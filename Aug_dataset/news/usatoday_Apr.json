        "body": "George Gray, the announcer on CBS' \"The Price Is Right\" actually told a cardiac surgeon to come on down Friday - to perform a quadruple bypass operation after he suffered multiple heart attacks days earlier.\n\nGray's wife, Brittney, told USA TODAY that he woke up Monday with what he thought was indigestion but it progressed to severe chest pain and weakness in his arms.\n\n\"If this isn't a heart attack, I don't know what it is,\" he told her.\n\nThe paramedics arrived a few minutes later to their place in Tucson, Arizona, where he's been staying during the production hiatus forced by the COVID-19 pandemic, \"and hooked him up to an EKG \"and then just looked at each other and went, 'Yep' \" she recalled.\n\n\"Are you allowed to tell me I'm having a heart attack?\" George asked.\n\n\"Yeah,\" they confirmed. \"It's a big one.\"\n\nDue to restrictions on visitors due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Brittney wasn't allowed to accompany him to the hospital's catheter lab, where they attempted to install a stent in his left anterior descending artery, which the largest of the three arteries supplying blood to the heart.\n\n\"It was 100% blocked,\" Brittney said, adding that a second artery was 60% blocked.\n\nMinutes later, the stent failed, filling with plaque after the doctor left the cath lab.\n\n\"He basically had a second heart attack right there,\" she said. \"The doctors were luckily able to rush back in and stent the stent.\"\n\nIn the recovery room, the doctors told George that he would need bypass surgery and an operation was scheduled for Friday.\n\n\"He recovered and he was getting stronger, but as he was being wheeled into the operating room, he started having a heart attack right on the operating table,\" Brittney recalled in an interview from outside his hospital room Saturday evening.\n\nAttempting to calm him, the anesthesiologist fibbed and said he was just giving George some oxygen. \"But they actually knocked him out and hurried to get him open,\" she said. \"And instead of just one bypass, they did a quadruple bypass.\"\n\nGray, who just turned 53 in March, was not an obvious candidate for a heart attack, either, she said. \"He has low cholesterol. He ran a mile the day before. No blood pressure problems, nothing. The doctor said this is most likely genetic. There are no signs beforehand - until the heart attack.\"\n\nHe is one of the 3% of U.S. men and 2% of U.S. women who have heart attacks between ages 40 and 59, according to the American Heart Association.\n\nShe added, \"His was very obvious but the fact is, it's not always obvious. He says that if you have symptoms or something genetic or you know of other factors, get checked.\"\n\nTwo of the heart attacks were \"widowmakers,\" referring to a severe blockage in the left anterior descending artery. A blockage as severe as Gray's starves the heart muscle of oxygen, triggering an abnormal heart rhythm, possibly leading to cardiac arrest, a situation where seconds mean the difference between survival and death, according to the University of Michigan's Frankel Cardiovascular Center website.\n\nHe's not the only entertainer to suffer a widowmaker in recent years: Comedian Kevin Smith had one in 2018 and \"The Biggest Loser\" fitness trainer Bob Harper suffered one while at the gym the previous year.\n\nBrittney said the circumstances surrounding George's heart attack actually could have been much worse.\n\n\"We were supposed to be in Thailand for our one-year wedding anniversary during this time. If COVID-19 didn't happen, we would have been on a plane back and he most likely would be dead. We jokingly - but not seriously - say that COVID-19 saved his life.\"\n\nContributing: Kim Painter, Special to USA TODAY\n\nThings are tough right now, and we want to help you get through it: Sign up for our Staying Apart, Together newsletter",

    "2 cats test positive for coronavirus in New York, a first for US pets": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "NEW YORK -- Two pet cats in New York state have tested positive for the coronavirus, marking the first confirmed cases in companion animals in the United States, federal officials said Wednesday.\n\nThe cats, which had mild respiratory illnesses and are expected to recover, are thought to have contracted the virus from people in their households or neighborhoods, the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said.\n\nThe finding, which comes after coronavirus cases in some tigers and lions at the Bronx Zoo, adds to a small number of confirmed cases of the virus in animals worldwide. U.S. authorities say that while it appears some animals can get the virus from people, there's no indication the animals are transmitting it to human beings.\n\n\"We don't want people to panic. We don't want people to be afraid of pets\" or to rush to test them en masse, said Dr. Casey Barton Behravesh, a CDC official who works on human-animal health connections. \"There's no evidence that pets are playing a role in spreading this disease to people.\"\n\nStill, the CDC is recommending that people prevent their pets from interacting with people or animals outside their homes -- by keeping cats indoors and dogs out of dog parks, for instance.\n\nPhotos: World struggles to stop spread of coronavirus\n\nWhat we know about coronavirus keeps changing: Here's all the things you may have missed.\n\nCoronavirus testing for pets isn't recommended unless an animal has been exposed to a person with COVID-19 and the animal has symptoms of the disease -- and tests have ruled out more common possible causes, said Dr. Jane Rooney of the USDA. Veterinarians who think testing is warranted are supposed to contact state officials to decide.\n\nBarton Behravesh said the animal tests are done at veterinary labs and use different chemicals than human tests, which have been in short supply during the crisis.\n\nFor most people, the coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as a fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks. For some, especially older adults and people, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia, and can be fatal.\n\nScientists are working to understand the potential for transmission to animals in homes, farms and elsewhere. So far, it doesn't appear that livestock or poultry are susceptible, Rooney said.\n\nThe two cats live in different parts of the state; the USDA and CDC wouldn't say where specifically.\n\nThe first cat fell ill about a week after a person in its household had a short respiratory illness, though the person's ailment wasn't confirmed to be COVID-19, Barton Behravesh said. The animal goes outdoors at times and might have come into contact with an infected person in the area, she said.\n\nThe second cat's owner tested positive for COVID-19 before the cat became sick, officials said. Another cat in the same home hasn't shown any signs of illness.\n\nThe agencies have recommended that any pet owners with COVID-19 avoid petting, snuggling or other contact with their animals as much as possible, including wearing a face covering while caring for them.\n\nThere have been a handful of reports outside the U.S. of pet dogs or cats becoming infected after close contact with contagious people, including a Hong Kong dog that tested positive for a low level of the pathogen in February and early March. Hong Kong agriculture authorities concluded that pet dogs and cats couldn't pass the virus to human beings but could test positive if exposed by their owners.\n\nA tiger at the Bronx Zoo had what was believed to be the first confirmed coronavirus case in an animal in the U.S. or a tiger anywhere. The 4-year-old Malayan tiger, named Nadia, was tested after starting to showing signs of illness on March 27, 11 days after the zoo closed to the public because of the virus.\n\nThree other tigers and three lions later showed symptoms. All have been recovering.\n\nZoo officials said they believe the animals were exposed by one or more keepers who had the virus but weren't showing symptoms at the time.",

    "24 products selling out online due to the coronavirus pandemic: Toilet paper, cleaning wipes, yeast, and more": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "-- Recommendations are independently chosen by Reviewed's editors. Purchases you make through our links may earn us a commission.\n\nAs the coronavirus pandemic continues to sweep the nation, many people are still quarantined at home -- and to cope, they're stocking up on everything from household essentials to things to stay entertained while social distancing. This has led to a shortage of products across the country, as supply struggles to keep up with demand.\n\nTo help consumers through this time, the team at Reviewed has been hard at work providing recommendations for the products people are searching for right now, along with the places you can still buy them (you can read about our strategy here). While doing our due diligence, we've seen a variety of products go out of stock, and we have compiled a list of the biggest ones below.\n\nHere's everything Reviewed has been covering that's quickly selling out, from toilet paper to puzzles to webcams. We'll continue to monitor the status of the products below but we could also use your help as we're all navigating these uncharted waters together. If there's something you've noticed in low supply in your own area or during your online shopping sprees, let us know by emailing request@reviewed.com.\n\nHousehold essentials\n\nToilet paper is at the top of everyone's must-have list right now. And it makes sense -- no one wants to run out of the one thing you use multiple times every single day. While the shelves at your local grocery store or Target might be completely bare, fear not -- for weeks, Reviewed has been tracking the dwindling supply of toilet paper to keep this list of places to buy toilet paper online updated.\n\nHere's where you can still buy toilet paper online\n\nIt's no secret that there's been a run on hand sanitizer -- but while it may be hard to find, it isn't impossible. Our Reviewed editors found you can still buy hand sanitizer and sanitizing wipes at certain retailers online to be shipped to your house or picked up curbside at the store. FYI: The CDC says that hand sanitizers with at least 60 percent alcohol are the most effective at killing germs.\n\nHere's where you can still buy hand sanitizer online\n\nJust as important as keeping your hands clean is keeping your home clean. That's why disinfecting wipes and spray -- which are on the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) approved list of disinfectants -- are just as tough to find as hand sanitizer. If you're able to find some at the retailers provided by Reviewed, make sure you're using your cleaning wipes correctly. The CDC says to use enough wipes that your surface remains saturated for 3 to 5 minutes.\n\nHere's where you can still buy cleaning wipes and spray online\n\nToilet paper isn't the only paper product that's hard to come by these days -- paper towels are also selling out at many stores. That's likely because the CDC recommends using paper towels to clean and disinfect your home to protect against coronavirus. In the rare event that you can pick and choose which brand of paper towels you buy, our Reviewed testers recommend the Bounty Select-A-Size 2-Ply. When tested, we found them to be the strongest and thickest.\n\nHere's where you can still buy paper towels online\n\nAccording to the CDC, the best way to prevent the spread of germs -- and more specifically, coronavirus -- is to wash your hands regularly. And for that, you'll need hand soap, which is sold out at a lot of stores. Fortunately, our team has discovered you can still find it at retailers like Target and Staples online. But if you run out, Reviewed's senior lab testing technician says you can actually use a mild dish soap to cleanse your hands, too. Game-changer.\n\nHere's where you can still buy hand soap online\n\nNew parents and caretakers alike are stocking up on diapers -- which means they're becoming harder and harder to find in stores. That's where Reviewed's product-tracking prowess comes in handy. We've found all the places you can still buy diapers online in a variety of counts and sizes (just keep in mind that many of these retailers are limiting you to two to three packs per order!).\n\nHere's where you can still buy diapers online\n\nWith one of the most common symptoms of COVID-19 being a fever, thermometers have become a popular purchase. Because of this, we've kept a close eye on the increasingly limited supply of digital thermometers -- and while there are a few places online where you can still buy thermometers, be aware that many of those won't ship until the end of the month.\n\nHere's where you can still buy thermometers online\n\nWhen you're sick, the first thing you reach for is likely a box of tissues. After all, the CDC recommends that you always use a tissue to cover your mouth whenever you cough or sneeze. And while you might not necessarily be able to find Reviewed's favorite tissues (Puffs Ultra Soft, in case you were wondering), you can still find other tissues at a few online retailers.\n\nHere's where you can still buy tissues online\n\nBottled water is a rare find at the grocery store at the moment, which is why so many people are turning to water filters and pitchers instead. If you're on the hunt for said pitchers before they sell out, our Reviewed testers recommend either the Brita or Pur brand, which we found to be the best water filter pitchers that you can buy right now.\n\nHere's where you can still buy water pitchers online\n\nOne alternative to toilet paper that's becoming more and more popular? A bidet. According to Slickdeals, searches for bidets have been up 304 percent over the last month. And here at Reviewed, we're big fans of the Tushy, a bidet that attaches directly to your toilet and that our tester says cleans your bum better than any amount of toilet paper.\n\nWhether you're staying home by yourself, with family, or with roommates, we're all looking for ways to stay entertained. And that means that a lot of common products for beating boredom -- like the ones below -- are in limited supply at online retailers.\n\nIf you're lucky enough to be quarantined with family or roommates, playing board games is a fun way to pass the time. Whether you're up for a rousing round of Code Names or down for a Monopoly marathon, games are flying off the shelves. While my family loves both of the above, one of our new favorites is Exploding Kittens -- it's as hilarious as the name suggests! And if you have young kids, the Reviewed Parenting team has rounded up some of the best -- and most entertaining -- board games for the whole family.\n\nHere's where you can still buy board games online\n\nAs people are desperate for new ways to stay entertained while social distancing, jigsaw puzzles have made quite the comeback. In fact, according to puzzle manufacturer Ravenberger, sales are up a whopping 370% (!!). Many of our Reviewed staff (myself included) have jumped on the puzzle-making bandwagon, too -- I will even unashamedly admit that after finishing the sole puzzle I own last night, I took it apart just to start it all over this morning.\n\nHere's where you can still buy puzzles online\n\nOne of the most popular things to do while #stayinghome? Playing video games. More specifically, playing video games on your Nintendo Switch, which was one of Reviewed's top tech gifts of the last year. The cult-favorite video game console is almost impossible to find right now -- but you can still snag one (or the Switch Lite) at one of these retailers.\n\nHere's where you can still buy Nintendo Switch and Switch Lite online\n\nIf you've been on social media at all during quarantine, you've likely been flooded with pictures of homemade banana bread, sourdough starters, cinnamon rolls, and extravagant cakes. I.e. it seems that everyone is baking in their newfound free time. So it makes sense that baking products like muffin tins, loaf pans, and baking sheets are selling out everywhere. If you're ready to play Top Chef, Reviewed's kitchen and cooking writer, Valerie Li, has shared her favorite kitchen tools you need to make baking easier while you're at home -- and where you can find them.\n\nAll that baking you're doing requires more than just the right pans -- many recipes require yeast. The bread-making ingredient is out of stock at most grocery stores right now but you can still find it at a few select retailers, according to Reviewed. And if you can't? Try your hand at one of these no-yeast-required recipes.\n\nHere's where you can still buy yeast online\n\nNo gym, no problem -- as long as you have a few home workout essentials, whether that's dumbbells, resistance bands, kettlebells, or maybe even a yoga mat. But even if you don't have any of the above, you can still get in a good sweat sesh. Just ask our social media manager (and resident exercise guru) who rounded up some of the most creative ways to work out with everyday household products (including using wine bottles as weights!).\n\nSewing machines are a hot commodity right now for two major reasons: first, because people are taking up sewing as one of their quarantine hobbies and second, because people are using them to make their own masks. If you're buying one for the second reason, our Reviewed staff can help -- we've found all the places where you can buy materials for homemade face masks and how to make the masks yourself.\n\n18. Hair dye\n\nWith salons closed, people are turning to at-home hair dye to fix their hair themselves (desperate times!). And subsequently hair dye is now running low at many retailers, with Nielsen research showing that hair color sales are up almost 25 percent compared to last year. If you aren't ready to take the plunge, though, we asked a pro stylist for tips on how to make your hair color last longer (all approved by Reviewed's own shopping editor, who previously had pink hair).\n\nNow that there's nowhere to go (and consequently no reason to get dressed up), loungewear has become more just our everyday attire -- it's also a top-selling product. Matching sets in particular are on everyone's wishlist. Some of our editors' favorite loungewear brands include Aerie, Summersalt, Brooklinen, and the cult-favorite Barefoot Dreams.\n\nJust like many of you, all of us at Reviewed have now found ourselves transitioned from working at the office to working from home. And more WFH-ers means more demand for home office and tech essentials. Below are some of the top sought-after ones, from laptops to webcams.\n\n20. Printers\n\nWhether you have kids who need to print out their math worksheets or you have important documents that need to be signed/scanned/copied, a printer is a must-have. Of all the ones we've tested, we like the Epson WorkForce Pro as the best overall (because of its great image quality and ease of use) or the Brother MFC-J680DW as the best value. Psst: Don't forget to stock up on printer paper, too.\n\nShop for printers at Staples\n\nTrying to do all of your work on a tiny laptop screen is a struggle at best and impossible at worst. That's why so many people have been buying up monitors, which are tough to find now. If you have your choice of screens, we've ranked the best computer monitors based on factors like image quality, flexibility, and affordability.\n\nShop for monitors at Best Buy\n\nMaybe your old laptop isn't going to cut it for full-time WFH life. Or your kids are now doing remote learning and need their own devices. No matter what your situation, a high-quality (and affordable) laptop is important -- which is why so many people are buying them right now. To help you choose, we've reviewed the best laptops under $500 (hint: number one is the Acer Aspire) and the best laptops for students (your kids will love the Asus Chromebook Flip!).\n\nShop for laptops at Best Buy\n\nApparently I'm not the only one guilty of splurging on a brand-new desk during quarantine -- Slickdeals data revealed that searches for desks are up 87 percent while searches for office chairs are up 65 percent as people scramble to set up home offices for their new work-from-home status. If you don't want to spend a lot of money (which we totally understand), we've scoured the Internet for the best office chairs and the best desks that are all under $100. You're welcome.\n\nShop for office furniture at Wayfair\n\nIf you feel like half of your day is spent in Zoom meetings, you aren't alone -- most people (including all of us here at Reviewed!) are turning to video conferencing for all their WFH needs. That spike in Zoom meetings is not only forcing you to actually get dressed in the morning but it's also causing webcams to sell out everywhere. If you need on still, we recommend frequently checking office supplies retailers like Staples or Office Depot -- products come back in stock constantly so just because something is sold out today doesn't mean it won't be available tomorrow.\n\nShop for webcams at Best Buy\n\nThe product experts at Reviewed have all your shopping needs covered.

        "authors": [],
        "body": "The McLeans discovered Friday that their pug, Winston, tested positive for COVID-19. He didn't display any severe symptoms before they found out, said McLean's 17-year-old daughter, Sydney.\n\nTwo things did stand out to the family, though: \"My dad heard him cough a lot,\" she said. \"He didn't eat his breakfast one morning and it's weird because he's a pug, but who knows?\"\n\nHeather and her husband, Sam, who works as a researcher and emergency physician at UNC-Chapel Hill, started developing mild symptoms in mid-March. She attributed her own symptoms -- scratchy throat and mild headache among them -- to allergies, but they worsened for a bit.\n\n\"We didn't do a good job of distancing ourselves,\" she told USA TODAY. \"We're having college and high school in our house too, and we realized our son also had mild symptoms. Our daughter didn't have any symptoms.\"\n\nThe family eventually recovered and enrolled in a study led by Dr. Chris Woods, a virologist and one of Heather's colleagues at Duke.\n\nEvery week since the beginning of April, a team of researchers has come to their house to perform blood tests and nasal swabs for the family.\n\n\"On the first day,\" Heather explained, \"they nasal swabbed all the pets -- the two dogs and the cat.\"\n\nWoods told NBC News that Winston may be the first dog nationwide to have a confirmed case of the virus. Fortunately, the other two creatures tested negative.\n\nWinston has since fully recovered and \"has been acting like himself.\"\n\n\"He's a very sweet animal; we're very lucky to have him quarantined with us,\" said Heather.\n\nShe hopes that her family's bout of coronavirus has a small silver lining -- both in learning how coronavirus manifests in pets, and in contributing to further research on how coronavirus can be treated in humans.\n\nAnd for anyone concerned about their pets contracting coronavirus, both Sydney and Heather advise not worrying too much about them.\n\n\"We're not seeing an epidemic of household pets or them transmitting it to other humans and animals -- we just happened to detect it in our dog,\" Heather said..\n\n\"Try not to worry too much about your pets,\" Sydney added. \"There's too much to worry about.\"\n\nMultiple veterinary experts, including representatives from the American Veterinary Medical Association, have previously said that there is no evidence yet that the coronavirus can spread from an infected pet to a human.",

        "body": "Montgomery: The first Alabama prisoner has died after testing positive for the new coronavirus, the state Department of Corrections reported Friday as it confirmed two other COVID-19 cases among inmates. Dave Thomas, 66, whom the prison system described as already terminally ill, died Thursday at a hospital within 24 hours of testing positive for COVID-19, the department said. Thomas, who had been housed at St. Clair Correctional Facility in Springville, had been hospitalized since April 4 to receive critical care related to his preexisting conditions. Another inmate at St. Clair and an inmate at Bullock County Correctional Facility have also tested positive for COVID-19. The state said it has quarantined a group of inmates out of one dormitory at St. Clair and quarantined an entire dormitory at Bullock.\n\nJuneau: Gov. Mike Dunleavy said the state will chart its own course in deciding how to reopen parts of the economy restricted or shut down because of concerns about the coronavirus. \"We'll continue to look at this through the lens of Alaska and what Alaska needs,\" the Republican said late Thursday, noting unique aspects of the state, including isolated communities that lack the health care infrastructure of other places. Dunleavy said the state continues to build up its testing capacity, and its chief medical officer, Dr. Anne Zink, has said that testing - and testing broadly - will be important as the state weighs easing restrictions. State officials have announced plans to lift in phases restrictions on health care activities, a process that includes calls for testing ahead of certain procedures and testing to the extent possible of patients admitted to facilities such as hospitals and long-term care centers.\n\nTucson: The University of Arizona is implementing furloughs and pay cuts for most of its employees as a result of economic strains brought on by the coronavirus outbreak. The university posted details about the furloughs on its website, saying the changes will begin May 11 and remain in effect until June 30, 2021. The amount of furlough days will be based on an employee's annual salary. For example, those who make less than $44,450 a year can expect 13 furlough days, while those who make more will have to take off without pay between 26 and 39 days. Employees who make more than $150,000 will see pay cuts ranging from 17% to 20%. The university, which projects it could lose $250 million as a result of the pandemic, is one of southern Arizona's largest employers.\n\nLittle Rock: Gov. Asa Hutchinson has announced the creation of a task force to help the state recover economically from restrictions that were put in place to help stop the spread of the coronavirus. The task force will be led by Steuart Walton, the grandson of Walmart founder Sam Walton. Walmart is based in Bentonville, Arkansas. The group will focus on helping small businesses because \"that's where we want to be able to get back to work,\" Hutchinson said at a news conference Saturday. During the pandemic, the governor did not issue a statewide stay-at-home order but imposed other restrictions that closed businesses such as gyms and casinos. He also prohibited sit-down service at restaurants and bars. On Friday, Hutchinson said he hoped to lift some restrictions imposed on businesses during the pandemic if Arkansas meets certain criteria. The task force will hold its first meeting this week.\n\nSan Francisco: Fears of getting infected with the coronavirus have prompted authorities in Northern California to allow some sexual assault victims to collect evidence with a nurse directing them in the hours\u00adlong process through a video call. The temporary measure put in place in Monterey County after shelter-in-place orders were issued last month to stop the spread of the virus raises issues of evidence contamination and other problems that would be challenged in court, defense attorneys said. Monterey County Deputy District Attorney Lana Nassoura said the temporary measure doesn't apply to victims of sexual assault who are children or who have been injured and is allowed when the victim is comfortable and able to conduct the forensic examination on themselves. She said the measure also aims to protect the nurses who lack the proper equipment to protect them from exposure to the virus.\n\nColorado Springs: Democratic Gov. Jared Polis has announced the Colorado National Guard will be sent into three of the state's largest nursing homes to conduct coronavirus testing. The state Department of Health and Environment identified COVID-19 outbreaks at 100 different facilities across the state, including 10 in Colorado Springs where 13 residents have died from complications due to the new virus and another five are suspected, The Gazette reports. More than 520 patients have tested positive at nonhospital health care facilities, and at least 138 patients have died, department officials said last week. Colorado began visitation restrictions and started implementing screenings into senior facilities last month. \"I think the toll would be far worse had that not been put in place,\" Polis said. \"The protocols that we're putting in place are really about providing additional education and training to staff to keep the facility safe.\"\n\nBridgeport: A lawyer said Saturday that he is suing Gov. Ned Lamont over his executive order requiring people to wear face coverings in public places \"wherever close contact is unavoidable\" to help curb the spread of the coronavirus. Stamford attorney Lindy Urso said he filed a lawsuit in federal court saying the order announced by Lamont on Friday is unconstitutional because it infringes on people's \"individual freedoms and liberties.\" Urso claims the number of deaths in the U.S. linked to COVID-19 is \"artificially inflated\" and accuses government officials and the media of stirring up fear about the virus. A spokesman for the Democratic governor declined to comment Saturday. Lamont's order on face coverings takes effect at 8 p.m. Tuesday.\n\nDover: State authorities say the death of a 73-year-old inmate is the first they've seen from complications of the coronavirus. Joseph Russo died Thursday at Bayhealth Hospital's Kent campus. Initially, though, authorities were unsure if his death was attributable to the coronavirus because two previous tests had come back negative. The state Department of Corrections said Friday that a third test showed Russo was indeed infected with the virus. Russo was an inmate at the James T. Vaughn Correctional Center in Smyrna, the state's largest prison. He was at the prison until Monday, when he was transferred to the hospital. Russo was part of a minimum-security housing unit of 45 inmates that has been closely monitored by security and medical staff since April 8. State figures show 20 inmates and roughly 20 staffers at Delaware prisons have tested positive for the coronavirus so far.\n\nWashington: Mayor Muriel Bowser and education officials say distance learning will continue throughout the 2019-2020 school year in response to the coronavirus crisis, WUSA-TV reports. The D.C. Public Schools and public charter schools academic year will end early May 29. Bowser has extended the district's stay-at-home order and public health emergency until May 15 to aid in flattening the curve and to save lives from the coronavirus. The extension applies to distance learning for D.C. schools, telework for D.C.'s nonessential employees and the stay-at-home order. Nonessential businesses are to remain closed until May 15. Bowser also gave additional guidance for wearing masks in the district, saying face coverings are required in grocery stores, hotels, taxis, ride-shares and other private transportation, and they're strongly encouraged for workers and riders of public transit.\n\nTallahassee: A man encased himself in concrete Friday outside the Governor's Mansion in the state capital, apparently to protest prison conditions related to the coronavirus. Tallahassee police spokesman Kevin Bradshaw said the man, identified as 28-year-old Jordan Mazurek, put PVC pipes horizontally into two 55-gallon plastic drums filled with concrete, with some sort of mechanism that locked his arms in place. Mazurek was first spotted about 6 a.m. outside the fence surrounding the mansion and was eventually freed about 10:30 a.m. One of Mazurek's drums was painted in white letters with the words \"Stop the massacre.\" The other read, \"Free prisoners now.\" The man also wore what appeared to be a surgical mask. Mazurek is a sociologist originally from Forth Worth, Texas, who now lives in Florida and is a co-creator of a group called Campaign to Fight Toxic Prisons. Mei Azaad, a spokeswoman for the group, said it did not organize the protest but was aware of it.\n\nAlbany: A brewery in one of the communities most affected by the coronavirus is thanking police with donations of home-brewed hand sanitizer. The Pretoria Fields Collective donated 200 bottles of the alcohol-based sanitizer to the Albany Police Department, the Dougherty County Police Department and the Dougherty County Sheriff's Office, WALB-TV reports. The county of roughly 90,000 residents has seen rates of infection from the new virus that far exceed those in Georgia's more densely populated communities such as metro Atlanta. Pretoria Fields typically brews craft beer but pivoted to producing hand sanitizer to help offset shortages during the pandemic. \"We wanted to do something to show the law enforcement our appreciation for putting their lives on the line,\" Pretoria Field manager Tony Singletary said.\n\nHonolulu: Gov. David Ige on Friday ordered a moratorium on evictions of people from their homes for failure to pay rent as the negative economic effects of the fight against the coronavirus deepen. Evictions in Hawaii have effectively been on hold since mid-March because the state judiciary had curtailed court proceedings to limit the virus's spread. But Ige said he believed the prohibition needed to be more explicit. \"It strengthens the intent and ensures that evictions cannot occur and that those trying to evict someone would be subject to a fine or a penalty,\" Ige said at a news conference. The social distancing requirements instituted to slow the virus have closed hotels, restaurants and retail stores across Hawaii. The state has received more than 240,000 unemployment benefit claims since March 1, which amounts to more than one-third of Hawaii's labor force.\n\nBoise: More than 1,000 protesters gathered at the Statehouse on Friday afternoon in defiance of Gov. Brad Little's extension of the statewide stay-at-home order. Little announced Wednesday that the order would extend to the end of April in the effort to slow the spread of coronavirus, although he lightened some restrictions so nonessential businesses could begin providing curbside service. Still, the news was met with derision by some members of the far-right in Idaho, and some libertarian, gun-rights and anti-vaccine organizations began directing members to defy the order. The Idaho Freedom Foundation, a libertarian think tank and lobbying group, emblazoned its social media feeds with \"Disobey Idaho\" graphics and announced it would host Friday's rally along with Health Freedom Idaho and the Idaho Second Amendment Alliance.\n\nChicago: The University of Illinois has allowed medical students to graduate early as the pressing need for health care workers has increased amid the coronavirus outbreak. Graduates could start their residency programs early, the Chicago Tribune reports. \"When we saw the way the pandemic was affecting the nation, we asked how we could provide physicians to the workforce as quickly as possible,\" said Dr. Mark Rosenblatt, executive dean of the college. \"And when you look at the type of students we have and why they went to med school in the first place, it's to help people.\" Earlier this month, Shivam Vedak marked his early graduation from the College of Medicine on a Zoom call. He and a cohort of the 191 graduates pledged to dedicate their lives to the service of humanity. \"I've never felt so validated in my decision to become a physician,\" Vedak said.\n\nEvansville: A southwestern Indiana hospital is fitting newborns with tiny plastic face shields to protect them from the coronavirus. Berry Global, the Evansville-based plastic packaging company, delivered a working prototype to Deaconess Women's Hospital on Tuesday. The next day the hospital began using the shields. Officials expect to have about 100 on hand. \"I can't believe how fast they picked up on the idea and had something for us to try,\" hospital CEO Chris Ryan said. She said officials are doing anything possible to shield babies from exposure to the virus, given that newborns are susceptible to airborne germs when they travel around the hospital in an open bassinet for routine postnatal procedures. \"We'd rather err on the side of being more cautious than not,\" she said. Berry has also adapted the shield design to fit toddlers and younger children.\n\nDes Moines: State officials will not call schools back into session this year, Gov. Kim Reynolds said Friday. The state has not reached its peak of positive coronavirus cases yet, and data doesn't indicate it's safe to reopen schools, Reynolds said. \"I regret to say that Iowa schools will not reopen for this school year. But school districts will be required to continue to provide continuous learning opportunities for their students until the end of the regular school year,\" she said. \"Believe me, I would like nothing more than to stand before you today and announce that Iowa will be open for school in May.\" Most school districts would have held classes through late May, and some end their year in early June. The announcement also cancels spring sports activities. State education officials say they will release information June 1 about whether school-sponsored activities, including summer sports, can resume.\n\nTopeka: The state plans to start using 3D printers to manufacture its own swabs to test for the novel coronavirus as officials look to improve the state's near-bottom national rank in testing before lifting a stay-at-home order. Gov. Laura Kelly and her top public health administrator, Dr. Lee Norman, have complained for weeks that Kansas isn't a priority for testing supplies and personal protective equipment from the federal government or even private vendors, making it difficult to get them. The state's struggles have continued with the Democratic governor under increasing pressure from the Republican-controlled Legislature to lift restrictions hindering economic activity, with her stay-at-home order set to remain in place until May 3. But Kelly said Friday that testing people both with and without symptoms is key. Kansas as of Friday had reported testing about 5.8 of every 1,000 residents, the second-lowest rate among all states, just behind Virginia.\n\nLouisville: A federal judge has denied Maryville Baptist Church's motion for a restraining order blocking enforcement of Gov. Andy Beshear's order barring faith-based mass gatherings. The church filed a lawsuit Friday saying that enforcement of the order discriminates against its rights under the First Amendment and the Kentucky Religious Freedom Restoration Act by prohibiting \"mass gatherings\" that are \"faith-based.\" But U.S. District Judge David Hale said Beshear's order to prevent the spread of COVID-19 bans all mass gatherings - \"i.e., any event or convening that brings together groups of individuals, including civic, public, leisure, faith-based, or sporting events as well as concerts, festivals and conventions.\" For that reason, Hale said it doesn't discriminate against religion. In a seven-page opinion, he also noted that other forms of group worship are permitted, such as drive-in, online, video or telephone conferencing and radio and TV broadcasts.\n\nNew Orleans: The state is working to make more clinic and hospital space available again for elective surgeries and other nonemergency medical care before May 1, Gov. John Bel Edwards said Friday. Elective surgeries and other procedures were largely put on hold as state hospitals converted space and clinic personnel were diverted to other jobs as Louisiana ramped up to deal with the COVID-19 outbreak. The state has the third-highest rate of cases in the country, Edwards said. But the number of those requiring hospitalization and ventilators has declined in recent days, raising hopes that an easing of economically devastating stay-at-home orders and business shutdowns may soon be in sight. Edwards said details on the return of more nonemergency services would be released this week.\n\nNortheast Harbor: It wasn't the destination wedding they'd planned, but a couple found a way to tie the knot in the middle of a pandemic. Bradley Gray and Teresa Norwood Gray got hitched Thursday at a drive-thru window at a local bank in their hometown. \"I threw it out there kind of as a joke at first. Then the more we talked about it, we're like, oh, maybe that'll work,\" Bradley Gray said. The officiant was inside the bank, behind the glass at the teller window. The happy couple stood outside, where they exchanged their vows. Guests in the parking lot practiced social distancing. Teresa Norwood Gray's son walked her down the \"aisle.\" Local teens provided the music. Passing motorists stopped to watch. \"Everyone needs a little lifting up right now. So the community really came together,\" she said. \"It gave them something to smile about.\" The novel coronavirus also ruined their honeymoon, as they were supposed to be departing Saturday on a cruise to the Caribbean, but the happy couple is making the best of it, heading to the groom's cabin in Maine. \"It's not quite as warm as the Caribbean, but we'll make it work,\" Bradley Gray said.\n\nBaltimore: The NAACP in the city has started circulating a sound truck blasting requests to \"stay at home\" during the coronavirus pandemic. The truck, which features messages from local celebrities, politicians and athletes, has started driving around areas where residents have continued to gather despite Gov. Larry Hogan's stay-at-home order, The Baltimore Sun reports. The messages tell people to remain in their homes when possible, practice social distancing guidelines, wash their hands frequently and wear masks. Spokesman Joshua Harris said the 40-foot sound truck made its first rounds Wednesday and will target low-income and \"hard-to-reach\" areas of the city for 6 to 8 hours a day in the upcoming weeks. Baltimore Health Commissioner Letitia Dzirasa said there has also been prevalent misinformation that the virus does not affect African Americans, who make up 60% of the city's population and have in fact been hit especially hard by the pandemic.\n\nChelsea: Physicians with Massachusetts General Hospital said they've found widespread evidence of exposure to the new coronavirus in this small Boston-area city. Nearly a third of 200 Chelsea residents who gave a drop of blood to researchers last week tested positive for antibodies linked to the virus, the Boston Globe reports. The participants seemed to be healthy, but half told doctors they experienced at least one symptom in the past four weeks. Massachusetts has been hit hard by the virus. More than 1,500 people have died, and a total of 36,372 people have tested positive for the virus. The state hit a new high for deaths in a single day on Friday with 159. Dr. John Iafrate, vice chairman of MGH's pathology department and the study's principal investigator, told the Globe that Chelsea is in the midst of a \"raging epidemic\" but is also probably further along in the outbreak than other communities.\n\nDetroit: A prisoner who declined to be paroled earlier this year after decades behind bars has died from COVID-19 complications, officials said. William Garrison is one of at least 17 Michigan prisoners who have died from COVID-19, a respiratory disease caused by the coronavirus, the Corrections Department said. Garrison, 60, could have left prison on parole weeks ago. But he decided to wait until September, when he would be eligible for a complete release without the rigors of parole supervision. After nearly 44 years in prison, \"he was trying to get free,\" said sister Yolanda Peterson. Garrison, however, changed his stance during the coronavirus outbreak, which has infected more than 500 inmates in Michigan prisons. The parole board approved his application in March. Garrison died Monday while waiting to see if prosecutors would challenge it, a standard step that can take weeks.\n\nWayzata: About three dozen residents have been moved from a Minneapolis-area senior living facility after an outbreak of the coronavirus made many staff members too sick to care for residents. The Minnesota Department of Health told the Star Tribune the decision to relocate residents from Meridian Manor in Wayzata on Saturday came in consultation with state and local officials. The department said a majority of staff members and administrators at the 50-bed facility became sick and were unable to care for residents. Five residents were sent to a hospital, some residents were relocated with family, and others were being moved to a nearby long-term care facility. In a statement, Meridian Manor said residents began testing positive for the coronavirus at the hospital April 7. As of Saturday, 18 of 55 had tested positive. On Friday, one resident died because of complications with COVID-19, the facility said.\n\nJackson: The state is reporting a dozen more deaths from COVID-19 as its total cases approach 4,000. The state Department of Health reported the new numbers Saturday, bringing the total number of deaths in Mississippi to 152. Gov. Tate Reeves said Friday that he is extending his statewide stay-at-home order by one week to try to slow the spread of the coronavirus. The order has been in place since the evening of April 3, and it originally was set to expire Monday morning. The extension expires April 27. Reeves said Mississippi is in the \"worst, hardest\" part of the curve of virus cases. \"I know we cannot stay in this position for much longer, but we are still in the eye of the storm,\" Reeves said. He said he will allow lakes and beaches to open starting Monday, but people will not be allowed to go in large groups.\n\nO'Fallon: A lawsuit filed by civil rights groups Friday seeks to allow all Missourians to vote absentee in upcoming elections to help reduce the risk of catching or spreading the coronavirus. The lawsuit was filed in Jefferson City by the American Civil Liberties Union of Missouri and the Missouri Voter Protection Coalition on behalf of the NAACP, the League of Women Voters and several residents. It claims that requiring voters to appear at traditional polling places during the pandemic puts lives at risk. \"No one should be forced to choose between staying safe and voting,\" Sophia Lin Lakin, deputy director of the ACLU's Voting Rights Project, said in a statement. Missouri law allows absentee voting, but only for people with certain reasons, such as illness or travel away from home on the day of the election. Municipal elections will be June 2, Missouri's primary election is Aug. 4, and the general election is Nov. 3.\n\nHelena: Gov. Steve Bullock said Friday that he plans to begin a phased reopening of the state's economy after April 24, when the current stay-at-home directives expire, but he didn't provide specifics about what that means. Details about plans to begin easing restrictions that have been in place for several weeks will be announced by the middle of this week, Bullock said. The governor said he's been working with business leaders and public health experts to determine how the state's economy could be reopened while keeping people safe and avoiding another outbreak of coronavirus. Because Montanans took the stay-at-home and social distancing directives so seriously, the state is in a position to begin reopening its economy \"in a time when a whole lot of states still won't be able to,\" Bullock said. But \"even as we reopen facets or remove some of these directives, there will be expectations of things like social distancing and masks.\"\n\nLincoln: Local farmers markets likely will focus on solo shoppers and not be their traditional family affair when they open this spring, a health department official said. Recommendations from the Lincoln-Lancaster County Health Department to allow operation of these markets include more hand-washing stations, increased space between vendor booths, a ban on free samples and stricter money-handling guidelines, among others. \"I know it totally changes the tenor of the thing,\" said Scott Holmes, environmental public health director for the Lincoln-Lancaster County Health Department. But the department wants to allow these key access points for healthy food to be open while also reducing the transmission risk of the coronavirus in Lincoln, he told the Lincoln Journal Star. Health officials plan to soon review the recommendations with market managers, who remain uncertain when they'll be able to convene their vendors for the start of the seasonal attractions.\n\nCarson City: Hundreds of people protested at the State Capitol on Saturday, demanding that Democratic Gov. Steve Sisolak reopen the state's economy and lift a stay-at-home order that he imposed to stop the spread of the coronavirus outbreak. News media video showed protesters parading on a sidewalk carrying U.S. flags and signs displaying messages such as \"Open Nevada\" and \"Stop the Tyranny.\" Meanwhile, others in cars honked the vehicle's horns. In other coronavirus developments, the Clark County School District has announced graduation will be postponed for the class of 2020. The southern Nevada school district made the announcement Friday in a districtwide email sent to families stating that each school will develop its own celebration plans following federal and state health guidelines and restrictions.\n\nConcord: A few hundred demonstrators cheered and waved signs outside the New Hampshire State House on Saturday during a call to reopen the state. Members of the crowd carried signs with slogans such as \"Live Free or Die,\" the state's motto. Others included \"Restore Jobs\" and \"Kiss My Constitution.\" One demonstrator, talk show host Ian Freeman, said that the government was guilty of fear-mongering over the state of the virus and that it was time to restore individual rights. \"Even if the virus were 10 times as dangerous as it is, I still wouldn't stay inside my home. I'd rather take the risk and be a free person,\" he said. Meanwhile, the ACLU of New Hampshire and national ACLU said they have filed a class-action lawsuit in federal court seeking the release of all Immigration and Customs Enforcement civil detainees from Strafford County Department of Corrections in Dover. The ACLU said it's impossible to maintain safe social distance at the facility.\n\nTrenton: The state says more than 4,000 people have died during the coronavirus outbreak, but the governor is reporting signs of progress. Gov. Phil Murphy announced Saturday another 231 deaths among those who have tested positive for the coronavirus, bringing the statewide total to 4,070. Another 3,026 cases were announced, bringing the statewide total to 81,420, he said. \"We are flattening the curve,\" Murphy said, presenting charts showing the rate of growth of new cases over the previous 21 days as well as daily rates of new hospitalizations since the beginning of the month. \"The slower the rate of new cases, the slower the rate of infections, the slower the rate of new hospitalizations, ICU beds required, ventilators required and, please, God, fatalities that result,\" Murphy said. \"We're now reporting more people leaving the hospital than entering - please, God, it stays that way.\"\n\nAlbuquerque: Nearly 40 of the city's police officers have been placed on quarantine after being exposed to a law enforcement officer who recently tested positive for the coronavirus, according to the department. Police said two civilian workers with the department also were exposed. Police officials said the 39 officers experienced different levels of exposure to the infected officer over the course of several days, including during a multi-agency operation. The officers who may have been exposed to the virus were tested and placed into quarantine. Police spokesman Gilbert Gallegos told KOB-TV that officials still are waiting for the test results. Mayor Tim Keller announced a new three-tiered system last week to help protect police officers from the coronavirus. In addition to current protocols, area commanders were directed to spend time over the weekend ensuring their officers are wearing masks during encounters with the public.\n\nNew York: The coronavirus death toll in the state has dropped again, a sign Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Sunday means that New York is \"on the other side of the plateau\" and that ongoing social distancing practices are working to stem the spread of the virus. Cuomo said 507 people died Saturday, down 43 from the previous day. Hospitalizations and other medical indicators are trending downward. But Cuomo and Mayor Bill de Blasio maintained their warnings that people in New York City and the rest of the state need to stay vigilant to curb the spread of the virus. \"We showed that we can control the beast, and when you close down, you can actually slow that infection rate, but this is only halftime,\" Cuomo said Sunday. We still have to make sure that we keep that beast under control, we keep that infection rate down, we keep that hospitalization rate down as we all get very eager to get on with life and move on.\"\n\nGoldsboro: A COVID-19 outbreak at a state prison has spread to more than 250 inmates, prison officials said Friday. State prisons Commissioner Todd Ishee said during a media briefing that 259 inmates had tested positive as of Friday afternoon at Neuse Correctional Institution, a state prison in Goldsboro. He said none required hospitalization, and 98% of those testing positive were asymptomatic. All 700 inmates have been tested, but some test results are pending. Ishee said no coronavirus-related deaths had been reported at any of the state's prisons. \"The outbreak at Neuse CI is no doubt a cause for concern but not for panic. We have medical protocols in place to handle this,\" Ishee said in an earlier statement. Inmates testing positive are being separated from others, and the state is sending additional medical and security staff to the facility.\n\nBismarck: The number of confirmed cases of the coronavirus in the state has risen to 585, with the biggest jump coming in northeastern North Dakota, where a wind turbine plant has been temporarily idled during an outbreak of COVID-19. The North Dakota Department of Health on Sunday reported 34 new cases in Grand Forks County, where the LM Wind Power facility is based in Grand Forks. Health officials did not report how many of the new cases are connected to the plant, where 110 cases were reported in early testing. Statewide, the number of new cases rose by 57, with Cass County second with 15 new cases. North Dakota also reported one new death, a woman in her 70s from Cass County with underlying medical conditions, bringing the state's total to 10. Fifty-one people have been hospitalized, up four from Saturday. The state has tested 13,630 people since the first test was confirmed in early March.\n\nColumbus: The governor is calling on the federal government to help provide crucial materials that would allow a dramatic increase in testing for coronavirus in his state. Gov. Mike DeWine said Sunday on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" that Ohio hospitals doing the testing lack needed chemicals known as reagents, and help from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration is needed. \"I could probably double, maybe even triple testing in Ohio virtually overnight,\" said DeWine, who called on the FDA to \"prioritize companies that are putting a slightly different formula together for the extraction reagent kit.\" In a more direct appeal, he said: \"Anybody in the FDA is watching, this would really take our capacity up literally ... overnight.\" DeWine, a Republican, referred to his having sought help several weeks ago with an issue involving sterilization of masks, and he said President Donald Trump \"got that done.\"\n\nOklahoma City: If the number of people hospitalized for COVID-19 in the state continues to trend downward, some businesses could begin to open back up as early as May 1, Gov. Kevin Stitt said Friday. Stitt said at a news conference that the state is continuing to ramp up its testing capacity and dedicating more resources to contact tracing, in alignment with guidelines released by the Trump administration for reopening the country's economy. Contact tracing involves interviewing those who have the coronavirus about their movements and contact with others. University of Oklahoma and Oklahoma State University medical students are assisting with the project. \"If our positive trends continue, we hope to share more details next week on how to roll that out,\" Stitt said. He said churches, retailers and restaurants are all working on plans on how to safely reopen their establishments.\n\nSalem: Dozens of people protesting the state's stay-at-home order drove around the Capitol on Friday, horns blaring, and a lawmaker asked the governor to ease restrictions for medical procedures for non-coronavirus patients. The protest in Salem was one of several happening across the country as conservatives push back against restrictions meant to slow the spread of the coronavirus. State Rep. Cheri Helt, a moderate Republican from Bend, credited Gov. Kate Brown for imposing the stay-at-home order and social distancing. But she said in a letter it's time to \"slowly and carefully begin lifting regulations that have essentially shut down access to health care and medical procedures in Central Oregon for anything unrelated to COVID-19.\" Helt noted that the order has affected the health care industry and patients who must wait for procedures.\n\nHarrisburg: The state is starting curbside pickup at liquor stores a month after Gov. Tom Wolf ordered them closed as part of a broader shutdown of businesses deemed nonessential. The Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board announced on its website Saturday that stores will begin taking orders by phone Monday, with each customer limited to no more than six bottles. Curbside pickup will be available at more than 175 of the state's 600 stores. The closure of the state-owned liquor stores had been widely unpopular, especially with the state's online ordering system largely unable to keep up with overwhelming consumer demand. The liquor board, which has a virtual monopoly on retail sales of hard alcohol in Pennsylvania, has been repurposing some of the stores to help fulfill online orders.\n\nProvidence: The state is taking extra steps to protect residents of nursing homes and assisted living facilities who are particularly susceptible to the coronavirus, state Department of Health Director Nicole Alexander-Scott said Friday. More than 90 of the people who have died in Rhode Island lived in what Alexander-Scott called congregate-care facilities. \"We are doing everything we can to keep them safe,\" she said. Measures either already in place or set for launch soon include isolation at the first sign of symptoms; aggressive and more frequent testing of residents and their caregivers every seven to 10 days; and the creation of \"strike teams\" that can be deployed to nursing homes that are experiencing outbreaks to aid the staff. The state will also provide support for families taking care of elderly relatives at home, she said.\n\nHilton Head: A theater that's closed because of the coronavirus is making a switch to showing movies online. Larry Mann and his wife have owned the Park Plaza Cinema on Hilton Head Island for more than a decade. Like other movie theaters in the U.S., they've had to shut down amid efforts to prevent the new virus from spreading. The Island Packet reports the couple is revamping the theater's website to stream films not yet available on platforms such as Netflix. Mann says streaming movies on his site will generally cost about $12. Initial offerings will include \"The Roads Not Taken\" starring Javier Bardem and Elle Fanning and the rock documentary \"Once Were Brothers: Robbie Robertson and the Band.\" \"If we could figure out how to get everyone popcorn, we would do that, too,\" Mann said.\n\nSioux Falls: An employee at the Minnehaha Juvenile Detention Center has tested positive for COVID-19, the facility's director said Saturday. Detention center director Jamie Gravett told the Associated Press that the Sioux Falls facility was informed of the positive test Friday \"and immediately began informing guardians, our partners and contractors while caring for our youth and keeping them safe.\" Staff and juveniles are being monitored for symptoms and have their temperatures taken twice each day, she said. The center in March put restrictions on visitors and began using \"enhanced sanitation procedures,\" Gravett said. The facility currently has 29 juveniles and 50 staff members. With statewide cases on the rise, the National Guard said it has selected locations for two 100-bed temporary hospitals to treat COVID-19 patients, one in Sioux Falls and one in Rapid City.\n\nChattanooga: The mayor is reversing course to allow drive-in church services during the coronavirus pandemic after the city was sued over its ban. Mayor Andy Berke confirmed the change in policy Saturday on Twitter. The conservative legal group Alliance Defending Freedom recently filed a federal lawsuit over the drive-in church ban on behalf of Chattanooga-based Metropolitan Tabernacle Church. \"Every week I sign a new executive order. I have spoken to pastors who assured me they could operate drive in church safely, with spaces between the cars and no collection plates,\" Berke wrote on Twitter. \"This week's order therefore permits drive in church. Please observe safely.\" The lawsuit followed Berke's declaration that drive-in religious services would violate the city's shelter-in-place directive that has been in place since April 2.\n\nAustin: The state is easing restrictions put in place to curb the spread of the coronavirus, Republican Gov. Greg Abbott said Friday, starting this week by letting retailers sell items for curbside pickup, resuming elective surgeries and reopening state parks. But Texas' tiptoeing toward restarting one of the world's largest economies immediately ran into new questions and skepticism and came as Abbott faces pressure from both conservatives who are eager to get Texas back to work and Democrats who are wary of going too quickly. Texas ranks last in the U.S. in coronavirus testing per capita, according to an analysis by the Associated Press of data collected by the COVID Tracking Project. Abbott said future decisions on reopening more of Texas would be guided by testing, and although he assured that testing would \"go up quite a bit\" in late April or early May, he did not provide a number.\n\nSalt Lake City: Salt Lake County officials reported a COVID-19 outbreak Friday at a homeless center for men near Salt Lake City where 94 of 205 people tested positive. Six of the men were taken to a hospital, two were treated and released, and four remained hospitalized in stable condition, said Ilene Risk, epidemiology manager at the Salt Lake County health department. \"While this finding is truly unfortunate, it's not especially surprising because the group living setting like this one is similar to a big household,\" Risk said. \"We tend to see household transmission at rates of about 25-50%.\" Officials had hoped to prevent an outbreak by doing extra cleaning of the facility and daily temperature screenings of residents. The county health department said in a statement that it is putting a plan in place to prevent other cases but acknowledged that maintaining social distancing to prevent the virus from spreading is difficult in a building that has up to 300 people.\n\nMontpelier: The New England Foundation for the Arts has awarded $47,000 to the Vermont Arts Council to support artists struggling financially amid the coronavirus outbreak, the council said. The funds will supplement an artists' relief fund the council started last month to provide grants of up to $500 to artists who are having financial difficulty due to the loss of a job or cancellation of concerts, festivals, theatrical performances and other arts events due to COVID-19, the council said. The council received 183 requests for emergency relief funding in the first week and by April 15 had awarded 164 grants totaling more than $64,000. The applications are temporarily closed and will reopen for a new round of requests Wednesday. \"From touring musicians who have lost all gigs for the foreseeable future to teaching artists whose residencies have been canceled this semester, Vermont's working artists are hurting,\" Executive Director Karen Mittelman said.\n\nRichmond: The state has reduced its jail population by 17% in response to the coronavirus outbreak, Gov. Ralph Northam said Friday. Northam said the jail population in the state was 24,000 on April 7, down 17% from March 1. Virginia has also seen a 67% decline in the number of new commitments for misdemeanors across the state. Northam said the reduction was achieved through various steps, including decreasing the number of low-risk offenders being held without bail in jails, diverting offenders from being admitted into jails before trial by using summonses in lieu of arrests, and using alternatives to jail such as home electronic monitoring. Critics, however, say the state hasn't moved quickly enough to reduce the number of people being held in state prisons, which are considered high-risk locations for the spread of the virus.\n\nSeattle: A King County Metro bus driver who worked in a highly populated area that includes Seattle has died after contracting the coronavirus. Metro in a statement to The Seattle Times confirmed the death Thursday of 59-year-old Samina Hameed. \"Metro and our entire community are deeply thankful for their service,\" Metro officials said. \"Our thoughts are with their family, friends and colleagues, as we look to do everything we can to support them.\" Hameed had been a Metro employee since 2017. Her husband is also a Metro operator, and the two have three children. Hameed is the first Metro bus driver to die during the pandemic. Transit is deemed an essential service, but drivers typically come in contact with the public and have an increased chance of contracting the virus.\n\nCharleston: Another nursing home resident has died due to the coronavirus, pushing the state's confirmed death count to 19, officials said Sunday. The Kanawha-Charleston Health Department confirmed the death of a male patient from the Eastbrook Rehabilitation Center in Charleston. The patient tested positive for the virus earlier this month and had been receiving care at a hospital, Eastbrook operator Stonerise Healthcare said in a statement. On Saturday, the state Department of Health and Human Resources reported the virus-related deaths of an 83-year-old man and an 88-year-old woman from Eldercare Health and Rehabilitation in the Jackson County community of Ripley. The number of reported deaths in the state from the coronavirus has more than doubled in the past week.\n\nMilwaukee: There was new testing and protesting in the state Saturday as the number of COVID-19 cases rose to nearly 4,200 and the death toll increased to 212. Hundreds of demonstrators stood shoulder-to-shoulder in Brookfield to protest Gov. Tony Evers' decision to extend Wisconsin's stay-at-home order through May 26. The group is calling for the reopening of churches, parks and the state economy. Some wore masks and elected to participate in parking lots, while the majority stood together on the sidewalk waving. Several showed off campaign signs, flags and bumper stickers for President Donald Trump. Meanwhile, two separate teams were busy investigating COVID-19 cases, one from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and another from the state National Guard. Brown County officials said the CDC was making its way to the Green Bay area to look into a more than fourfold surge of COVID-19 cases in just 10 days.\n\nCheyenne: Testing ability and statistics rather than a schedule will determine when places in the state ordered closed to limit the spread of the coronavirus will be allowed to reopen, Gov. Mark Gordon said Friday. Gordon has prohibited gatherings of 10 or more people and ordered the closure of schools and many types of businesses through April 30. Gordon hasn't said whether he would extend that date or when on the calendar he might begin lifting restrictions. \"It's not really so much date-driven; it's data-driven. It's more about how many tests we'll be able to give, how many positives, how many of those positives are community spread versus something else,\" Gordon told the Associated Press. Most of the U.S., including Wyoming, still lacks widespread testing capacity toward meeting newly outlined federal goals. \"We aren't adequate on testing. That's been one of our biggest bugaboos,\" Gordon said.",

        "authors": [],
        "body": "A New York study suggests blood thinners may help reduce deaths among critically ill coronavirus patients on ventilators.\n\nIn an observational study published in the peer-reviewed Journal of the American College of Cardiology, Mount Sinai doctors gave blood thinners to 28% of 2,773 hospitalized patients with COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus. They discovered the sickest patients benefited the most from the blood thinners.\n\n\"The benefit was much more significant in those who were very sick and admitted in the ICU and intubated,\" said Dr. Valent\u00edn Fuster, senior investigator and corresponding author of the Mount Sinai study.\n\nMore than 60% of 234 patients who required mechanical ventilation survived when given blood thinners. Only 20% of patients who weren't given blood thinners survived. Doctors, however, say the numbers are subject to change as patients are still hospitalized.\n\nFuster said the study was a stepping stone to Mount Sinai's understanding of the role blood thinners can play in coronavirus patients. But he cautioned further validation is needed through more studies.\n\n\"This is an opening door on a treatment that could be of great benefit,\" he said. \"But we are very cautious in interpreting it because it's an observational study.\"\n\nAlthough there's still no scientific evidence, anecdotal reports from doctors across the country have suggested an association between the novel coronavirus and blood clotting.\n\nAt Mount Sinai, doctors reported five patients under the age of 50 who suffered large vessel strokes over a two-week period, according to a letter published in the New England Journal of Medicine in late April. All five patients tested positive for COVID-19 but had mild to no symptoms.\n\nStrokes in young people: COVID-19 caused strokes in young people who had mild coronavirus symptoms, NYC doctors say\n\nCould heartburn drug famotidine be used to treat coronavirus?: The theory is trending online, but there's no data to support it.\n\n\"A big part of the way this disease hurts people is in blood clots, whether it's in the lungs or the kidney or the heart or the brain,\" said Dr. J Mocco, director of the Cerebrovascular Center at Mount Sinai.\n\nA study from the Netherlands published in early April looked at 184 patients checked into the intensive care unit for COVID-19 pneumonia. Nearly a third suffered from thrombotic complications, more commonly known as blood clotting.\n\nAlthough doctors can't confirm why the symptom occurs, Mocco said research suggests the virus attaches itself to a host cell that exists in the respiratory tract and in blood vessels, allowing the virus to travel anywhere inside the body.\n\nWhile blood clotting appears to be a prevalent problem among critically ill patients, Mocco said the decision to use blood thinners should be made on a case-by-case basis.",

        "authors": [],
        "body": "CNN news anchor Brooke Baldwin in December 2017 in New York.Evan Agostini/Invision/AP\n\nCOVID-19 \"got\" CNN anchor Brooke Baldwin and now she's sharing details of just how \"damn sick\" she was. But it wasn't all bad: She found clarity about the things that really matter and a renewed sense of connection to family, friends and community.\n\nGetting there was two weeks of hell, Baldwin said in a personal essay posted on CNN on Sunday, one of a series from CNN's staff about living with and covering the global pandemic.\n\nBaldwin announced she had tested positive and started feeling symptoms in early April, joining CNN anchor Chris Cuomo in coronavirus misery.\n\nCuomo has continued to anchor his evening show from his basement although he has been sidelined occasionally by brutal symptoms. His wife, Cristina Cuomo, said she is feeling better after being diagnosed with COVID-19 last week.\n\nBaldwin's essay was illustrated with Instagram pictures of Baldwin during her illness, looking glum and exasperated, even when she had her pug dog Pugsley by her side.\n\nFor Baldwin, who anchors the 2-4 p.m. edition of \"CNN Newsroom,\" it was hard to cope with the melancholy and isolation, even from her husband in the same New York apartment. He didn't get sick (\"knock on wood,\" she said), despite many hugs of comfort during the times she went to \"very dark places.\"\n\n\"These simple acts of connecting with me and hugging me were restorative beyond measure. The isolation might be worse than the body aches,\" she wrote.\n\nThe physical pain was so bad she had to take long, nightly hot baths to distract her from her own aching body. Then there were the nightly fever sweats, a pervasive sense of dread, the crying jags and the lack of interest in food she could no longer taste or smell.\n\nWorst were the moments when her symptoms abated long enough to fool her into thinking she was recovering - only to have them revisit with a vengeance. \"I never knew when it would end. It was relentless, scary, and lonely,\" Baldwin wrote.\n\nStill, she was lucky, she said. The virus didn't take \"suffocating hold of my lungs\" the way it has with thousands of other patients. She felt grateful she didn't add to the stress of overwhelmed doctors and nurses and in hospital emergency rooms.\n\n\"And most of all I am grateful for the reminders this virus provided: First, that clarity comes from being quiet and listening to our feelings. And second, that connection is more vital to our health and happiness than we might care to admit,\" she wrote.\n\nEveryone who is quarantined at home, whether sick or not, has been forced to sit still without distraction, she wrote. \"The clarity this can bring is more illuminating than anything I could have uncovered in my normally busy, 'full' life. When I was sick and my body came to a screeching halt, I stopped doing and started really feeling.\"\n\nAnd people responded, in messages and on social media, she said. She found herself logging on to Instagram to feel better.\n\n\"I realized that sharing my own vulnerability with others online and receiving positive energy and well-wishes back brings me the gift of connection. I quickly discovered how grateful I was to all of these people showing me love.\"\n\nSo to hell with COVID but also a thank you of sorts, she concluded.\n\n\"I wouldn't wish this virus upon anyone, but I hope as my smell and taste and some sense of normalcy start to return, that I will also hold onto the clarity and connection I found while I was so damn sick.\"",

        "body": "BERLIN (AP) -- The Bundesliga will have to wait a bit longer for a chance to restart.\n\nGerman chancellor Angela Merkel said Thursday that a decision on whether the country's soccer league can resume amid the coronavirus pandemic has been pushed back to next Wednesday.\n\nMerkel made the announcement after meeting with the country's 16 state governors to discuss a possible easing of strict containment measures to combat the virus.\n\nSoccer authorities had been hoping to receive the go-ahead to resume the league as early as May 9 after presenting a raft of hygiene measures it said would help minimize the risk of spreading the virus. That includes playing games without fans, continuous testing and monitoring of players.\n\nBundesliga clubs are committed to finishing the season by the end of June, but have not yet been given the go-ahead to resume full team training. Now it seems the earliest the league can resume is May 16 or 23, but it depends on how the number of coronavirus cases develops.\n\nMerkel warned there is still a danger that COVID-19 infections could rise if containment measures are relaxed too soon.\n\n\"We have to keep looking at the overall situation. We have to do all we can to ensure there is no regression, but that we keep going forward step by step,\" Merkel said.\n\nA ban on all large gatherings in Germany through the end of August will remain. So even if next season begins on schedule, the first games will be played without fans present.\n\nThe German soccer federation earlier announced that an extraordinary general meeting will be held through video conferencing on May 25 to discuss the crisis.\n\nThe Bundesliga was suspended with nine rounds remaining on March 13.\n\nAs of Thursday, Germany had registered more than 160,000 cases of the coronavirus, with nearly 6,500 deaths attributed to COVID-19, according to Johns Hopkins University.

    "CDC Director Redfield warns second coronavirus wave could be 'more difficult,' hit same time as flu": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "Many health experts, including Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, have also warned of a possible second wave of infection.\n\n\"There is always the possibility as we get into next fall, and the beginning of early winter, that we could see a rebound,\" Fauci told CNN last week.\n\nModels had predicted that COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus, would kill 100,000 to 200,000 Americans. Though it appears the actual number of fatalities will be much lower - which most experts attribute to the level of adherence to social distancing guidelines - the outbreak has strained the capacity of hospitals to treat the more than 825,000 confirmed cases in the country. States hit hardest by the virus have scrambled to find enough respirators, ventilators and protective gear for medical staff to respond.\n\nThis outbreak became widespread in March when the number of flu cases normally begins to taper off. Redfield warned that if hospitals had to respond to another coronavirus outbreak at the same time as flu cases, both of which affect the respiratory system, the health care system could be overwhelmed.\n\nRedfield said the U.S. was fortunate the coronavirus did not arrive earlier because if the peak from that outbreak had come at the same time as the peak in flu cases, \"it could have been really, really, really, really difficult in terms of health capacity.\"\n\nThe CDC director said his concerns about a second wave have largely fallen on deaf ears.\n\n\"When I've said this to others, they kind of put their head back. They don't understand what I mean,\" Redfield told The Post.\n\nThere are many unanswered questions about the virus that could determine whether there will be a second wave of infection and how bad that wave might be. One of the biggest unknowns is whether people who have survived COVID-19 are immune and, if so, how long that immunity lasts.\n\nThe virus is similar to other coronaviruses such as SARS and MERS that do convey some immunity, so experts are optimistic this one will do the same. That could mean large swaths of the country will be safe from a second outbreak because many people have likely been exposed to the virus but did not develop symptoms.\n\nThe size of the population that might have developed antibodies to the virus can't be known until wider testing has been done. But Fauci told CBS News on Monday that antibody tests won't be meaningful until more is known about the virus.\n\nHe said it was \"a reasonable assumption that when you have an antibody that you are protected against reinfection. But that has not been proven for this particular virus.\"\n\n\"We don't know how long that protection - if it exists - lasts. Is it one month? Three months? Six months? A year?\" Fauci said.\n\nAnother key is whether the coronavirus behaves like influenza, largely going away during the warmer months but reappearing as the weather cools, which is the scenario that concerns Redfield.\n\nRedfield said social distancing has been crucial to slowing the spread of the disease. He advised states to adhere to the guidelines put out last week by the White House for them to begin to lift their restrictions..\n\nWhen asked about the protests against stay-at-home orders that have been held in multiple states and calls to \"liberate\" states - language used in a series of tweets from President Donald Trump - Redfield told The Post, \"It's not helpful.\"\n\nIn response to The Post's interview, Trump said in a tweet Wednesday that Redfield had been misquoted and would be issuing a statement.\n\nFood and Drug Administration Commissioner Stephen Hahn told CBS News on Wednesday that a second wave of cases was \"certainly a possibility\" and that it was a concern for all the doctors on the White House coronavirus task force.\n\nHahn said that was why a key aspect of the administration's plan to reopen the country relies on \"surveillance mechanisms to look for the respiratory illnesses and then do the appropriate testing at that time.\"\n\n\"I hope we don't have a rebound. That would make this very difficult, as we get into November,\" Fauci said. But if there is a recurrence, \"hopefully, we'll be able to respond to that rebound in a much more effective way than what we see now.\"\n\nHe said the keys would be developing treatments, expanding testing and the ability to trace who has been in contact with people who have been exposed.\n\nRedfield told The Post that about 500 CDC staff members working on various health issues around the country will begin to focus on the coronavirus. He said at least another 650 will be hired to assist with contact tracing and other jobs aimed at helping states move forward and prepare for another potential wave.\n\nAn estimate from Johns Hopkins University's Center for Health Security and Association of State and Territorial Health Officials says an additional 100,000 people will be needed to effectively conduct contact tracing for the nearly 330 million people living in the U.S. Those organizations called on Congress to appropriate $3.6 billion in emergency funds for the effort.\n\nA report from former CDC Director Tom Frieden says 300,000 additional hires are needed to do the tracing.\n\nRedfield agreed many more people will be needed to do the surveillance. He told the Post that an option being considered is to train census takers, as well as Peace Corps and AmeriCorps volunteers, to become \"part of a comprehensive contact tracing effort.\"\n\n\"These are all discussions that are going on to try to determine what is the optimal strategy to be used,\" Redfield said.\n\nAnother key step to avoid a catastrophic impact from a second wave of the pandemic will be to encourage as many Americans as possible to get a flu shot in the fall. Getting the shot could be the difference in making sure there is \"a hospital bed available for your mother or grandmother that may get coronavirus,\" he said.",

    "CDC report: Raspberries caused 2019 norovirus outbreak on cruises": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "Passengers contemplating boarding another cruise after the coronavirus pandemic might already be planning to pass up the buffet next time they sail due to social-distancing concerns - assuming ships don't do away with them anyway. But a new report published Friday by the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention spotlights the smoothie bar, too.\n\nThe study identified frozen fruit - namely raspberries - used to make smoothies as the culprit of a norovirus outbreak that infected hundreds of passengers on multiple cruises from a single company in 2019.\n\nBetween July and September 2019, the unnamed cruise line experienced \"sudden, unexplained outbreaks\" of acute gastroenteritis passed between passengers sailing on 10 ships in Europe, according to the CDC. While the outbreak went on throughout the summer, the cruise line's investigations \"yielded no clear source\" of the outbreaks though food was tested extensively.\n\nThe CDC study found the symptoms - the rapid onset of vomiting and diarrhea followed by recovery within a 24-hour period - to be consistent with norovirus. The highly contagious virus can be transmitted through contaminated food or water, direct contact with an infected person or touching contaminated surfaces.\n\nThe CDC's Vessel Sanitation Program (VSP), which works with the cruise industry to prevent and control the introduction, transmission and spread of gastrointestinal illnesses on passenger ships, was first notified about the situation in September. Any ship with 13 or more passengers or that has a foreign itinerary with U.S. ports is under its jurisdiction.\n\nOn Sept. 18, the VSP was notified of an acute gastroenteritis outbreak on one of the cruise line's ships that was sailing into New York from Germany.\n\nAccording to the CDC report, the ship was met in New York by VSP investigators on Sept. 22. They found that 117 out of 2,046 passengers and eight out of 610 crew members had exhibited symptoms consistent with acute gastroenteritis. From that group, four stool samples were collected for testing by the CDC and three came back positive for norovirus. But still, the VSP was unable to find the source of that outbreak at the time.\n\nShortly afterward, on Oct. 7, the VSP was informed of two additional outbreaks in U.S. waters. The first was on a ship taking a round-trip voyage from New York City along the eastern seaboard that infected 85 of the ship's 2,166 passengers and 10 of its 612 crew members. On the second cruise, from Montreal to New York, 83 of 2,251 passengers and 10 of 610 crew members became ill.\n\nFive stool samples from the second and third voyages investigated were taken by the CDC and overall, nine of the 11 samples taken from the three voyages tested positive for norovirus.\n\nAfter reviewing food questionnaires from passengers on the round-trip New York City voyage, the CDC found that 80% of those sickened \"implicated a smoothie made from frozen fruits and berries.\"\n\nBerries have been the source of norovirus outbreaks in the past, according to the CDC, which brought in the Food and Drug Administration in to collect frozen fruit and berry samples from the ship for testing.\n\nThe FDA tested 16 fruit groups from the ships and found that three items tested positive for norovirus: Tropical fruit cocktail, raspberries and berry mix.\n\nLater, the cruise line learned its food vendor had bought nearly 22,000 pounds of frozen raspberries at the end of June - right before the outbreak began - from a supplier in China. Those berries were provided to the cruise line's entire fleet.\n\nIn November, the discovery prompted the World Health Organization to issue a recall on frozen raspberries traced back to China.\n\nCDC spokesperson Jennifer Burchfield would not confirm the cruise line in question. However, she said, \"Ten of the 13 outbreaks occurred while the ships were not sailing in U.S. jurisdiction. We do not know the total number of people infected during this multi-ship outbreak.\"",

    "COVID chronicles: Heartache at one U.S. city's deadliest nursing home": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "Maria Ortega cradled a phone to her ear -- her children and grandchildren huddled around her -- as she choked out a few final words to her 74-year-old mother, Rachel Luna.\n\nLuna was in an ICU bed across town, in and out of consciousness, dying from coronavirus. She slipped away just after midnight on April 15.\n\nThe next day, 86-year-old Barbara Gardner, who lived down the hall from Luna at the West Oaks Nursing and Rehabilitation Center, succumbed to the virus alone in her room.\n\nOn the third consecutive day of heartbreak at the tan-brick facility in South Austin, 51-year-old Maurice Dotson, a beloved nursing assistant who tended to patients there for a quarter century, became the first health care worker in the city to die from COVID-19.\n\n\"My heart breaks for everyone there,\" Dotson's mother, Florence, said. \"I pray about it everyday.\"\n\nSince the outbreak began in late March, the virus has stalked the West Oaks hallways, spreading from room-to-room, patient-to-patient. West Oaks has averaged at least two deaths a week. More than half of its 125 patients have been diagnosed with the virus. Fifteen have died. Two dozen staff members have tested positive.\n\nWhat happened there the week of April 12 offers a snapshot of the grim toll the coronavirus has exacted at facilities that house some of the nation's most vulnerable populations.\n\nLeaders there say they have been in a constant battle to save lives by isolating the sick from the healthy. Terrified employees have raced to prevent further loss while trying to protect themselves after losing a friend and colleague.\n\nThe experiences of family members with loved ones at West Oaks mirrors the devastation and anxiety of thousands of families across the nation. Elderly parents and grandparents who could no longer care for themselves sit sequestered in nursing homes and similar facilities, where an estimated 10,000 have died nationally.\n\nChildren and grandchildren have grappled with the helpless reality that they can't see family members and must put faith in often overwhelmed facility staff who they hope are abiding by protocols and providing proper care.\n\nWest Oaks operators say they have taken an array of steps to stop the spread. They have suspended gatherings, closed dining halls and quarantined residents in their rooms. They have made sure workers have protective gear and given lessons on how to wear and discard it. They have mandated daily temperature checks for patients and staff alike.\n\n\"As we navigate through this unprecedented crisis, our top priority is keeping our patients healthy and safe,\" Larry Deering, CEO of West Oaks' parent company wrote in a letter to families.\n\nBut that is cold comfort for families who have stood by helplessly as their loved ones died alone.\n\n\"I don't want to say I blame them because they were good to my mom,\" Ortega said. \"But I wonder, 'Why her? Why my mom?'\"\n\nRachel Luna, once a feisty tournament-winning pool player, moved into West Oaks, a sprawling facility nestled among Texas oaks, four years ago.\n\nShe had lived with her daughter in their wood-framed North Austin duplex for years, but when dementia took hold, she became a danger to herself. After accidentally overdosing on medication, doctors and social workers told Ortega and her brother that they should consider 24-hour nursing care.\n\nWest Oaks was the only facility in Austin that had an opening and could offer the level of care Luna needed.\n\n\"Miss Luna\" quickly settled into Room 114 and got to know residents and staff, who doted on her. Her mother could be demanding, but workers treated her kindly, Ortega said.\n\n\"My mom was old school,\" Ortega said. \"And she would let them know, 'You get my check to take care of me, so you are going to take care of me.'\"\n\nBut Luna appreciated the community, which became a hub of social activity for the family.\n\nAt Christmastime, gold tinsel decorated the doorway to Luna's room, a wreath hung in the middle of the door and a stocking dangled under her nameplate.\n\nThey sang along when a resident or visitor played the piano next to the vending machines in the common area and shared snacks in the \"West Oaks Bistro.\"\n\n\"She was happy there,\" Ortega said.\n\nNursing homes and long-term care facilities like West Oaks have been hit hard in the COVID-19 pandemic. Estimates by The New York Times and others are that nursing home deaths have accounted for about a fifth of the nearly 72,000 deaths nationally.\n\nIn New York, for instance, officials have reported that the number of nursing home residents who died after testing positive or were presumed to be positive since March 1 has reached nearly 5,000, accounting for about a fifth of the state's deaths.\n\nTexas officials report 884 nursing home residents have died, about 45 percent of all virus-related deaths in the state. The toll has rapidly escalated since April 13, when the state reported 47 fatalities at nursing homes and senior care centers.\n\nIn Austin, nursing home fatalities make up about half of the city's total COVID-19 deaths. Of the 57 deaths in Travis County, 29 were residents at nursing homes or other long-term care centers. Additionally, 335 of the county's estimated 2,000 COVID-19 cases were nursing home patients or staff.\n\nExperts from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have tried to understand nursing home clusters since the first U.S. outbreak in King County, Wash., in February.\n\nOlder adults are more susceptible because of their age and underlying health conditions, researchers say. And, nursing homes pose a greater risk because of the \"congregate nature,\" which experts say routinely contributes to outbreaks of flu, stomach viruses and other maladies.\n\nResearch into nursing home outbreaks has also highlighted a troubling aspect of the virus that applies to the population at large, according to the CDC.\n\n\"Residents with COVID-19 may not report typical symptoms such as fever or respiratory symptoms,\" the agency said. The CDC says patients infected with the virus may have no symptoms and could spread it without knowing.\n\nOfficials in Austin and Travis County have issued several orders to try to curb the spread at nursing homes. Officials said in an April 22 directive that facilities must not admit any new residents if two or more patients test positive; that a facility must make all staff available for COVID-19 testing if requested by public health authorities; and that operations must notify next-of-kin of all residents if a patient tests COVID-19 positive.\n\nAustin officials also created a strike team of additional doctors, nurses and other medical staff who may supplement facility staffing during an outbreak and remain until it has subsided.\n\nThe week of April 12, the outbreak was in full swing at West Oaks.\n\nA couple of weeks earlier, staff had called Ortega to alert her that two patients had tested positive for the virus. A week later, she was relieved when nurses called again to say that her mother had tested negative.\n\nBut about 10 days after that, West Oaks staff called once again to report that Luna wasn't herself and appeared dehydrated. Two days later, she was admitted into the hospital, where doctors again tested her for the virus.\n\nThis time, the test was positive. A doctor told Ortega her mother's prospects were grim.\n\n\"He told me that in her condition, she was probably not going to survive,\" Oretga said. \"I didn't want to hear that.\"\n\nOne week later, on April 14, the family made that final tearful call to their matriarch.\n\n\"For her to die the way she did, that's what really, really hurts,\" said Ortega, a school food service worker, crying as she sat on a rusted folding chair in her front lawn. \"She deserved to have everybody around her.\"\n\nDebbie Cullins' father called her on April 11 to say her mother, Barbara Gardner, had tested positive for COVID-19.\n\nWest Oaks had become a center of family life for 86-year-old Gardner and her husband, too.\n\nCullins said her mother suffered seizures that left her unable to speak. She was referred to the facility four years ago by the staff of a rehab center where Gardner was a patient.\n\nEach day, Gardner's 85-year-old husband, John, made the 4-and-a-half mile trip from his home to the facility to feed his wife lunch and dinner, his daughters said.\n\n\"My dad said there were a lot of people who didn't have anybody who would visit them, and he felt sorry for them,\" said Cullins, who lives outside of Dallas. \"He would go and talk to them and do different things with them.\"\n\nThe family got its first wrenching blow when John Gardner learned he could no longer visit his wife after West Oaks closed its doors to outside visitors in mid-March.\n\nIn early April, Cullins' father called to say that the virus had arrived at West Oaks.\n\nDespite the positive test nearly two weeks later, her mother had no obvious symptoms at first, Cullins said. Family members prayed she had a mild case and would bounce back. Then her fever spiked, and she died the following day, April 16, one day after Luna.\n\n\"Not being able to be there for your mom, who is so frail and so vulnerable, it is horrible,\" said Sandy Millner, another of the Gardners' daughters. \"She didn't deserve that. It's a nightmare.\"\n\nCullins said she now fears for her father, who not only lost his wife of 63 years, but possibly other friends who died that he doesn't yet know about.\n\n\"He is afraid of which of his friends he has lost,\" she said.\n\nWhile the families of Luna and Gardner anguished over the suffering of their loved ones, Maurice Dotson, one of the staff who had cared for them in those final years, was fighting his own battle with COVID-19.\n\nThe devoted caretaker who always put residents first -- never completing a shift without going room-to-room to see if they needed anything -- was taken by ambulance to the hospital April 9.\n\nDotson had told friends that he was worried about contracting the virus, but felt as though he would be abandoning his family if he didn't go to work.\n\nOn April 17, the day after Gardner died, COVID-19 took Dotson, too.\n\nWest Oaks officials in a statement said they grieved for Dotson's loss and that \"our dedicated staff put patients first before themselves everyday.\"\n\nCompany officials declined to speak about what safety steps they have recently taken. However, in a statement, they said they are following protocols recommended by doctors who are advising them, Austin Public Health and the CDC.\n\nIn the April 28 letter to families, Regency Healthcare, which operates West Oaks, said it has designated specific staff to work only with COVID-19 patients and established isolation spaces \"with physical barriers\" for those patients. They also have increased housekeeping responsibilities, ensuring that \"touchpoints\" are routinely cleaned.\n\n\"We are committed to addressing every challenge this pandemic brings,\" the letter said.\n\nOn April 17, the same day Dotson died, Diana George called her father from her room at West Oaks. The 50-year-old multiple sclerosis patient was upset. She felt ill and feared she had contracted coronavirus.\n\nThree days later, John George got another call from West Oaks. His daughter was unresponsive, en route to the hospital in an ambulance.\n\n\"Her immune system is compromised to start with,\" John George said, his voice cracking. \"And you think, it's got to be a death sentence.\"\n\nBut his daughter had a track record of beating death.\n\nDiana George confronted a stream of medical woes for more than a decade. After being diagnosed with MS, her mobility gradually eroded until she required a wheelchair.\n\nA series of infections forced doctors to amputate both of her legs.\n\n\"She weathered it better than we did,\" said John George, a retired pool builder in Austin and Dallas. \"It was not a problem for her, but she's very positive.\"\n\nFearing she would become a burden to her five adult children, Diana George moved to Texas from Missouri about 10 years ago, eventually settling into West Oaks.\n\nThe last time most of her family -- her mother, father, stepmother and children -- saw her was more than two months ago. They gathered at West Oaks on Feb. 22 to celebrate her 50th birthday, snapping pictures of Diana George smiling brightly from under a rainbow-colored decorative hat.\n\nHer parents had barely heard of coronavirus then.\n\nBut John George said his fears deepened in mid-March when he learned that West Oaks was closing to visitors. A few days later, the facility informed him that a resident had tested positive for COVID-19.\n\nTrying to gauge his daughter's risk, he pressed for more details about which patients were sick. He got nothing until that terrifying call from his daughter.\n\nBut as she had before, Diana George proved herself stronger than the disease that attacked her body.\n\nIn the past three weeks, she has steadily improved. She remains hospitalized as officials search for a place where she can continue to recover before returning to West Oaks.",

    "COVID-19 and its restrictions made my brother's death harder to grieve": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "My younger brother, Tom Keveney, died last month. My family's deep sadness was understandable and unavoidable, but the coronavirus pandemic ravaged our ability to mourn his death.\n\nTom, with the help of an excellent medical team, had been bravely fighting advanced cancer for more than four years. His most recent prognosis was not good, but the suddenness of his death was a surprise. That abruptness and a recent symptom raised the possibility of COVID-19, although he didn't have the most well-known symptoms and hadn't been diagnosed with it.\n\nLike thousands of mourning families, we'll never know. Chalk it up as another brutal side effect of the coronavirus era.\n\nTom, a landscaper who loved fishing, crime novels and the Red Sox, died in his sleep after spending a great weekend with my brother Pete and my sister, Kate, in Connecticut. (I live in California.) I hope and pray it was without physical pain. I know it was without the shattering psychological pain faced by those who have died alone because the virus prevents family members from being at their bedsides.\n\nWe're all feeling loss resulting from the pandemic. It could be a graduation ceremony or a job; it's likely to be freedom of movement and a basic sense of security. The fallout from COVID-19 makes the death of a family member inestimably worse.\n\nMy family's experience isn't unique; if anything, it's too common in these unprecedented times. Many families' losses have been crueler; each cuts to the bone. I'm not an expert, and I don't pretend to offer advice on dealing with death. The best I can hope for is connection, a recognition of the feeling for whatever you have lost; an understanding of what others are going through; even a bit of girding for what may be coming down the road.\n\nI had forgotten the raw pain of a loved one's death because I hadn't lost a family member in more than 20 years. Time, thankfully, helps soften that suffering, but the price may be paid in eventual numbness. When Tom died, it all came roaring back. Although the sensation is horrible, it's natural, a healthy reaction and a start to grieving.\n\nStaying Apart, Together: Read our newsletter on 'Star Wars,' gray hair and books getting us through the week\n\nWhat I don't recall with past loss is being so frustrated, even angry - feelings that accompanied my family's inability to honor Tom's passing properly. I blame that on the coronavirus, regardless of whether Tom had it. Death makes us realize the limits of our control, which isn't the worst thing for our proud species. Pandemic restrictions, although justified, injected a devastating feeling of powerlessness.\n\nIn normal times, after learning of Tom's death, I would have immediately flown to Connecticut, planned wake and funeral details and joined friends and family for hugs, tears and funny stories. Tom, known for his sense of humor, would have leaned toward the stories. Those options aren't possible now.\n\nI searched flights the day of Tom's death, as if on autopilot, but a trip back to Connecticut wasn't realistic. I didn't want to get sick or raise the risk for others, from TSA workers to my family members. I would have been told to self-quarantine for two weeks as soon as I landed, anyway.\n\nIn addition, the traditional rites weren't available. A wake made little sense when the state wouldn't allow more than five people in one place. Our family's Catholic church, like most places of worship, isn't performing funerals right now. Besides, we wouldn't want Tom's friends to risk their health by attending.\n\nToo many deaths: We need to mourn coronavirus losses, not just track the grim tally of deaths\n\nSome families conduct services via Zoom or hold family-only burials. There are even drive-thru viewings. Pete, Kate and I, the surviving members of our nuclear family, decided to postpone the funeral until we can join our friends and others who love Tom, who was cremated. A quick look at newspaper obituaries indicates many families are doing the same.\n\nMy siblings fully supported my decision not to fly back to Connecticut right away, which is the best gift they could have given me. There's so much guilt connected with death; it helps not to let coronavirus add more.\n\nThe loss of familiar rituals hit me harder than I expected. I most regret not having the chance to get together with my brother and sister at the time of sharpest grief, but I missed the comfort and order that comes with a funeral, too.\n\nThat includes the ceremonial elements and the chance to talk about Tom's life at the service but also the surrounding tasks: making travel plans, alerting friends, getting a suit pressed. Those duties would have kept me busy and, happily, out of my own head for a few days. That's not avoidance, just a welcome break. There will be plenty of time to be alone with my thoughts.\n\nStuck in California, I felt adrift. I didn't realize how much structure traditions provide when death jolts daily life. They set boundaries, allowing a few days away from regular routines, including work. (I'm fortunate to have a job and supportive colleagues.) Friends sent sympathy cards, food and plants; their caring helps more than they can know.\n\nAt home, I had too much time to think about the fact that I hadn't seen Tom since last summer, although we spoke almost daily and I have visited frequently over the years. A trip back home might have eased that regret or at least taken my mind off it for a while.\n\nAt least my family had the opportunity to commemorate Tom's life through an obituary that ran in the New Haven Register and on the funeral home's website. We added some personal details. Friends gained the comfort of recognition; those who didn't know Tom could understand why we think he's a great guy. This essay is another not-so-subtle way to talk about my brother.\n\nI posted a link to the obituary on Facebook to get wider reach. I've never been a big Facebook fan, but I received many comforting responses and now have a greater appreciation of its ability to connect - and of how much of my friends' big life news I've missed over the years. I'm trying to do better on that front going forward.\n\nTwo weeks later, worried I hadn't done enough to honor Tom publicly, I sought other options to make sure he was remembered. Twitter wasn't a completely satisfying alternative, but it provided an efficient way to reach people. I tweeted a link to his obituary and received supportive responses. They're not the same as cards or phone calls - I worry the deeper connection those old-school communications provide is being squeezed out by the convenience of digital condolences - but the messages were comforting. (Note to self: I've got work to do on sending cards, too.)\n\nWithout the clear demarcation point of a formal bereavement period, I went back to work at USA TODAY, where I write about television (and lately coronavirus), a few days after Tom's death. It gave me something to do and made me feel useful. I also felt tired and had difficulty focusing, which probably stemmed from Tom's death, the stress of stay-at-home restrictions and the oppressive cloud of COVID-19. I'm guessing that's a common feeling.\n\nA month since Tom's passing, I'm muddling through, helped by family, friends, colleagues and an excellent therapist. My brother and sister have good friends, too, and we have each other. It helps that I talk to them just about every day.\n\nPhone calls, Zoom get-togethers and long, social-distanced walks with friends have eased the isolation of dealing with this by myself, across the country from family. Occasional runs - sorry, knees! - relieve stress. And time, as it has done before, is slowly softening the pain.\n\nI'll be OK, thanks to the kind of support system many people don't have. But I'm still furious with coronavirus for depriving my family, and especially Tom, of his deserved goodbye.\n\nSomeday, we will gather with friends to mourn and celebrate Tom - as will so many other families waiting to honor their lost loved ones. I long for that day, although I have no idea when it will come. Just part of the toll of this damnable pandemic.",

        "authors": [],
        "body": "The claim: Nicotine substitutes could have a positive effect in fighting COVID-19\n\nAmid coronavirus news, claims have surfaced that nicotine could contribute to preventing people from contracting COVID-19.\n\nThis followed the release of a study suggesting that those who smoke daily are less likely to develop a severe case of the virus.\n\nDifferent news outlets, including The Daily Mail and The New York Post, reported on the findings from the French study, which came from the Piti\u00e9 Salp\u00eatri\u00e8re, a major hospital in Paris.\n\n\"Nicotine may be suggested as a potential preventive agent against COVID-19 infection,\" the study reads. \"Both the epidemiological/clinical evidence and the in-silico findings may suggest that COVID-19 infection is a nAChR disease that could be prevented and may be controlled by nicotine.\"\n\nMore: What's true and what's false about coronavirus?\n\nThe study acknowledges that nicotine is a drug of abuse and could have severe pathological consequences. But it states that in controlled settings, nicotine could provide an efficient treatment.\n\n\"Results showed that of the patients hospitalized, with a median age of 65, only 4.4 percent were regular smokers,\" the Daily Mail piece reads. \"But among those at home, with a median age of 44, 5.3 percent smoked.\"\n\nThe Daily Mail article continued: \"By comparison, among the general population, 40 percent of those between ages 44 and 53 smoke, and around 11 percent of those aged 65 to 75 smoke. The researchers determined that far fewer smokers appear to have contracted the virus or, if they have, their symptoms are less serious.\"\n\nThe study examined 480 coronavirus patients.\n\nShortly after the study was released, the French government banned online sales of nicotine replacements, such as nicotine gum and patches, and warned that pharmacies that dispense treatments for tobacco addiction must limit the amount they issue per person, Business Insider reported.\n\n\"Because of media coverage of the potentially protective effect of nicotine against COVID-19, there is a high risk of a significant rise in the pharmacy dispensing and Internet sale of nicotine replacement treatments over the coming days,\" a draft order from the European Commission reads.\n\nThe order explains the limitations are necessary to regulate the pharmacy dispensing and the Internet sale of nicotine substitutes. The limitations were also established to prevent the health risks associated with \"excessive consumption or misuse in the wake of media coverage,\" and to maintain an appropriate supply for those who are looking to quit smoking.\n\nIn an overview by the National Center for Biotechnology Information of five different studies suggesting that nicotine may aid in severe COVID-19 cases, it was found that \"smoking is most likely associated with the negative progression and adverse outcomes of COVID-19.\"\n\nOn April 21, Bloomberg News reported the U.S. Food and Drug Administration revised its stance on COVID-19 and nicotine, saying nicotine could also increase the chances of catching the coronavirus. It was reported earlier in the month that smokers could potentially have worse outcomes from the virus.\n\n\"People who smoke cigarettes may be at increased risk of infection with the virus that causes Covid-19, and may have worse outcomes from Covid-19,\" the agency told Bloomberg News.\n\nThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued guidance that people with medical conditions such chronic lung disease, high blood pressure and diabetes are at a higher risk for severe illness from the virus.\n\nA post by the Center for Tobacco Control Research and Education at the University of San Francisco states people could reduce the risk of contracting coronavirus by ditching smoking and vaping products.\n\n\"When someone's lungs are exposed to flu or other infections the adverse effects of smoking or vaping are much more serious than among people who do not smoke or vape,\" the post reads.\n\nThe study drew criticism from some experts who were skeptical about its findings .\n\n\"This is one study done by one group. We have to wait and see on the evidence,\" Robert Schwartz, a professor at the University of Toronto Dalla Lana School of Public Health and executive director of the Ontario Tobacco Research Unit, told Global News. He said even if nicotine does play a role in preventing the virus, it could potentially cause more harm than COVID-19 if everyone started smoking.\n\nJason Sheltzer, a fellow at Cold Spring Harbor Lab, a nonprofit research and educational institution, created a Twitter thread highlighting flaws in the study.\n\n\"So in short, I think that this analysis is severely flawed. They're comparing statistics that shouldn't be compared.\" Sheltzer tweeted after analyzing the study. \"I don't think that there's any convincing evidence that smoking protects against coronavirus.\"\n\nMore information is needed in order to rate the claim that nicotine substitutes could help in fighting COVID-19 symptoms as true or false. It is possible that nicotine substitutes could aid in fighting the coronavirus but findings from the French study were very preliminary and more research is needed. Furthermore, many other studies state differently and researchers have warned against jumping to conclusions from the study.\n\nThank you for supporting our journalism.

        "body": "Giving back just got easier, after the state unveils a new web site aimed at connecting willing volunteers with badly needed help. And small businesses get more financial aid after the fund quickly depleted. Plus, I talk to the head of the California State Parks Foundation about Earth Day, which celebrates 50 years of honoring Mother Nature.\n\nIt's Arlene Mart\u00ednez, with Tuesday's news.\n\nBut first, just in time for Mother's Day, our favorite Golden State chocolatier is back. Darn right I'm talking about See's Candies. You might remember it shut down last month for only the second time in its history (the other was during World War II). So ... hint, hint everyone in my family.\n\nStay safe and informed with news and resources from across the USA TODAY Network and beyond: Sign up for In California today (it's free!).\n\nLet's start with some quick headlines:\n\nLeader of the pack: California once again had the nation's most polluted cities on the American Lung Association's \"State of the Air,\" with Los Angeles and Visalia topping the list for smog and Bakersfield and Fresno on top for soot pollution.\n\nL.A.'s garment industry has shifted from clothing to protective gear. What's not changing is the sub-minimum-wage pay and poor conditions workers have long faced.\n\nThe state Department of Public Health releases guidelines for how to prioritize patients in the event an outbreak overwhelms hospitals. See the full report here.\n\nA \"Reopen California Freedom Rally\" is scheduled for Thursday in Victorville. The Facebook group organizing it calls for the state to open the economy by late April to help save small businesses.\n\nIn Santa Barbara County, Latinos have a disproportionately higher number of cases compared to their percentage of the population.\n\nDip your toes in the sand but don't stay, officials in Ventura County decide in opening up some beaches and parks.\n\nCompanies with thousands of employees, past penalties from government investigations and risks of financial failure even before the coronavirus walloped the economy were among those receiving millions of dollars from a relief fund that Congress created to help small businesses through the crisis, an Associated Press investigation found.\n\nA San Jose software company was among the at-least 75 publicly traded companies set to receive a combined $300 million in low-interest, taxpayer-backed loans.\n\nOn the bright side, the Senate on Tuesday approved a bill that includes $320 billion more in loans to small businesses.\n\nSeveral communities, including La Quinta, are creating small business assistance programs of their own.\n\nIn lieu of wading through bulky, inept technology and coursework they struggle to fit in between jobs, some families call it quits, weeks before the academic year ends.\n\nSome restaurants work to stay open despite risks, knowing that if they close, there may be no re-opening.\n\n\"COVID toes\" join the list of symptoms some coronavirus patients exhibit, even if it's their only symptom.\n\nGov. Gavin Newsom on Tuesday announced a new volunteer initiative and a website that aims to connect residents looking to give back with opportunities in their communities and across the state.\n\nThe new website, californiavolunteers.ca.gov, offers visitors options, including working at food banks, donating blood, delivering meals or joining the California Health Corps.\n\nNewsom said anyone interested in helping out will be matched based on their expressed interests, with local needs. \"Rather than you initiating your interest, we want to make sure we engage with you,\" he said, adding that organizers would continue two-way conversations with potential volunteers and connect weekly through email.\n\n\"From our zoomers to our boomers,\" he said, \"we want you to volunteer.\"\n\nWere we all Netlflix: Company adds nearly 16 million subscribers in Q1.\n\nA sky show for free happens Tuesday into Wednesday, during peak time for the Lyrid meteor shower.\n\nSpotify launches 17 new curated playlists to help you find your next favorite podcast.\n\nWorthy of a Scooby snack: \"Scoob\" skips theaters and will be available to rent starting May 15.\n\nOn Wednesday, Earth Day celebrates 50 years of honoring Mother Nature. The event's origins are in no small part traced to one of the nation's worst oil spills in Santa Barbara.\n\nThat was in 1969 and a year later, Earth Day was held for the first time, the result of a bipartisan effort in Washington, D.C. and President Richard Nixon's executive order that created the Environmental Protection Agency.\n\n1970 was also the founding year for the California State Parks Foundation, which works to promote and protect our 280 state parks. I spoke via email with Holly Martinez, the nonprofit's director of programs and advocacy, about ways to celebrate while at home, how to explore safely when you're out and when parks may reopen.\n\nQ: How would California State Parks Foundation have been celebrating Earth Day had this been a normal year? It's a big one.\n\nA: Earth Day usually represents an opportunity to bring our communities together to give back to the parks and open spaces that we depend on throughout the year. Depending on the park, this can entail working together to remove invasive plants, teaching the next generation about the importance of conservation in their backyard and the impact of climate change, or simply being together outdoors...\n\nAcross our Earth Day events, we've brought nearly 90,000 volunteers together to provide nearly 355,000 hours of crucial park maintenance tasks that total about $7.3 million in park improvements.\n\nQ: So many people think of Earth Day as a way to go out and celebrate by helping the planet. We can't do that this year. What can we do at home - specifically, inside?\n\nA: While we're doing our part to help flatten the curve by staying inside, we can all focus on the little things that we can do to bring the outdoors home - like having an indoor picnic! We are encouraging everyone to act as stewards of our environment in the face of climate change - create a compost bin, avoiding the battle for paper products at the store and repurpose old clothes for cleaning. Check out Bring the Outdoors Home ideas on our website here as well as our blog How to Celebrate Earth Day Amid COVID-19.\n\nWe will also be engaging Californians online with their local state parks through a digital celebration on our Instagram and Twitter.\n\n...In our neighborhoods?\n\nA: While we're sheltering in place, celebrate today by going for a walk in your neighborhood! Earth day really reminds us that our parks are special pockets of the planet where we can find spectacular natural beauty, spaces to learn and innumerable mental and physical health benefits - a reality that Californians sheltering at home are more aware of now than ever ... identify plants and wildlife in your own community that you may not have noticed right outside your doorstep and experience a slice of the health benefits the outdoors provide.\n\nThe 1969 Santa Barbara oil spill: An environmental 'shot heard around the world'\n\nQ: For our littlest planet helpers, do you have a suggestion for fun crafts to do, with things they may already have?\n\nA: Take a nature journal on your neighborhood walk and draw pictures of the plants and animals you see and try and identify them when you get home. There are some amazing apps that can help kids with identification like \"PictureThis\" and \"Seek by iNaturalist.\" Many state parks are also offering virtual tours and live experience on state parks as learning experiences through the PORTS program which you can find on our website featuring education resources and tools.\n\nRelated: Here are 5 national parks to go explore virtually.\n\nQ: In Ventura County and other places, some parks, trails and beaches are starting to open. How do you suggest people visit those places safely?\n\nA: For obvious reasons, our current reality has many of us yearning for blue skies, green grass and sand between our toes. Unfortunately, those seeking respite outdoors often failed to heed the basics of what the stay at home orders are meant to accomplish - social distance.\n\nAs parks begin to reopen we're urging people to follow some common-sense guidelines: remain local, adhere to closures and signage, wash your hands and bring hand sanitizer, observe social distancing of at least 6 feet at all times and stay home if you are experiencing symptoms of COVID-19.\n\nQ: I've seen images of incredible wildlife at some places enjoying having lots of space to themselves, including at Yosemite. Are you seeing anything like that at California's state parks?\n\nA: Yes, of course. These images show that we are really just so fortunate to share these spaces with such incredible wildlife, and I can speak for myself that I'm looking forward to co-existing with these animals once our parks reopen - even the bears! We feature a photo contest on our Instagram account to experience the nature and beauty of state parks.\n\nQ: I can imagine there are ecological benefits for the parks while they're closed. What are some of those, if that's the case?\n\nA: We are lucky to be gifted such beautiful public lands in California and while a temporary reprieve from visitors may have short-term ecological impacts, we're also seeing some long-term consequences. Closures and visitor limitations are significantly impacting revenue sources for these green sanctuaries - revenue that goes to not only keeping parks open but also to habitat restoration, trail improvements and restoring natural ecosystems. Volunteer events have also been put on hold during this time, and our volunteers are incredible champions that protect and preserve these incredible resources.\n\nQ: And now, the question always on people's minds, when will full access to state parks be restored?\n\nA: Decisions around closures and reopening are being made using all the scientific facts available and with the end goal of keeping every Californian safe during this crisis. This means, that full access to state parks will be restored when the safety of every visitor is ensured.\n\nGreen spaces have clearly proven to be a place of reprieve while we all shelter in place and we hope everyone from home joins us tomorrow in celebrating our earth and these spaces we've been gifted.

A few are still at port awaiting debarkation of passengers,\" Bari Golin-Blaugrund, senior director of strategic communications for Cruise Lines International Association, told USA TODAY on Wednesday.\n\nIn a statement, Costa Cruises said told USA TODAY that 34 crew members on board the docked ship Costa Atlantica have tested positive for coronavirus.\n\nThe Italian-flagged Costa Atlantica has been docked in Nagasaki, Japan, for repairs and maintenance by Mitsubishi Heavy Industry since Jan. 29. No passengers have been on board during the repair work.\n\nThere are 632 people on board of 33 nationalities, according to the cruise line.\n\n\"We have already upgraded the precautionary and containment measures including, but not limited to, quarantine on board, following the instructions from the Japanese government and the relevant health authorities,\" Costa Cruises said in the statement.\n\nThe outbreak surfaced Tuesday when the first crew member, identified only as a foreign national, tested positive for the virus.\n\nNone of those infected had serious symptoms, and all are isolated in single rooms on the ship, officials said.\n\nMitsubishi officials said no crew members had left the ship since mid-March. Before then, crew members had been allowed to come and go from ship to shore if they passed temperature checks and had not traveled recently to high-risk countries such as China and Italy.\n\n\"We have been constantly monitoring the health of our colleagues on board during the ships' stay in Japan,\" the cruise line said.\n\n'Inherently high-risk setting': Are cruise ships unsafe - and will they change?\n\nNagasaki officials are investigating how and where the crew members contracted the virus.\n\nThe outbreak on the ship adds to concerns about testing and hospital capacity in Nagasaki, where only 102 beds are available.\n\nAll of Japan is under a coronavirus state of emergency as cases rise. Japan has about 11,500 cases of infection, with 280 deaths. Those numbers are separate from an earlier outbreak on another cruise ship, carrying more than 3,700 passengers and crew, where 712 people were infected.\n\nAnother Costa ship docked Wednesday, in Genoa, after wind conditions prevented a scheduled entrance into port on Tuesday evening, spokesman Roger Frizzell told USA TODAY.\n\nIt is the final Carnival Corp. ship with guests still on board to return to port.\n\n\"Following the onboard inspections, carried out by the local health authorities, disembarking operations for the return home of the 1,519 guests on board the ship have begun,\" Costa Cruises said Wednesday. \"Transportation to the various destinations of origin have been organized by the company directly from the Maritime Station in Genoa.\"march\n\nPassenger disembarkation will take place over the next several days.\n\nCosta Deliziosa departed on a four-month-long \"Around the World\" cruise on Jan. 5, before the World Health Organization declared coronavirus a global health emergency on Jan. 30 and long before the agency upgraded the virus to a pandemic on March 11. Since then, the ship has only stopped for fuel and supplies. The ship was originally scheduled to disembark on April 26 in Venice.\n\nThree months in: A timeline of how COVID-19 has unfolded in the US\n\nAs of Wednesday, Costa Cruises maintained there were no cases of COVID-19, Frizzell said.\n\n\"The health situation on board, where in addition to guests, there are also 898 crew members, does not present any public health concern and no registered cases of COVID-19,\" the line said in the statement.\n\nA 75-year-old Italian passenger died on board due to a heart attack on April 6.\n\n\"The company while presenting its heartfelt condolences to the guest's relatives, is taking steps to provide the necessary assistance to them,\" Costa said in the statement. \"The disembarkation and translation of the body for reunification with his loved ones will take place from Genoa, the final destination of the cruise, following the instructions of the relevant authorities.\"\n\nOn Tuesday, all remaining passengers on Princess Cruises' Pacific Princess disembarked, said Negin Kamali, a spokesperson for Princess Cruises.\n\nPacific Princess returned to Los Angeles on Monday with 119 passengers who remained after most were disembarked in Fremantle, Australia, on March 21.

    "COVID-19: Which countries have no coronavirus cases?": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "While countries including the United States struggle with the growing number of coronavirus cases, others have slowed them or haven't reported a single one since the virus was first discovered in December 2019.\n\nNew Zealand recorded its first day with no new coronavirus cases Monday, according to the country's Ministry of Health. As of Wednesday, the country has 1,488 confirmed and probable cases and 21 deaths.\n\nMeanwhile, the World Health Organization confirmed to USA TODAY that some countries haven't reported any cases of COVID-19 including Comoros, Lesotho, Turkmenistan, North Korea, Kiribati, Marshall Islands, Federated States of Micronesia, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga, Tuvalu, Vanuatu, Cook Islands, Nauru, Niue and Palau.\n\nAre these countries impervious to the coronavirus?\n\nThe majority of nations that haven't reported any cases of the coronavirus are isolated island chains in the Pacific.\n\nDr. Thomas Tsai, assistant professor of health policy at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, said these islands were mostly spared of the coronavirus because countries in Asia were quickly locked down preventing travel and tourism.\n\nHowever, this isn't the case for North Korea, Turkmenistan and Lesotho, which all share borders with countries that have reported coronavirus cases.\n\nDespite its 880-mile border with China, North Korea still claims to have had zero infections. China is North Korea's biggest trading partner, accounting for as much as 95% of the country's reported imports, according to 38 North, a website that tracks the country's developments.\n\n\"It's a near impossibility for them not have cases,\" said Jung H. Pak, a former CIA analyst and North Korea expert with the Brookings Institution, a Washington think tank.\n\nPak and other experts say there's evidence of at least a small-scale COVID-19 outbreak in North Korea, a country where much of the population is already in poor health, the economy is crippled and the health system is abysmal.\n\nThe true picture of how widespread COVID-19 is inside North Korea will probably never be clear. North Korea is one of the world's most secretive, repressive and authoritarian countries in the world, and the regime's propaganda machine controls the flow of information.\n\nTurkmenistan leader Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedow vehemently insists that the country has miraculously avoided the coronavirus, while its neighbor Iran has confirmed over 100,000 cases as of Wednesday, according to the Johns Hopkins website.\n\nDr. Robert Saunders, professor of international relations at Farmingdale State College (SUNY), said one of the reasons why the country has no confirmed cases may be due to lack of testing.\n\n\"Willful ignorance can be framed as victory,\" he said.\n\n'Bad economies are as hurtful to health as viruses': US lurches toward reopening despite ominous coronavirus models\n\n'All night, my eyes are open':: After mass job losses, Americans forced to choose: Pay bills or buy food?\n\nUnited Nations Resident Coordinator Elena Panova told the BBC Turkmenistan is testing everyone who arrives to the country exhibiting symptoms, relying strictly on official information.\n\nHowever, experts agree that official information from Turkmenistan is notoriously unreliable. Saunders believes there are definitely coronavirus cases in the country and said the government could be working hard to suppress those test results by controlling social media and manipulating death certificates.\n\nPanova also told the BBC Turkmen authorities are working with UN agencies to plan for a possible outbreak, closing most of its land border crossings and cancelling flights.\n\nDespite these measures, daily life in Turkmenistan appears as normal. In mid-April, hundreds of soccer fans crowded a stadium in the capital, Ashgabat, to watch its domestic teams play.\n\nJ. Stephen Morrison, who directs global work at the Center for Strategic and International Studies as the think tank's senior vice president, said there are a couple of reasons why Lesotho could be successful in managing their case counts.\n\nHe said the mountainous country is mostly remote and difficult to access, making social distancing easier than other more populated countries. South Africa, which surrounds Lesotho, imposed a strict lockdown early in the pandemic, which kept its numbers low and may have inadvertently benefited its neighbor.\n\nLesotho, like many other African countries, also has experience managing pandemics. Methods such as social isolation and contact tracing are well established in parts of southern and eastern Africa.\n\n\"There's something to be said for having those durable and resilient infrastructures and having had that political experience of going through an epidemic where at its peak 20 years ago was threatening to destabilize these societies,\" Morrison said.\n\nWhile all this may be true, he still believes there may be some unaccounted cases in the country.\n\nAlthough Lesotho closed its borders March 10, Morrison said Lesotho's economy is very dependent on South Africa and the history of migration between the two countries puts into question the lockdown's effectiveness.\n\nLesotho is also in the midst of political turmoil as prime minister, Thomas Thabane, is charged with murdering his estranged wife who was assassinated in 2017. According to Deutsche Welle, Thabane struggles to hold onto power deploying the country's army while citizens demand his immediate resignation.\n\nMorrison said this may have distracted the government from focusing on managing the pandemic.\n\n\"Lesotho is a country that has been prone to instability,\" he said. \"That sort of instability doesn't speak well to control over a virus.\"\n\nAmerica's Food Chain: 'Essential worker just means you're on the death track'\n\n'Dangerous dynamic': Coronavirus threatens new 'Cold War' between US and China\n\nWhile experts question if any of these countries are truly free of the coronavirus, Morrison said what's more important is to make sure they're prepared in case its residents do come in contact with the virus.\n\n\"They all have to play the long game,\" he said. \"They may be successful up to a point for now but their population doesn't have immunity from this.\"\n\nHe argues the international health community must ensure these countries have sufficient testing, PPE and the hospital capacity to successfully manage the pandemic if it somehow appears. Morrison said trade, migration and travel will certainly reintroduce the virus when the world begins to reopen its borders.\n\n\"If they want to preserve their low rates, remain relatively or largely free [of the virus], ultimately they have to create the capacity to detect, respond and control,\" he concluded.",

It is treatable, and Nance has been able to play basketball without symptoms for the most part. But he is concerned that his therapy that suppresses his immune system might leave him more vulnerable to the COVID-19 virus.\n\n\"I would hope there would be an understanding (from the league) if someone didn't feel comfortable coming back that you'd get a pass,\" Nance told ESPN. \"Just because you may look like the picture of health, some people have issues you can't see.\"\n\nNance, 27, has returned to the team's facilities for individual workouts, one of about seven Cavaliers players to do so over the past couple of weeks. Though he hopes to be able to play should the league resume, he is being extra vigilant.\n\n\"I'm paying super close attention to everything that is going on,\" he said. \"I was watching the German soccer league over the weekend and seeing how the players were interacting with each other and still seeing them make a lot of contact.

        "authors": [],
        "body": "DENVER -- A Colorado restaurant that opened for full service on Mother's Day in defiance of state rules banning sit-down dining was ordered to close Monday and had its license suspended indefinitely by health officials.\n\nA video posted by Colorado Community Media showed people sitting at tables and waiting close together in line at the counter of C&C Breakfast and Korean Kitchen while others lined up outside.\n\nExcept for one person wearing a mask, the scene at the eatery in Castle Rock about 30 miles south of Denver appeared similar to a busy day at many restaurants before the government allowed only takeout service due to the coronavirus.\n\nGov. Jared Polis said the restaurant was \"causing an immediate health hazard,\" and its business license will remain suspended until it is no longer a threat.\n\n\"We're walking a tightrope between protecting all of our health and of course trying to grow our economy,\" he said. \"It's hard enough to walk without folks shaking the rope because of their own ideological or anti-scientific views, which they choose over the lives of our brothers and sisters.\"\n\nPoll: 42% percent of Americans 'very concerned' someone in family could get seriously ill\n\nThe Tri-County Health Department said if the owners refuse to comply, further legal action would be taken that could include the revocation of its license.\n\n\"It is not fair to the rest of the community and other business owners that are following Safer at Home and doing their part,\" the department's executive director, John M. Douglas, Jr., said in a statement.\n\nIn a tweet to President Donald Trump, the restaurant's owners said they were standing up for America, small businesses and the Constitution, and against Polis' overreach in response to the outbreak.\n\nThe owners, Jesse and April Arellano, could not be reached for comment by telephone on Monday. After laying off most of their staff during the outbreak, Jesse Arellano told KCNC-TV on Sunday that they wanted to get the attention of lawmakers. He acknowledged they could face sanctions for their actions but said they wanted to know how much support they had.\n\n\"We figured if we're going to crash, we're going to go down and see how many people stand with us,\" Jesse Arellano told the station.\n\nRestaurants in Colorado are not allowed to offer sit-down service under Polis' latest order, but the state has allowed eateries in western Colorado's Mesa County to open tables to customers -- though only at 30% capacity -- because of its low number of cases.\n\nMesa County has not had any coronavirus deaths. Douglas County, where the Castle Rock restaurant is located, is a wealthy county that is a mix of suburban and rural areas. It has had 28 deaths due to the virus, about 3% of the statewide count.\n\nFor most people, the coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia and death. The vast majority of people recover.",

        "body": "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has always warned that \"it may be possible\" to become infected with coronavirus by touching contaminated surfaces or objects.\n\nIt just \"does not spread easily\" in that manner, the agency now says, nor by animal-to-human contact, or vice versa.\n\n\"COVID-19 is a new disease and we are still learning about how it spreads,\" the CDC's recently updated guidelines say. \"It may be possible for COVID-19 to spread in other ways, but these are not thought to be the main ways the virus spreads.\"\n\nDr. John Whyte, chief medical officer for the health care website WebMD, told Fox News that the CDC's slight update brings clarity and helps to reduce fears.\n\n\"Many people were concerned that by simply touching an object they may get coronavirus, and that's simply not the case. Even when a virus may stay on a surface, it doesn't mean that it's actually infectious,\" Whyte was quoted.\n\nFor hours, even days: How long does the coronavirus live on surfaces?\n\n\"I think this new guideline helps people understand more about what does and doesn't increase risk. It doesn't mean we stop washing hands and disinfecting surfaces. But it does allow us to be practical and realistic as we try to return to a sense of normalcy.\"\n\nThe CDC still warns that the main way the virus is spread is through person-to-person contact, even among those who are not showing any symptoms.\n\nThe main way to prevent infection, the CDC says, is by practicing social distancing and staying at least 6 feet away from others, washing your hands with soap and water, and cleaning and disinfecting frequently touched areas.\n\nA recent study in the New England Journal of Medicine shows that coronavirus can live on some surfaces for up to three days and up to three hours in the air.\n\nIt can live up to four hours on copper, up to 24 hours on cardboard and up to 2-3 days on plastic and stainless steel, according to the study.\n\nThe CDC, however, has said that catching the coronavirus from boxes delivered by Amazon or on your takeout food bag is highly unlikely \"because of poor survivability of these coronaviruses on surfaces.\"",

        "authors": [],
        "body": "Though they had the state government's backing to reopen congregations to in-person services, many Georgia churches on Sunday ignored Gov. Brian Kemp's measure and remained closed as coronavirus fears persist.\n\nKemp announced on April 20 that churches could open their doors for in-person services if \"done in accordance with strict social distancing protocols\" but later added that \"of course, online, call-in, or drive-in services remain good options.\"\n\nThe announcement was part of a rollout of an easing of restrictions in Georgia's stay-at-home order that is set to lift May 1.\n\nYet, despite the go-ahead to resume service, most churches remained relegated to video streaming or drive-in services such as Cornerstone Church in Athens.\n\nCoronavirus live updates: Get the latest information on the outbreak in the United States\n\nSix new symptoms: CDC adds list of new possible coronavirus symptoms to watch for\n\nAt least one church appeared to hold in-person services.\n\nThe Redeeming Love Church of God the Bibleway in Statesboro held two services Sunday, according to its Facebook page. Both were livestreamed and each appeared to have at least 20 parishioners in attendance.\n\nThis was the same church whose members recorded video on April 10 of Georgia State Police ordering a service to be broken up. After the incident, church leaders vowed they would continue to ignore the state's stay-at-home order. In-person services were held the last several weeks, the church's Facebook page indicated.\n\nIn Louisiana, a similar defiance of stay-at-home orders resulted in pastor Tony Spell of Life Tabernacle Church in Central being placed under house arrest, according to NBC.\n\nMayor Bob Smith of Watkinsville issued a press release Sunday in which he expressed support for the Georgia governor's measures.\n\n\"I encourage you to get outdoors and exercise,\" Smith said in the release. \"Go to work. Earn a living. Assemble to worship. And be grateful for every day we have.\"\n\nThe Catholic Dioceses in Georgia said Thursday in a statement that it is \"not authorizing the return to congregating at churches or making our churches available for devotions\" through May.\n\nMany priests and parishioners may fall into a high-risk category for the virus, the dioceses said, and if social distancing guidelines change significantly they will \"reexamine\" the possibility of congregating.\n\nThe North Georgia Conference of the United Methodist Church said in a statement April 20 that it was advising churches not to gather through May 13 \"as we do our best to do no harm.\"\n\nBishop Reginald T. Jackson, Presiding Prelate of the Sixth Episcopal District of the African Methodist Episcopal (AME) Church, issued a directive to more than 520 churches Tuesday prohibiting gatherings for services on Sunday, calling Kemp's decision \"unacceptable.\"\n\nThe Baptist Ministries Conference of Augusta held a joint press conference Friday, alongside Mayor Hardie Davis Jr., in which president Anthony Booker, pastor Charles Goodman Jr. and pastor Karlton Howard urged residents to heed warnings from medical experts and stay home.\n\n\"I'd rather preach over you living, than preach over you dead,\" Booker said.\n\nIn his April 20 announcement, Kemp also allowed gyms, fitness centers, bowling alleys, body art studios, barbers, cosmetologists, hair designers, nail care artists, aestheticians, their respective schools and massage therapists to reopen Friday. The measure requires those businesses to observe \"minimum basic operations\" that include employee screening, social distancing and wearing of masks.\n\nIt's not only religious leaders in the state who are pushing back against Kemp's measure.\n\nSavannah Mayor Van Johnson asked more than 70 religious leaders in the city to keep their worship centers closed in a video conference call held Friday. None of the leaders said they would reopen. Johnson told the religious leaders he understood the financial burden of the religious institutions being closed but said, \"we can reach God without going through a building.\"\n\nAtlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms expanded that message beyond houses of worship. She regularly posts the latest confirmed case numbers and death total in the state on her verified Twitter account and, on Friday, she posted a message alongside an image of the day's statistics.\n\n\"The numbers speak for themselves,\" she wrote. \"PLEASE STAY HOME.\"",

    "Coronavirus and swimming pools: What the CDC wants you to know": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "Looking forward to hitting the local public swimming pool for the first time this summer? Prepare to put a face mask in your tote bag, although you won't need to wear it in the water.\n\nOn Wednesday, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention published new guidelines for operating swimming pools during the coronavirus pandemic. The documentation arrives just a few days before Memorial Day weekend, when many outdoor pools typically open for the summer season.\n\n\"There is no evidence that the virus that causes COVID-19 can be spread to people through the water in pools, hot tubs, spas, or water play areas,\" the CDC said on its website. \"Proper operation and maintenance (including disinfection with chlorine and bromine) of these facilities should inactivate the virus in the water.\"\n\nNevertheless, the agency said, \"While there is ongoing community spread of the virus that causes COVID-19, it is important for individuals as well as owners and operators of these facilities to take steps to ensure health and safety.\"\n\nThe CDC tailored the following instructions toward pools operated by local governments, apartment complexes, homeowners associations, schools, water parks and gyms. The guidelines do not specifically apply to private pools or those operated by hotels, cruise lines and other travel-related businesses.\n\nAmong the CDC's suggestions:\n\nThe CDC suggested that pool operators \"encourage the use of cloth face coverings as feasible,\" noting that they are \"most essential in times when physical distancing is difficult. However, it advised that staff tell swimmers not to wear masks in the water because it is difficult to breathe through them while wet.\n\nIt also suggested that pool operators change the layout of their seating areas so that patrons can remain six feet away from anyone outside their household.\n\nWhile in the water, swimmers should also be advised to keep the same distance from anyone they are not quarantining with.\n\nThe CDC did not address how to socially distance lap swimmers but pool operators could take a page from the guidelines published by USA Swimming, the sport's national governing body, which suggested limiting swimmers to one or two per lane and starting them from opposite ends of the pool.\n\nParents should consider whether their children can or will stay six feet away from people they don't live with. If not, they should not take them to the pool.\n\nThe only exceptions to the social-distancing rule, the CDC said, should be individuals involved with the evacuation of the facility in the event of an emergency or the rescue or administration of first aid or CPR to a swimmer in distress.\n\nThe CDC instructed pool operators to encourage all staff and patrons to wash their hands and cover coughs and sneezes. And while the CDC didn't suggest instructing patrons to take a shower before entering the pool, it is likely that pools that already had that rule will actively enforce it this summer.\n\nIt's possible that some pools may go the opposite route, keeping their showers or locker rooms off-limits for the time being and telling patrons to shower at home and wear their swimsuits under their clothes when they arrive and leave. That's what USA Swimming has recommended athletes do for now.\n\nThe guidelines also encouraged pool staffs to regularly disinfect frequently touched surfaces on the pool deck and in the locker room, including:\n\nFor pool facilities that provide towels to patrons, the CDC advised washing in the warmest appropriate water temperature and allowing them to dry completely. It also suggested devising a system so that furniture, pool equipment and other items are disinfected before being given to the next user and are kept separate from ones that have not yet been cleaned.\n\nThe CDC also recommended no-touch trash cans.\n\nThe sharing of pool equipment that touches the face and is difficult to disinfect - such as goggles and snorkels - should be discouraged, even among patrons from the same household. Any other gear should not be shared with people from outside your home.\n\nThe CDC recommended that pool staff use the public address system and the facility's social media accounts to regularly broadcast announcements on how to stop the spread of the virus.\n\nThe onus to enforce these guidelines will largely be on the lifeguards and on-deck staff and their managers. The CDC advised pool managers to arrange duty schedules so that staff who are not actively guarding be assigned to monitor the use of face coverings, handwashing and social distancing practices.\n\n'Hygiene is the new luxury': How cruise ship design could evolve to ward against outbreaks\n\nPublic pool operators should have a plan to isolate staff or patrons with symptoms, such as cough, shortness of breath and fever, and transport them to their homes or health care provider, if needed.\n\nAt least one person should be designated as the COVID-19 point of contact. That person should respond to all virus-related concerns and all staff should know how to reach that person.\n\nThe local health authorities should also immediately be notified of any COVID-19 cases and staff and patrons should be notified of potential exposure within the boundaries of the Americans With Disabilities Act.\n\nAny employee or patron who has tested positive for COVID-19, displays symptoms or has been around anyone with the disease in the last two weeks should not enter the facility until they have safely ended their 14-day isolation.\n\nWeighing whether to travel this summer?

    "Coronavirus antibody testing doesn't yet provide answers on immunity": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "Medical experts have some advice for Americans thinking about getting coronavirus antibody tests: Don't -- at least not until the questionable ones have been weeded out and scientists know whether people who have survived COVID-19 are immune from the virus.\n\nUntil then, some scientists say manufacturers should stop advertising the antibody tests, for as little as $25, that many Americans are using to decide if they can safely stop social distancing or return to work.\n\nNikole Carlson Hartzell said she felt invincible after an antibody test for COVID-19 at an urgent care center in Brighton, Michigan, reported what she said was \"no active infection, no prior infection and no evidence of immunity.\"\n\n\"Knowing I wasn't infected, I immediately visited my niece and hugged my sister,\" said Hartzell, who reasoned she could not transmit the coronavirus at that moment. \"The novelty of it quickly wore off, as once I was home and saw my husband, I was no longer superhuman and could not guarantee anything anymore.\"\n\nExperts say people should be careful about how they interpret and act on results of COVID-19 antibody tests that haven't been validated by government regulators.\n\nAntibody tests \"may give people a false sense of security,\" said Kamran Kadkhoda, medical director of immunopathology at the Cleveland Clinic in Ohio. Test manufacturers \"should stop offering them until we know more.\"\n\nDuring the past few months, many people with symptoms of COVID-19 were told to stay home and not use up the scarce diagnostic tests that could confirm they were infected with the coronavirus. There was little doctors could do, whether someone had a diagnosis or not.\n\nNow that another type of exam -- antibody tests -- is more readily available, thousands are lining up at urgent care clinics, workplaces or even drive-through sites. Some hope at a minimum to satisfy their curiosity about that fever or dry cough months ago.\n\nIn late January, Bob Nadeau got a case of the flu like he'd never had before. His chest was heavy, like there was a weight on it. He couldn't taste or smell normally.\n\n\"Coffee tasted terrible, and I love coffee in the morning,\" said the Naples, Florida, resident. \"And I love to have a beer, you know, at beer-thirty. Beer tasted terrible.\"\n\nA flu test came up negative. Now he hopes to confirm his suspicions with a COVID-19 antibody test.\n\nAntibody tests that have been properly constructed and validated are useful. They can identify blood donors for coronavirus research and help scientists determine how widely the virus has spread in a particular community or population, according to the Infectious Disease Society of America.\n\nThey could even aid the global quest for a vaccine by helping researchers understand which antibodies, if any, provide immunity, the organization said.\n\nHowever, manufacturers have flooded the U.S. market with antibody tests that vary widely in accuracy. Even if the tests are accurate, scientists don't know how long antibodies will last or what level someone needs to be immune.\n\n\"At this point we have to assume that they could be at risk of re-infection,\" said Dr. Mary Hayden, chief of the Rush University Medical Center Division of Infectious Diseases, during a recent online conference about antibody testing.\n\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration made this rush to market possible by allowing COVID-19 antibody test manufacturers to self-validate their products without first submitting the data to regulators.\n\nAmid criticism of that policy, the FDA changed course Monday. Citing unnamed \"unscrupulous actors\" marketing fraudulent tests, the agency said manufacturers must meet new accuracy standards and submit proof of testing quality.\n\nAt that point, the FDA had given emergency use approval to 12 out of more than 200 antibody test manufacturers. The FDA is working with other government offices to assess the performance of antibody tests. Results have not yet been made public.\n\nPartly filling the information void, a few independent and government organizations have analyzed some of the COVID-19 antibody tests. One group, partly funded by the Chan Zuckerberg Biohub, reported the tests did not always work as advertised. The Geneva, Switzerland-based Foundation for Innovative New Diagnostics also found that some tests performed poorly.\n\nMotivations behind antibody testing vary.\n\n\"Let's put America back to work,\" says the website for one test manufacturer, Abacus Pharma International. The website of Abbott Labs, a U.S. testing giant, says its antibody test \"could be a critical next step in battling this virus.\"\n\nHealthLabs.com, a lab that uses tests from Quest, LabCorp and other laboratories, offers COVID-19 antibody tests at 4,500 sites nationwide. Fiyyaz Pirani, the company's founder and CEO, said the test primarily satisfies people's curiosity about whether they have been infected.\n\nQuest Diagnostics, another lab testing giant, offers COVID-19 antibody tests online. To qualify, you must be symptom-free for at least 10 days. A USA TODAY reporter who took the test got the result -- negative -- within a day.\n\nHartzell received her test results faster, and for just $25.\n\nShe was partly motivated by curiosity. For 12 days in January, she had been immobilized with a fever, sore throat and chills. Tests for flu and strep throat came back negative.\n\nSince then, she'd wondered: Did I have COVID-19? If so, she figured, she could continue to help her sister and 16-month-old niece without the risk of getting them sick.\n\nSo Hartzell drove an hour to an urgent care antibody testing site outside Detroit. She almost missed out because the clinic was booked solid. Luckily, some people didn't show up.\n\n\"I waited about 25 minutes in my car, came inside to a sparse waiting room with only two available chairs, and was soon taken to a room,\" said Hartzell, who documented the moment with a selfie. \"The test was very simple, a prick of the finger, and a few squeezes because quite a few drops of blood are required.\"\n\nRoughly seven minutes later, she got the results and went straight to see her sister and niece.\n\nHartzell said she normally would have looked for more information about the antibody test and its manufacturer. But not this time.\n\n\"Had any results come back positive, I'd have checked into it more,\" she said. \"And had the test cost more than $25, I'd have thought more about it.\"\n\nWhen told by a USA TODAY reporter that the manufacturer of her test had not yet received FDA emergency use authorization, Hartzell said she was \"bummed.\"\n\nNow she's back to self-quarantining for two weeks before visiting her sister and niece.\n\nThe test Hartzell got isn't the one many experts say we need most.\n\nThough tests to detect an active coronavirus infection are more available than just a short time ago, it still can be difficult for Americans to get one. Governors and health leaders continue to complain about shortages, particularly the swabs and chemical reagents required to run the tests.\n\n\"We desperately need highly specific and sensitive tests\" that confirm whether patients with COVID-19 symptoms have the coronavirus, said Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota. \"That's the test we really need. But that's the test we don't have enough reagents for.\"\n\nAntibody tests, also called serology tests, detect whether someone has developed antibodies to fight off SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus behind the COVID-19 disease. Those antibodies generally can't be detected until two weeks after infection. Antibody tests use blood samples, unlike the molecular tests that typically require long swabs to collect samples of mucus from the nose and throat.\n\nAnd then there are the questions about the accuracy of these tests.\n\nLike some other medical tests, the quality of a coronavirus antibody test is measured in two ways. Sensitivity is the test's ability to detect antibodies for the disease when they're actually there. An error in sensitivity could produce a false negative, indicating the absence of these antibodies when they exist.\n\nSpecificity represents a test's ability to identify people who were not infected with the coronavirus and did not produce antibodies to the disease. An error in specificity could produce a false positive, indicating the presence of antibodies that aren't actually there.\n\nA false positive could result from a test that detects antibodies to other coronaviruses in a blood sample, not the one that causes COVID-19.\n\nA test with a specificity rate of 95% might seem great, but it's not, said Dr. Geoffrey Baird, the interim chair of laboratory medicine at the University of Washington School of Medicine in Seattle.\n\nConsider a situation in which 3 percent of people are infected. If a test with a 95% specificity were used to test 1,000 people, it would identify the 30 people who actually had been infected and developed antibodies, Baird said. But it would also identify roughly 50 false positives.\n\nFalse positives are of particular concern because they could lead people to believe they were immune to the coronavirus when they don't actually have antibodies for it.\n\nChai Bunyagidj is the president and chief executive officer of Alfa Scientific Design, the San Diego company that manufactured the antibody test used to check Hartzell. He said his test is among the few developed and manufactured in the U.S.\n\nLab studies show the test has a 97.8% sensitivity and 94.7% specificity, Bunyagidj said.\n\nAfter two months in lockdown, many people hope they had COVID-19 and didn't realize it at the time, which they think might free them from being so careful.\n\nAlan Green, an 83-year-old resident of Naples, Florida, took a cruise through the Panama Canal in March, ending in San Diego.\n\n\"I would expect I might have come in contact with a number of people who may have been exposed\" to the virus, Green said through a face mask bright with red, white and blue stars.\n\nHe hasn't had any flu-like symptoms, but several health conditions put him at increased risk if he gets the virus.\n\nGreen figured he had at least a 50-50 chance of testing positive for coronavirus antibodies, which is why he showed up at a local Quest Diagnostics lab last week. If he tested positive, he hoped to return to a more normal routine: seeing his girlfriend and perhaps eating at restaurants with outdoor tables and distance between customers.\n\nHis dreams have been deferred. He tested negative.\n\nEmployees of Snap Logistics, a Milwaukee trucking company, were anxious about contracting the coronavirus because they regularly interact with other people on the job.\n\nSo Nate Rupp, the company's owner, paid $3,000 for about 30 employees and contractors to get antibody tests at work. ARCpoint Labs, a drug testing company with a location near Milwaukee, came out to perform the 15-minute, rapid-result finger-prick tests.\n\nARCpoint advertises that the tests are a key tool in \"your staff's return to work or safe interaction with others.\" However, the company acknowledges on its website that the exam has not been reviewed by the FDA and should not be used \"as the sole basis to diagnose or exclude\" an infection.\n\nIn April, a U.S. House oversight subcommittee sent ARCpoint a letter raising concerns about the tests. The letter said the company's protocol for interpreting test results appeared to overstate current scientific knowledge by encouraging test-takers with one type of antibody to disregard social distancing procedures.\n\nThe company's CEO said ARCpoint wrote back, addressing the concerns and saying the tests complied with FDA regulations -- which until Monday simply required antibody test manufacturers to validate the tests on their own.\n\nNone of Rupp's drivers or employees tested positive for the coronavirus antibodies. \"I'm not sure what we would have done if we had positive tests,\" Rupp said. \"I think it calmed them down a bit.\"\n\nBut he's mindful of the limitations of the tests. \"I did it for peace of mind, with the understanding we'll still need to keep social distancing and wearing (personal protection equipment) and of course washing hands.\"\n\nMore than 100 employees for the Oneida County Sheriff's Office in northern Wisconsin took ARCpoint antibody tests last week. Capt. Tyler Young said the agency paid for the tests fully aware they're imperfect.\n\nYoung said the department had planned to ask for volunteers to work in the county jail if they tested positive because they would have less risk for contracting the coronavirus. But no employees indicated they had.\n\nFor him, the quick test result came with mixed emotions.\n\n\"It's a bit of a relief because it maybe confirms what we've been doing to keep safe is working,\" Young said. \"It's not perfect, but more information is better than nothing.\"\n\nSome healthcare experts aren't as accepting.\n\n\"This is as close to the Wild West as I've ever seen in terms of laboratory tests,\" said Osterholm, the director of the infectious disease research center in Minnesota. \"Even the good tests will likely give results that are virtually meaningless.\"\n\nThe Minnesota-headquartered Mayo Clinic validated eight antibody tests before selecting what it considered to be the two best performers for its own use. Elitza Theel, director of the Mayo Clinic Infectious Diseases Serology Laboratory, said its analysis showed some of the tests weren't as accurate as companies asserted to the FDA.\n\nOne test had a false positive rate of 15%. \"That's pretty poor,\" she said. \"We would be telling 15 people out of 100 that they had had COVID-19 when they didn't.\"\n\nTheel said Mayo Clinic policy doesn't allow her to identify the makers of the tests now. However, she expects to publish a scientific journal article about the assessments soon.\n\nFIND, the Geneva-based nonprofit, is working with several partners, including the World Health Organization, to validate hundreds of COVID-19 antibody tests submitted by manufacturers.\n\nData posted on FIND's website show sensitivity rates of 6% and 4.3%, respectively, for rapid antibody tests made by two manufacturers in China. The data also show a specificity rate of 36.4% for a rapid antibody test made by a different Chinese manufacturer.\n\nTests with rates like that \"are more likely to give you the wrong result,\" said Baird.\n\nFIND's assessments of 40 COVID-19 antibody tests showed specificity rates of close to 100% for several manufacturers' tests. That means virtually no false positives.\n\nCassandra Kelly-Cirino is an infectious disease scientist and director of emerging threats at the nonprofit. She explained why manufacturers' claims often don't hold up in independent testing.\n\nFor one thing, results vary depending on how recently the infection occurred. The tests assessed by FIND are abysmal in detecting antibodies formed in the first few days after someone has been infected with the coronavirus, Kelly-Cirino said.\n\nFor anything less than eight days, the tests \"have very, very poor performance,\" she said.\n\nMoreover, some of the antibodies the body produces to fight COVID-19 dissipate quickly. \"After about the 14-day mark what we're seeing as well is a tail off, where (the tests) don't work as well,\" she said.\n\nAnother problem is that manufacturers often use small samples to validate their tests, Kelly-Cirino said. Abbott and Ortho Diagnostics, whose tests have been authorized for emergency use by the FDA, didn't use any samples from people whose immune systems were compromised, she said.\n\nThe elderly and people with health conditions don't produce as many antibodies, so they're harder to detect, she said. So if test manufacturers \"decided to exclude all patients that are falling in that area that's because it likely would have brought their performance levels down,\" Kelly-Cirino said.\n\nThat's a problem, she added, because those people especially need accurate tests.\n\nTesting perfection wasn't necessarily the top item on Desiree Callahan's agenda when the information technologist drove her GMC Denali up to an antibody testing site in San Diego last week.\n\nCallahan, 55, said she had a flu-like illness in late 2019 and was \"just curious\" to know if she'd had a bout with COVID-19.\n\nMatt Collins, a spokesman for COVID Clinic Inc., the company that arranged the drive-through testing, said the tests \"help us to understand an accurate picture of the virus by telling us how many people have been or are currently affected.\"\n\nHowever, such antibody surveys are typically done by researchers who strive to test a representative sample of the population.\n\nCallahan paid $125 test for her test. She said she wanted to believe the procedure was 100% accurate. \"I'm not uncomfortable. It is what it is,\" she said.\n\nDays later, she learned the test showed she never had COVID-19.\n\n\"Whether I tested positive or negative for the antibodies,\" she said, \"I would still take precautions when in public, as I feel we just do not have enough information surrounding this virus that has so quickly devastated our nation.\"",

    "Coronavirus at work: Were employees protected? OSHA is investigating": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "Workplace safety inspectors are conducting nearly 200 coronavirus-related investigations to determine whether employers failed to adequately protect their workers, according to data from the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration.\n\nHalf involve employee deaths or hospitalizations.\n\nThe inspections target nearly 50 hospitals and two dozen nursing homes, including one in Joliet, Illinois, where administrators believe an infected maintenance worker spread the virus room to room. Twenty-four residents died, along with a nursing assistant and the maintenance worker himself.\n\nAlso under review: a school system garage in Lexington, Kentucky, where 17 employees tested positive and one died; a meatpacking plant in Dakota City, Nebraska, where the widow of a deceased employee said he kept working after getting sick so he could get incentive pay; and two Native American schools in Arizona that reportedly stayed open after others shut down and where two employees died.\n\nIn all, OSHA officials are reviewing workplaces in two dozen states with a total of 96,000 employees, according to USA TODAY's analysis.\n\nOSHA has been under fire for not doing enough to protect workers amid the pandemic. State and federal OSHA offices have fielded thousands of coronavirus-related complaints since January, according to records released last week.\n\nIn recent weeks OSHA also has uploaded data detailing inspections that were launched by federal and state officials and refer to COVID-19. They reveal which inspections are being conducted at what companies.\n\nA total of 192 COVID-related inspections were launched between Feb. 19 and April 23. Many were triggered by complaints that employees were in danger, had been hospitalized or died. Five cases have since been closed; the rest were open, according to data released Tuesday.\n\nLabor unions say the federal workplace safety agency isn't doing enough. The AFL-CIO, which represents more than 12 million workers, sent a scathing letter Tuesday to Labor Secretary Eugene Scalia, who oversees OSHA, accusing the agency of being too lenient and slow.\n\n\"For all workers, the toll of COVID-19 infections and deaths is mounting and will increase even more rapidly as workers return to work without necessary safety and health protections,\" AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka wrote in the letter, which listed dozens of members who have died from the virus.\n\nHe faulted the agency for not doing more inspections, not issuing citations and releasing only voluntary coronavirus safety guidelines. \"Without government oversight and enforcement, too many employers are disregarding safety and health standards,\" he wrote.\n\nUnder federal law, OSHA has jurisdiction over most workplaces in the country. It can issue regulations and enforce them with inspections, citations and legal actions.\n\nTwenty-six states, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands have their own OSHA offices that work under the authority of the federal agency. State workplace standards can't be weaker than federal ones.\n\nIn a response to Trumka released by the Department of Labor on Thursday, Scalia disputed the union's assertions and argued that when it comes to workplace safety, \"the cop is on the beat.\"\n\nIn a statement provided to USA TODAY, OSHA said it has been \"acting to protect America's workers by providing extensive guidance to employers and workers on COVID-19 response.\" As of Wednesday, it said more than 200 COVID-related inspections have been launched.\n\nOSHA declined to comment on specific inspections because the cases remain open. \"The agency continues to field and respond to complaints, and will take the steps needed to address unsafe workplaces, including enforcement action, as warranted.\"\n\nNearly 4,000 coronavirus-related complaints were filed with federal and state OSHA offices between Feb. 24 and April 6. OSHA withheld the names of employers and other details in about 3,100 because those cases are open.\n\nMore than one in four complaints involved health care facilities, where problems included a lack of masks, respirators and other protective gear. Some complainants said employers didn't notify staff when coworkers tested positive or allowed people suspected of having the virus to keep working.\n\nMany of the other industries represented in the complaints are those deemed essential while other workplaces have been shut down, including public safety, transportation, food services and manufacturing.\n\nFormer OSHA officials say it probably investigated many complaints by phone and by asking for documents rather than conducting in-person inspections, according to the agency's guidelines meant to minimize exposure for OSHA inspectors.\n\n\"They're trying to call the employer up and resolve these through the phone,\" said John Newquist, a former OSHA assistant regional administrator. \"They're not going outside to do these complaints because they have their own people ... at risk.\"\n\nHe said inspectors would ask employers about their plans, what sort of personal protective equipment they provide, whether they're practicing social distancing and similar questions.\n\nOSHA said it is enforcing standards for personal protective gear and sanitation as well as overarching federal law that requires employers to \"provide a workplace free of recognized hazards likely to cause death or serious physical harm.\"\n\n\"Each investigation is conducted at the local level by an agency area office, and is determined on its own merits,\" the agency said. \"A case can be handled through an investigation or formal inspection.\"\n\nThe inspection records do not detail what triggered the reviews, but relatives, companies and media accounts offer some details.\n\nTwo dozen nursing homes are under OSHA review following employee hospitalizations and deaths. One is Symphony of Joliet in Illinois, where 24 residents and two staffers died.\n\nIn a letter to Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker last week, Symphony Care Network's CEO said administrators believe an infected maintenance worker unwittingly spread the virus at the nursing home.\n\n\"At the beginning of the crisis, in response to the orders to limit gatherings of people, a dedicated and hard-working maintenance employee set up dining tables in every Joliet patient's room so that they would be able to take meals there instead of in our communal cafeteria setting,\" CEO David Hartman wrote in the letter, which was provided to USA TODAY.\n\n\"He worked diligently and, by all accounts, exerted himself in order to serve our residents, visiting more than 40 rooms in a single day. Unfortunately, although he was asymptomatic, he was also carrying the COVID-19 virus and, through his visit to all of these rooms and his physical exertion, he was an example of ... a 'super-spreader.'\"\n\nThe unnamed worker was one of two employees who died. The other was nursing assistant Sandra Green, 57, who died after struggling for 24 days on a ventilator, the Joliet Herald-News reported. Her daughters alleged there weren't enough masks and gowns at the nursing home.\n\nHartman said in his letter the company has created a crisis team and has sought advice from public health experts to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. He said the company is undertaking \"massive precautions\" that include protective gear and screenings of staff and patients twice a day.\n\nOSHA inspectors are reviewing workplace safety at Marion Regional Nursing Home in Hamilton, Alabama, where Rose Harrison had been a registered nurse for 30 years when COVID-19 arrived last month.\n\nJessica Black, Harrison's daughter, said in an interview with USA TODAY that masks were not required and her mom wound up working for five days with a slight fever and cough. She said her mother even administered COVID-19 tests to patients and colleagues while ill.\n\n\"They told her unless she had a fever of 104 she was expected to work because she was a team leader,\" Black said.\n\nOfficials with Marion Regional Medical Center did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nHarrison was hospitalized hours after leaving work on April 3. She died three days later. \"I am devastated,\" Black said.\n\nResearch Medical Center in Kansas City, Missouri, is one of 38 hospitals that are being inspected after workers were hospitalized or died. Registered nurse Celia Yap Banago, 69, became ill after caring for a coronavirus patient in March. She died April 21, a week short of her planned retirement.\n\nHer coworkers complained about a shortage of masks, gowns, face shields and other protective equipment. A nurses union memorialized Yap Bonago during a protest outside the White House the day after she died.\n\n\"No nurse, no health care worker, should have to put their lives, their health, and their safety at risk for the failure of hospitals and our elected leaders to provide the protection they need,\" National Nurses United Executive Director Bonnie Castillo said.\n\nResearch Medical Center spokeswoman Christine Hamele said in a statement that hospital officials are heartbroken by Yap Banago's death, have adhered to federal guidelines for protective equipment, and are cooperating with OSHA's review.\n\nThree medical centers run by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs are among those being inspected after worker deaths. They are in Detroit, Ann Arbor, Michigan, and Indianapolis, where three employees have died from the virus.\n\nThe American Federation of Government Employees, which represents 260,000 VA workers, has complained about shortfalls in protective gear and employee testing. It filed a complaint with OSHA in March.\n\nAcross the country, the VA says, 2,227 workers have contracted the virus and 20 have died.\n\nVA spokeswoman Christina Noel said that's a fraction of the workforce and a smaller proportion than other health care systems.\n\n\"We welcome OSHA oversight, but the fact is that VA's employee safety practices have helped limit Veterans Health Administration COVID-19 employee infection rates,\" she said.\n\nOSHA has launched an investigation into Fayette County Public Schools in Lexington, Kentucky, where bus driver Eugenia Higgins Weathers died April 4 after contracting COVID-19.\n\nShacora Faulkner, Weathers' daughter and a bus driver herself, told the Lexington Herald-Leader that bus drivers likely caught the disease in a crowded break room.\n\nShe complained that school system officials didn't implement precautions after Gov. Andy Beshear called for social distancing, and they failed to quickly notify employees about exposure.\n\n\"Fayette County did not protect us,\" Faulkner said. \"Honestly, I feel like they did not care about us.\"\n\nSchool officials told The Courier-Journal they took precautions beginning in the latter half of March. Hand sanitizer was distributed and employees were told not to congregate in common areas.\n\nIn Arizona, OSHA is investigating a pair of rural boarding schools run by the Bureau of Indian Education after people complained they remained open amid the outbreak.\n\nLaverne Bitsui, a longtime teacher at Rocky Ridge Boarding School near Hardrock, Arizona, died on Mar. 23, though her family told the Navajo Times it's unclear if she had coronavirus.\n\n\"As far as her sickness, she was sick, but we don't know how bad,\" a family spokesperson told the Times. \"I think she was trying to be positive about it, trying not to get herself scared -- I guess we were not expecting this. She did tell us that other employees are infected ... and now they're passing it on to their families.\"\n\nThe Times reported that a staffer at Tuba City Boarding School, about an hour's drive away, passed away two weeks later.\n\nThe Bureau of Indian Education did not respond to messages seeking comment.\n\nOSHA is investigating a Tyson Foods meatpacking plant in Dakota City, Nebraska, where line worker Raymundo Corral died from COVID-19 on April 18. The meat-processing industry has been racked by the coronavirus.\n\nCorral's common-law wife, Anna Bell, told the Sioux City Journal he continued working after reporting symptoms, in part because of an incentive program that paid $500 to workers who did not miss shifts.\n\n\"People wanted that $500,\" Bell said. \"I would say (to Tyson Foods), it would have been great if you would have treated your employees like human beings instead of just assets.\"\n\nTyson Foods said in a statement that the company was \"deeply saddened by the loss of a team member from our Dakota City plant and are keeping the family in our thoughts and prayers.\"\n\n\"Tyson cooperates with all OSHA inspections,\" the company said, but it doesn't comment on them.\n\nSubsidiary Tyson Fresh Meats announced Wednesday that it is pausing operations at the plant to allow for a deep cleaning.",

    "Coronavirus cases slow in some hard-hit counties around U.S.": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "Across America, coronavirus infection rates are starting to decline in communities that weathered significant outbreaks - an indicator of when it may be OK to plan a return to normal.\n\nActions behind the improvement vary from place to place, USA TODAY found, from large cities that tracked down anyone who had contact with infected individuals to small towns that closed churches and ski resorts that were centers of infection.\n\nThese communities tended to follow the basic coronavirus playbook by closing schools and initiating social distancing measures - often earlier than required by their states. Many added more extreme measures: staggering shopping days by birthdates, testing sewage and closing county borders to travelers.\n\nThey view their success with cautious optimism.\n\nIn Milwaukee County, which added as few as 29 cases a day this week, down from 100 daily at the end of March, the emergency medical services director called the numbers encouraging. But, Ben Weston said, \"it's a little too soon to say we're in the clear.\"\n\nIn Chittenden County, Vermont, cases grew by leaps weeks ago, but the county added just a handful of infections this week as its testing capacity increased.\n\n\"Our death rate went up early and woke people up,\" said Tracy Dolan, the state's deputy health commissioner. \"We're going to start slowly opening the spigot and will be watching for an increase in transmission.\"\n\nUSA TODAY's analysis focused on 650 counties that consistently report daily case counts. Two-thirds experienced a high infection rate: at least 100 cases per 100,000 population. Of that group, 168 reported a significant slowdown last week - half as many new cases as the week before, or less.\n\nFrom week to week, case numbers vary, and counties have widely different protocols for who gets tested, causing experts to warn officials and residents not to assume the worst is over.\n\n\"If you think about getting to a peak in new cases, that still means that there are more infectious people around you than any other time,\" said Ellie Murray, assistant professor of epidemiology at Boston University. \"So if you relax lockdowns, you undo all the work you've done to bring those numbers down.\"\n\nCumberland County, Maine, is one of the places where positive signs haven't panned out. From March 30 through April 6, the county added a total of 100 cases. The following week, it added 40.\n\nThe trend didn't hold: In the past week, the county reported 80 new cases.\n\nWhere glimmers of progress emerge, public health experts advised a renewed focus on vulnerable populations such as the homeless, the incarcerated and seniors in care facilities. The key, said Joshua Sharfstein, vice dean for public health practice and community engagement at Johns Hopkins University, is to keep the social distance pressure on.\n\n\"I think it's been remarkable to see people changing their lives so fundamentally and avert apocalyptic health care scenarios,\" Sharfstein said. \"We've proven we can do what's necessary to fight the virus.\"\n\nCommunities with declines in new coronavirus cases credit a variety of efforts for their improvement.\n\nIn Onondaga County, New York, which surrounds Syracuse, cases were growing by dozens two weeks ago but slowed to single-digit increases. This week, they stand at 646 total in a community of nearly 500,000.\n\nRyan McMahon, the county's executive, said that by 2:30 p.m. each day he gets new daily case figures from health experts before he addresses his community in a webstreamed event.\n\nOnondaga County officials canceled a large St. Patrick's Day parade and shut down schools in mid-March - earlier than the state mandate and before any outbreak in the county. It set up a testing site near vulnerable communities of color and advertised voluntary shelter-in-place rules before state guidelines were issued.\n\nResidents were encouraged to spread out their essential shopping trips, using their birth years. Those born in odd years would shop Monday, Wednesday and Friday, and those born in even years would go Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday.\n\nWhile many places in the USA continue to come up short on testing, Onondaga County has had excess capacity since March, McMahon said. Residents from as far away as the Bronx, Long Island and Buffalo, he said, have visited the county's drive-up facilities to get tested.\n\nAs Onondaga County's infection rates ebb, it is rolling out proactive testing for those without symptoms in nursing homes - both residents and workers.\n\n\"We know for our seniors with any underlying conditions, they have a nasty fight on their hands if they get the virus,\" McMahon said. \"We also want to find those asymptomatic employees before it becomes a problem.\"\n\nPublic health experts said reopening the economy will require contact tracing of new infections, in which teams of workers contact those potentially exposed, who can be tested and isolated.\n\nMore: Ending coronavirus shutdown will not be fast or easy\n\nWashtenaw County, Michigan - home to Ann Arbor - leaned on contact tracing to slow down an escalating problem. In the final week of March, the county saw its total number of confirmed cases leap from 82 to nearly 400. Over the past week, the county has added 98 cases.\n\nThe county is not easing up anytime soon, said Susan Ringler Cerniglia, a county public information officer.\n\n\"We are still doing contact tracing on every confirmed case,\" she said.\n\nEvery person who tests positive is called and interviewed about whom they've talked to and where they've been. Based on those interviews, health officials identify others at risk. They reach out to those people and start the process again.\n\nOn any given day, the department has 12 staff members tracing contacts. They trained health educators and health safety inspectors to share the work.\n\n\"It is resource-intense,\" Cerniglia said. \"We have all of our nursing staff working on this, and not anything else.\"\n\nPlanning to reopen the county next month, the department is thinking through how it can keep up with intensive contact tracing while resuming regular restaurant inspections and other routine work.\n\nOpening things up will make tracing more complex: When most people shelter at home, the \"web of contact,\" Cerniglia said, is small.\n\nWashtenaw County has taken creative approaches to isolation, such as offering hotel rooms to people with confirmed cases who are not able to isolate themselves at home. In nursing homes and homeless shelters, Cerniglia said, officials move quickly to treat and isolate those who test positive or had close contact with someone who did.\n\nOrganizations around the county worked together to get supplies into the hands of people who need them. Groups piggybacked on food distribution through schools to pass out cleaning supplies, safety masks and hand sanitizer.\n\n\"We are seeing some indications that all the hard work and all the sacrifices put into social distancing are starting to have an impact on the numbers,\" Cerniglia said. \"But all that said, we're fearful of jumping into normal levels of activities and seeing those cases jump right up.\"\n\nFor smaller communities, slowing the disease can be relatively simple. Tracking the path of infection can lead back to one location or event.\n\nBartow County, Georgia, saw an initial spike in cases after a \"superspreader\" event at the Church at Liberty Square on March 1. The church's music minister was retiring. Worshippers traveled from across the state.\n\nIn the weeks after that event - which drew about 1,500 people - the tiny county saw its rate balloon to one of the highest in the state.\n\nCounty officials issued a shelter-in-place order March 27, five days before the governor followed suit. Church services moved online.\n\nFor two straight weeks, the number of new cases slowed: 40 new cases last week, 30 this week.\n\n\"We were able to get that under control,\" said Logan Boss, a county public information officer.\n\nOther small communities have taken extreme measures to barricade themselves from the virus.\n\nIn Gunnison County, Colorado, home to the historic mining town and ski destination of Crested Butte, officials restricted all travel from outside the community's borders April 3, threatening a $5,000 fine and jail time. They included people who own second homes there, partially out of concern that the 7,700-foot altitude could put sick patients at greater risk because they need more supplemental oxygen and ventilators.\n\n\"With spring break, we envisioned our community doubling in size, with 8,700 homes registered to out-of-town mailing addresses,\" county spokesman Andrew Sandstrom said. \"We're a county with no ICU beds and 24 regular hospital beds.\"\n\nIn March, Gunnison County prevented bars and restaurants from serving anyone 60 years or older - a twist on the standard practice of checking IDs for minors. It shut down all nonessential hospital visits, construction and golf courses.\n\nThe county partnered with a lab company that is testing fecal samples from five wastewater treatment facilities to track the spread of the virus and the impact of social distancing. In Massachusetts, the same startup - Biobot Analytics - found evidence of more infections than initially reported.\n\nActive and new cases peaked March 20 in Gunnison County and have since slowed to a trickle, passing 100 total and three deaths. This week, the county eased restrictions, including allowing some construction to resume.",

    "Coronavirus concerns at Amazon roil workers into labor actions": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "Scores of Amazon workers are planning to not show up for their jobs this week in an effort to bring attention to their safety concerns and put pressure on the company to improve workplace conditions during the COVID-19 pandemic, say organizations supporting the workers.\n\nIt is being billed as the biggest mass action yet in an ongoing dispute between the e-commerce behemoth and its workers. Hundreds of warehouse workers pledged to call out from their jobs starting Tuesday, according to Athena, a coalition of local and national organizations representing workers.\n\nAnother mass sickout among tech workers is planned for Friday and has been organized by the group Amazon Employees for Climate Justice. \"We are asking you to call in sick on Friday, April 24th to show that you want Amazon to go in a different direction,\" the group said in a Medium post to Amazon workers.\n\n'Thank you coronavirus helpers': First responders, health care workers can shop during special hours, get discounts\n\nCoronavirus stimulus lawsuit: Case alleges Wells Fargo unfairly shuffled Paycheck Protection Program applications\n\nThe Athena coalition says there are more than 130 warehouses where Amazon workers have contracted COVID-19, including some warehouses with more than 30 confirmed cases. \"Amazon's corporate management has consistently responded with delay tactics and incoherent plans that do not rise to the urgency of the pandemic,\" Athena said in a statement about this week's action.\n\nAmazon recently confirmed the death of one worker in California, though it's unclear where he was infected with the coronavirus. Additionally, the company said it has taken a number of measures to protect workers, including issuing masks and temperature checks.\n\nThe online retailing giant also said it has increased pay for hourly employees by $2 per hour in the U.S. and has filled 100,000 new jobs since March. Last week, the company said it planned to hire another 75,000 workers.\n\n\"A next step in protecting our employees might be regular testing of all Amazonians, including those showing no symptoms,\" Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos said in a letter to shareholders last week.\n\nBut Athena says the face masks have been provided only to a fraction of the workforce and are of poor quality. It also said temperature checks easily could be avoided and that workers with fevers reported being sent home without paid time off.\n\nThe sickout planned for Friday also is protesting the treatment of warehouse workers, as well as the firings of two tech workers who had criticized the company's climate policies and workplace safety conditions. One of those workers, Maren Costa, recently addressed Amazon tech workers in an internet forum.\n\n\"We want to tell Amazon that we are sick of all this -- sick of the firings, sick of the silencing, sick of pollution, sick of racism, and sick of the climate crisis,\" Costa told them, according to a news release from the group Amazon Employees for Climate Justice. \"So we're asking tech workers to join us for a sick out on Friday, April 24 and show Amazon that you do not agree with their actions.\"\n\nThe company didn't immediately respond to a request for comment on the planned worker protests.\n\nThe first publicized action from Amazon workers over safety during the coronavirus pandemic happened March 30 when some workers at an warehouse on Staten Island, New York, walked out during lunch.",

    "Coronavirus concerns: At-risk but can't work at home? Ask HR": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "Johnny C. Taylor Jr., a human resources expert, is tackling your questions as part of a series for USA TODAY. Taylor is president and CEO of the Society for Human Resource Management, the world's largest HR professional society.\n\nThe questions are submitted by readers, and Taylor's answers below have been edited for length and clarity.\n\nHave a question? Do you have an HR or work-related question you'd like me to answer? Submit it here.\n\nQuestion: I have Type 1 Diabetes and am at-risk for the coronavirus. My job could easily be done from home, but my company won't consider it. Today, I closed my office door to practice social distancing and my boss made me open it. People in the office are sick but are not staying home. Is there anything I can do about this? - Anonymous\n\nJohnny C. Taylor Jr.: I'm sorry to hear you feel at-risk while at work. But the good news is you can - and should - do something about this.\n\nType I Diabetes can be considered a disability under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). So, depending on the nature of your condition, working from home may be a reasonable accommodation your employer could be required to consider.\n\nThat said, let's clarify something you said: Your \"company won't consider it.\" What makes you say this? Did leadership, HR, or your boss say so? I ask because fewer assumptions now will make for a smoother process - and better outcome - later.\n\nWhile your boss did make you open your door, that doesn't mean he's closed to your concerns. That's why you should meet with him and explain why you shut it. You're especially at-risk for this virus - and that's why you would like to work from home. (If you asked him already, skip this step and talk to HR.)\n\nMake his decision simple by being prepared. Bring an outline of how working from home won't impact productivity. Describe what your setup will be, how it allows you to work without being in the workplace - and take notes.\n\nIf your boss remains unwilling to let you work remotely, you should go right to HR, share your notes, and make the same request. You should also highlight how the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends employers allow remote work during this time, especially for those who are at-risk, such as yourself.\n\nI'll add this. While the CDC advises against requesting notes from healthcare providers during this pandemic, your condition might warrant one to underscore your unique needs.\n\nPerhaps your company has changed course since you submitted your question. But if it hasn't, hopefully this approach helps relieve your concerns and keep you healthy.\n\nStay well!\n\nWorkplace issues: Michigan worker says her boss fired her for trying to follow stay-at-home order\n\nRetirement concerns: The stock market is crashing and we're in a recession. Can I still retire?\n\nQuestion: After returning from a cruise to Nassau, my employer said I can't return to work for two weeks because of the coronavirus. I have no symptoms and feel great. Can my employer do this?\n\nTaylor: Simply put, yes. Amidst this unprecedented pandemic, employers can ask employees to stay home.\n\nI know it may have been an inconvenience. But since there were outbreaks on cruise ships, it's easy to understand your employer's precaution. After all, even if you are asymptomatic, you could still have the virus or be contagious, according to the CDC.\n\nAs with any crisis - be it natural or man-made - employers want to keep employees safe and operations protected. In this case, the coronavirus is like nothing we've seen in a century, so companies are adjusting business practices out of an abundance of caution.\n\nSince I don't have details on what staying home means for you (i.e. working remotely, being furloughed, taking leave, etc.) I can't say much more. However, I thought it was a great, general question worth answering since I'm sure many readers have wondered the same or something similar.\n\nHere's the bottom line: Even if you're feeling well, it's important to protect yourself and those around you. Practice social distancing, good hygiene, and stay home.\n\nAfter all, at-will employment is still the law of the land. If you push too hard, your employer could simply terminate your employment. Given the fact that roughly 22 million people have filed for unemployment during the last month, you should consider yourself fortunate to have a job and an employer that is trying to keep the workplace safe.",

        "authors": [],
        "body": "WOODLAND PARK, N.J. - An alarm blared as Patricia Landers, who suffers from dementia, opened the door of a Florham Park assisted living center shortly before midnight and walked out, wearing her bathrobe. The facility did not call police for 39 minutes.\n\nThat lag time gave Landers a chance to get far away. After a four-hour search, police found her about three miles from the facility, in neighboring Madison. Family members said in an interview with NorthJersey.com and the USA TODAY NETWORK New Jersey that she told them she had been frightened the entire time. They said she had bruises from falling.\n\nThe family filed a lawsuit Wednesday against Brookdale at Florham Park and its parent company, one of the largest operators of long-term senior living facilities in the nation, alleging the home didn't provide the level of care it promised for residents with dementia.\n\nThe lawsuit comes amid a pandemic that has exposed weaknesses in the eldercare system, raising questions about staffing levels at long-term care facilities and complaints about inadequate communication with family members.\n\nBrookdale Senior Living, based in Tennessee, has more than 800 long-term care facilities in 45 states, according to its website. A company spokeswoman wrote in an email that Brookdale does not comment on legal proceedings and doesn't discuss individual residents.\n\nPatricia, the family said, managed to walk away from the Florham Park facility four times over several months. And the home allegedly told relatives that she tested negative for COVID-19 last month -- when in fact the test came back positive, according to the family.\n\n\"I thought my mother was going to die,\" said Judy Aiello of West Orange, one of Patricia's four daughters.\n\nFamily members said that the home had promised them 24-hour security and a staff trained to deal with residents who have dementia. The family said it provided neither. And they said they routinely called the home to ask about their mother but their messages were not returned.\n\nPatricia, 83, is now living in another facility after recovering from pneumonia and having another test for the virus, which was negative, her family said. Several family members agreed to discuss her care this week, including a daughter, Amy, and her husband Nils Lofgren, a musician and songwriter who has performed with Bruce Springsteen and Neil Young.\n\nLofgren, who lives in Arizona, said the pandemic hit home when his mother-in-law went missing from the assisted living facility last month.\n\n\"Our anxieties, fears and worries went sky high,\" he said. \"We thought Pat was in a safe place because that is what they promised.\"\n\nBrookdale reported to the state a total of 310 COVID-19 cases and 58 deaths in 10 facilities in New Jersey as of May 13. Its Florham Park campus has had 10 cases, a relatively low number, and no deaths. There have been almost 27,000 COVID-19 cases at long-term care facilities in the state and more than 5,000 fatalities.\n\n\"I will say that we work hard to maintain an open and constructive dialogue with families about their loved one and the best way that we can work together to help each resident live their best life in their community,\" Brookdale's spokeswoman, Heather Hunter, wrote.\n\nAndrew Miltenberg and other attorneys representing Patricia's family said in court papers that the Florham Park facility was \"consistently understaffed, and the staff that was there, was undertrained and either unwilling or incapable of providing the requisite level of care promised by Brookdale and required by Ms. Landers' conditions.\"\n\nA federal class-action suit settled last year alleged staffing problems at the company's Florida facilities, saying they were the result of the parent company's policies. The suit said Brookdale misled families by telling them staffing was based on assessments of its residents. Instead, the suit charged, it was set by the corporation and based on profit, leaving homes unable to meet residents' needs.\n\nThe company settled another federal lawsuit after a Michigan woman with dementia froze to death in 2011 when a fire door closed behind her, locking her out of the building, according to court filings. South Carolina court records show a pending lawsuit against the company related to another woman with dementia who allegedly walked out of a facility in 2016 and was killed by an alligator.\n\nPatricia Landers raised four daughters as a single mother in West Orange, working as an executive secretary for 27 years. She taught sewing classes, and she helped people learn to read and write English at the local library. She volunteered at a local hospital.\n\nShe recovered from non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, her family said, but chemotherapy left her with lung problems. She had a heart murmur and osteoporosis. Her family moved her into Brookdale in January, lured by the promise that it was equipped to take care of residents with dementia.\n\nThe family said in court papers that Patricia didn't get medicines and treatments she needed. She complained of being \"pushed up against the walls\" by staff members, the lawsuit said, and relatives said they noticed bruises during visits. The receptionist refused to put them through to staff and took messages that were never returned, the documents said.\n\n\"My mother kept telling us she was scared and the girls were mean,\" Amy Aiello Lofgren said.\n\nA Brookdale employee called the family about the alleged abuse and urged them to file a complaint, the lawsuit said.\n\n\"The employee was aware of the staff's abusive and improper behavior with residents, yet could not control them, and was not getting help from Brookdale management in fixing the situation,\" the suit said.\n\nPatricia walked out of the home three times between Feb. 18 and April 5, according to the suit. Police found her the last time after a \"concerned citizen\" reported a woman walking down the road in a bathrobe.\n\nAfter that incident, she was moved to a \"memory care\" section of the home, an area that was supposed to be more secure for people with dementia. Three days later, on April 8, she escaped for a fourth time.\n\nA police report said she tried to get out at first by using a chair to smash a glass window. A staff member escorted her back to her room and went to another area to call the family, the report said. The lawsuit said Judy Aiello spoke to her mother by phone and calmed her down before the staff \"left her unsupervised.\"\n\nMinutes later, Patricia opened an exit door and triggered an alarm. The door does not immediately open, according to police.\n\n\"One must hold the push bar in for an extended period of time which will activate a very loud audible alarm,\" the report said, adding the door can be opened after \"several seconds of the alarm sounding.\"\n\nThe alarm went off at 11:58 p.m. Police said they were called at 12:37 a.m. Then the Morris County Sheriff's K9 unit arrived and Judy Aiello said family members joined the search.\n\nPatricia was found in Madison, the police report said. Court documents said she was wearing her bathrobe and it was 4 a.m.\n\nThe family agreed to move her back to Brookdale temporarily while they looked for a new home. The suit said Brookdale promised Patricia would have 24-hour care by \"skilled nurses\" from an outside agency trained in dealing with dementia. Instead, the suit said, they were aides who lacked such training.\n\nDays later the agency told the family the aides were \"now unavailable,\" according to the suit. Brookdale called one day later with the news, the family said.\n\nMeanwhile, Patricia was given a COVID-19 test at the insistence of her family, though at the time she didn't have symptoms. The family said staff members told them on April 16 that the test was negative.\n\nHours later, the home called to say it didn't have an aide to watch Patricia that night but was looking for one, the family said. Judy Aiello said she received another call four minutes later from a doctor saying her mother needed to be transferred to a psychiatric hospital. She said she wasn't given an explanation.\n\nThe hospital staff stunned the family by telling them that the COVID-19 test from days before, which they had been told was negative, showed Patricia had contracted the virus. The hospital later told the family that Patricia had developed pneumonia.\n\n\"I thought there was no way my mother's going to make it through this,\" Judy Aiello said.\n\nTwo weeks later, Patricia had recovered, and another COVID-19 test came back negative. Now, she's staying at a CareOne facility in Livingston where the family said she's been happy, and asking them to bring her books to read by her favorite author, Harlan Coben, a writer of mystery thrillers.",

        "body": "WASHINGTON -- Janice Hagigal pulled on latex gloves, then placed canned corn, salad dressing, potted meat, cranberry sauce and frozen chicken leg quarters in a plastic bag. By noon Tuesday, there wasn't much left on the shelves at the Emory Beacon of Light's food pantry.\n\nStill, Hagigal wanted to make sure everyone in line - mostly brown and black people like she and her coworkers -- got something to eat that day.\n\n\"They're more in need now than ever,'' said Hagigal, an assistant who has worked at the nonprofit's pantry since 2006.\n\nAs the coronavirus outbreak continues to take its toll on black and Latino communities, black and Latino churches, advocacy groups and civil rights activists have ramped up efforts to help their own, filling in gaps where they say the federal government and even some local governments have fallen short.\n\nSome have raised hundreds of thousands of dollars to help people buy food and diapers. Others have given out masks and hand sanitizer. Some have set up coronavirus testing sites in communities where there were none.\n\nThe pandemic has put more focus on health care and income disparities in those communities. But while some officials have pledged to address those inequities, advocates said their communities can't wait.\n\nMore: Coronavirus spares one neighborhood but ravages the next. Race and class spell the difference.\n\n\"It's clear that we had to step up to fill in the gap,'' said Joseph W. Daniels, Jr., lead pastor of Emory Fellowship, a predominately black church in Washington, D.C., and founder of the Emory Beacon of Light. \"We had to fill in places where typically and traditionally you would think that (the federal) government would step in.''\n\nA survey in April by the Pew Research Center, found 61 percent of Hispanics and 44 percent of blacks said they or someone in their household had lost a job or had their wages reduced because of the outbreak compared to 38 percent of whites.\n\nCenturies of institutionalized racism are a main driver behind the many economic and health care disparities that have fueled high rates of unemployment and positive cases in black and Latinos communities during the outbreak, according to experts.\n\nAt the same time, the federal government has a history of neglecting communities of color during crises, said Silas Lee, a sociology professor at Xavier University, a historically black university in New Orleans. As one of many examples, he and others point to the government's slow response in 2005 after Hurricane Katrina, which devastated black communities in Louisiana, Alabama and Mississippi.\n\nThey also point to the response after Hurricane Maria decimated Puerto Rico in 2017 and government policy toward the water crisis in Flint, Michigan, in 2014, which heavily affected black communities.\n\nCommunity groups and churches have long served as resources for people of color to help fill the void, Lee said.\n\n\"When the challenges arise, they do not run away from them,'' Lee said. \"They will find a way to have an impact.\"\n\nOutside the food pantry at Emory Fellowship, a steady stream of people walked up, each stopping at blue tape on the ground marking the recommended six feet of social distancing. They came pushing carts and carrying shopping bags. Some came alone, others with small children. At one point, about a dozen people waited.\n\nIt was the first visit for Ralphie Avix Vincent. She saw someone with a bag and they directed her to the pantry.\n\n\"It's so kind,'' said the 73-year-old as she walked away with a plastic bag.\n\nFor more than 20 years, the pantry has served people in the neighborhood, which until gentrification crept in over the past decade, was mostly black and Latino. Each Tuesday, the pantry served about 80 clients. Since the outbreak, that number has more than doubled, reaching a high last week of 215 people in need.\n\n\"The only time we have that may people is Thanksgiving,'' said Hagigal.\n\nThe center has been scrambling to get more donations as more people have been laid off and furloughed, with more than 33 million Americans filing unemployment claims since March as of this week. The non-profit relies on church members, local businesses and other faith organizations. It also partners with the Capital Area Food Bank.\n\nHelping the community is at the heart of Emory's mission, said Daniels. But problems facing communities of color, including food insecurity, the lack of affordable housing and access to quality health care and education, can't be addressed without government intervention.\n\n\"The federal government is looking for churches to step up and help, which it should. As a church, that's our responsibility to community,'' Daniels said. \"However, with the realities of what people in the margins are going through ... We can't sustain it. We don't have the resources.\"\n\nMore: Historic layoffs take biggest toll on Blacks, Latinos, women and the young\n\nIn California, Canal Alliance has been giving out food and masks every Tuesday to about 500 families in Marin County since March. Before the outbreak, it distributed food to about 250 families on Tuesdays.\n\nOmar Carrera, CEO of the nonprofit community-based organization, said the need was clear. People the group served -- mostly low-income Latino families and immigrants -- needed money to buy basics like medicine, food and diapers. Many worked in lower-paying jobs, including landscaping, childcare, construction, restaurants and retail.\n\nSo Canal Alliance launched a fundraising drive aiming to collect $50,000. It raised more than $2 million. Throughout April, the group distributed the first $500,00 to more than 1,500 families. Most got a check for $350. The next distribution of $800,000 is expected this month, with each family getting $600.\n\n\"We were really giving the power to people to make that decision'' about what they needed, Carrera said. \"The gap in our community was access to cash.\"\n\nIn contrast, much of the help from local officials was earmarked for rent payments, said Carrera.\n\nLee, the professor at Xavier, said churches and community groups often customize their efforts to meet the needs of communities unlike the \"cookie-cutter approach'' of governments. About 73 percent of African Americans and 70 percent of Hispanic said they didn't have emergency funds to cover three months of expenses, compared to about 47 percent of white, according to the Pew survey.\n\nLee said those groups are trusted institutions in their communities.\n\n\"People know them,'' Lee said. \"It's very important to have a level of trust when you're providing services especially in the environment we're in now. People are emotionally fragile, financially fragile, spiritually malnourished. ''\n\nIn Atlanta, community groups are also working to ensure black and Latino residents have equal access to health care.\n\nMore than 40 cars drove up to the testing site Monday at the Project South parking lot in south Atlanta. Some lined up before testing for the coronavirus began at 10 a.m., while others walked up to get the free test. It was the first day for the new site.\n\n\"It was slow and steady and sort of a good day to get into our groove,'' said Emery Wright, co-director of Project South, a community organizing group.\n\nAs the outbreak spread, Project South teamed with Hunger Coalition of Atlanta to hand out food, hand sanitizers and toilet paper in the African American neighborhood in Atlanta where the groups are based.\n\nThe group's leaders also decided they needed a stepped-up public health response. In early April, Project South and the Hunger Coalition partnered with the Community Organized Relief Effort, a non-profit founded by actor Sean Penn, to set up the community's first testing site.\n\nCommunity activists and civil rights leaders have called for federal health officials to track and release racial data of people testing positive for the coronavirus and those who died from it. President Donald Trump vowed weeks ago that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention would do just that, but so far only a few states have released racial information. Data from these states shows black and Latino people are dying at a disproportionately higher rate compared with whites.\n\nWright said groups learned they would have to take care of their own from Hurricane Katrina, when government and private contractors failed to help communities of color in the predominately African American city of New Orleans and others in Alabama and Mississippi. In 2011, eight community groups across the Southeast formed a coalition to respond to disasters. The groups, including Project South, have kicked into action to help during the pandemic.\n\n\"When it hit we just knew that this was going to be up to us, both here locally and then coordinating a response across the region,'' Wright said.\n\nMore: 'Tuskegee always looms in our minds': Some fear black Americans, hardest hit by coronavirus, may not get vaccine\n\nIn Florida, staff from the Redlands Christian Migrant Association went to bus stops in Collier County last month to hand out masks and bandanas to farm workers headed to the fields to pick fruit and vegetables.\n\nThe non-profit provides childcare and runs charter schools, but with the outbreak its mission has expanded to raise money to help its clients -- mostly Latino farm workers and migrants -- buy food and cleaning supplies and pay for rent and utilities.\n\nMany don't qualify for federal stimulus checks or food stamps because they are undocumented immigrants. And with the outbreak, many now work just one day a week instead of five or six days.\n\n\"They're really struggling to make ends meet,'' said Isabel Garcia, the organization's executive director.\n\nThe last time the organization launched a massive fundraising effort was after Hurricane Irma in 2017 when it distributed food and supplies for a week. This time it's different, said Garcia. The health care crisis will require a longer recovery time. They don't know when childcare centers or schools will open.\n\n\"We're not ready and set up to be able to serve families,\" during a pandemic, Garcia said. \"It's emotionally draining, but we've never stopped.\"\n\nIn recent weeks, the group has also handed out staples such as rice and beans to needy families.\n\n''They are often the forgotten ones,\" Garcia said.\n\nIn southwest Chicago, officials at the Esperanza Health Centers started seeing more patients show up in early March with COVID-19 symptoms. So workers there starting testing their mostly Latino patients. Initially, there were about 25 people a day. Now, it's up to 150. Of those tested, about 55 percent test positive.\n\n\"It was scary to see,'' said Carmen Vergara, the center's CEO. \"That's alarming.\"\n\nWhen the pandemic hit, the community health center formed an internal task force and expanded testing space at two of its four sites. There weren't enough testing sites in the community, Vergara said.\n\n\"It was our role to make sure we were taking care of the patients that we serve,'' she said. \"We knew we had to stay on top of'' developments.\n\nVergara said the state and city are helping more now, including providing more testing supplies.\n\nBut \"there's still a lag of testing,'' she said. \"There's still work to be done.\"\n\nNearby, Enlace Chicago, a community-based organization, started raising money to help its most vulnerable clients, including seniors, single parents and those ineligible for federal aid because of their immigration status.\n\n\"You have to be able to mobilize on your own,\" said Katya Nuques, the group's executive director. Last month, the group started giving families $500 each from the $300,000 it had raised.\n\n\"People are really suffering during the crisis,'' said Nuques. \"We don't think we're going to recover easily from this one.\"\n\nMore: Health issues for blacks, Latinos and Native Americans may cause coronavirus to ravage communities\n\nMore: Health issues for blacks, Latinos and Native Americans may cause coronavirus to ravage communities\n\nIn Maryland, Grainger Browning, Jr., and his wife, Jo Ann, both pastors at Ebenezer A.M.E. Church in Fort Washington, watched on Easter as the line of cars waiting to get gift cards grew to three miles long. Some drove up with all their belongings inside. Some came with their children.\n\n\"It was heart wrenching to see the need,'' recalled Grainger Browning. But \"we were happy that we were able to assist ... and just seeing people so happy that somebody was reaching out to them because government money had not come in yet.\"\n\nThe church is in a predominately affluent black county, but there are pockets of poverty among its black and Latino residents, and the pandemic has hit Prince George's County hard.\n\n\"The crisis is hitting every area of our community,'' said Grainger Browning.\n\nWith donations from the congregation, the church has given away $150,000 since March to help nearly 5,000 people buy food. On Thursday, it teamed with the World Central Kitchen founded by chef Jose Andres to distribute 1,000 meals.\n\nOn Mother's Day, it plans to give $50 gift cards to mothers.\n\nJo Ann Browning said giving is not foreign to Ebenezer, but called it a \"blessing'' during the pandemic to see church members ''stepping up to the plate and hitting a home run in terms of their giving.\"\n\n\"The reality is there for the grace of God go ourselves,'' she said.\n\nThe last time the church launched a massive relief effort was when it raised $120,000 to help victims of Hurricane Katrina. It's important, the Brownings said, to help their brown and black communities.\n\n\"There's never been a case where everything was okay. The church is always there to fill the gap,'' said Grainger Browning. \"The church was never there just on Sunday...It's really what we did Monday through Saturday that made the difference.\"",

    "Coronavirus death toll hard to track: 1 in 3 death certificates wrong.": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "Funeral homes are changing the way funerals are held during the coronavirus outbreak.\n\nAs the U.S. struggles to track coronavirus fatalities amid spotty testing, delayed lab results and inconsistent reporting standards, a more insidious problem could thwart its quest for an accurate death toll.\n\nUp to 1 in 3 death certificates nationwide were already wrong before COVID-19, said Bob Anderson, chief of the mortality statistics branch at the National Center for Health Statistics in an interview with the USA TODAY Network.\n\n\"I'm always worried about getting good data. I think this sort of thing can be an issue even in a pandemic,\" Anderson said.\n\nExperts say the inaccuracies are part and parcel of a patchwork, state-by-state system of medical examiners, coroners and doctors who have disparate medical backgrounds, and in some cases none at all.\n\nAnd the problem is about to get worse. The pandemic will undoubtedly inundate already overworked and sometimes untrained officials who fill out the forms.\n\nAccurate death certificates are paramount for local health officials who are trying to determine where to focus resources to fight the spread of the coronavirus, said Dr. Umair Shah, executive director of the public health department in Harris County, Texas, which includes Houston.\n\n\"That death represents an ecosystem of people,\" Shah said.\n\nInaccurate death reporting is a longstanding problem noted by numerous researchers in study after study.\n\nA 2017 review of Missouri hospitals, for example, found nearly half of death certificates listed an incorrect cause of death. A Vermont study found 51% of death certificates had major errors. Nearly half of the physicians the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention surveyed in 2010 admitted that they knowingly reported an inaccurate cause of death.\n\nDeath certificates regularly lack enough details to accurately pinpoint the cause of death, Anderson said.\n\n\"For example, cardiac arrest is not an acceptable cause of death, because everybody dies of cardiac arrest,\" Anderson said. \"That just means your heart stopped.\"\n\nThe widespread inaccuracy of death certificate information stems largely from the varying levels of expertise of those who complete the forms, experts said.\n\nPhysicians, coroners, medical examiners, and in some states, other medical personnel, such as nurse practitioners, can legally sign death certificates, said Dr. Sally Aiken, president of the National Association of Medical Examiners and a practicing medical examiner in Spokane County, Washington.\n\nCoroners and medical examiners are responsible for certificates in homicides, accidents and suicides, Aiken said. Physicians fill out the form when natural deaths, such as those caused by COVID-19, occur in a hospital. But medical examiners and coroners do it if the person died at home or in another non-healthcare setting.\n\nMedical examiners are generally physicians specializing in forensic pathology who can perform autopsies.\n\nCoroners, however, are not always doctors. In some states, such as Alabama and Georgia, the only requirement for a coroner is that they are a non-felon of legal age to be elected to the position.\n\nEven those with medical expertise, though, regularly get it wrong. In Vermont, there are no coroners. If a death is natural or happens in a hospital or out in the community, physicians, nurse practitioners or physician assistants fill out death certificates. And the state medical examiner's office, which investigates violent deaths, reviews about 5,000 certificates each year to find and fix errors.\n\nWhen the state medical examiner's office compared 601 death certificates completed between July 1, 2015 and Jan. 31, 2016 with medical records, they found that 51% had major errors.\n\nLauri McGovirn, a medical examiner who worked on that review, said some physicians didn't complete death certificates regularly, so they were unfamiliar with the process. Others viewed it as an administrative chore.\n\n\"It does make you wonder in other states where they don't have the type of resources or the money to review every death certificate what their error rate may be,\" McGovirn said.\n\nIn addition to expertise gaps, there's a severe shortage of medical examiners nationwide.\n\nIn a recent report to Congress, the Justice Department said as many as 700 more forensic pathologists are needed. That same report noted that in addition to staffing, \"budgets, resources and supplies are too inconsistent to ensure that death investigations are of the same quality across the United States.\"\n\nDr. Ray Fernandez has been the chief medical examiner for Nueces County, Texas, for 19 years. He knows what the shortage means -- a punishing workload.\n\nDespite hiring another full-time pathologist and two part-time pathologists several years ago, he and his colleagues each perform 200 to 300 autopsies per year, regularly bumping up against the National Association of Medical Examiners' recommendation of no more than 325 per year.\n\nThe organization has temporarily suspended that caseload limit amid due to COVID-19, but Fernandez said the more cases medical examiners take on, the greater the chance they'll make mistakes.\n\n\"COVID-19,\" he said, \"is impacting the system at a time when it's already in a crisis with a shortage of people doing the work.\"\n\nTo further complicate efforts to curb the spread of coronavirus, many medical examiners and coroners refuse to attribute a death to COVID-19 without a positive test before the person died. Some medical examiners are doing post mortem testing if they have the means. But with tests in short supply, that's not always possible.\n\nDr. James Gill, vice president of the National Association of Medical Examiners and the chief medical examiner for the state of Connecticut, said he's sending his staff to funeral homes to swab the noses of the deceased, which are then analyzed by an outside lab.\n\nThe family of the deceased and the first responders who attended to them need the lab results to know whether they should self isolate or get treatment, Gill said.\n\n\"You have to remember, though, that even if we are doing a swab on a dead person, those results may affect the living,\" Gill said.\n\nThe National Center for Health Statistics, where Anderson works, updated its website on April 1 to clarify that those filling out death certificates should record COVID-19 as the probable cause if testing isn't possible and if the medical records or circumstances support that.\n\nDespite this, Anderson said, some physicians will simply list the cause of death as pneumonia when the pneumonia likely came after a COVID-19 infection. But he hopes fewer do.\n\n\"The fact is, a lot of these deaths are not going to be autopsied and post mortem testing is not going to be done, so we're going to have to rely on second-hand accounts and what the symptoms were,\" Anderson said. \"We may miss some as a result.\"",

    "Coronavirus deaths grow in homeless community, advocates demand action": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "FORT COLLINS, Colorado -- James Anderson jammed a pocketknife deep into the earth, a yellow string stretching from the handle to where it was tied to his flimsy green tent.\n\n\"I think that'll hold,\" he said as a gust of wind rattled the fabric. \"I hope it will. I think it will.\"\n\nAll around him, dozens of men and women were similarly using makeshift stakes and rope to strengthen their tents. Others piled up their meager belongings to make windbreaks as a storm forecast to drop 10 inches of snow on the city darkened the sky.\n\nAn estimated 553,000 people experience homelessness on any given night in the United States, a dangerous living situation that's being exacerbated by the coronavirus outbreak. Amid the pandemic, many have been pushed into shelters or encampments like this one on the playing fields of a city-owned recreation center. But advocates say real solutions are needed -- not temporary, makeshift housing -- and are warning federal leaders that the nation will only remain as healthy as its less fortunate residents.\n\nPublic health officials and advocates for the homeless have for decades warned that people living on the streets are generally sicker and more vulnerable than most Americans. But the coronavirus outbreak has hammered that point home with deadly seriousness: At least 27 people experiencing homelessness have already died in New York City, the epicenter of the U.S. outbreak, where nearly 14,000 died as of Tuesday, or nearly one third of the nation's death toll.\n\nThe challenge will likely get worse, experts say, because 22.2 million Americans have lost their jobs in the wake of national closures.\n\n\"We have a pandemic laid over an epidemic. We have a situation that's suddenly at the front of people's mind because they recognize that the health of their neighbor has immense impact on their own health,\" said Commissioner Kenneth Hodder, the Western District commander for the Salvation Army, the nation's largest non-government social services provider with 7,600 sites nationally.\n\nAdvocates for people experiencing homelessness said they are frustrated at the slow pace of response, with many accusing the federal government of being more interested in bailing out Wall Street than Main Street, especially since most services are provided at the local level, and are heavily dependent on charity and sales taxes.\n\nTo further complicate matters, homeless people may miss out on the federal stimulus checks and other benefits being offered if they have no fixed address at which to receive mail.\n\nRoughly 17 out of every 10,000 Americans experience homelessness, according to the National Alliance to End Homelessness, a nonpartisan organization based in Washington, D.C. Of those, about 33 percent are families with children.\n\nFederal guidelines for helping slow the spread of coronavirus call for people experiencing homelessness to either be sheltered in large \"congregate\" shelters, like recreation centers or auditoriums, or in encampments like the one in Fort Collins. Those measures are cheaper in the short term than providing proper housing.\n\nIn Fort Collins, city officials and multiple nonprofit agencies have transformed a recreation center on the edge of the city's historic downtown into a shelter for up to 200 men and women. It's a place where they can get three free meals a day while health officials take their temperature and preside over handwashing stations and flush toilets. They're encouraged to sleep inside, although many still prefer their tents.\n\n\"Rather than dispersing people into the shadows during a global pandemic, we have them here in front of us,\" said Holly LeMasurier, who is helping manage the Fort Collins shelter.\n\nAnyone using the shelter, including those showing symptoms and awaiting test results, is free to come and go. Workers encourage clients to maintain social distancing and wear masks even when not inside.\n\nThe goal is to slow the spread of the outbreak and help save lives. People experiencing homelessness generally lack access to adequate sanitary facilities such as sinks to wash their hands in, and often congregate in tight groups or on city buses while also moving around regularly.\n\nIn New York City, aerial photos of mass burials of unclaimed bodies grabbed international headlines last week. The city normally has about 25 unclaimed bodies buried on Hart Island each week, but the coronavirus outbreak has accelerated that to two dozen a day. Authorities weren't immediately able to say how many of those bodies belonged to people experiencing homelessness, but acknowledged that at least some of them likely were.\n\nBut some people experiencing homelessness said they are worried that by rounding them up in one place, officials are putting them at risk to protect others, instead of prioritizing their personal safety. Some also said they were resentful about their loss of freedom given the many rules associated with shelters, including restrictions against pets, alcohol or drugs.\n\nFew people at the shelter or encampment expressed concern about coronavirus infections. Instead, they fretted about the quality of the food and heavy police presence.\n\n\"When you're worried about where your next meal is coming from, or trying to figure out a way out of homelessness or struggling with addiction, you're not thinking a lot about the coronavirus,\" said Brad Meuli, president and CEO of the Denver Rescue Mission.\n\nOutside the shelter in Fort Collins, John Carlin said he worries pressure from the public will prompt city officials or police to start locking up people like him. Carlin, who sat huddled in a blanket with his dog, Brando, lost his housing earlier this year when the woman he was living with asked him to move out.\n\n\"I keep joking that one day we're going to wake up with barbed wire fences around this place, but I'm only half joking,\" he said.\n\nPeigan Buchanan, 19, said it's been frustrating to watch how police have closely patrolled the encampment, instead of intervening only when there's a real problem. Buchanan lost her job as a cook at a restaurant only a few block away from the tent city. She recently observed officers confront an elderly man in possession of a large sheath knife.\n\nOfficers confiscated the man's knife and ordered him to leave the encampment for violating rules against weapons, even though the knife was sheathed and he wasn't threatening anyone with it. At times, there were at least six officers at the encampment, along with two private security officers hired to patrol the shelter.\n\nBuchanan said the city's population of people experiencing homelessness have been effectively corralled into the encampment by threats that they'll be ticketed for illegally camping if they don't stay off the streets, perpetuating a cycle of poverty caused by fines and detention.\n\n\"If you look like you're homeless, people assume you have the coronavirus or you're going to bite their head off,\" said Buchanan. \"These are people. No matter how many fences they put up or how many cops there are, these are people.\"\n\nAdvocates for the homeless say study after study shows that providing stable housing in the form of subsidized or free apartments is ultimately far cheaper than trying to address the myriad individual challenges faced by that community, from drug and alcohol abuse to repeated jailings, court appearances and emergency room visits.\n\nThose advocates are trying to persuade the federal government -- with mixed success -- to help pay for hotel rooms in cities from Los Angeles to Las Vegas and Chicago, arguing that keeping the homeless community safe and healthy will protect the rest of the country from potential reinfection.\n\nIn New York City, authorities have been renting $200-a-night hotel rooms to isolate people who have no home but are showing signs of infection, and in the Seattle area, public health officials bought a motel for the same purpose.\n\n\"This is the case study that housing IS health,\" said Dr. James Stewart, a medical doctor and public-health expert helping oversee the Fort Collins shelter on behalf of the Health District of Northern Larimer County. \"If we don't prevent the outbreaks in our community, we are all at risk.\"\n\nNan Roman, president of the National Alliance to End Homelessness, say this crisis could prove a tipping point for long-needed structural changes, where the United States starts to treat men and women experiencing homelessness with the care and empathy you'd expect from the world's richest nation.\n\n\"It's always a matter of political will. It's not that we can't afford to do it or we don't know how to do it. It's that we don't want to it. And this kind of situation shows us what happens when we don't put a floor of housing, food and health care beneath people,\" Roman said. \"We are all connected. And to have so many people on the edge, living to paycheck, people barely afford to sustain themselves -- it's not a very good way to run the country. Because it just leaves us very vulnerable.\"\n\nBack at the Fort Collins shelter, Anderson snacked on a cup of soup provided by the nonprofit Food Not Bombs. Anderson has lived in the city for about 30 years, experiencing homelessness several times. He lost his most recent housing when the IHOP he worked at shut last summer and he used up all his savings.\n\nLike most Americans, he's ready for the restrictions on movement to be lifted so he can go back to the library and to Starbucks, to walk around freely and hang out with his friends. He prefers camping in wooded area to staying in the encampment, and itches at the thought of being surrounded by so many other people.",

        "body": "Oldham County Judge Don Allred was sitting in his living room on a Thursday night when the state health department called.\n\nOldham County -- located on historic Route 66 bordering New Mexico in the Texas Panhandle -- had its first confirmed case of COVID-19. Her name was B'Anna Scroggins. She was 39. She had a husband, two kids, a job and a long list of friends in her home in the county seat of Vega.\n\nAllred, who looks the part of a rural county judge with his grey mustache, jeans, sports coat and cowboy boots, had known the virus was coming. He wasn't naive enough to think that his 2,300-resident community would be shielded from a pandemic killing tens of thousands of people around the world.\n\nBut until that day, COVID-19 felt more like a big city thing, something far away from the modest, single-story homes that line Vega's narrow streets. New York and New Orleans were a world away from Vega's one-square-mile downtown with its handful of restaurants, eight-page weekly newspaper, gold water tower and wind turbines near the 25,000-head cattle feed yard.\n\nAllred, who has been the county judge in Oldham County for more than three decades, hung up the phone and got to work. He hasn't stopped since then, making calls, occasionally dropping off groceries to elderly neighbors, trying to calm the nerves of local business owners watching their earnings plummet.\n\nFor months, America has been focused on the travesty unfolding in major cities, watching the numbers click up every day to more than 1.2 million confirmed cases of COVID and more than 71,000 deaths across the country.\n\nBut rural areas are feeling the pain of the virus in their own ways. In Oldham County, shops have been shuttered. Restaurants and businesses have lost money. Sheriff's deputies have stopped fewer speeders on the highway and people suspected of lower-level crimes such as marijuana possession or assaults are getting low bonds to keep them out of the 10-bed jail.\n\nAnd the stories of people like B'Anna Scroggins show how even one death can sideswipe tight-knit communities.\n\n\"Her loss was not just frightening to our community,\" Allred said. \"It was emotionally devastating.\"\n\nB'Anna Scroggins, her husband, Billy, and their friends packed into the Texan Dome at South Plains College on Friday, March 6, wearing their black and gold Vega Longhorns T-shirts. The regional basketball tournament had drawn a large crowd to watch the highschool boys teams battle it out for a chance to go to the state finals.\n\nThe tournament was almost two hours away, but that's what Vega residents do -- support their students, even when their own kids have graduated or don't play sports.\n\n\"The whole town was there,\" said Shaye Pingel Warner, one of B'Anna's best friends. \"I bet there were 300-400 people there from our side. Probably more.\"\n\nThe Scroggins crew snatched good seats -- about six rows from the court. It was a heartbreaker; Vega lost 69-58 to Sundown.\n\nOh well, the Vega fans said through tears. On to golf and track.\n\nAt that time, Allred didn't know Scroggins so much as he knew of her. He'd followed her son, Brian, when he played basketball and football in high school. But in Vega, that's as good as knowing someone.\n\n\"We're all family,\" he said. \"In a small community, everybody either knows you or knows someone who knows you.\"\n\nSoon, B'Anna Scroggins would become a major figure in Allred's life.\n\nB'Anna worked as a business analyst at AIG. Billy owned his own company, C and C Gaskets, which produced custom-made refrigerator gaskets. The couple married in 1996 when B'Anna was 16 and Billy was 21. Billy loved her red hair, that she was sweet and a good listener.\n\nThey had two children and frequently hit concerts together, seeing groups like Matchbox 20 and the Goo Goo Dolls. B'Anna had recently bought tickets for a concert featuring Motley Crew, Joan Jett and others to celebrate Billy's 45th birthday in July.\n\nThe couple also had a tight-knit circle of friends. They held big Halloween parties, vacationed together at Ute Lake in New Mexico and drank margaritas at a local restaurant. B'Anna always sang Lizzo's Truth Hurts at karaoke.\n\n\"She always had a smile on her face,\" Billy Scroggins said.\n\nOn Tuesday, March 10, four days after the basketball game, B'Anna started feeling sick.\n\nShe texted Pingel Warner: \"I have been coughing and had chills all night.\"\n\nAlong with a crushing headache, she had a 102-degree fever.\n\nShe wasn't the only one to get sick. Pingel Warner, her boyfriend and a few others in Vega who had attended the basketball tournament, had already fallen ill, so B'Anna wasn't worried.\n\n\"She thought she got the flu,\" Billy Scroggins said.\n\nState officials would later confirm that the tournament might have been responsible for spreading COVID-19.\n\nAs the week progressed, B'Anna Scroggins tried to bring the fever down with Tylenol and Motrin.\n\nBy Friday, March 13, she couldn't take it anymore. She headed to a family care clinic in Bushland, about 20 minutes away, Billy Scroggins said. There, she tested negative for the flu and strep throat and her temperature had dipped.\n\nThe doctors sent her home with instructions to return if her high fever returned.\n\nThe next day, she went to an urgent care clinic in Amarillo. She had again with a 103-degree fever, a piercing headache and a persistent cough. This time, she tested positive for the flu B and pneumonia.\n\nHer blood-oxygen level was so low that doctors called an ambulance to transfer her to BSA Hospital in Amarillo.\n\nB'Anna kept her spirits up, Billy Scroggins said. She asked her husband to check on her friend's daughter, who was also sick.\n\n\"That's how she was,\" Billy Scroggins said. \"She always worried about everybody but herself.\"\n\nThree days later, B'Anna Scroggins stopped breathing. She was resuscitated, intubated and taken to the ICU. Two days later, she was diagnosed with COVID-19.\n\nPingel Warner started asking people on Facebook to pray for her friend.\n\n\"Calling on our prayer warriors to pray fervently for one of my dearest friends, B'Anna Scroggins,\" Pingel Warner wrote on March 19, the first of multiple posts. \"The next few days are the most critical. Please pray for complete healing and restoration.\"\n\nHundreds of people responded.\n\n\"I don't know her but God knows her and I am praying for her miracle healing in Jesus name,\" one person wrote.\n\n\"Keep fighting B'Anna Scroggins!!!\" another wrote. \"God is with you!!\n\nAs soon as Allred discovered Scroggins had COVID-19, he snapped into action.\n\nAllred called the emergency management coordinator and the sheriff's office, a small county department with five deputies and five jailers. The dispatchers were notified of the case so, in case they were called there for an emergency, the responders would be wearing appropriate protective gear.\n\nThen he had to figure out how to inform those who didn't know about Scroggins's official confirmation of COVID. They had to rely on the state health department for guidance, he said. There's no hospital, not even a single doctor, in Oldham County.\n\n\"We were basically in the dark, not knowing what to do or how to react,\" Allred said. He worried about somehow violating HIPAA. He worried about the rumor mill spreading wrong information. And he worried that more cases were coming.\n\nOn March 20, the county posted the COVID-19 confirmation on its emergency management Facebook page.\n\n\"Texas Department of State Health Services has notified local officials of a confirmed case of COVID-19 in Oldham County,\" the post read. \"No further information is available at this time but will be provided as it becomes available\"\n\nThat same day, Pingel Warner confirmed on Facebook that B'Anna was the one who tested positive for the virus because the rumor mill had been churning. At least 15 to 20 people had texted or messaged her, worried that they had been exposed to the disease.\n\nThe disease that had seemed so distant suddenly became very real.\n\n\"Most of the time she was in our prayers, hoping she was going to be OK, that she was going to make it through this,\" Allred said. \"No one really had an understanding of the seriousness. We all knew it could be fatal, but she was a 39-year-old woman. We thought, 'She'll be OK. We'll get through this.'\"\n\nRumors flew through the community, often instigated by Facebook or Twitter.\n\n\"The first week or two weeks, 70-80% of my job was trying to stomp out rumors,\" Allred said. \"It was 'So and so has it,' and then, 'Their whole family has it,' and 'What do I do, I saw them?'\"\n\nBefore B'Anna's death, when Billy Scroggins left home in a mask to go to the post office, a neighbor called the police, accusing him of spreading the disease.\n\nAllred started getting calls from residents worried about the disease. He told people what he could and tried to give them accurate information. If they were feeling ill, he told them what the health department had instructed him to say: If you start feeling bad and have a fever, wait it out for a few days. After that, if you don't feel better, call the hospital and let them know you're coming.\n\nAllred resisted calling for a shelter-in-place measure, saying the county was so rural that it was isolated enough to slow the spread of the disease. Instead, he brought five-gallon jugs of hand sanitizer to the schools, to fire departments, city and county offices. He helped deliver groceries to his neighbors.\n\nHe worked with the sheriff's office and used his position as county magistrate to keep travelers picked up on the highway out of jail and out of the county. In late March, the governor ordered the shutdown.\n\nMeanwhile, Allred was worried about the county's economic health.\n\nRoy Arellano, co-owner of Rooster's Mexican Restaurant and Cantina in Vega, stood in mid-April in an empty dining room. Chairs were stacked on maroon-colored tables. The fountain in the corner bubbled audibly when ordinarily it would be drowned out by the sound of talking customers.\n\nBusiness was down 60% since mid-March, when Gov. Greg Abbott banned eating in restaurants. Arellano had to lay off four employees, leaving himself and two others to handle to-go orders.\n\n\"It affects our business,\" he said. \"A lot of people are afraid to come out.\"\n\nLocal veterinarian T.J. Barclay also has seen a dip in his business, which mainly focuses on horses. With rodeos and other events canceled, owners don't need his services as much.\n\nKirkland Feedyard in Vega -- which fattens cattle before slaughter -- has taken a hit from the stock market, said Robby Kirkland, who runs the operation.\n\n\"My message for my family, to customers is that we're all healthy and alive. Maybe we don't have as much money in our pockets, but we still have our jobs.\"\n\nOldham County wouldn't let its businesses die without a fight, though, either. People were eating out as much as they could. They also started buying gift certificates for haircuts from Bill's Barber Shop.\n\n\"Just to put some money in his pocket,\" Allred said.\n\nBut telling people they had to shut their doors was hard for officials. Salons, gift shops, T-shirt stores -- - none of them qualified as essential business, something that irked the owners, particularly because Walmart and Dollar General stayed open.\n\n\"How is a barber who wears a mask and gloves a bigger hazard to my community than 250 people walking around Walmart?\" Allred asked.\n\nOldham County Commissioner Quincy Taylor -- who owns Taylor's Vega Market -- never had a problem with losing business. The problem was she had too much.\n\nIn early March, when people started hoarding, people from the surrounding areas would clean out her shop -- toilet paper, paper towels, canned goods, rice. Nothing was left for the locals, Taylor said.\n\nTaylor closed her doors and only provided curbside pick up or delivery service. It wasn't just a matter of making sure her neighbors had food, she said. It was about their health, too.\n\n\"I didn't want all those people from Amarillo coming to our store bringing us who knows what,\" Taylor said.\n\nDoctors in the ICU put B'Anna Scroggins in a medically induced coma to help get oxygen to her organs. But nothing helped.\n\nOn March 23, her blood oxygen levels never got above 30. A normal reading is between 95 and 100. Her heart raced, swinging between 130 and 160 beats per minute.\n\nHer husband Billy began feeling achy and lethargic, symptoms he attributed to stress. He was allowed to see his wife only outfitted in double gloves, a face shield and a gown. B'Anna's sister kept vigil at her side while Billy checked in on their 16-year-old daughter, Shaylee, and got some rest.\n\nAt 2:30 a.m. on March 24, B'Anna Scroggins's heart stopped. She was gone.\n\nThree days later, Billy Scroggins was diagnosed with COVID-19. Scroggins, who has asthma, had to use his inhaler more, but mostly felt weak and tired. He felt better shortly after receiving a Z-Pack, which is an antibiotic, on the day he was diagnosed.\n\nThe community rallied around the Scroggins family, setting up a Gofundme account that generated more than $25,000.\n\n\"It blew me away,\" Billy Scroggins said. \"I was so shocked.\"\n\nAllred wasn't. He knew the town would support the Scroggins family.\n\n\"It was very serious and devastating,\" Allred said. \"It became real and it became alive and it became local.\"\n\nHe also knew the community was scared.\n\nAfter his wife's the death, a handful of people sat outside Billy Scroggins's house in their cars and masks to make sure he didn't leave. One rumor accused him of threatening to cough all over the local store's produce.\n\n\"I'm not mad at anybody,\" Billy Scroggins said. \"Nobody knows how to react to these things.\"\n\nAnd yet, things got even harder. The same community that had leapt to help Scroggins deal with the loss of his wife couldn't help him do the most basic thing -- hold her funeral.\n\nB'Anna's Scroggins's funeral was postponed three times. The first two stemmed from conversations about whether the health department would allow friends to watch from their cars. The answer was no, he said.\n\nAllred had to tell Scroggins that people couldn't attend the funeral not only because of the executive order that only 10 people could gather at a time, but because Billy Scroggins and his daughter were still quarantined.\n\n\"It was terrible,\" Allred said. \"There's things you have to do sometimes that you despise, but you have to do those things to protect the community.\"\n\nThe third time the funeral was pushed back was because the grave digger got sick.\n\nUltimately, only immediate family -- Scroggins, his two children and his son's fiancee -- came to the graveside on April 1. Several law enforcement officers, who saluted the family as they arrived at the cemetery, sat in their cars outside the gates as a sign of respect, but also to make sure no one else attended the funeral, Scroggins said.\n\nBut the minister the family had arranged didn't show.\n\n\"He was afraid,\" Billy Scroggins said.\n\nFuneral director Bart Boxwell stepped up. He said a few words, praying for God to watch over the family in their time of need. He played \"It is Well,\" by Kristene DiMarco on a little boombox.\n\nScroggins doesn't remember much about the burial. He was crying too much.\n\nThe little house that B'Anna was renovating is quiet now. Billy spends his days caring for Shaylee, a quiet girl who is spending time with a few friends and her boyfriend.\n\nBilly Scroggins is celebrating the birth of his 21-year-old son's first child, and going to work. He'll miss his wife's smile and the way she dragged him out of the house and her edict that, no matter how annoyed they got with each other, they'd always figure it out.\n\n\"We just worked,\" he said. \"We always had the rule that we don't go to bed mad. And we never did.\"\n\nA couple of weeks, but what feels like eons, after B'Anna Scroggins's death, In some ways, life in Oldham County is returning to some semblance of normalcy.\n\nRooster's and the Dairy Queen are open for partial in-restaurant dining. The county courthouse doors are open, though officials are still limiting the number of customers who can enter offices at the same time.\n\nTaylor is letting a few people come into her grocery, though curbside service and delivery are still the priority. Businesses like salons and barber shops are open, and the school is finalizing a plan that would allow their 42 seniors to have a graduation ceremony.\n\nIn other ways, life here remains on pause things remain the same. Churches are still closed. Businesses are having to live with the money they lost these last few months.\n\nWhat will the new normal look like? Taylor wonders. Will people ever go to football games again? Will they be able to have parties? Will they be able to look at each other without worrying they'll catch something?\n\n\"Everything is so different,\" Taylor said. \"I don't think we'll ever be like we were. Look how much it's already changed us.\"\n\nAnd the threat of the disease spreading into Oldham County remains ever present. While the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases is still three, the rural county is surrounded by areas with far more cases.\n\nPotter County, home of Amarillo and directly east of Oldham County, has about 1,000 cases of the virus. Nearby Moore County has more than 400 and Randall County has about 300.\n\nMany Oldham residentsWith the number of people who commute to work in Amarillo or other cities, which means more cases could show up. in Oldham.\n\n\"I'm concerned about it filtering out to our local communities,\" Allred said. \"I don't think any of us are naive enough to think this is over.\"\n\nDespite the heartbreak of B'Anna Scroggins's death, COVID-19 has also shown Vega's heart, he said. One person gave $1,000 to the grocery store for its employees, while others brought meals, cookies or banana bread to keep them fed during the long days.\n\nFamilies are spending have had more time to spend with their children, and there is a sense of gratitude that things aren't worse.\n\n\"There are people that are scared out there, but we cannot live in fear,\" he said. \"We must live in facts. I know God can take any tragedy and turn it into triumph.\"",

        "body": "ALBANY, N.Y. - On March 29, as New York and other states began ordering nursing homes to admit medically stable residents infected with the coronavirus, national trade groups warned it could unnecessarily cost more lives.\n\nThe health directives put \"frail and older adults who reside in nursing homes at risk\" and would \"result in more people going to the hospital and more deaths,\" the American Health Care Association and affiliates said at the time.\n\nA month later, it appears government officials should have heeded the dire call to pursue different pandemic emergency plans.\n\nThe deadly virus has spread like wildfire through many nursing homes across the Northeast, and state officials are scrambling to better protect those most vulnerable to COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus.\n\nThe death toll is devastating, according to interviews with nursing home officials, patients' families, health care advocates, government officials and from an examination of state records by the USA TODAY Network Atlantic Group, a consortium of 37 Gannett-owned daily newspapers across the Northeast.\n\n'Patients are dropping like flies': 16,000 dead from COVID-19 in U.S. nursing homes\n\nCoronavirus at work: Safety inspectors reviewing scores of employee hospitalizations, deaths\n\nMeanwhile, advocates and residents' relatives have criticized state and federal officials, as well as some nursing homes, for failing to address the crisis as deaths mounted.\n\n\"To have a mandate that nursing homes accept COVID-19 patients has put many people in grave danger,\" said Richard Mollot, executive director of the Long Term Care Community Coalition in New York.\n\n\"We know facilities have a lot of infection-control problems, we know that facilities have low staff, so what do you think was going to happen when the staff were further strained in caring for these patients?\"\n\nAmid the pushback, New York Health Commissioner Dr. Howard Zucker on Wednesday issued an advisory warning nursing homes they could face fines or lose their license if they didn't properly isolate COVID-19-infected residents, citing state health law.\n\nThe letter noted nursing homes incapable of isolating contagious residents should transfer them to other medical facilities and stop admitting additional residents.\n\nNew Jersey's Health Commissioner Judith Persichilli took a similar step on April 13, clarifying how the state's nursing homes could deny admitting infected patients.\n\n\"People just can't go back until the spread in the nursing homes slows down and until they can take care of their residents appropriately,\" Persichilli said the day the revised guidelines were distributed.\n\nMore: NY withheld nursing home COVID-19 details for weeks. Thousands died. Here's how secrecy impacted lives\n\nMore: Infections in long-term care facilities may impact return to normal\n\nYet the efforts have come too late for some family members, many of whom complained of being kept in the dark about risks at nursing homes since visitors were banned in March to combat the virus.\n\nOne is Kathleen Cole, who said her 89-year-old mother, Dolores McGoldrick, died April 17 after contracting COVID-19 at Ferncliff Nursing Home in Rhinebeck, New York.\n\nMcGoldrick, a former teacher, was infected shortly after a fellow nursing home resident was re-admitted from a hospital in late March, Cole said.\n\nThe nursing home staff said the other resident didn't have COVID-19 when readmitted but didn't provide many other details about the case, she added.\n\nCole, who is a nurse, cast blame for her mother's death on the entire nursing home system. It spanned from Ferncliff's inability to contain the virus to state officials' refusal to release many details about infections and deaths at the facility and others.\n\n\"The whole thing has just been handled awfully ... by everybody in regard to nursing homes,\" she said. \"It's like a slaughterhouse at these places.\"\n\nMore: Nursing homes throughout Northeast become Achilles' heel as thousands die from coronavirus\n\nWhen will it end?: Coronavirus may last 2 years, study warns. And its second wave could be worse.\n\nCole recounted calling nursing home staff about her mother and being told repeatedly that she was stable since testing positive on April 2. But at one point, several phone calls went unanswered, which Cole chalked up to understaffing over the holiday weekend in mid-April.\n\nCole said she only learned of the true situation after her mother was transferred to a local hospital's emergency room on April 14.\n\n\"My mother's hands were blue - it wasn't like a dusky shade blue, her nail beds were blue, her feet were blue, she was ice cold,\" Cole said, recalling the scene at the hospital.\n\n\"She never opened her eyes for anybody to speak with, and she was just in a horrible, horrible state,\" she said. \"I know that didn't occur over the course of several hours; that was something that was accumulating over time.\"\n\nMore: As coronavirus spreads in Delaware nursing homes, families wonder if they will be able to say goodbye\n\nCole has countless unanswered questions, including how her mother contracted the virus. She was in a private room, and staff said there was an isolation unit set up for COVID-19-positive residents, suggesting lapses in containment efforts, Cole said.\n\n\"I just felt that she wasn't being evaluated appropriately and that actions should have been taken sooner and maybe my mother would have made it through,\" she said.\n\nJon Goldberg, a spokesman for Ferncliff, which had reported six deaths as of Thursday, declined to discuss a specific resident's case, citing health privacy laws.\n\nIn general, Goldberg disputed that staffing shortages existed. He noted the facility was providing sufficient protective gear and COVID-19 testing for its residents and staff despite supply challenges caused by state and federal issues.\n\nIn an email, Goldberg wrote that Ferncliff \"has no higher priority than the health and lives of our residents and care members.\n\n\"We will continue to do everything in our power to protect, care and advocate for them, and to communicate truthfully and candidly with the people who love them and the communities we serve,\" he added.\n\nMore: Coronavirus in NY: Over 2,400 COVID-19 deaths at nursing homes, assisted living homes. See by county\n\nCentral to the nursing home crisis was the early focus on preventing coronavirus patients from overwhelming hospitals.\n\nMassive convention centers and college buildings were converted into temporary hospitals in New York and New Jersey as infections mounted, and hospitals in other states braced to handle surges in COVID-19 patients.\n\nOn March 31, the New Jersey Department of Health told the state's long-term care facilities that they could not deny admission or readmission based on a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19.\n\nThe state needed to make room in its hospitals for the growing number of COVID-19 cases and turned to nursing homes to take over the care of some patients.\n\nAt the time, Persichilli said there were restrictions in place to prevent the spread of the virus, such as placing asymptomatic residents on their own wings or floors.\n\n\"What we were encountering was that a resident would go to the hospital, be treated, recover, and [(the nursing home) would not accept the resident back,\" Persichilli said at the time.\n\n\"Part of the directive is that this is that resident's home. We keep forgetting that. They should be accepted back with the appropriate precautions,\" she added.\n\nMore: Delaware nursing homes, hit hard by coronavirus, face an uncertain future\n\nAt the time, there were fewer than 1,000 known cases in long-term care facilities, which includes nursing homes, assisted living facilities and other care homes.\n\nNot even two weeks later, the number of cases had climbed to more than 5,200, prompting the state to provide additional guidance.\n\nPersichilli on April 13 clarified that the state allowed for readmission of suspected COVID-19 patients only if they could be placed in isolation.\n\nThe order required nursing homes to separate residents in groups and designate staff for each, preventing employees from moving between patients who could spread the virus.\n\nThe separate groups are residents who have tested positive for or show symptoms of COVID-19; residents who might have been exposed to the virus; and residents who are not ill and have not been exposed.\n\nOn Wednesday, New York's health commissioner outlined similar guidelines for separating nursing home residents and staff. The advisory also reinforced prior measures taken to protect nursing homes, such as banning visitors and requiring temperature checks of staff.\n\nNew York Gov. Andrew Cuomo has said the coronavirus has proven an efficient predator that preys upon nursing home staff and residents, despite the precautions. He has also urged some nursing homes to reach out to the Health Department to help relocate patients.\n\n\"If a nursing home has a patient that they can't handle, COVID, or whatever the reason, they must refer that patient out of that facility,\" he said during a press briefing Monday.\n\nBut state Assemblyman Ron Kim, D-Queens, on Wednesday asserted the virus has exposed the poor state of many nursing homes after decades of government funding cuts and harmful regulatory changes.\n\n\"These tragedies in nursing homes are not accidents, they're the outcome of bad policy decisions,\" he said during a press briefing to announce new legislation seeking to improve care and transparency at nursing homes.\n\nIn Pennsylvania, 461 - one-quarter of the state's roughly 1,900 long-term care centers - had at least one COVID-19 case, according to state health data.\n\nPennsylvania is among the states where health officials are allowing licensed long-term care facilities to continue admitting new patients, including those discharged from hospitals but unable to go home and to readmit current patients after hospital stays.\n\n\"This may include stable patients who have had the COVID-19 virus,\" according to a copy of March 18 guidelines the state department of health issued.\n\nThe reasoning for allowing readmissions, according to the guidance, was \"to alleviate the increasing burden in the acute care settings.\"\n\nState health officials also directed long-term care centers to employ \"normal discharge-to-home\" criteria to assist in long-term care bed availability.\n\nPennsylvania Health Department spokesman Nate Wardle said the department is aware of the \"significance\" of COVID-19 in long-term care facilities and is working to assist them as individuals are discharged from hospitals.\n\nMore: NJ nursing home crisis deepens as coronavirus death toll mounts among residents, staff\n\nNursing home leaders contend state and federal officials have failed to provide adequate resources and guidance during the pandemic.\n\nFrom insufficient coronavirus testing and personal protective equipment shortages, they said the dereliction of duty helped ignite and fuel the outbreak in nursing homes.\n\n\"Frankly, I think we've been neglected, and we're still neglected,\" said Dr. Elaine Healy, vice president of the New York Medical Directors Association.\n\n\"When the focus started being put on us through the efforts of the press, the response has been to sort of look at us in a negative way,\" she said, citing New York authorities launching investigations into COVID-19 deaths at nursing homes.\n\n\"This is really a series of forest fires burning in different facilities that we didn't start,\" she added.\n\nStrikingly, Italian officials issued similar orders for nursing homes to admit coronavirus patients on March 8, a move under investigation by authorities for contributing to potentially preventable deaths, according to the Associated Press.\n\nDespite push back on state decisions to send infected patients into nursing homes, some administrators say there was no other option.\n\n\"Our facilities were ultimately the release valve\" for overwhelmed hospitals, said Jordan Strohl, the administrator at The Actors Fund Home in Englewood in Bergen County, the epicenter of the outbreak in New Jersey.\n\n\"When we heard from them how bad it was and how bad things were there, I felt like it was our obligation to step up and do the right thing,\" he added.\n\nStrohl converted half of the 25-bed sub-acute care building to care for COVID-19 cases, hiring a contractor to install airlocks to prevent contamination. He offered hazard pay and incentives to keep his staff on the job and had nurses volunteering to work with residents on the COVID-19 wing, he said.\n\nStrohl said The Actors Fund Home was likely better prepared than some other nursing homes in the state, and still, residents' relatives were concerned about the state's order to admit patients with known cases.\n\nOne person suggested flying sick residents out to the USNS Comfort, the U.S. Navy hospital ship docked in New York Harbor at the time, he said. But that was outside of Strohl's authority, so he did what he could.\n\n\"I tried to write back to every single person,\" he said. \"I said, 'I understand your concern, but I will tell you this is the best way to take care of them.'\"\n\nNurse practitioner Lisa Kaplewicz at the Tarrytown Hall Care Center in Westchester Couty said an issue for residents is when they have to leave the nursing to go a medical appointment.\n\n\"That's a concern because they have the exposure to other people in the community that might potentially be asymptomatic carriers, so we have to presume that there's been an exposure,\" she said.\n\n\"We have to isolate these residents within our facility to prevent transmission to the other residents that are here.\"\n\nSome nursing homes in New Jersey also adjusted to care only for COVID-19 patients, according to Theresa Edelstein, senior vice president of the New Jersey Hospital Association.\n\n\"Nursing homes that care for COVID-19 patients are playing a very important role in preserving access to care,\" she said.\n\n\"Not every COVID patient discharged from the hospital can go directly home. For those who need additional skilled nursing care, our nursing homes have been there.\"\n\nSome experts have called on New York to pursue COVID-19 only facilities for infected nursing home residents, such as those in New Jersey, Massachusetts and Connecticut.\n\nMore: Coronavirus: Dozens of NY nursing homes have clusters of COVID-19 deaths. See the data here.\n\nCuomo this week said some hospitals are designated as COVID-19 only, but the state has not released any details on them.\n\nAnd others want the state to at least test everyone in every nursing facility for coronavirus. Dutchess County in the Hudson Valley said it will look to test all residents at its 13 homes.\n\n\"We have seen the ravaging toll COVID-19 has taken on nursing homes throughout our nation, and we are taking proactive steps to ensure we save lives,\" said Dutchess County Executive Marc Molinaro, whose father recently died from the virus.\n\nMask safety: How to clean, reuse or hack a coronavirus mask\n\nIn Maryland, Gov. Larry Hogan enacted an executive order on Wednesday requiring universal testing of all residents and staff at Maryland nursing homes, regardless of whether they are symptomatic.\n\nNursing home outbreaks represent 19% of all total positive cases in Maryland and 46% of all deaths. There have been outbreaks or clusters of cases at 278 different facilities across the state, including 4,011 confirmed cases at 143 different Maryland nursing homes.\n\n\"Even when best practices and care is in place, this virus may still be transmitted by asymptomatic staff, meaning that every patient interaction comes with some risk,\" Hogan said at a press briefing.\n\nImpacted facilities are also required to provide regular updates to their residents, resident representatives and staff regarding COVID-19 infections, a measure that New York officials required this month amid calls for improved transparency.\n\nUnder the executive order, any nursing home staff who test positive will be immediately discharged into isolation. It will also be mandatory for facilities to cooperate with strike teams deployed by the state.\n\nMore: Breaking down Maryland's coronavirus data on individual nursing homes, other facilities\n\nThe strike teams will be supplemented with newly-created \"bridge teams,\" which will provide emergency clinical staffing to facilities in crisis.\n\nMeanwhile, New York on Wednesday revised guidelines preventing COVID-19 positive nursing home employees who are asymptomatic from returning to work for 14 days from the first positive test date.\n\nPreviously, the workers could return in seven days based on Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidance, according to a letter issued by the health commissioner.\n\nHealth experts asserted improved testing and clearer guidance on isolation will be key to limiting the death toll in nursing homes.\n\nAs the virus is spreading, it is very hard to know what the threshold for stopping admissions should be particularly if adequate COVID-19 testing is not available for residents and staff, said Summer Johnson McGee, the dean of the School of Health Sciences at the University of New Haven in West Haven, Connecticut.\n\nBut McGee believes if new admissions were stopped after the first positive case was identified, it may have given facilities better ability to contain its spread.\n\n\"Many facilities are at 100% capacity, which means there were no beds to create isolation units,\" she said.\n\n\"Nursing homes should be working to create excess beds to be able to isolate healthy patients in local hotels or surge capacity venues.\"",

    "Coronavirus in your car? Here's how to protect yourself.": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "Dog owners know all too well about the problems of shedding in the car, but another kind of shedding presents an even stickier problem: people shedding SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19.\n\nEvery time we cough or sneeze, we spew a whole slew of aerosols into the air. Some are big enough that you can see them ejected out of someone's mouth or nose. Some are \"big\" in an aerosol physics sense but still invisible to the naked eye, and those settle onto surfaces rather quickly. And some are small enough that they can float around in the air.\n\nWhat you might not know, though, is that this isn't happening only when you cough or sneeze. You also release aerosols when you're just talking and even when you're just breathing normally.\n\nThat presents a particular problem for this virus for three reasons:\n\n\u25baMany, if not most, who get it are asymptomatic so have no idea they have it.\n\n\u25baPeople can shed a high viral load from their throat before they have symptoms.\n\n\u25baThere is evidence that this asymptomatic transmission is happening, a lot.\n\nOutdoors, the shedding of virus during normal talking is not much of a problem, because we can social distance, and the wind dilutes airborne virus quickly.\n\nEven indoors, the average bedroom has a volume of about 1,000 cubic feet of air. This volume of space, combined with a typical home that has an air exchange rate of about 0.5 air changes per hour (meaning half the air in the house is changed with outdoor air every hour), can help dilute the virus.\n\nBut what about inside our cars?\n\nThe typical family car interior has a volume of about 100 cubic feet, a 10th the size of a bedroom. And we might cram four, or sometimes five, people into that small space. It's impossible to social distance.\n\nDoctors: Violent trauma will surge amid coronavirus upheaval. We're already seeing it.\n\nHere's the potential problem as it relates to COVID-19. Over the decades, we've done a really nice job of sealing up our cars. Ever notice how quiet they are on the inside these days? That's because every effort has been made to seal up every gap possible so there are better acoustics. The result is that the ventilation rate -- how much fresh air comes into the car -- can be quite low.\n\nTo show what this means for COVID-19 and to give you a simple step to protect yourself and others while in a car, we modeled a simple scenario: riding in car for 80 minutes with an infected passenger who seems fine other than coughing every few minutes.\n\nHOTLINE: Share your coronavirus story\n\nWhen the windows are closed, SARS-CoV-2 (in fine aerosol particles) accumulates in the car cabin. With each new cough, the concentration builds up with no significant dilution happening. But even cracking one window open just 3 inches can keep this at bay.\n\nSo the next time you're in the car -- be it your own vehicle with others or in a taxi, Uber or Lyft -- it's all the same advice: Open up the windows just a bit, even if everyone is feeling fine.\n\nIf you're using your air conditioning or heat and want to keep the windows closed, make sure the car is not in recirculating air mode -- select the mode that brings in fresh outdoor air. Having everyone in the car wear a mask can also help and is a must in a taxi or ride-share vehicle.\n\nWhen will I get my stimulus check: We answer this and dozens more of your most-asked questions\n\nLastly, bringing in more outdoor air only addresses airborne transmission. There are many high contact surfaces inside a car for droplets to land on, so wash your hands after your trip.\n\nDrive safe!",

    "Coronavirus in your pets? Veterinarians say you shouldn't be too worried, share signs to watch for": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "But veterinarians say there isn't too much for owners to worry about when it comes to the family pet and coronavirus.\n\nJessica Romine, DVM specialist in small animal internal medicine at Specialty and Emergency Pet Hospital in Southfield, Michigan, said if any household pets are at higher risk of exposure, it is cats due to the similarity in lung enzymes between humans and felines.\n\nBut even then, the risk of any pet having a severe case of coronavirus, the way humans are experiencing, is low, Romine said.\n\n\"The cats that they've seen, and this includes the tigers that they've found at the zoo, other cats in New York City that have come back positive and shown mild signs, seem to be much, much more mild than people,\" she said.\n\nThink of it numerically: To date, there have been more than 981,000 confirmed cases in the U.S., yet just one dog and a few cats are confirmed to have the virus.\n\n\"The likelihood your pet is going to get sick or come down with coronavirus is so small,\" said Keith Cook, co-owner of Southgate Animal Hospital. \"Right now, fortunately, that doesn't need to be one of our worries, there are much more important things to worry about.\"\n\nHere's what you should know about pet health in the age of coronavirus:\n\nRomine said COVID-19 symptoms in pets closely resemble the well-known symptoms in humans: cough, fever and runny nose. All symptoms are likely to be relatively recognizable and mild, she said.\n\nThere are a variety of respiratory diseases that could cause similar symptoms that are more common, which a vet would likely check before testing for coronavirus, Cook said.\n\nIf you believe your pet is showing symptoms and may have been exposed to coronavirus by someone confirmed with it, let the vet know upfront before bringing them in.\n\nThe good news? No. The bad news? You could give it to your pet, Romine said.\n\n\"There seems to be no evidence that pets can be giving it to people, so they shouldn't be a risk for them licking us or getting it from them,\" she said. \"If anything, it would be the other way around, that a sick person could give it to their own cat or dog potentially.\"\n\nThere is no evidence to date that pets can infect their owners, so there is no concern about animals being asymptotic and transmitting it the way humans do.\n\nOwners should think of their animal as they would any other surface. The virus can live on their fur, like it would a countertop, but likely does not survive for very long.\n\nVeterinary services are considered essential under most stay-at-home orders, but there are some changes. Most animal hospitals and veterinary offices are limiting pets they can see to those who are ill. If you need to take your pet to the vet, call ahead to schedule an appointment.\n\nWhen you arrive, call the vet to let them know you are there and they will ask questions about the pets history and reason for visit over the phone, before coming out to pick up the pet and bring them in. The owner stays in the car for the duration of the appointment to limit themselves and those in the office.\n\n\"It's a change in routine, but it's allowing us to continue to provide all of the level of care that we need to for our animals, while trying to minimize our risk and theirs,\" Romine said.\n\nTreat your pet as you would anyone else in your household and social distance.\n\n\"If you've been diagnosed with coronavirus, don't cuddle and hug your pet, don't possibly expose them,\" Cook said. \"In some cases, they're even recommending social distancing on a walk -- just like you are social distancing, the same thing with your pets.\"\n\nBefore anyone in the household even gets sick, Michigan Humane Society recommends having a plan in place for where the pet could go and an emergency kit of supplies prepared.\n\nThere is a COVID-19 test for pets that uses similar technology to the test used in humans, Romine said. If there is serious concern that the pet has been exposed and is showing symptoms, the test can be administered.\n\nHowever, Cook said other causes will likely be checked before moving to a pet coronavirus test.\n\nOverall, the risk and concern with pets and coronavirus is currently low.\n\n\"Certainly keep an eye on your pet, but I think the risk is very low,\" Cook said. \"The major concern should really be the health of themselves and their families. We are here for their pets when they need us, but the risk of coronavirus is very low and should not be something that they need to be really worried about.\"",

    "Coronavirus is a traumatic illness that could leave millions with PTSD": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "COVID-19 has infected nearly 5 million people globally and killed almost 323,000. It can devastate a range of organ systems, including the lungs, the kidneys and the cardiovascular system.\n\nBut for those who get very sick and are lucky enough to recover, the virus carries another potential danger -- to mental health. Hundreds of thousands of COVID-19 survivors could be at risk for symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder. As the number of infections continues to rise steadily, this potential hazard will also grow.\n\nWe have long known that being critically ill can lead to symptoms of PTSD, including chronic fear, arousal and avoidance. The reasons for this are complex. Having a life-threatening illness that requires intensive care can be terrifying. These patients are facing the possibility of their own death in a situation in which they have ceded control of their own bodies to strangers, often in painful or unpleasant ways. They often can't move, they are intubated, and they receive medications that make them feel sick or cause them to drift in and out of consciousness.\n\nThis nightmarish experience is often the everyday reality of being hospitalized with serious illness. These patients can also fall into a delirium and, after they recover, they are disturbed by vivid memories of these hallucinations and misperceptions.\n\nIt also appears that being critically ill, particularly with severe infections that cause inflammation, can prime the brain to remember traumatic experiences. The brains of many of these patients are deluged with adrenaline, the fight-or-flight neurotransmitter. After all, what is more urgent than trying to stay alive? Adrenaline activates the amygdala, the fear center of the brain. When this happens, a person's memories tend to be strongly encoded. This is a key reason that people tend to remember so much about traumatic experiences.\n\nMany seriously ill patients can also experience a burst of inflammatory chemicals that triggers an additional adrenaline spike. On top of that, many of these patients suffer a dangerous drop in blood pressure, which is often treated with, you guessed it, a shot of adrenaline. As a result, many seriously ill people, including those with COVID-19, have very high levels of adrenaline, which likely affects how they experience the already distressing ordeal of being sick in the hospital.\n\nAs a psychiatrist who often sees survivors of critical illness, I am very familiar with these problems. In some ways, being seriously ill can resemble combat, another common cause of PTSD: In both cases, people feel extreme fear, intense arousal and a sense -- often quite accurate -- that they have little control over their own fate.\n\nGiven these circumstances, it makes sense that many hospitalized COVID-19 patients could be at risk for PTSD symptoms once they recover. The problem may be exacerbated because most hospitals are not allowing any visitors for these patients, so most of them must suffer alone, without family or friends.\n\nResearch suggests that PTSD symptoms are particularly common in people who survive acute respiratory distress syndrome, or ARDS, in which the lungs fill with fluid and breathing becomes difficult. Oxygen is central to life, and we have evolved to prize it intensely. Anyone who has gotten something caught in their throat knows how terrifying this feeling is. Now imagine that sensation lasting for days or weeks.\n\nIt cannot be ignored: During coronavirus isolation, treating mental health issues through telemedicine is vital\n\nOf course, ARDS is a hallmark of severe COVID-19. Many such patients must be attached to ventilators in order to breathe. A tube is inserted deep into their throats, which can give them the sensation of being choked. Often, these patients must be sedated and restrained to keep them from pulling the tube out in a panic.\n\nThe problem may extend beyond the hospital. The health care system has been stretched so thin that many COVID-19 patients with serious symptoms don't go to the hospital at all. Some describe struggling over days to breathe freely. This group could also be at risk for persistent emotional effects.\n\nBecause COVID-19 is so new, there is little research on its mental health consequences. A study of over 700 COVID-19 patients by Chinese researchers, published in March in the journal Psychological Medicine, found that an astounding 96% of them had significant PTSD symptoms during quarantine. This rate is much higher than what researchers typically find for non-COVID critical illness survivors. Most researchers agree that 20% to 25% of such patients end up with PTSD symptoms.\n\nThe high rate found in the Chinese study could be due in part to the fact that these patients were quarantined for weeks in hospitals, apart from family and friends. The United States has not used this strict approach. Nevertheless, not all of these patients had a serious illness. In that region of China, anyone who tested positive for COVID-19, whatever their symptoms, was quarantined.\n\nA second crisis: Mental illness is epidemic within the coronavirus pandemic\n\nPTSD after critical illness is treatable, with strategies similar to those used for PTSD triggered by other circumstances. For many patients, a combination of medication and psychotherapy can, over time, ease or eliminate symptoms. But because the problem remains unfamiliar to many doctors, including most psychiatrists, many of these patients don't receive the help they need.\n\nIt is impossible to know how many Americans will ultimately be infected with COVID. But as the partial reopening continues, the number will likely stretch into the millions. Not all of these people will become seriously ill, of course, but many will. One recent paper from the Annals of Internal Medicine estimated that about 9% of patients infected with COVID-19 require intensive care. Of those, tens or perhaps hundreds of thousands could end up with symptoms of PTSD.\n\nOver the coming months and years, we will need to make sure that we focus on the mental health of these patients, providing the support they need to recover, not only physically but emotionally as well.",

    "Coronavirus is still spreading, but here's how states can open safely": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "We have been at this for a number of difficult weeks since the global coronavirus pandemic began, and it has taken a toll.\n\nIt has been a time of unprecedented challenge. To our health. To our jobs. To our social connections. To our health care communities.\n\nWe have sacrificed with great unity to #StayHome in order to reduce the infection rate and save lives.\n\nWe want a sense of normalcy back -- to go to work, to go to restaurants, to see sports again, to send our kids to school, to hug our families -- but not at the expense of the lives of our friends, families and neighbors.\n\nWe want a good economy and public safety, but we are afraid if we open too quickly, or don't have plans to adjust if spread recurs, we will have neither.\n\nWe don't believe we need to wait until everything is completely perfect or there is zero risk before we open again. The reality is that many states are already taking the first steps toward opening, and this must happen in the safest way possible.\n\nAmericans should still #StayHome whenever possible and continue social distancing. Now we need to get on a path to #OpenSafely that gets it right.\n\nCOVID-19 is still spreading, but at a steadier rate. While it is shrinking in places like New York, it is still growing rapidly in some areas where there had been fewer cases. The virus is still equally contagious. The virus is still lethal to many. The virus still spreads through unsuspecting asymptomatic people. Some places are especially hard hit: nursing homes, meatpacking plants, prisons, detention centers, public housing, and the communities around them as people move in and out. People are still dying at an alarming rate, and that will continue unless we follow the path like the one outlined by Dr. Deborah Birx at the White House: a steady, gated reopening that avoids accelerated growth in cases, hospitalizations and deaths.\n\nTens of millions of Americans are now out of work. Many businesses have closed; others are in danger. Americans are facing hunger and the inability to pay their rent or mortgage at levels not seen here since the Great Depression. Congress and the administration have passed laws to support Americans through this, but support isn't the same thing as a job. And the support still leaves voids that need to be filled.\n\nYet opening the country before we have the conditions like those outlined in the White House plan can put Americans at risk unless we take further steps. It won't help the economy if we end up having to pull back hard or close again because the virus starts spreading toward the point where it threatens our health care systems and further disrupts our health. The things that will bring us back -- consumer spending, business hiring, signing leases, travel and capital investment -- won't happen unless Americans feel confident they can do these things without a substantial risk of harm to themselves or their loved ones from getting and spreading COVID-19.\n\nWe are asking decision-makers at all levels to #OpenSafely -- to move along the path of opening up our communities again as deliberately as necessary and as quickly as can be safely accomplished.\n\nOpening up safely means:\n\n\u25baFollowing the plan laid out by Dr. Birx to begin opening communities up with two weeks of declining case counts and the other gating criteria met -- or explaining how there is an alternative plan for containment if that condition is not met.\n\n\u25baCreating adequate diagnostic testing availability so that people who need a test can get one -- particularly people with symptoms, and those without symptoms in high-risk settings like nursing homes, prisons and meatpacking plants.\n\n\u25baImplementing improved safety standards and protocols to avoid outbreaks and slow spreading in potential hot spots.\n\n\u25baHaving adequate public health infrastructure to contact trace and offer voluntary isolation to contain the virus when it is detected -- not necessarily to trace all cases successfully, but enough to minimize potential outbreak clusters and keep getting better over time.\n\n\u25baProtecting vulnerable and at-risk populations and hard-hit communities, and not putting essential workers at needless risk.\n\n\u25baObtaining sufficient personal protective equipment (PPE) to protect our first responders and health care workforce, including by expanding access to testing in the community\n\nAs the reopening process begins and moves forward, states should be carefully monitoring hospitalization trends and their hospital capacity. If the rise in cases is on track to threaten hospitals' capacity to care for COVID-19 or other acutely ill patients in the state, states should immediately take steps to slow or pause reopening efforts. The lag between infection and serious complications is typically eight days or more, so there is little time to wait if such trends emerge.\n\nAdditional important areas to make progress on that will reduce risk of transmission and support continued opening up:\n\n\u25baWidespread use of high-quality masks.\n\n\u25baSurge capacity in the health care system with sufficient PPE to protect health care workers.\n\n\u25baEvidence-based mitigation measures and screenings in offices and public spaces, using guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or comparable ones.\n\n\u25baControls at major air and rail entry points.\n\n\u25baContinuous monitoring at the state and county level for indications of potential emerging outbreaks, including symptom-checking apps, digital thermometers and other syndromic surveillance tools as they become available.\n\n\u25baTest, trace and isolate most active cases and their closest contacts, using vacant hotel space where necessary.\n\n\u25baCoordinated response with neighboring states.\n\n\u25baWidespread use of telemedicine to improve health care access and reduce the use of PPE.\n\n\u25baReadiness to respond quickly to new community spread.\n\nAreas that can most safely open up (with appropriate distancing and risk mitigation steps) if states have met the Dr. Birx gating criteria but have not yet initiated the reopening process are:\n\n\u25baDoctor offices, clinics and surgery centers with sufficient community PPE.\n\n\u25baWorkplaces like retail and manufacturing.\n\n\u25baParks and other outdoor recreation, lakes, gardens and bike trails.\n\n\u25baShopping areas and coffee shops where people don't congregate in large numbers or for extended periods.\n\n\u25baOutdoor weddings and funerals with small groups that physically distance and wear masks when close together.\n\nAdditional areas that we hope can open up successfully under significantly modified conditions, but that will benefit from further technical assessment on how processes should be modified that would allow them to operate with lower risks:\n\nAreas that should remain closed until risks can be significantly reduced:\n\n\u25baLarge-scale events like concerts, sports with high attendance\n\n\u25baLarge conventions and other activities involving significant travel and congregation\n\nWe believe these lists can be refined and adjusted locally based on conditions, proximity to hot spots, density and other factors.\n\nWe are asking public officials and decision-makers to #OpenSafely by quickly getting the conditions in place so we can move forward. We are encouraged that other countries, including Germany, Italy and New Zealand, as well as parts of the United States, are implementing strategies to begin to open safely and closely monitor a step-by-step opening. We believe a safe step-by-step opening can happen across the United States.\n\nWe believe Americans want to remain united in the fight against COVID-19, as we were in the initial response after 9/11.

    "Coronavirus new symptoms, Kim Jung Un health, Chris Matthews harassment: The weekend's biggest news": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "Just shy of 1 million confirmed cases of coronavirus in the United States, a leading health expert says the country is \"near the end of the beginning.\" Tom Inglesby, director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, said Sunday the COVID-19 outbreak has reached a plateau in new cases but probably will not ease much before Memorial Day. This is in contrast to Vice President Mike Pence's claim that the U.S. would \"largely have this coronavirus epidemic behind us\" by the holiday.\n\nChills, repeated shaking with chills, muscle pain, headache, sore throat and a new loss of taste or smell. Those are the six new symptoms the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is cautioning could be signs of the coronavirus. The additions come as health experts' understanding of the deadly disease continues to evolve and confound. The CDC previously listed fever, cough and shortness of breath as symptoms.\n\nThere are more than 956,000 confirmed coronavirus cases in the U.S., according to the John Hopkins database, with the death toll surpassing 54,000. Globally, there are more than 2.9 million confirmed cases and 205,000 deaths.\n\nFractures in leadership between local, state and federal governments are creating an uncertain path toward reopening the country. Georgia has become a high-profile outlier after it set in motion aggressive plans to ease stay-at-home restrictions, over the objection of some local officials -- even President Donald Trump. Mayor Van Johnson, of Savannah, Georgia, asked local churches to remain closed over the weekend, and Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms urged residents to stay home.\n\nMost states have favored a slower, more gradual approach. Many announced in recent days a framework for reopening, often with tentative dates or benchmarks where restrictions may be relaxed.\n\nIn New York, one the states hit hardest by the coronavirus, the daily death toll dipped to 367 -- the lowest one-day total in weeks, Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Sunday. He said hospitalization and testing numbers continue to show improvement and that the state agrees with federal guidelines for 14 days of declines before reopening begins.\n\nMaryland Gov. Larry Hogan, a Republican who has butted heads with President Trump over his messages about the coronavirus, urged the nation's chief executive to use \"fact-based'' information in his media briefings. On Thursday, Trump pondered the possibility of introducing disinfectants or ultraviolet light into the human body to kill the coronavirus, which Hogan said prompted hundreds of calls into his state's emergency hotline inquiring about ingesting Clorox or cleaning products as a treatment. \"I think when misinformation comes out or you just say something that pops in your head, it does send a wrong message,\" Hogan said.\n\nThere has been lots of confusion around the health and whereabouts of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. Last week, South Korea's government said it had no information to corroborate a media report suggesting Kim was gravely ill after he reportedly underwent heart surgery this month. On Sunday, the Associated Press reported a train likely belonging to Kim has been parked at his compound on the country's east coast since last week, satellite imagery showed. The speculation about his health has been caused, in part, by a long period out of the public eye.\n\nIn his first interview since resigning over inappropriate comments about a female reporter's appearance, former MSNBC anchor Chris Matthews said the reporter's complaint about him was \"highly justified.\" Speaking to Vanity Fair's Inside the Hive podcast, Matthews, 74, acknowledged both that he made inappropriate workplace comments. \"I accepted the credibility of the complaint in the article. I didn't want to challenge the person that made the complaint and wrote the article. I thought it was very credible and certainly within the person's rights to write that article, of course. That was highly justified.\"\n\nThat's a wrap. The 2020 NFL draft has a bow on it. That means it's time for instant gratification: report cards for all 32 teams. Who got an A? Who got an F?

While the number of jobless claims is dropping, economists say the labor market will continue to struggle despite states gradually reopening their economies.\n\nAlso Thursday, President Donald Trump's former personal lawyer Michael Cohen will be released from a New York federal prison because of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nThe number of confirmed coronavirus cases around the world surpassed 5 million early Friday, according to a Johns Hopkins University data dashboard. The United States accounts for over a fifth of them with more than 1.5 million confirmed cases.

Instead, Luis Mu\u00f1oz ran 5,100 laps from his porch to make it happen.\n\nStaying Apart, Together: USA TODAY brings a newsletter about how to cope with these trying times straight to your inbox. \ud83d\udce5\n\nAt least 5 million people are known to have been infected with the coronavirus, according to the Johns Hopkins University data dashboard, showing the massive global reach of the pandemic.\n\nEpidemiologists say the number of cases around the world may actually be far higher than what is known as testing capacity lags, some countries may not be fully reporting data and people sick with the virus may not seek a test or may be asymptomatic.\n\nThe virus first broke out late last year in Wuhan, China, before it traveled to Europe, ravaging Italy and Spain, then heading to the United States, where New York City became the new epicenter.\n\nThe nation's top infectious disease specialists, including Dr. Anthony Fauci, have warned that a second wave may be coming in the fall and winter if the United States reopens too quickly and without the proper testing and contact tracing infrastructure in place.\n\nAs states continue to reopen, some cities are closing down streets to allow restaurants to have al fresco dining.\n\nThe city of Cincinnati closed 25 streets in Over-the-Rhine and the Downtown area so restaurants can have additional space when they reopened last week. Indoor dining will resume Thursday in Cincinnati with some restrictions like tables being 6 feet apart and physical barriers.\n\nIn California, Long Beach was one of the first cities in Los Angeles County to approve a plan that will close streets for outdoor dining. Similar to Cincinnati, the city's Open Streets Initiative will close down streets in the next two weeks to allow restaurants to use, including sidewalks and parking lots, for outdoor dining.\n\nTampa Mayor Jane Castor created a similar program that began May 5, and has recently announced that it will extend through May 26 because of its popularity, reports the Tampa Bay Times. Many other cities, like Chicago and Indianapolis, will also follow suit in the upcoming days.\n\nLooking forward to hitting the local public swimming pool for the first time this summer? Prepare to put a face mask in your tote bag, although you won't need to wear it in the water.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention published new guidelines for operating swimming pools during the coronavirus pandemic. The documentation arrives just a few days before Memorial Day weekend, when many outdoor pools typically open for the summer season.\n\n\"There is no evidence that the virus that causes COVID-19 can be spread to people through the water in pools, hot tubs, spas, or water play areas,\" the CDC said on its website. \"Proper operation and maintenance (including disinfection with chlorine and bromine) of these facilities should inactivate the virus in the water.\"\n\nNevertheless, the agency said, \"While there is ongoing community spread of the virus that causes COVID-19, it is important for individuals as well as owners and operators of these facilities to take steps to ensure health and safety.\" Here are the guidelines.\n\n- Jayme Deerwester\n\nOhio and West Virginia will reopen restaurants for indoor seating on Thursday, one day after Connecticut took its initial reopening steps and Delaware reopened retail businesses by appointment only.\n\nMore changes are coming on Friday: Alaska will resume life as it was \"prior to the virus,\" with a full reopening of the economy without restrictions; Iowa will reopen movie theaters, museums and zoos; and Kentucky will allow restaurants to operate at 33% capacity indoors with unlimited outdoor seating. Find the latest news in your state\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has always warned that \"it may be possible\" to become infected with coronavirus by touching contaminated surfaces or objects. It just \"does not spread easily\" in that manner, the agency now says, nor by animal-to-human contact, or vice versa.\n\n\"COVID-19 is a new disease and we are still learning about how it spreads,\" says the CDC's recently updated guidelines. \"It may be possible for COVID-19 to spread in other ways, but these are not thought to be the main ways the virus spreads.\"\n\nDr. John Whyte, chief medical officer for the healthcare website WebMD, told Fox News that the CDC's slight update brings clarity and helps to reduce fears. \"Many people were concerned that by simply touching an object they may get coronavirus and that's simply not the case. Even when a virus may stay on a surface, it doesn't mean that it's actually infectious,\" Whyte was quoted.\n\nThe CDC still warns that the main way the virus is spread is through person-to-person contact, even among those who are not showing any symptoms.\n\nPresident Donald Trump said Wednesday he will complete his regimen of hydroxychloroquine \"in a day or two.\"\n\nTrump said Monday he was taking the drug, which he has repeatedly touted as a treatment for the coronavirus despite warnings about its effectiveness and side effects, to prevent contracting COVID-19.\n\nTrump, who according to the White House has tested negative for the disease, stirred up a storm by saying he had been taking the drug daily for about a week and a half as an added measure to avoid being infected by the virus.\n\n- Savannah Behrmann\n\nThe number of Americans filing new unemployment claims will likely continue to drop, but it's still expected to reach the millions as the economic toll from the coronavirus pandemic ticks on.\n\nBetween 2.3 million and 2.8 million Americans filed initial applications for unemployment insurance last week, economists estimate. That's down from the 3 million who filed claims the week before and the record 6.9 million who sought assistance in late March.\n\nBut if the latest tally, which the Labor Department reports on Thursday, matches estimates, it will mean roughly 39 million Americans have applied for unemployment in just nine weeks, a staggering number that reflects a jobless rate that is the highest since the Great Depression.\n\n- Charisse Jones\n\nFootball players as well as men's and women's basketball players will be allowed to resume voluntary on-campus workouts beginning June 1 after getting the OK from the NCAA Division I Council on Wednesday.\n\nThe move lifts a prohibition that has been in place since March, when the coronavirus pandemic resulted in a variety of actions shuttering college sports, including the cancellation of the NCAA basketball tournaments.",

    "Coronavirus on cruise ships: Royal Caribbean plans to bring crew home": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "Royal Caribbean, in conjunction with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, has made a plan to repatriate its crew members back to their respective home countries - including those from the U.S. - as the coronavirus pandemic lingers.\n\nWhile the cruise industry has managed to disembark passengers from ships, it has struggled with how to remove thousands of crew members.\n\nAcross 26 cruise ships, 25,000 Royal Caribbean crew members have completed 14 days of in-room quarantine and are now practicing social distancing, according to an internal letter to crew from Michael Bayley, Royal Caribbean president and CEO, and obtained by USA TODAY. Five crew members are being treated in isolation with flu-like symptoms, which are similar to those of COVID-19.\n\nNearly 9,100 crew members have returned home, including 398 Americans, by commercial flights and private transport.\n\nRoyal Caribbean crew members come from 60 countries, and returning them home means following 60 sets ofrules.\n\n\"What we've learned over the past month is that one simple question - how do we get you home? - turns out to be incredibly complex to answer,\" Bayley wrote in the letter.\n\nHere's the breakdown of when remaining American crew members aboard the Royal Caribbean fleet can return home. Bayley noted that plans are subject to change:\n\nThe letter also indicated that one employee had died this month after being hospitalized for several weeks and that the company was mourning \"the loss of several of our colleagues over the past two months.\" It did not say whether they had COVID-19. USA TODAY has reached out to Royal Caribbean for more information.\n\n\"Our hearts and prayers go out to his family, friends and colleagues, including his two brothers, who also work for the Royal Caribbean family,\" Bayley wrote in the letter of the recently deceased employee \"We have all been traumatized by this terrible time and it is our shared commitment to each other that will help us journey to better times.\"\n\nThe CDC will only allow the line to disembark crew if company executives guarantee crew members won't use public transportation, public airport terminals or interact with rental car companies or restaurants on their trips home, among other stipulations. The cruise line and company executives are subject to criminal penalties such as imprisonment if crew members break those rules. Still, Bayley said the line would agree to the terms to get crew off the ships.\n\n\"Over the past several days we have discussed our concern with the CDC on the criminal penalties associated with guaranteeing future events that we had little to no control over,\" Bayley wrote in the letter. \"We remain hopeful that this language will eventually be adjusted.\"\n\nThe CDC is \"pleased\" the cruise line decided to take the steps to safely disembark crew and is ready to review the cruise line's submissions, spokesperson Scott Pauley told USA TODAY. \"CDC is committed to helping crew members disembark and return home to their families as quickly and safely as possible while protecting their health and the health of the communities to which they will be returning,\" Pauley added.\n\nThose who don't want to leave ships don't have to, Bayley wrote, and added that more than 1,000 have requested to remain aboard.\n\nAs for when the ships might cruise again? Royal Caribbean spokesperson Jonathon Fishman told USA TODAY: \"We have not yet determined our return to service date. Right now, we are focused on developing additional measures to further protect our guests and crew. We look forward to providing great service to our guests when we return, we and can't wait to set sail again.\"\n\nCarnival Cruise Line announced Monday it plans to resume some of its North American cruise service this summer starting Aug. 1\n\nCleaning a floating petri dish: How is a cruise ship sanitized after a coronavirus outbreak?\n\nYes, it's happening: Carnival Cruise Line plans to resume some North American cruises in August amid coronavirus",

    "Coronavirus on cruises: Are cruise ships unsafe? Can they change?": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "LOS ANGELES - One of the last cruise ships bound for the U.S. arrived Monday with 115 passengers after an around-the-world cruise cut short by coronavirus fears.\n\nNow the Pacific Princess will join the fleet idled by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's latest order that all cruise ships stand down for more than three months before setting sail again. It's hoped that will be enough time to get over the worst of the pandemic that swept through passengers and crews with devastating results.\n\nThe coronavirus has proven to be a crisis like no other. Not another economic downturn. Not another outbreak of norovirus. It's yet to be seen if the industry can find a way to reassure passengers, many of them senior citizens who are in a high-risk group for COVID-19, that cruising is safe and to formulate a comeback, which could include new health-safety improvements.\n\nThe CDC lists 20 vessels in which the coronavirus became the uninvited guest when they visited U.S. ports under its jurisdiction. There were many more ships ravaged by the virus around the world. With COVID-19 cases aboard, some ships became unwanted nomads with country after country refusing to let them anchor or tie up to discharge passengers.\n\nMore: Cruisers not deterred by coronavirus pandemic, still booking future voyages\n\nTwo passengers died aboard the Coral Princess, and another passed away later at the hospital after tying up in Miami. Passengers started falling ill after the ship left Chile, with countries refusing to allow passengers disembark as it sailed north.\n\nAfter COVID-19 cases were identified on Princess Cruises' Grand Princess, the ship was forced to steam in circles off San Francisco while a plan was formulated to isolate passengers coming ashore.\n\nFour passengers died aboard Holland America's Zaandam as it worked its way up from Chile, eventually being allowed to discharge passengers in Florida. Three of the deaths were later linked to COVID-19.\n\nThe Pacific Princess left Fort Lauderdale, Florida, for its global voyage Jan. 5. Sailing west, its 111-day cruise was cut short when fears of the coronavirus swept through the industry. Most passengers flew home from Fremantle, Australia. The rest, deemed unfit to fly but not infected by the coronavirus, came home to Los Angeles with the ship.\n\nStaying Apart, Together: A newsletter about how to cope with the coronavirus pandemic\n\nThe basic problem is that cruise ships place hundreds or thousands of guests into a relatively small space with megaships playing a prominent role in the industry. Royal Caribbean's 1,188-foot Symphony of the Seas, for instance, can accommodate nearly 9,000 people between both passengers and crew.\n\n\"Like other close-contact environments, ships may facilitate the transmission of respiratory viruses from person to person through exposure to respiratory droplets or contact with contaminated surfaces,\" Aimee Treffiletti, chief of the CDC's Vessel Sanitation Program, told USA TODAY.\n\nCruises, with a more-the-merrier philosophy, are never a solitary affair. The fun centers around myriad group activities in a nonstop-party atmosphere. It might be sipping cocktails around the pool, filling showrooms for Las Vegas-style revues, dancing, lectures, playing games or other activities. Lavish buffets, a cruising mainstay in which guests crowd around serving tables, are another opportunity for viruses to spread.\n\n\"The nature of cruise ships is when there is a virus, it spreads like wildfire,\" said Mike Winkleman, a Miami-based maritime attorney who has filed lawsuits seeking class-action status against cruise lines concerning the coronavirus on behalf of both passengers and crews.\n\nUphill battle: Centuries-old laws may shield the cruise industry from huge payouts in coronavirus suits\n\nThe cruise industry was already plagued by a reputation for outbreaks. Norovirus sickened 129,678 cruise-ship passengers between 2008 and 2014 out of 74 million who set sail over that period, the CDC says. The virus, leading to symptoms like nausea, stomach aches, vomiting and diarrhea, ruined many a vacation, but is rarely fatal.\n\nHave fun, but don't get sick! How cruise ship passengers should prepare for illness or injury\n\nNorovirus is spread by contact with an infected person, contaminated food or water or a contaminated surface, which can happen on land as well as sea. But besides close quarters, passengers aboard cruise ships are constantly going between decks and having to steady themselves by grabbing handrails, chair backs or just about any other fixed object when a ship rocks in heavy seas.\n\nCoronavirus is far more deadly. Since it's spread primarily through tiny droplets produced by coughing or sneezing, it can be contracted not only from touching surfaces but also from merely being downwind of an infected person. Even worse, many people who contract coronavirus may not show symptoms immediately, or at all.\n\nCOVID-19, thus, was unlike anything the cruise industry had ever encountered.\n\n\"COVID-19 is a new disease, and we are still learning about how it spreads and the severity of illness it causes,\" CDC's Treffiletti said. \"Like outbreaks in shoreside communities, COVID-19 cases on cruise ships may not have been able to be avoided at the beginning of the pandemic.\"\n\nSome aboard may be more vulnerable than others, a report found. Those in crew cabins and congregating in restaurants are most at risk for respiratory infection, found a 2015 study in the journal Indoor and Built Environment by Qingyan Chen, a Purdue University professor, and two others.\n\nThere are no easy defenses. Quarantining passengers suspected of having a respiratory illness or requiring masks for crew members \"could reduce the attack rate only to a moderate extent,\" the study warned.\n\n\"It's an inherently high-risk setting,\" said Dr. Claire Panosian Dunavan, professor of medicine emeritus in the infectious diseases division of UCLA's School of Medicine. \"Everyone was worried about norovirus. Respiratory infection has always been the scariest prospect as far as I was concerned.\"\n\nPanosian Dunavan saw it firsthand aboard an otherwise well-maintained ship with ample hand sanitizer dispensers a couple of years ago. She said her husband contracted human metapneumovirus, a respiratory illness, toward the end of the cruise.\n\nA cruise ship involves \"a lot of people crammed together touching the same surfaces,\" Panosian Dunavan said. As for COVID-19, she added, \"I think this is the virus that is revealing the inherent vulnerability of this popular form of travel.\"\n\nIt's possible that the cruise industry could do a better job of filtering air aboard ships, though there is no proof air-conditioning systems can transmit the coronavirus. Modern jetliners, like Boeing's 787 Dreamliner, run cabin air through high-efficiency particulate air, or HEPA, filters. Boeing says they are \"effective at removing bacteria, viruses, fungi.\"\n\nThe CDC's and industry's answer to health issues on cruise ships, both now and long before COVID-19 came along, is the Vessel Sanitation Program, or VSP. It was created by the CDC in the 1970s in response to gastrointestinal outbreaks on cruise ships. Today, it sets a standard for health practices from stem to stern, whether it's food contamination, pool and spa water quality, ventilation or pest control.\n\nInvestigation: Princess Cruises had high rates of illness even before coronavirus\n\nThe industry's trade group, the Cruise Lines International Association, points to VSP as putting ships a cut above, \"a level of federal scrutiny that is unique within the travel and hospitality industry,\" said Bari Golin-Blaugrund, senior director for strategic communications at CLIA. \"There is no similar federal program for hotels, airlines or restaurants.\"\n\nShe said crews regularly clean and sanitize handrails, door handles, faucets and other commonly touched surfaces multiple times a day. In addition, crews attack the possibility of an outbreak other ways, such as \"strict laundry protocols\" aimed at eliminating viruses and bacteria on soft surfaces such as sheets. After a cruise ends and before the next set of passengers arrive, ships are cleaned from top to bottom, she added.\n\nBut against the coronavirus, even those thorough procedures and others, like checking passengers' temperatures as they come aboard, clearly weren't enough.\n\nPrincess Cruises' Grand Princess started having suspected cases of the virus reported last month after a passenger on a previous cruise had fallen ill. Though that man had disembarked, dozens of passengers remained on board for a second voyage on the ship. On its second sailing, 21 people on board had tested positive by the time the ship was allowed to dock in Oakland, California. Passengers who weren't infected were sent to military bases to go into quarantine.\n\nThe CDC says one ship, the Carnival Valor, had three back-to-back cruises in which cases of the coronavirus were reported.\n\nIn an interview with Axios on HBO last month, Carnival Corp. CEO Arnold Donald said while there is \"lots of social interaction,\" overcrowding isn't the issue on ships. They are \"not a theater. It is not an arena. It is more like Central Park. There's a lot of natural social distancing, the ships are large, people are not always gathered and clumped together.\"\n\nIn a more recent interview with CNBC, Donald predicted cruising will bounce back despite multiple cruise ships having been stuck at sea with ill passengers and turned away from ports in multiple countries. \"Social gathering at some point will return, and when it does, people will want to cruise,\" he said, noting reservations for cruises next year are up even as ships shut down operations after the CDC issued a new 100-day \"no sail\" order that went into effect April 15.\n\nA Morgan Stanley industry note to investors on April 8 obtained by USA TODAY revealed customers are optimistic. They are still booking cruises from July onward. Many of them are re-bookings of canceled cruises.\n\nVeteran cruisers aren't deterred from taking the vacations at sea.\n\nAlan Podrid who, with his wife, Sharon, endured the ordeal aboard the Coral Princess without becoming ill, though they were confined to their cabin for six days.\n\nThe Podrids have taken 45 cruises, after returning home to Marietta, Georgia, they were starting to put the experience into perspective.\n\n\"People either love it or they hate it,\" Podrid, 70, said of cruising. \"I don't think the bad publicity is really warranted when you consider the state of affairs through the country and throughout the world. Everyone is kind of finding their way through it.\"\n\nAnother Coral Princess passenger, John Hutton, 71, remained gung-ho about cruising after returning home to Oak Island, North Carolina.\n\n\"We are cruisers through and through,\" he insists. The retired school teachers who lived for 25 years in Hawaii still plan to take a Princess Cruise to Tahiti in November and to the Baltics in August 2021.\n\nTanner Callais, founder of Cruzely.com, cruises about four times a year, for work more often than vacation now, says the risk is no worse than \"being at a concert or a crowded airport.\"\n\nBut he's looking for assurances about how the industry would deal with an outbreak of similar magnitude.\n\n\"I'd also like to know there is a plan to deal with any potential illness instead of seeing ships stranded for days looking for a port to accept them,\" he said.\n\nCruisers not deterred by coronavirus: Still booking future voyages, experts say\n\nWhile CLIA has not yet come out with any long-term changes on ships in response to the coronavirus outbreak, some may be on the table.\n\n\"As cruise lines begin planning for the future, they are exploring ways to go further still to improve upon their already robust public health protocols, including additional screening requirements and enhanced sanitation measures,\" Golin-Blaugrund said Monday.\n\nThe CDC confirms that plans are coming and noted they will be similar to protocol already in place to address gastrointestinal illnesses on board.\n\nWhen the CDC issued its no-sail order extension on April 9, it required all ships in U.S. waters to create plans to address coronavirus prevention and response.\n\n\"Ships are currently formulating similar plans to address outbreaks of COVID-19, and these plans could also be modified to prevent and respond to other communicable illnesses in the future,\" Treffiletti, chief of the CDC's Vessel Sanitation Program said.\n\nIt's yet to be seen what those tougher measures could include. If rapid testing for the coronavirus becomes more readily available, that's a possibility. It's unclear whether crew or passengers would ever be required to wear masks on board.\n\nCruise lines \"have a duty to mitigate foreseeable risks,\" said Jeff Ment, an attorney who specializes in representing travel companies. It \"requires a plan, screening people, kicking off people who are sick.\"\n\nAny obvious health risks, like shared serving spoons for buffets, are likely to disappear, he added.\n\nCruise operators may feel compelled to require more social distancing, especially in dining rooms or theaters. But limiting the number of customers plays havoc with profitability.\n\nHe also thinks cruise lines may improve air filtration on ships and beef up medical facilities. Some luxury cruises attract a high-end clientele, yet \"you don't know much about what's in a medical facility on ships.\"\n\nAttorney Winkleman is hopeful that the industry will make necessary improvements.\n\n\"I think the industry has to learn its lesson and do more to keep their passenger safety the midst of an outbreak,\" he said.",

    "Coronavirus peak: Is America ready for second wave in the fall?": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "Paul Romer, a Nobel Prize-winning economist, envisions a day when all Americans are tested regularly for COVID-19, and they present proof when dining out or visiting a dentist.\n\nMichael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, said that if a \"big peak\" of coronavirus floods hospitals this winter, \"we have the potential here to go through days we have not seen since World War II. ... As a nation, we will not be ready.\"\n\n\"What we're experiencing is a massive global destabilization of all our systems,\" adds Brian David Johnson, a futurist and director of the Threatcasting Lab at Arizona State University. \"We actually don't know all the damage that has happened. We're on life support, globally.\"\n\nIf the world premiere of COVID-19 caught you off guard, you may need to get prepared for a sequel.\n\nMany scientists believe the pandemic likely will dissipate over the summer only to return late this year in a second wave that could be worse than the first. While that outlook is no certainty - just one of several plotted by public health experts - disaster planning is all about anticipating worst-case scenarios.\n\nSo, with months to go before a possible Round 2, is the United States prepared - medically, economically and emotionally?\n\nThe leading answer from epidemiologists, economists and futurists: probably not. But tomorrow depends in part on what we do as individuals, communities and a nation.\n\nThe destabilization described by Johnson is glaringly evident in three realms:\n\nMedicine. Some U.S. hospitals, hit with patient surges in COVID-19 hot spots, warned of running out of ventilators, personal protective equipment and other supplies. The Strategic National Stockpile was nearly emptied. Thanks to a global manufacturing binge, supplies appear to be catching up and, in key locations such as New York City, the disease is abating for now. But, if the coronavirus returns with a second wave, will the health care system be ready?\n\nThe economy. Unemployment is higher than any time since the 1930s. Businesses - from mom-and-pop shops to major corporations - are going under. Global trade is crippled. Travel, sports and entertainment industries are mostly dormant. How much more financial trauma can the economy endure?\n\nEmotional damage. Psychological, social and political strains of the coronavirus, though not easily measured, are palpable products of a medical and economic nightmare. If the pandemic gets worse down the road, threatening our fabric of work, schools, homes and governance, will Americans be ready?\n\nPreparedness is not easily defined. In biblical lore, Egypt endured 10 plagues - water turning to blood, swarms of locusts, even an infestation of frogs - and it's still around.\n\nBut, if COVID-19 has delivered any lesson, it may be the value of looking ahead at a nation's ability to absorb catastrophic shock.\n\nEach time COVID-19 takes another World War II veteran, 'we lose a part of history'\n\n'This is not the time to do nothing': Volunteers risk lives to deliver food to the needy\n\nOn the health care front, it's crucial to recognize that COVID-19 is, as University of Michigan epidemiologist Arnold Monto puts it, \"a very strange virus.\"\n\nIts origin, transmission, symptoms and damage remain puzzles. And its future seems to defy computer modeling. Because of that, experts start any conversation by warning that the first wave is still cresting and that predicting the future of the coronavirus is a fool's game.\n\n\"If you don't express doubt about what's going to happen, you really haven't done your job,\" noted Monto, who has consulted for the World Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control. \"My take is you have to keep an open mind and prepare for all eventualities.\"\n\nMonto and others point out that COVID-19's threat could be blunted by the development of a vaccine or a treatment.\n\nBut many epidemiologists share the view of Anthony Fauci, the nation's top infectious disease expert, who testified during a congressional hearing Tuesday: \"The idea of having treatments available or a vaccine to facilitate reentry of students into the fall term would be something that would be a bit of a bridge too far.\"\n\nAmid coronavirus: AP exams went online and had tech problems. College Board says it's investigating.\n\nIn the absence of a panacea, public health experts say, comprehensive testing is the immediate solution. It would allow disease tracking and quarantines to significantly dull a second COVID-19 spike. Most argue that testing and tracing is the most important step in controlling the disease. But they also contend those efforts have been a bust in the United States so far.\n\n\"We still haven't gotten our act together,\" said Irwin Redlener, director of the National Center for Disaster Preparedness at Columbia University. \"I think it's inevitable that we're going to have a second, if not a third, wave\" because of the nation's \"erratic and disorganized policies.\"\n\n\"The biggest single failure was the lack of testing in this country,\" agreed Eric Toner, senior scholar with Johns Hopkins University's Center for Health Security. \"That influenced every single other thing that has gone wrong. ... And we still have problems in testing.\"\n\nUntil the disease can be monitored and controlled, Toner warned, \"we need to be really careful about dialing back social distancing. It has been amazingly successful - more effective than I thought it would be.\"\n\nMonto's big fear is a resurgence of COVID-19 coinciding with a deadly flu outbreak, overwhelming hospitals, health care workers and supply systems. \"If they're all synchronized, it may really break down,\" he said. \"To me, that's the worst-case scenario.\n\nI don't think we're ready now.\"\n\nWithout a vaccine or treatment, and with testing problematic, hospital preparedness looms crucial.\n\nBut questions about medical supplies lead to a dead end. It's not clear how many ventilators or personal protection outfits would be needed, how many are now in stock, or how many may be produced by a ramped-up manufacturing system during the coming months.\n\nIn mid-April, Toner estimated supply demands in the United States for a 100-day surge of COVID-19: 4 billion gloves, 321 million gowns and 179 million medical-grade masks. But those numbers are no longer valid, he said, and the actual need is unclear.\n\nEven if an accurate count was available, there is no national inventory showing the volume of supplies on hand.\n\nNor is there a calculation of worldwide manufacturing increases amid the crisis, which could meet the demand.\n\nIn a National Action Plan for medical preparedness issued this month, Toner and other researchers at Johns Hopkins portray the U.S. health care system almost like an intensive care patient who is bleeding out - desperately needing an infusion of money to restock supplies and reinforce staffing.\n\nWhile a federal bailout bill provides $175 billion to cover losses, the report says, that's not nearly enough.\n\nWhile the price is high, authors concluded, \"it will certainly cost less than the trillions now being spent spend because our public health and health care system was not prepared or equipped for this pandemic.\"\n\nIn a recent op-ed for The New York Times, Romer and fellow economist Alan Garber wrote about the dueling threat coronavirus poses to America's public health and financial well-being. While shutdowns may allow some people to survive, they concluded, \"it is our economy that will be dead.\"\n\nIn an interview, Romer said that whether COVID-19 stays on its present course or ebbs and surges, the nation faces an unemployment rate of 30%, yet people seem to think it will just go away allowing life to resume as before.\n\n\"There's this optimistic bias, and a certain amount of denial,\" he said. \"With no change in policy, they're just not going back to those jobs ... and there's a good chance those jobs won't be there.\"\n\nUnless or until a vaccine is developed, Romer said, the only hope is a biweekly testing requirement for everyone, with those who have the disease going into isolation.\n\nAn alternative would be to choose the economy over safety. But Romer said that raises a tragic question: \"Are we willing to accept 2,000 deaths a day for months on end?\"\n\n\"The longer it goes on, the more it's going to imply we're just not coming back to the same place,\" agreed Ken Rogoff, economics professor at Harvard and former chief economist for the International Monetary Fund.\n\nWhile declining to give the nation a letter grade for preparedness, Rogoff said COVID-19 has undermined much of the planet's economic structure. As one example, he said, \"we're going to see just a collapse of global trade. We may have a world where (nations) ... become more like fortresses.\"\n\nRogoff praised the \"drastic measures\" taken thus far in the United States to fight the pandemic, including huge relief allocations. But such tactics cannot be sustained, he said, and leaders in Washington, D.C., seem unequipped for prolonged viral waves. \"The problem is, where is the economy heading?\" Rogoff said. \"Are they mentally prepared for that? I doubt it. ... It's not going to be easy, because the political system is really fragile.\"\n\nColin F. Camerer, a professor of behavioral finance and economics at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, said COVID-19 may require intense, short-term pain to achieve a long-term gain. He and others pointed to South Korea as a model nation that used comprehensive testing and strict social distancing to weather the economic storm while limiting infections. By contrast, Italy and the United States - which were slow to test or take precautions - have suffered heavy casualties and economic damage.\n\n\"The No. 1 thing is to get the first wave over, and then prepare for the second one,\" Camerer said.\n\nAlmost everything about American life has changed: jobs, schools, homes, churches, entertainment.\n\nPsychiatric journals are churning out articles on suicide and mental health problems triggered by fear, financial ruin and social isolation. An already polarized political system seems utterly askew, with dueling versions of reality. And the internet's output of conspiracy theories, lies and apocalyptic visions has gone on steroids.\n\nJohnson, the futurist at Arizona State University, said it's not yet clear how we're handling the first go-round of coronavirus, let alone additional waves. But upheaval is coming.\n\nAfter the 9/11 attacks, Johnson noted, there were changes - from sweeping anti-terror legislation to relatively small things, like footwear: \"We've normalized taking off our shoes at the airport.\"\n\nWhile Johnson prefers to focus on human resiliency, he acknowledged doomsday visions are part of the profession. With COVID-19, he said, \"there are ways of looking at this destabilization where it does not restablize.\"\n\nThomas Frey, a futurist and founder of the DaVinci Institute in Colorado, said the pandemic may be \"the most explosive crisis in all of world history\" - a potential paradigm shift not just economically but culturally.\n\nFundamental gestures, such as the handshake, are likely to vanish or change.\n\nYet Frey also questioned whether worldwide \"hysteria\" over the disease is rational, and he suggested that shutting down a country may be overreactive unless the death toll borders on 1 million.\n\n\"It's a bizarre balancing act we're trying to maneuver,\" he said. \"I think our emotional preparedness - societal preparedness - I'd give that a failing grade. I actually don't see us having the political will do go through this again.\"\n\nNancy Berlinger, a research scholar with The Hastings Center, a non-partisan bioethics institute in New York, said it's clear America is not ready for a second viral peak \"because we were not prepared for the first.\"\n\nBerlinger, who lives in one of the world's hardest-hit communities, speaks with evangelical passion about displaying virtues during catastrophe times: Compassion. Open-mindedness. Unselfishness.\n\nWhile the pandemic has created wrenching dilemmas for leaders, she said, daily personal decisions such as social distancing also fall within the ethical prism, and selfishness may empower a pandemic to take more lives, cause more suffering.\n\n\"It's about the moral choices each and every one of us make,\" Berlinger said. \"I hope we will in every way possible have a stronger sense of who our neighbor is, who our fellow citizen is.\"",

    "Coronavirus post-lockdown economy: Hard choices and high spending": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "President Donald Trump wants to restart the economy by ending the lockdowns and getting people back to work. However, based on U.S. spending, employment and consumption data, the economy started crashing well before lockdowns began in mid-March. Demand for transportation and other services began to collapse in mid-February and early March due to COVID-19's dangers, and isn't likely to naturally return to pre-crash levels until the risk of the virus recedes.\n\nIn late February through early March, COVID-19 deaths in the United States were about 20 to 30 per day. The daily U.S. death toll is now 1,000 to to 2,000 (and tens of thousands of Americans require hospitalization for severe symptoms). Polling data show that many Americans are reluctant to resume discretionary activities under the current circumstances. For example, 72% of fans in a recent survey said they wouldn't attend a game at a stadium until a vaccine is available.\n\nSo even if all mandatory lockdown measures end, the economy won't bounce back to January 2020 levels. The Economist described this scenario as a \"90% Economy\" -- technically open, but (due to COVID-19 risks) operating at only about 90% of capacity, with high unemployment rates.\n\nAnd this is the optimistic scenario.\n\nIf daily deaths and hospitalizations increase exponentially after mandatory lockdowns end, the economy will shut down again, either from renewed government-mandated lockdowns or chaotic spontaneous lockdowns as people fear leaving their homes. Economically, this could create an even more devastating downward economic spiral.\n\nPerhaps COVID-19 will rapidly become less dangerous, maybe treatments will become more effective, a vaccine will quickly become available or some other deus ex machina will solve this crisis. However, we don't prepare for war by assuming a best-case scenario about our enemies. We shouldn't make policy based on best-case assumptions about COVID-19.\n\nAt the federal level, here's how we should prepare:\n\n\u25baSupport state and local governments by replacing tax revenues they've lost due to COVID-19. Because they are the first responders, we must ensure they're well-resourced. As we try to restart the economy, the last thing we need is large-scale layoffs that impact vital employees like teachers and police, fire and sanitation workers. Well-functioning and safe schools are vital to restarting the economy (if parents can't send their children to school in the fall, it will be difficult for society to resume normal activities).\n\nWe should also provide generous support for our public colleges and universities. They're where many middle-class Americans get their education, and where much of our cutting-edge basic research takes place. We can't afford to lose a generation of talent if these universities collapse and have to be rebuilt. Also, as large local employers, they bring significant economic benefits to their communities.\n\n\u25baInvest in public health and health care. Trump called Americans warriors in the fight against COVID-19. We send our soldiers into combat with the best protection possible, and a guarantee of the best health care available if they're wounded. COVID-19 requires the same commitment to America's workers and consumers.\n\nCoronavirus economy: We're in for a painful slog, not Trump's fast, 'spectacular' recovery\n\nThe best chance to get the economy back on track is to make the workplace and consumer environments as safe as possible. A national Test, Trace, Isolate and Treat program,is an urgent priority. Health care is our frontline and it must be well-funded. In this crisis, we can't guarantee Americans' safety against COVID-19, but we must guarantee they'll have health care coverage to battle its effects.\n\n\u25baInvestments and policies that help our economy adapt. Businesses should get tax credits (and other incentives) to make workplaces as safe as possible for workers and consumers. Also, we should facilitate moving unemployed workers to jobs where they're needed (in one example, Amazon has already added 100,000 workers). Finally, we need tax incentives and other legislation to rebuild inventories of Personal Protective Equipment, and move supply chains back to the United States for products vital to our national security.\n\n\u25baInvesting in infrastructure. With low interest rates and slack in the economy, it's time for the long-delayed push to fix our infrastructure. Money invested in infrastructure will generate current employment and make our nation function better in the long run. This push must also include our digital infrastructure, at the federal, state and local levels. Many government computer systems are antiquated and not fit-for-purpose. They should be replaced before the next crisis.\n\nWe should also accelerate providing broadband infrastructure for low-income rural and urban communities. We might be in for a prolonged period of distance learning and/or remote work -- and no family should be left behind due to inadequate digital infrastructure.\n\n\u25baMaking hard choices about industries that might not come back. Respectable business leaders predict that the airline industry might not come back for years, if ever. My point isn't to target airlines, but rather to emphasize that we must make some realistic decisions about which industries are no longer viable or need to transform radically to survive.\n\n\u25baTemporary Universal Basic Income and/or generous unemployment benefits. This would put a floor under everyone. If jobs don't exist, we can't let people starve. And we need their participation in the economy to keep other people employed.\n\n\u25baTargeted aid to actual small businesses, like local restaurants, and less to big companies. The aid should be focused on helping them transition to more appropriate business models, and distributed in a manner that's transparent and non-corrupt.\n\nBeating back COVID: In war on coronavirus, recruit army of contact tracers to guard against a counterattack\n\nIf this looks expensive, well,, it is. On the other hand, currently the U.S. government can borrow money for 30 years at just 1.4%. Financially, this is a good time to invest in infrastructure, public health and the education of future generations. If we don't make these investments now, we're potentially looking at a multi-year Great Depression.",

    "Coronavirus quarantine, school closures: Kids mental health will be OK": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "When Tamar Canady thinks about the upsides to the coronavirus pandemic, she thinks about how she and her 15-year-old daughter sleep in more these days.\n\nBut the downsides are difficult.\n\nElla Canady, like many teens, often hides her emotions. But recently at her home in Phoenix, she's had some uncharacteristic breakdowns in front of her mom. She misses her friends. And school -- the real kind, not the kind where she sits in front of a computer for five hours daily.\n\n\"I'm sorry,\" Tamar says as she soothes her daughter. \"I know you didn't want this.\"\n\nNobody knows when or if life will return to normal after the coronavirus pandemic. But as the weeks of stay-at-home orders and school closures continue nationwide, parents are questioning whether isolation measures and physical distancing are doing lasting damage to their kids' emotional development.\n\nWill this generation grow up fearful of touching or standing too close? Will they know how to make friends or interact in group gatherings? And how will it affect their academics and job prospects?\n\nPsychologists and economists are still gathering data, but here's the consensus for the short-term: Most of the kids will be all right.\n\nSome experts see young children poised to bounce back better than adolescents and teens, who are going to face some stress. But in general, children's resilience is inherently tied to the stability and safety of their families.\n\nThat's why children from families who are already vulnerable -- with the tightest finances, facing job losses, food insecurity, housing instability or fractured relationships -- are likely to fare the worst and will need the most help. Without solid emotional and financial supports, those children are likely to face the biggest blow to their social, psychological and academic development.\n\nThe COVID slide: How school closures will cause 'historic academic regression'\n\n\"We really are facing two crises,\" said Ariel Kalil, a developmental psychologist at the University of Chicago and director of the Center for Human Potential and Public Policy. \"We have the economic crisis, but we also have this school crisis that will have uneven impacts, depending on a family's income.\"\n\nIn general, high-income families will have the means and habits to make up for school closures. But low-income families will face more stress and have less access to resources.\n\n\"They'll have fewer habits and supports for stimulating their children in the home environment to make up for that schooling loss,\" Kalil said.\n\nA cheap, easy way to reach parents:Reading rates and attendance shot up when schools texted moms\n\nLife may be weird right now, but many kids will build resiliency through this period, child development experts say.\n\nThere's no precedent in the research literature for this kind of collective impact. But social and emotional outcomes for children will depend largely on how close they are to stress and how long it lasts, the stability of the resources around them and the presence of relationships that help moderate the stress, psychologists say.\n\n\"I don't think this is going to have an everlasting effect,\" said Seth Pollak, a psychology professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and director of the Child Emotion Lab. Much of his work focuses on how disadvantaged children develop. But he suspects affluent, college-bound students will emerge just fine.\n\n\"Most kids will ride this out and probably write some interesting college application essays about it.\"\n\nSome may delay college: Coronavirus could change where students go to college, if they go at all\n\nFor toddlers, life during coronavirus is giving them exactly what they yearn for: The ability to more fully attach themselves to their parents stuck at home, said Amy Learmonth, a psychology professor at William Paterson University of New Jersey who studies children.\n\n\"I would not worry about the little ones, even though they're driving their parents nuts,\" Learmonth said. \"In the infant and toddler phase, it's kids' goal in life to have their attachment figure close to them.\"\n\nA guide to coronavirus for kids: Here's what you need to know\n\nLearmonth said she worries more about children in their tween years, who are pivoting from having family members at the center of their social interactions to placing peers in that role. Adolescents and teens are figuring out how to make and be friends with people because they share commonalities, not just proximity.\n\n\"They're the ones who are probably suffering most in the short-term,\" Learmonth said. \"What they're learning in the hallways of middle school is vastly different from what they're learning to do in a virtual group chat with friends.\"\n\nFor some kids who associate those hallway interactions with stress or anxiety, quarantine has actually provided some relief, said Tim Kearney, chief of behavioral health at Community Health Center, Inc. in Middletown, Connecticut. The organization serves students' mental health needs at about 100 school-based sites across the state.\n\nBut many other children are struggling with the loss of face-to-face time with peer groups, as well as the loss of other school and community rituals, Kearney said.\n\nFor Alina Tran, a senior at East Haven High School in Connecticut, her biggest worry before COVID-19 was picking out a college. Now she's worried about keeping her Advanced Placement course grades above a C while trying to finish her senior year online. Tran places a lot of pressure on herself and dreams of becoming an optometrist.\n\nShe's attended art therapy sessions for years at school to help manage her stress. Now those therapy sessions, hosted by Community Health Center, have moved to Zoom. Last week, Tran met online with three other students and a therapist while drawing from their homes and bedrooms.\n\n\"I don't know what to do with myself,\" said Tran, who found herself too out of sorts to even doodle. But she held up a painting from a previous week, where the prompt was to place a lighthouse in an incongruous setting. Tran painted it into a meadow.\n\n\"My parents didn't graduate from college,\" she said. \"I'm really stressed about it. And with this whole pandemic, and with visiting colleges and everything getting canceled, I don't really know a good way to transition to college.\"\n\nNothing about college is normal right now: Stunned by coronavirus, a college town slowly awakens to a surreal world\n\nTran's therapist assured her that her feelings were normal and encouraged her to make time for creativity to help stay calm.\n\nIt's actually good advice for everyone. Kearney said adults can best help their kids by staying focused on the present, and by getting physical and mental exercise daily.\n\n\"One thing that helps is for parents to exercise creativity: 'Let's have a dinner from such-and-such a country, let's eat food that's all the same color, let's have a picnic in the bedroom,' \" Kearney said.\n\nParents should also consider relaxing limits on screen time, he added. Social media can provide kids with a much-needed connection to peers and social groups, especially for those who can't safely go outside.\n\nSocial media could be teens' saving grace: How students are staying connected remotely during isolation\n\nKearney and other child psychologists worry most about children from the most challenging circumstances.\n\n\"I have kids I'm treating who are going stir crazy because they haven't gone outside in three weeks,\" Kearney said. \"They don't have a yard, a patio or a balcony, and if they open the door to the hallway, there are lots of people milling about.\"\n\nThey may not have internet, either: Students are learning from quarantined worksheets, Wi-Fi in school parking lots\n\nNew data from a study following service-industry workers in one large American city paints a particularly worrisome picture of their mental and economic well-being.\n\nThe study was designed to track families where at least one parent worked in the service industry -- in normal times. But the arrival of the pandemic allowed researchers to survey families before and immediately after the public health crisis shuttered most of the American economy.\n\nThe blow was immediate: More than 4 out of 10 households experienced a layoff between February and mid-March, said Anna Gassman-Pines, an associate professor of public policy at Duke University and a co-author of the research. Her partner is Elizabeth Ananat, an economist at Barnard College.\n\nBy early April, layoffs had occurred in almost 6 in 10 households being studied.\n\nThe job losses were accompanied by a spike in severe mental health symptoms. About 10% of parents reported feeling anxious or depressed all day at the end of March, up from 6% of parents who reported feeling that way a month prior, the results showed.\n\nChildren felt worse, too. About 20% of them started chronically misbehaving at home, their parents reported, a jump from 14% the month prior, Gassman-Pines said.\n\n\"What was surprising to us was just how quickly families' well-being took a hit after the full extent of the crisis started to take place,\" Gassman-Pines said.\n\nResearch shows economic downturns are linked with a host of bad outcomes that hit vulnerable families hardest.\n\nDisadvantaged youth who experience community downturns in their formative years are more likely to have lower test scores and lower college rates of college attendance, Gassman-Pines added. And even if children don't have a family member who loses a job, they tend to do worse in school and life when many people around them experience unemployment.\n\nThe most dramatic solution won't be cheap: Gassman-Pines said policymakers need to be thinking about how to get more cash to low-income families as quickly as possible.\n\n\"The majority of these people responded that they cannot pay for groceries this month,\" Gassman-Pines said. \"Same with rent and mortgage. They are really needing resources for those.\"\n\nCoronavirus stimulus checks: For many, the money is missing. Where is it going?\n\nContact Erin Richards at (414) 207-3145 or erin.richards@usatoday.com. Follow her on Twitter at @emrichards.",

    "Coronavirus strains are mutating. Are some more dangerous than others?": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "SAN FRANCISCO -- The coronavirus is mutating as it spreads across the planet, with a strain that may first have appeared in Europe becoming dominant in many areas even as new ones appear. The still unanswered question is how the strains differ and whether they cause additional, and more severe, illnesses.\n\nSeveral recent studies have identified mutations of the original SARS-CoV-2 virus that emerged in China and causes COVID-19. The strains are very similar but represent slight changes in the virus' makeup.\n\n\"That could explain why we're seeing such different outcomes between San Francisco and New York City,\" said Alan Wu, a professor of laboratory medicine at the University of California, San Francisco's School of Medicine and chief of the clinical chemistry laboratory at Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital.\n\n\"Everybody talks about the SARS-CoV-2 virus as if it's one thing. It may be more of a problem,\" said Dr. Greg Poland, director of the Mayo Clinic's Vaccine Research Group.\n\nAll viruses mutate, especially RNA viruses such as SARS-CoV-2, said Poland. What's important is whether there's going to be a clinical significance, he said.\n\nOne potentially alarming study posted April 30 from Los Alamos National Laboratory found 14 mutations of virus circulating and warned that several had characteristics that could make them more infective. Another paper found several mutations of the virus.\n\nWu cautioned that it's too early to draw hard and fast conclusions before there's enough data to base them on.\n\n\"It's a lot more complicated than either of these two papers suggests,\" he said. \"Lots of labs are doing the research but they haven't yet published their findings.\"\n\nInitial results of an in-depth COVID-19 testing program in a small neighborhood in San Francisco published Monday found 2.1% were positive for coronavirus and more than half had no symptoms.\n\nSo far Wu's hospital, which sees a high percentage of poor and underserved patients, has had only two deaths and about 100 people put on artificial breathing machines due to COVID-19. New York City has seen more than 19,000 deaths according to the city's health department.\n\nThough New York's overall population is much larger - 8 million versus 880,000 - the difference is striking.\n\n\"How does that happen? It's not just density, San Francisco is the second most dense city in the nation after New York,\" said Wu.\n\nIn New York, 80% to 90% of patients on ventilators died, while at his hospital only two have, he said.\n\n\"I would love to say it's only that we did things better, but the infection and survival rates between New York and San Francisco are night and day,\" he said.\n\nMultiple labs are busy looking to see if the different mutations partly explain how the disease can be mild in some areas and so deadly in others.\n\nThere's certainly evidence that different strains are circulating.\n\nResearch conducted at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City found the variant of the virus that arrived in New York mainly came from Europe and was a mutation of one that initially arose in China.\n\nThe strain on the West Coast, which appeared in Seattle and San Francisco, is more closely linked to a variant from the Chinese city of Wuhan.\n\nTo make things more complicated, researchers at Cambridge University in England found three distinct variants of SARS-CoV-2. They called the first to appear Type A. A second variant, Type B, arose from it and became the majority form found in China. That mutated into several other types including Type C, which is the major strain found in Europe.\n\nSeveral recent papers also have found multiple mutations, though whether they are more infectious or deadly isn't yet known. Tracking the various trains also is difficult to follow because many papers identify different variants by different names.\n\nA group at Los Alamos National Laboratory identified 14 different strains of the virus, at least one of which appeared more easily transmissible than the original.\n\nThe D614G mutation described by researchers was first seen in Europe in early March and by early April its frequency was increasing. When it appeared in a new area, in many cases it became the dominant form in a matter of only a few weeks, the researchers found.\n\nBoth the original and the new strain were circulating in the English town of Sheffield and extensive testing there found that while having the mutated strain didn't correlate to a higher chance of being hospitalized, those patients did seem to have higher viral loads. Higher levels of the virus in the body are typically associated with worse outcomes.\n\nOne concern is that if the virus mutates too far from the versions currently circulating, it could affect vaccine production. A vaccine could, in essence, create an antibody that is not the virus that is circulating.\n\n\"Next fall, the vaccine might give you some immunity or no immunity,\" said Poland.\n\nAnother report, from researchers in China, found at least two major SARS-CoV-2 strains circulating there and one was more common than the other, which could mean it was better able to adapt.\n\nMultiple labs are working to analyze the genetic differences between the various strains circulating in the world to see if the levels of sickness and death can in part be explained by genetic differences in the virus itself.\n\n\"Answers will come soon,\" said Wu. \"They just haven't had time yet to publish their findings.\"",

        "body": "For years, Lallie Kemp Regional Medical Center has spiraled further into the red.\n\nThe 24-bed charity hospital in Louisiana's small town of Independence lost more than $15 million in 2016 and another $19 million in 2017, the latest public data available. Those losses represent nearly a third of the hospital's total gross revenue.\n\nThen coronavirus rocked Tangipahoa Parish, where Lallie Kemp is scrambling to help treat the community's hundreds of confirmed COVID-19 patients - many of whom are indigent and unable to pay or rely on Medicaid, which pays hospitals less than private insurance.\n\nWith government restrictions banning elective procedures - one of the rural hospital's primary money makers - the pandemic already has erased $1.3 million in expected revenue. If the quarantines continue through May, that will swell to nearly $3 million.\n\n\"We don't have any profit margin to speak of, so it will be a direct loss,\" said Chad Thompson, the hospital's chief financial officer. \"And we don't know how long this will last.\"\n\nIn rural communities across America, more than 800 hospitals like Lallie Kemp already faced financial peril before the pandemic took hold. Now, they must find a way to treat the 18,000 coronavirus patients in their communities.\n\nThose cases represented just 2.3% of U.S. totals as of Tuesday but could trigger a financial cascade that sinks up to a hundred hospitals within the next year.\n\nA USA TODAY Network analysis of financial reports submitted to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services found that almost half of the counties with coronavirus cases are served by a hospital that reported a net loss in 2017.\n\nFor 640 of these struggling medical centers, there is no other hospital in town. Nearly all of those in jeopardy are in rural counties.\n\nAs the virus spreads into rural America, sometimes weeks after urban hotspots, many small hospitals must now wrestle with the choice of laying off longtime staff members or buying life-saving supplies for frontline clinicians.\n\n\"You have a vulnerable population for COVID, and we see a situation where many of these rural hospitals won't be able to survive the pandemic,\" said Maggie Elehwany, head of government affairs for the National Rural Health Association.\n\n\"These are some of the poorest areas of the country,\" she said. \"The providers are running out of money, they're running out of supplies and they're laying off staff as this wave of COVID hits.\"\n\nThe 19 rural hospitals that shuttered in 2019 were more than any other year since researchers started keeping track - and 2020 was on pace to break that record even before the virus. States that did not expand Medicaid were hardest-hit. Some experts worry that dozens of rural hospitals could close this year if the federal response to the coronavirus does not adequately compensate for lost revenues.\n\nThe pandemic has accelerated closures in Kansas and West Virginia, while Tennessee-based Quorum Health, which operates more than 20 rural hospitals in 13 states, also filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in April.\n\nExperts fear if more of these hospitals go down, swaths of rural America will be left to defend against COVID-19 without a local medical center.\n\n\"Some places have had one funeral, then suddenly there's dozens of cases and the hospital is overwhelmed,\" said Anna Loengard, chief medical officer with Caravan Health, which manages 150 rural hospitals and primary care clinics across the country. \"You get into a situation where you really have no safety net for these hospitals.\"\n\nBatesville is a town of about 7,500 along a quiet stretch of Interstate 74 in Eastern Indiana.\n\nAmong the first areas of the Midwest to confirm positive cases, the city's 25-bed hospital was pushed over capacity as 10 new patients came in each day with COVID-19 symptoms. The closest major urban hospital is 45 miles away in Cincinnati.\n\nWithout the ability to perform elective surgeries - about half of the hospital's revenue - administrators are wondering how they will keep the doors open as their community needs them most.\n\nThe pandemic has taken its toll on the small staff at Margaret Mary Health, where doctors and nurses are treating people they have known for years. Then two of the four obstetricians fell sick with COVID-like symptoms at the same time.\n\n\"I still need to be able to deliver babies, perform C-sections or do other emergency surgeries,\" said Tim Putnam, Margaret Mary Health's chief executive. \"We have to be ready to do anything we need to do.\"\n\n\"I don't think any hospital can go for long periods of time, keeping up all of the costs we have but with only half of the revenue.\"\n\nIn 1978, there were 1.5 million U.S. hospital beds. Today, that's down to about 900,000. Some hospitals have reduced capacity in an effort to stay afloat. Others shuttered entirely.\n\nAcross the country, at least 163 rural hospitals have closed since 2005, according to the North Carolina Rural Health Research and Policy Analysis Center.\n\nNearly half of those that remain are unprofitable, the center said.\n\nResidents of these communities tend to be older, and many are poor, with more underlying chronic health conditions. Experts say a disproportionate number are uninsured, indigent or rely on Medicaid.\n\nThose same variables also make these towns more susceptible to a COVID-19 outbreak. But many rural hospitals just aren't equipped for such a pandemic.\n\nThese centers struggle to recruit nurses, physicians and technicians during the best of times. Coupled with recent layoffs, many cannot backfill staff that get sick. Some hospitals have one, maybe two ventilators. There are shortages of EMS providers, many of whom are volunteers that often are older and more at risk for COVID-19 themselves.\n\nAnd although smaller hospitals have purchasing pools for large quantities, traditional supply chains are disrupted, forcing them to turn to the government for help.\n\n\"We believe (the virus) is going to work its way everywhere,\" said Terry Hill, senior advisor for the National Rural Health Resource Center in Duluth, Minnesota. \"We're going to have to deal with this, and it's going to be backbreaking for some of the rural hospitals.\"\n\nFew hospitals across the country have the type of cash reserves needed to survive the pandemic, and rural ones are no exception despite federal laws that guarantee many of them higher payments for services.\n\nIn 2017, about 57% of rural hospitals and 40% of urban hospitals reported having enough cash on hand to cover their salary costs for at least a month, according to financial reports submitted to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.\n\nBut experts warn some smaller hospitals might have only a couple weeks, or just days cash on hand, if any at all. They're scrambling to figure out how they'll make payroll next period.\n\n\"Right now, in the next 90 days, the problem will be cash,\" said George Pink, deputy director of the North Carolina Rural Health Research and Policy Analysis Center.\n\nThe federal government relaxed rules on telemedicine, which has helped some hospitals recoup revenue from virtual patient visits. Private providers also have turned to Small Business Administration loans.\n\nBut a third of rural hospitals are community or publicly owned, so they're not eligible, according to the National Rural Health Association. For that same reason, these are also the hospitals that cannot refuse patients for their inability to pay.\n\nOf the federal government's $100 billion stimulus earmarked for hospitals, the first $30 billion in CARES Act funds was split among providers who accept Medicare. Industry leaders estimate that left between $500,000 to $1 million for every rural hospital eligible.\n\nBecause rural health care providers serve one-fifth of the U.S. population, they're lobbying for more.\n\nMany rural hospitals also tapped into a program offering accelerated advanced Medicare payments. But that money must be paid back within a year, and without additional help from Congress, many rural hospitals expect to default.\n\n\"It doesn't go as far as you would think,\" said Patti Davis, president of the Oklahoma Hospital Association. \"It's not going to be enough to sustain them.\"\n\nFederal programs like Medicaid and Medicare pay more for services at Critical Access Hospitals. Those facilities have 25 or fewer beds and serve isolated communities that would otherwise be long drives from emergency care.\n\nUnlike other hospitals that get paid a flat rate based on the average charge for service, Critical Access Hospitals get 101% of service costs. This helps ensure doors stay open and doctors are still paid during times of the year when few people visit the hospital.\n\nPerhaps because of that difference in payment strategy, two-thirds of Critical Access Hospitals reported having enough cash on hand in 2017 to pay salaries for a month, significantly more than other hospitals.\n\nBut those rural hospitals also have smaller budgets, which means the loss of even a few profitable surgeries could have significant impacts after savings disappear. In 2017, urban hospitals reported median operating expenses of $94 million, more than triple that of rural hospitals.\n\n\"Every hospital in the country is facing real financial challenges,\" said Dave Gessel, executive vice president of the Utah Hospital Association. \"It's more acute for the rural hospitals because they don't have the same backup and support networks to keep them in business.\"\n\nOzarks Community Hospital spent $350,000 to prepare for COVID-19 - doubling its bed capacity to 50, expanding the isolation ward and obtaining more ventilators.\n\nAt the same time, postponing elective surgeries has carved away nearly $7 million in revenues this year.\n\nWithout an advance from the Medicare program, the 3,400 residents of Gravette, Arkansas, would have been left without a hospital, said Paul Taylor, Ozarks' chief executive.\n\n\"We were already operating on a negative margin and struggling financially - then the virus hit,\" Taylor said. The hospital told federal officials in 2017 that it had a net loss of $36 million that year - nearly as much as its annual operating expenses of $47 million.\n\nIf Ozarks must repay the full amount of its Medicare loans, it will become one of more than 100 hospitals across the country that Taylor estimates will close within the next year. That's more closures than the previous five years combined.\n\n\"They delayed the abyss we all face,\" he said. \"But until something is done, we're all sitting here on pins and needles, wondering how we're going to pay this back.\"\n\nIn Texas, four out of five rural hospitals similarly struggled to meet payroll before the pandemic.\n\nTexas has seen at least 26 rural hospitals close since 2010 - more than any other state. Yet some rural areas are facing COVID-19 at greater rates per capita than Houston or Dallas. Overrun with admissions, one rural hospital saw its cases spike from two to more than 50 in a day.\n\n\"My fear is it will be unpredictable, sporadic and uneven - where some communities avoid it and some get wiped out,\" said John Henderson, president and CEO of the Texas Organization of Rural and Community Hospitals. \"And that's even harder to prepare for.\"",

        "body": "WOODLAND PARK, N.J. -- With coronavirus restrictions in place, interactions with nature might be limited to a quick walk through the neighborhood, but it's not hard to notice spring has sprung -- bringing allergy season with it.\n\nAllergy symptoms are likely to increase during the next two to three weeks as pollen counts grow into the thousands, said Leonard Bielory, professor of medicine, allergy, immunology and ophthalmology at Hackensack Meridian School of Medicine.\n\n\"If it wasn't for the cold snap, we'd be having an incredible amount of pollen right now,\" Bielory said Monday. \"Once it warms up, with the rain we've gotten, it's going to be quite an intense opening season for trees. It's going to explode.\"\n\nThat raises a new dilemma: Some allergy symptoms, such as coughing, mimic signs of COVID-19. So how can sufferers tell the difference?\n\nCoronavirus: These are the 6 new possible symptoms the CDC added to its list\n\nPrevention: How to clean, reuse or hack a coronavirus mask\n\nThe combination and severity of symptoms is telling.\n\nPatients with asthma or allergies who cough and experience breathlessness can resolve their symptoms with inhalers or prescription medication, Bielory said.\n\nBut if a patient has COVID-19, those solutions won't work -- and the symptoms are likely to be far more extreme. Coronavirus patients can have severe difficulty breathing. That's why many admitted to hospitals need the assistance of ventilators, which move air in and out of the lungs mechanically.\n\nPeople who develop viruses, including COVID-19, may experience an associated fever within 24 to 72 hours of infection, Bielory said.\n\n\"Fever is a major differential,\" he said. \"You don't normally get fever with allergies.\"\n\nCOVID-19 patients may also develop gastrointestinal symptoms and muscle aches and pains, according to the Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America. Up to two-thirds of them may lose their sense of smell, Bielory said. None of those symptoms is associated with allergies.",

Patients may be most infectious in the days before they began showing symptoms, studies show.\n\nThe expanded CDC list is significant: Most testing sites require a patient to have a COVID-19 symptom before the individual can be tested.\n\nThe CDC recommends seeking \"medical attention immediately\" for trouble breathing, persistent pain or pressure on chest, bluish lips or face or a new \"confusion or inability to arouse.\"\n\nAs COVID-19 has tightened its grip on the world in the past three months, medical comprehension of the virus has advanced.

    "Coronavirus symptoms; lung damage; Why COVID-19 virus is so contagious": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "MILWAUKEE - The new coronavirus has spread like wildfire, killed -- and spared -- people of all ages and all health conditions, baffled doctors, defied guidance and conventional wisdom, and produced an unprecedented array of symptoms.\n\nThere's never been a virus like it.\n\n\"This gets into every major biological process in our cells,\" said Nevan J. Krogan, a molecular biologist at the University of California, San Francisco, who has studied HIV, Ebola, Zika, dengue and other viruses over the last 13 years.\n\n\"At the molecular level, it's something we've never seen before, and then look at what it does to the body -- the long list of symptoms -- we've never seen that before.\"\n\nAs Americans debate the reopening of businesses, bars, schools and other aspects of everyday life, it's important to understand the virus we are up against and why it has sown so much suffering and confusion.\n\nAt first, the virus was thought to be mostly a risk to older adults and people with chronic illnesses; its primary point of attack, the lungs. Then 30- and 40-years-olds with the virus began dying of strokes. Recently, a small number of infected children have died of a mysterious illness resembling Kawasaki disease.\n\n'Like a war': Pfizer head of vaccines talks finding a treatment for coronavirus\n\nSymptoms of COVID-19 range from fever, coughing and shortness of breath to the loss of smell and taste and the angry red swelling that has come to be known as \"COVID toes.\" Studies have found that damage from SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes the disease COVID-19, isn't limited to the lungs; it can include the heart, liver, kidneys, gastrointestinal system and bowels.\n\nTo understand a virus' \"motivation\" -- why it does what it does -- keep in mind that it is a parasite. It lives inside its human or animal host taking what it needs at the expense of the host.\n\nAs long as it finds hosts without immunity, and as long as its own mutations do not weaken its ability to spread and multiply, the virus thrives.\n\nKey benchmarks of a virus are how widely it spreads and how deadly it is to those it infects.\n\nIn the five months since it was first identified in Wuhan, China, SARS-CoV-2 has infected more than 4.5 million people across the globe, killing more than 300,000.\n\n\"The thing that strikes me about the clinical aspect is the shear amount of transmissibility,\" said Megan Freeman, a virologist and specialist in pediatric infectious diseases at UPMC Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh.\n\n\"There are very few viruses that are more contagious than this one,\" agreed Mark Schleiss, an investigator for the Institute of Molecular Virology at the University of Minnesota.\n\nA single COVID-19 patient spreads the disease to a median of 5.7 people, making it twice as contagious as the 1918 Spanish flu, according to a report in the journal Emerging Infectious Diseases.\n\nA death crisis in New Jersey: How one mortician races to keep up with COVID-19\n\nThe rate of infection in the U.S. -- what experts are referring to when they talk about \"flattening the curve\" -- has slowed. Even so, the nation is still averaging about 1,000 COVID-19 deaths a day, roughly two 9/11 attacks every week.\n\nThousands of the world's best scientists have worked with remarkable speed seeking to understand the new coronavirus. They deciphered its genetic code in barely a week and have produced scores of papers suggesting possible treatments and vaccines.\n\n\"The canvas we call COVID-19 was blank 16 weeks ago,\" said Gregory Poland, director of Mayo Clinic's Vaccine Research Group. \"We've filled in a lot of dots, but we have so much more to go.\"\n\n\"We don't understand HIV that well in my opinion,\" Krogan said, \"and we've been studying that for decades.\"\n\nScientists know some but not all of the reasons the new coronavirus spreads so easily. Freeman points to several factors, including one that distinguishes SARS-CoV-2 from the virus it closely resembles, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS).\n\nSARS attacks the lower respiratory system, whose job it is to pull in air from the upper respiratory system.\n\nSARS-CoV-2, however, attacks the upper respiratory system, the pathway that allows air to travel in and out of the lungs as we breathe. The upper airway is also the system involved when we cough.\n\nThe upper respiratory system offers a more efficient means of spreading, Freeman said.\n\n\"That's why it is more transmissible. ... When this emerged probably there was some mutation that adapted it to use the upper airway, and the upper airway has made it very successful.\"\n\nA second difference between SARS and SARS-CoV-2 involves the bond that allows viral cells to attach to human cells and infect them. With both viruses, this bond forms between the Spike Protein on the virus and a region on the outside of the human cell called the ACE-2 receptor.\n\nBoth viruses use this bond to enter cells, but the bond is much stronger with the new coronavirus than it was with SARS. That is why many of the potential treatments so far are designed to undermine that bond.\n\n\"You always want to target the Achilles' heel of the virus, something the virus does not have the luxury of changing too much\" explained Maria Elena Bottazzi, a professor of pediatrics at Baylor College of Medicine and co-developer of a potential SARS vaccine that is going to be tested on SARS-CoV-2.\n\nAlthough public health leaders compared the new coronavirus to seasonal flu early on, coronaviruses have a special feature that separates them from other viruses like flu. They have their own proofreading system that helps limit mistakes in their genetic code known as mutations.\n\n\"Flu viruses make six and a half times more mistakes than coronaviruses do,\" Freeman said.\n\nEven as the spread of the virus slows in the United States, some researchers fear what will happen if major outbreaks hit poorer, densely populated cities in Africa.\n\n\"Look at the problems we've had,\" Poland warned. \"Now amplify that through areas that have civil wars, that have corruption, that have scarce resources. That's a humanitarian disaster in the making.\"\n\nThe virus' skill at spreading poses one challenge; what it does inside the human body poses another.\n\nMuch of what scientists have learned so far about the new coronavirus suggests that it is a remarkable destroyer at both the micro and macro levels, decimating individual cells and entire organs.\n\nAt the molecular level, the virus disrupts some of the most fundamental functions of life: cell division; the system cells use to talk with one another; and their ability to make proteins.\n\nThe proteins our bodies make help us carry out almost every human action from eating and walking to breathing and thinking.\n\nOnce a person ingests the new coronavirus, it enters the lungs and directly infects the air sacs, the microscopic workhorses that take in the air we breathe. In serious cases, the air sacs fill with fluid, leaving less and less room for oxygen. This is a feature of what is known as COVID-19 pneumonia.\n\nThe pneumonia can lead to Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome, a severe breathing condition that deprives the vital organs of oxygen.\n\nA healthy blood oxygen level is usually between 95% and 100%. Below 90% is low. Some COVID-19 patients have been found to have blood oxygen levels below 65%.\n\nAs the air sacs are infected and damaged, this triggers the immune system, which can lead to a dangerous condition called a cytokine storm. In a cytokine storm, the immune system goes into overdrive and winds up killing both healthy and diseased cells.\n\nOne of the most subtle and deadly offshoots of low blood oxygen is a condition called silent hypoxia.\n\nAs described by emergency room doctor Richard Levitan in a commentary in the New York Times, silent hypoxia allows patients to develop low blood oxygen levels without realizing the problem until it dips into dangerous territory. They breathe faster to compensate for the lack of oxygen but are unaware they are breathing faster.\n\nLevitan suggested that people can bypass long waits for coronavirus tests, using a simple device called a pulse oximeter as an early warning system for detecting COVID-19 pneumonia. The device, which fits over your finger, measures blood oxygen levels, and can be bought at pharmacies without prescription for about $30.\n\nUnfortunately, SARS-CoV-2 does not restrict its damage to the lungs.\n\nThe virus also causes blood clots, which have led to people in their 30s and 40s dying from strokes.\n\nAnd then there are the recent cases in New York and Paris of children with COVID-19 who develop symptoms closely resembling Kawasaki disease. The disease begins with a rash and fever, inflames blood vessels, and eventually can damage the coronary arteries that deliver blood to the heart.\n\n\"What is it about COVID-19 that it produces Kawasaki disease?\" said Schleiss, at the University of Minnesota, who estimates he has seen more than 1,000 Kawasaki cases in his medical career.\n\n\"I don't think SARS-CoV-2 is a cause of Kawasaki disease, but it is the cause of something very similar.\"\n\nEvery few weeks, SARS-CoV-2 seems to reveal new and disturbing oddities.\n\nA recent study from China published in the journal JAMA Network Open, reported finding the new coronavirus in the semen of six of 38 infected men, raising concern that it may be possible to transmit the virus through sexual contact.\n\nThe virus also has been found in patient stool samples and untreated wastewater. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has reported that standard methods at wastewater treatment plants should be effective enough to protect workers.\n\nSuch discoveries, however, raise fundamental questions, as we try to return to our old lives. Have we yet determined all of the ways the virus can spread from one person to another? Are there activities that may pose risks we have not anticipated?\n\nAt the University of California, San Francisco, Krogan said it will be important to examine the genetic scripts of both those who suffer severe cases of COVID-19 and those who get mild or no disease at all.\n\n\"There are 30-year-olds and some of them are asymptomatic and others are on respirators. What the hell is that all about?\"",

        "body": "Three top health officials and members on the White House's Coronavirus Task Force, including Dr. Anthony Fauci, will self-quarantine after exposure to a person with the virus, according to official statements and media reports.\n\nFauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, has been at the White House, where two staffers have tested positive for the virus in recent days, the institute said Saturday. By virtue of his calm, Brooklyn-inflected White House briefings, Fauci has become a leading expert on the coronavirus.\n\nAs U.S. cases reach almost 1.3 million and deaths top 77,000, states are making moves to ease social distancing restrictions.\n\nWorldwide, there are more than 3.9 million cases of the coronavirus and more than 276,000 deaths, according to the John Hopkins University data dashboard.\n\nOur live blog is being updated throughout the day. Refresh for the latest news, and get updates in your inbox with The Daily Briefing. Scroll down for more details.\n\nHere are some of the most significant developments to know today:\n\nSome good news: This year's Gerber baby has been chosen -- Meet Magnolia Earl.\n\nWork-from-home struggles? Here's how to prevent depression, reduce stress and increase energy levels.\n\nFauci has tested negative for the virus and is taking \"appropriate precautions,\" a National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases spokesperson confirmed to USA TODAY. While he will stay at home and telework, Fauci will go to the White House if called and take every precaution, the institute said.\n\nIn addition, two other members of the White House coronavirus task force placed themselves in quarantine after contact with someone who tested positive for COVID-19\n\nDr. Robert Redfield, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, will be \"teleworking for the next two weeks\" after it was determined he had a \"low risk exposure\" to a person at the White House, the CDC said in a statement Saturday evening. The statement said he felt fine and has no symptoms.\n\nAnd the Food and Drug Administration confirmed to USA TODAY on Saturday commissioner Stephen Hahn will self-quarantine for two weeks after coming into contact with someone who tested positive for COVID-19. Hahn has tested negative for the virus, according to FDA press officer Stephanie Caccomo.\n\nThe coronavirus pandemic has been creeping closer to the inner circle of the White House in the past week, as two employees there have tested positive. Meanwhile, at least 11 U.S. Secret Service employees were reported to be infected and about 60 other staffers were in self-quarantine, USA TODAY has learned.\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration issued its first emergency use authorization for a COVID-19 antigen test, a new type of diagnostic test that provides rapid results and is cheap to produce.\n\nAntigen tests analyze samples collected with a nose or throat swab to search for proteins found on or within the virus. While positive results from antigen tests are highly accurate, there is a higher chance of false negatives, according to the FDA.\n\nThe test is different from the two existing types of FDA-authorized tests. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests are diagnostic tests that detect genetic material from the virus to determine if someone has an active infection. Serological tests detect antibodies to attempt to determine if someone has had the virus and built up an immune response to it.\n\nThe FDA issued the authorization late Friday to the California-based Quidel Corporation.\n\n- Grace Hauck\n\nFormer President Obama called the Trump administration's response to the coronavirus pandemic an \"an absolute chaotic disaster\" in a private call with members of the Obama Alumni Association on Friday, according to media reports.\n\nYahoo News obtained tape of the conversation, and several people who heard the speech confirmed Obama's comments to the New York Times. CBS News also confirmed the call with Obama communications director Katie Hill.\n\nObama said the response to the coronavirus \"would have been bad even with the best of governments.\"\n\n\"It has been an absolute chaotic disaster when that mindset - of 'what's in it for me' and 'to heck with everybody else' s when that mindset is operationalized in our government,\" Obama said, according to CBS News.\n\n- Grace Hauck\n\nThe federal government is shipping hundreds of donated cases of remdesivir, an experimental drug shown to be useful in treating COVID-19 patients, to six hard-hit states. The Food and Drug Administration cleared remdesivir for emergency use last week as a potential treatment for the coronavirus.\n\nThe 360 cases were being sent to Connecticut, Illinois, Iowa, Maryland, Michigan and New Jersey, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services said Saturday. Each case contains 40 vials of the drug.\n\nThe antiviral drugs were donated by Gilead Sciences, which makes remdesivir. HHS said the doses will go to the more critical patients, including those on ventilators or in need of supplemental oxygen.\n\nThe department said a randomized controlled clinical trial suggests that remdesivir was associated with \"faster recovery\" for COVID-19 patients, although it cautioned that the data was not sufficient to determine if it was associated with lower mortality.\n\nThree children have died in New York from inflammatory disease that might be linked to coronavirus, Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Saturday. The announcement adds to the state's worry that it might be entering a new phase of the COVID-19 pandemic where it strikes children, who before had been deemed at low risk for the virus.\n\nCuomo said New York is up to at least 73 cases of the illness, which appears similar to Kawasaki disease or toxic shock syndrome, including a persistent fever.\n\nThe illness has been called \"Pediatric Multi-System Inflammatory Syndrome Associated with COVID-19,\" and Cuomo said the state will launch an investigation into it in conjunction with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\n- Joseph Spector\n\nDespite vehement objections from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the White House is pushing to return to its failed experiment of relying on temperature screenings for air travelers to detect coronavirus, according to internal documents obtained by USA TODAY.\n\nThe White House directive to check travelers in 20 U.S. airports for fever comes after earlier efforts by the CDC to screen travelers returning from China failed to stop the global pandemic from reaching the United States. Recent emails show CDC scientists, who have begun owning up to initial missteps in the federal response, trying to persuade the administration to reconsider.\n\n\"Thermal scanning as proposed is a poorly designed control and detection strategy as we have learned very clearly,\" \u202fDr. Martin \u202fCetron, the CDC's director of global mitigation and quarantine, wrote in an email to Department of Homeland Security officials on Thursday. \"We should be concentrating our CDC resources where there is impact and a probability of mission success.\"\u202fRead more here.\n\n- Bretty Murphy and Letitia Stein\n\nA federal judge ruled Friday that a Kentucky Baptist church - and all churches in the commonwealth - may hold in-person services Sunday despite the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nTabernacle Baptist Church in Nicholasville won a temporary restraining order blocking enforcement of Gov. Andy Beshear's order barring in-person church services to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Beshear's order bars also mass gatherings of more than 10 people.\n\nThe effect of the order is limited: Beshear has said he will lift the ban on church gatherings May 20, although attendance will be limited to follow social gathering guidelines.\n\n- Andrew Wolfson\n\nDenver will lift its stay-home restrictions this weekend. Ocean City, Maryland, plans to reopen its Boardwalk, Inlet parking lot and beaches to the general public. And in Nevada, restaurants, retail stores, barbershops, hair salons and some brewpubs can resume limited operations Saturday.\n\nThose are among many moves states have made in recent days to roll back social distancing restrictions.\n\nIn contrast, some states have said little about when restrictions will be lifted. In New Jersey, Gov. Phil Murphy has not publicly identified any key, specific benchmarks the state needs to hit to relax restrictions.\n\nFind the latest news from your state.\n\nAs a soaring outbreak of coronavirus cases pushed Russia into fifth place worldwide, Moscow's Red Square stood largely deserted Saturday after the normally huge, military parade marking the 75th anniversary of the end of World War II was canceled.\n\nPresident Vladimir Putin left a bouquet of red roses at the foot of the Eternal Flame, then briefly addressed the national on television, saying, \"We know and firmly believe that we are invincible when we stand together,\" without specifically mentioned the virus outbreak.\n\nWith the latest cases pushing Russia ahead of Germany and France, Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin extended the city's lockdown until May 31 and ordered residents to wear face masks and gloves in all public places and transport, Moscow Times reports.\n\nIn Spain, restrictions on half the residents were eased Saturday, except for the hard-hit Madrid region, the epicenter of Spain's outbreak. In the first phase, some small shops will be able to open, while bars and restaurants can only open \"terraces\" and must operate at 30% normal capacity.\n\nIn Germany, where the number of new cases fell for the first time in four days, restaurants, hotels and all shops were preparing to reopen, although individual German states can adjust the rules. Soccer matches are scheduled to resume May 15.\n\nDelta Air Lines is cutting service to 10 airports in the U.S. that serve cities including New York, Los Angeles and Chicago. It's part of the company's previously announced 85% reduction in service schedule. Delta says the airports where it is temporarily pulling service are relatively close o other, larger airports that travelers can use as an alternative. In New York, for example, Delta's Westchester County Airport service will cease, but flyers can still get to LaGuardia. Flights will stop at Stewart International, but John F. Kennedy International is the close-by option. See the schedule changes here.\n\n- Chris Woodyard\n\nRoy Horn, half of the Las Vegas stage duo Siegfried & Roy, died of complications due to the coronavirus Friday. He was 75.\n\n\"Today, the world has lost one of the greats of magic, but I have lost my best friend,\" Siegfried Fischbacher said in a statement. \"From the moment we met, I knew Roy and I, together, would change the world. There could be no Siegfried without Roy, and no Roy without Siegfried.\n\n\"Roy was a fighter his whole life including during these final days. I give my heartfelt appreciation to the team of doctors, nurses and staff at Mountain View Hospital who worked heroically against this insidious virus that ultimately took Roy's life.\"\n\nRoy Horn tested positive for the contagious respiratory illness in late April.\n\n-- Brett McGinness\n\nOn the day he issued guidelines for parts of California to start reopening, Gov. Gavin Newsom also identified a nail salon as the origin of the coronavirus outbreak in the state, one of the first ones in the nation to get impacted.\n\nNewsom provided details of the requirements for counties to relax social distancing measures beginning Friday, when clothing stores, florists, sporting goods stores and bookstores will be among the retailers allowed to operate again, albeit through curbside pick-up service.\n\nAsked why businesses that offer personal-care services like nail salons can't open yet, Newsom said, \"This whole thing started in the state of California, the first community spread, in a nail salon. I just wanted to remind you, remind everybody, of that. I'm very worried about that.''\n\nHe did not elaborate about the time and place community spread began in the state.\n\nThe head of a research group that studies bat-borne coronaviruses in China similar to the COVID-19 strain that's ravaged the globe has warned that a U.S. government decision to cut funding to his organization imperils American public health.\n\nEcoHealth Alliance's research grant was abruptly terminated last month by the National Institutes of Health, the primary agency of the U.S. government responsible for biomedical and public health research. EcoHealth Alliance's research in China is focused on identifying and warning about coronaviruses dangerous to human health.\n\n\"I'm really concerned about where this leaves us,\" said Peter Daszak, director of the New York-based organization, in a USA TODAY interview.\n\nThe National Institutes of Health confirmed EcoHealth Alliance's $3.4 million grant, distributed over six years, was canceled on April 24. But it would not discuss details about how the decision was made.\n\n-- Kim Hjelmgaard\n\nThe City of Cincinnati will close parts of 25 streets so restaurants can expand outdoor seating, a move that will help restaurants without patio space keep tables farther apart for social distancing - and open as early as possible.\n\nRestaurants and bars have been closed by state order since March 21 in order to curb the spread of the novel coronavirus. It's put people out of work and shuttered restaurants who opted not to morph into carryouts.\n\nTampa announced a similar plan May 5. And cities in San Mateo County in California temporarily restricted traffic beginning late last month in areas so people could safely get together.\n\nIn a similar move, Seattle said 20 miles of streets closed amid the state's stay-at-home order will be permanently closed to vehicles. The areas will remain for residents to exercise outside, and the construction of bike infrastructure will be accelerated in 2020, Mayor Jenny A. Durkan announced.\n\n-- Sharon Coolidge\n\nAt least 11 U.S. Secret Service employees were reported to be infected with the coronavirus and about 60 other staffers were in self-quarantine, a person familiar with the matter said Friday.\n\nThe person who is not authorized to comment publicly declined to breakdown the numbers of civilian versus agent infections. The assignment locations of the sick employees also were not identified.\n\nThe service, which provides personal protection for the president, vice president and their families, along with visiting heads of state, has 7,600 employees, including more than 3,000 agents who work in close proximity to those they protect.\n\n-- Kevin Johnson and Michael Collins\n\nAn aide to Vice President Mike Pence, press secretary Katie Miller, has tested positive for coronavirus, the White House confirmed. Pence was traveling to Iowa to meet faith leaders to discuss reopening religious services to the public, but his plane was delayed and some staffers disembarked.\n\nThe news comes one day after the White House announced Thursday that a military valet to President Donald Trump had tested positive for the virus. Trump told reporters that his aides will now be tested daily instead of weekly after the valet tested positive for the disease.",

        "body": "Hours after the White House added safety precautions against the coronavirus for the president and his staff Sunday, Trump administration officials denied a report that Vice President Mike Pence is self-isolating.\n\nEarlier in the day, a top economic adviser predicted unemployment levels could exceed 20%, and New York revealed new rules for nursing homes, where many of the coronavirus deaths in the state have occurred.\n\nIn a far-from-typical Mother's Day, social distancing measures kept many families from celebrating together in the U.S., which has recorded nearly one-third of the world's cases. Among the relatives forced to stay apart were New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo and his mother Matilda Cuomo, who called into his daily briefing so he and his three daughters could wish her a happy Mother's Day. However, unrest about lockdown restrictions had businesses in Pennsylvania and Ohio defying state orders.\n\nIn England, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced the first steps in the country's path toward reopening, four weeks after leaving a hospital where he was dealing with COVID-19.\n\nThere were nearly 80,000 deaths and more than 1.3 million confirmed coronavirus cases in the U.S. as on Sunday, according to the John Hopkins University data dashboard. Worldwide, the virus has killed more than 282,000 people and infected almost 4.1 million.\n\nOur live blog is being updated throughout the day. Refresh for the latest news, and get updates in your inbox with The Daily Briefing. Scroll down for more details.\n\nHere are some of the most significant developments to know Sunday:\n\nWhat we're talking about today: It's Mother's Day, and it's easy to see what the pandemic has taken. But it has also brought grown children home.\n\nDoes wearing a mask weaken the immune system? We rate the claim \"false,\" even though you may have heard it in a debunked viral video.\n\nVice President Mike Pence is not self-isolating and will be back at work in the White House on Monday, a Pence spokesman said, denying a published report.\n\nThe story by Bloomberg came two days after his press secretary tested positive for the virus. Earlier in the week, a valet for President Donald Trump also tested positive. In addition, three members of the White House coronavirus task force entered quarantine after being close to someone diagnosed with COVID-19. Both Trump and Pence have tested negative.\n\n\"Vice President Pence will continue to follow the advice of the White House Medical Unit and is not in quarantine,\" spokesman Devin O'Malley said in a statement. \"Additionally, Vice President Pence has tested negative every single day and plans to be at the White House tomorrow.\"\n\nAs part of new protocols announced Sunday, Trump and Pence will be tested daily for the virus, as will every staff member in close proximity to them. White House guests will be tested, work spaces will undergo regular deep cleaning and staff will follow social distancing guidelines, undergo daily temperature checks and have their symptom histories reviewed.\n\n-- Michael Collins\n\nWhite House economic adviser Kevin Hassett believes the unemployment rate could rise above 20% and the worst job losses would come in \"May or June\" because of the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.\n\nWhen asked Sunday what the \"bottom\" of the country's unemployment pain would be, Hassett, who advises the Trump administration on economic policy and is the former chair of the Council of Economic Advisers, told CBS's \"Face the Nation,\" \"to get unemployment rates like the ones that we're about to see ... which I think will climb up toward 20% by next month, you have to really go back to the Great Depression to see that.\"\n\nWhen asked about the \"low point\" in the unemployment rate, he said: \"I'm looking for rates north of 20, sadly.\"\n\nThe U.S. lost 20.5 million jobs in April, and the unemployment rate rose to 14.7%, both record-high numbers as the nation felt the economic effects of the coronavirus. Social distancing measures have forced the closures of businesses across the country, leading to employee layoffs and furloughs.\n\n- Nicholas Wu\n\nAs its rate of new infections and deaths from COVID-19 continues to slow, New York state is taking new measures to protect those most susceptible to the disease.\n\nNursing homes that can't provide a prescribed level of care for patients for any reason will have to transfer them to another facility or contact the state department of health, Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced at his Sunday news briefing. In addition, nursing homes that can't treat coronavirus-positive residents will have to do the same. Cuomo also said nursing home staffs will be required to get tested for the virus twice a week, and hospitals won't be allowed to discharge patients to those facilities unless they have tested negative for COVID-19.\n\n\"This virus uses nursing homes. They are ground zero,'' Cuomo said. \"They are the vulnerable population in the vulnerable location. It's a congregation of vulnerable people.''\n\nAccording to The Associated Press, New York has had one-fifth of the nation's coronavirus-related deaths in nursing homes -- 5,300 out of 26,000.\n\nCuomo also said the state is investigating up to 85 cases of COVID-related illnesses among children, from toddlers to those of elementary school age, who showed symptoms not typically associated with the coronavirus. At least three children have died of the disease, which manifests itself in inflammation similar to toxic-shock syndrome or Kawasaki disease instead of respiratory symptoms.\n\nGroups of residents defying state orders to stay at home in Pennsylvania and Ohio are the latest signs of growing unrest over the measures imposed to limit spread of the coronavirus, which have wrecked economies and social activities.\n\nIn York, Pennsylvania, more than 150 people attended a Saturday meeting organized by state Rep. Mike Jones to talk about reopening business in York County, in spite of Gov. Tom Wolf's order forbidding large gatherings. The vast majority of those in attendance were not wearing masks, and many were shaking hands, hugging and sitting close together in violation of social distancing guidelines, the York Daily Record reported.\n\nThe newspaper also reported two locations of the Round the Clock Diner defied Wolf's order limiting restaurants to take-out only by opening for dine-in service Sunday.\n\nNear the eastern Ohio town of Cambridge, pop. 10,000, the National Road Diner has remained open despite multiple visits from the Guernsey County sheriff's and health departments.\n\n\"I believe it's my constitutional right to open my business now,\" owner Vicki Brearley told the Columbus Dispatch, even though Gov. Mike DeWine and Health Director Dr. Amy Acton decreed dine-in restaurants couldn't reopen until May 21.\n\nThe restrictions to fight the virus have prompted protests in several parts of the country.\n\nBritish Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced a slow easing of the country's coronavirus lockdown Sunday and outlined his government's road map for further lifting restrictions in the coming months.\n\nIn a televised address to the nation, Johnson said Brits who can't work from home, such as those in construction or manufacturing jobs, \"should be actively encouraged to go to work\" this week. He suggested they avoid mass transit and either drive or preferably walk or bike to work.\n\nJohnson said a restriction limiting outdoor exercise to once a day will be lifted Wednesday. The prime minister, who spent a week in the hospital receiving treatment for COVID-19, stressed that social distancing guidelines still will have to be observed and said it would be \"madness\" to allow a second spike in infections.\n\n\"This is not the time simply to end the lockdown this week,'' Johnson said. \"Instead we are taking the first careful steps to modify our measures.\"\n\nHawaii is facing its highest unemployment rate ever as strict stay-at-home orders and a virtual shutdown of the state's once-mighty tourism industry have left residents reeling, leaning on their savings or unable to pay rent and feed their families. Since March, the state's unemployment rate has soared from 3% to 34%, one of the highest in the nation.\n\nRoughly 216,000 of the state's 660,000 workers were employed in jobs supported by tourism in 2019. Airline arrivals to Hawaii have nosedived from more than 30,000 passengers per day to 756. Food service workers, who make up roughly 13% of all employees in the state and earn a median annual income of about $30,000, lost wages as restaurants closed and hotels shuttered.\n\n\"Our life is in danger because, of course, we don't know what will happen,\" said Julie Gabot, a housekeeper at the Sheraton Waikiki. \"There's no real hope for good things in the future.\"\n\nFor decades, LGBTQ people have battled for a seat at the census table.\n\nThen in 2020, there came a beacon of hope when same-sex couples living together were included in the 10-year survey for the first time, even though sexual orientation and gender identity questions were absent. Advocates rallied the LGBTQ community, urging full participation.\n\nThen in the midst of rollout this spring, a global health crisis erupted - upending lives and tangling census outreach efforts.\n\n\"Because of social distancing, people are not out there pushing the census,\" said Glennda Testone, executive director of New York's LGBT Community Center. \"My fear is that the response numbers will go down.\"\n\n- Susan Miller\n\nThree top health officials and members on the White House's coronavirus task force -- Drs. Anthony Fauci, Robert Redfield and Stephen Hahn -- will self-quarantine for two weeks after exposure to a person with the virus, according to official statements and media reports.\n\nFauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, will begin a \"modified quarantine\" after a low-risk exposure, according to CNN. He has tested negative and is taking \"appropriate precautions,\" a NIAID spokesperson confirmed to USA TODAY.\n\nRedfield, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, will be \"teleworking for the next two weeks\" after it was determined he had a \"low-risk exposure\" to a person at the White House who tested positive, the CDC said in a statement Saturday.\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration said commissioner Hahn has tested negative but will self-quarantine.\n\n- Joel Shannon\n\nAfter South Korea reported 34 new cases of the coronavirus Sunday, most of which were linked to club goers, President Moon Jae-in urged calm and said \"there's no reason to stand still out of fear.\"\n\nThe Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said 26 of the 34 new infections were locally transmitted; the others came from abroad. Sunday's surge marked the first time that the daily rate increased by more than 30 in about a month.\n\nOn Saturday, Seoul Mayor Park Won-soon ordered more than 2,100 nightclubs, hostess bars and discos to close.\n\nAccording to the John Hopkins University data dashboard, South Korea reported 10,874 confirmed cases and 256 deaths as of Sunday morning.\n\n- The Associated Press\n\nPresident Donald Trump was featured in a taped video during Saturday's UFC 249 preliminary broadcast on ESPN, congratulating UFC president Dana White and the UFC for resuming operations and hosting the card during the global coronavirus pandemic.\n\n\"They're going to have a big match,\" Trump said during the broadcast. \"We love it. We think it's important - get the sports leagues back. Let's play. We do the social distancing and whatever else you have to do, but we need sports. We want our sports back, and congratulations to Dana White and the UFC.\"\n\nUFC 249 at VyStar Veterans Memorial Coliseum in Jacksonville, Fla., was not only the first UFC card in the U.S. since the outbreak of coronavirus forced stay-at-home orders in most of the country, but also the first major sporting event of any sort.\n\n- Danny Segura\n\nThe head of a research group that studies bat-borne coronaviruses in China similar to the COVID-19 strain that's ravaged the globe has warned that a U.S. government decision to cut funding to his organization imperils American public health.\n\nEcoHealth Alliance's research grant was abruptly terminated last month by the National Institutes of Health, the primary agency of the U.S. government responsible for biomedical and public health research.

        "authors": [],
        "body": "Nursing homes, long-term care facilities, prisons and meatpacking plants are all facing increasing scrutiny heading into the weekend as sobering reports of outbreaks at each made news late in the week.\n\nEven as questions are raised about how to contain those outbreaks, states across the nation are constantly changing their social distancing restrictions, slowly relaxing an uneven patchwork of regulations and making moves to reopen ravaged economies. The weekend will again bring challenges as some worry nice weather will cause crowding, especially at beaches in states including Florida and California.\n\nOur live blog is being updated throughout the day. Refresh for the latest news, and get updates in your inbox with The Daily Briefing.\n\nHere are the most important developments:\n\nSome good news: Don't feel pressure to exercise too much as you're stuck at home -- \"Whatever your regular exercise routine was, I wouldn't alter it,\" one expert recommends.\n\nA question you might have: What should I do if I think I might have coronavirus? This guide will walk you through next steps.\n\nCalifornia has gained praise for its speed in enacting social distancing orders which have helped keep the most populous state from suffering the kind of runaway outbreaks that have plagued other states. But a USA TODAY Network analysis finds the state is still woefully unprepared to reopen in accordance with public health recommendations.\n\nGov. Gavin Newsom recently laid out a reopening plan with benchmarks that must be met before he will recommend walking back stay-at-home orders and other social distancing measures. He called for California to test between 60,000 and 80,000 people daily.\n\nCalifornia is doing just a third of that, as of late April, conducting only about 52 tests per 100,000 people each day, according to a USA TODAY Network analysis. Across the nation, California falls slightly into the bottom half of all states.\n\nCalifornia is far behind behind the national leaders -- Rhode Island, North Dakota and New Mexico -- which are respectively averaging about 260, 209 and 163 tests per 100,000 residents each day. No other states have yet to achieve the recommended testing metric, though New York and Massachusetts are close.\n\nNewsom has said some business sectors, such as retail and manufacturing, may be able to open within weeks if the state's testing capability grows and case numbers slow. But other businesses such as hair salons will take longer. Large gatherings such as concerts still remain out of reach, he said.\n\n- Nicole Hayden, Mark Olalde, Jordan Culver and Joel Shannon\n\nAll Tennessee inmates and correction staff will be tested for the coronavirus as part of a new widespread initiative to mitigate the spread of the virus amid multiple massive prison outbreaks in the state, Gov. Bill Lee announced Friday.\n\nThe governor's office said more than half of the inmates and staff tested at Trousdale Turner Correctional Center in Hartsville tested positive for the virus.\n\nOf the 2,725 total tests given at the facility this week, at least 1,349 came back positive, according to CoreCivic, the national private corporation that runs Trousdale Turner. Just two of the inmates who tested positive exhibited symptoms, CoreCivic said in a statement, and both are being treated at a nearby hospital.\n\n\"The rate of infection at the Trousdale Turner Correctional Center is consistent with or below what is being reported by other correctional systems nationally,\" CoreCivic's public affairs office said in a statement Friday, noting that more than 70% of federal inmates have tested positive for the virus, according to recently released data.\n\nBased on state virus data compiled by The Tennessean, the outbreak at Trousdale has led to the largest single-day spike in positive cases -- more than twice the size of any other -- since the virus came to Tennessee in early March.\n\nGov. Michelle Lujan Grisham invoked the state's Riot Control Act on Friday as she sealed off all roads to nonessential traffic in one of the largest communities bordering the Navajo Nation, where a surging coronavirus outbreak has already prompted widespread restrictions and weekend lockdowns.\n\nShe also required businesses in Gallup to close from 5 p.m. to 8 a.m. in the city of about 70,000 people along Interstate 40, which remained open to through traffic.\n\nGallup is a hub for basic household supplies, liquor sales and water-container refills for people living in remote stretches of the Navajo Nation -- often without full indoor plumbing -- and indigenous Zuni Pueblo. The Navajo Nation has imposed evening and weekend curfews on the reservation spanning portions of New Mexico, Arizona and Utah.\n\nCOVID-19 infection rates in Gallup and surrounding McKinley County make it one of the worst U.S. hotspots for the pandemic as patients overwhelm intensive care facilities.\n\nCity officials requested new state of emergency under the riot act that can prohibit people from walking streets and using certain roads. Violations are punishable as misdemeanors on a first offense and as a felony on the second offense. Emergency declarations under the act expire after three days and can be renewed.\n\nThe coronavirus isn't going away anytime soon, infectious disease experts predict in a report released Thursday.\n\nThe pandemic could last between 18 and 24 months and won't be halted until 60% to 70% of the population is immune, according to the report by the University of Minnesota's Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy.\n\nResearchers note that COVID-19 appears to spread more easily than the flu because it has a longer incubation period, spreads while people are asymptomatic, and has a higher basic reproductive number, meaning the average number of new infections that result from one infected person.\n\nBecause it's so contagious, \"more people will need to get infected and become immune before the pandemic can end,\" the researchers note.\n\nThe report presents three scenarios for the spread of COVID-19 and makes several recommendations, including advising government agencies to plan for worst-case scenarios, making plans for periodic resurgences, and warning the public that the disease won't be over soon.",

    "Coronavirus won't end for 2 years, with worse second wave, study warns": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "If COVID-19 follows a pattern set by the 1918 Spanish flu, the pandemic is likely to last up to two years and return with a vengeance this fall and winter - a second wave worse than the first, according to a study issued from the University of Minnesota.\n\n\"States, territories and tribal health authorities should plan for the worst-case scenario,\" warns the report out of the university's Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy, \"including no vaccine availability or herd immunity.\"\n\n\"Risk communication messaging from government officials should incorporate the concept that this pandemic will not be over soon and that people need to be prepared for possible periodic resurgences of disease,\" the authors suggest.\n\nThe study team, headed by Dr. Kristine A. Moore, medical director at the University of Minnesota center, included pandemic experts from Harvard and Tulane universities.\n\nAntibody tests were supposed to help guide reopening plans. They've brought more confusion than clarity amid coronavirus.\n\nIn a preface to the report, researchers said they are striving to produce critical and timely information \"with straight talk and clarity.\"\n\nThe worst-case scenario - with a major resurgence by year's end - is one of three laid out in the paper.\n\nA second possibility suggests the outbreak this year could be followed by a series of smaller waves into 2021.\n\nAnd a third scenario, not seen in previous pandemics, would feature a \"slow burn\" of viral transmission with no clear pattern.\n\n\"The virus caught the global community off guard, and its future course is still highly unpredictable,\" says the report. \"There is no crystal ball to tell us what the future holds and what the 'end game' for controlling this pandemic will be.\"\n\nHowever, it stresses, a COVID-19 vaccine is not likely to be available until 2021. And, because up to a quarter of those infected may have no symptoms - and others spread the disease for days before feeling ill - historic influenza pandemics provide the best model.\n\nSecond wave: When will it hit, and what will it look like?\n\nBecause humans don't have natural immunity and the virus is so easily transmitted, up to 70% of the population may have to develop immunity before COVID-19's spread diminishes naturally. That means the pandemic length \"will likely be 18 to 24 months,\" and the virus will remain endemic afterward.\n\nThe worst-case scenario - a more lethal resurgence this fall and winter - is based on the Spanish flu outbreak a century ago, when a small wave hit in early 1918, followed by a huge spike that fall and a third major wave in early 1919.\n\nStudies suggest social distancing measures had worked against the 1918 epidemic until they were hastily lifted by some cities, like Denver, in early celebrations. Instead of continuing to \"flatten the curve,\" these cities experienced a second spike in cases.\n\n\"A lot of the confusion, in general, is premised on the misunderstanding that if you control the epidemic once, then you're done,\" Harvard epidemiologist Marc Lipsitch told the USA TODAY Editorial Board last month. \"There's no reason to think that.\"\n\nThe researchers urged government agencies and officials to gird for resurgences and develop triggers for re-instituting mitigation measures so health care systems won't once again be overwhelmed.\n\nAntibody tests: They could be key to reopening the country. Here's how they work.",

        "body": "Three months. That's a full fiscal quarter. The full length of some couples' made-for-television engagements. The amount of time it takes to potty train a puppy (if you're lucky).\n\nA lot can change in three months. Exhibit A: The first case of a \"mysterious virus\" from China was discovered in America exactly three months ago. Things sure have escalated since then, haven't they?\n\nIt's Ashley with the news to know.\n\nBut first, over boring Zoom meetings? An appearance from a donkey could shake things up. You can \"rent\" an animal to virtually join your video call. (If anyone at USA TODAY is reading this, please bring alpaca to our next meeting.)\n\nSince the first U.S. COVID-19 case was discovered, there have been more than 2.5 million confirmed cases worldwide, and the USA reports more than any other country. If there's a silver lining to this suffering, it's that the country is learning important lessons about dealing with this pandemic - and the ones that will inevitably come.\n\nCOVID-19 was not produced in lab, WHO says\n\nAvailable evidence indicates that the coronavirus originated in animals in China and was not made in a lab as has been alleged, the World Health Organization said Tuesday. The announcement follows President Donald Trump's comments last week that U.S. intelligence officials were investigating whether the coronavirus began spreading after an accident at a Chinese high-security biomedical laboratory in Wuhan.\n\nWhat are 'COVID toes'?\n\nA new coronavirus symptom - mostly seen in kids - puzzles disease experts. Patients with the symptom, informally dubbed \"COVID toes,\" experience purple or blue lesions on their feet and toes.\n\nNurses protest outside White House\n\nRegistered nurses gathered outside the White House on Tuesday, calling attention to the tens of thousands of health care workers nationwide who have become infected with COVID-19 because of the lack of personal protective equipment. The nurses read aloud the names of U.S. nurses who died of COVID-19.\n\nSouth Korean officials say there's no reason to think North Korean leader Kim Jong Un is seriously ill, despite a U.S. media report suggesting he was in \"grave danger.\" CNN, citing unnamed U.S. officials, reported Monday that Kim had undergone heart surgery this month and intelligence suggested the leader might be seriously ill. South Korea's government says it has not detected any unusual signs about Kim's health and had no information to corroborate the report. However, North Korea is one of the world's most secretive nations, and information about its leader is extremely difficult to verify.\n\nRob Gronkowski wants to play football again. More specifically, he wants to continue playing with Tom Brady. And it appears he'll get his wish. Gronkowski is set to come out of retirement in conjunction with a trade that will send his contractual rights from New England to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, his agent confirmed. The Buccaneers signed Brady in March.\n\nSpeaking of Tom Brady, even he has to social distance: The six-time NFL champion quarterback was kicked out of a Tampa park while working out, Mayor Jane Castor revealed. Tampa parks are closed because of the coronavirus outbreak, but a park staffer spotted someone violating the rules. It was Tom Brady.\n\nNearly half of the nation's population - about 150 million people - live with and breathe polluted air, \"placing their health and lives at risk,\" according to a report released Tuesday by the American Lung Association. The report says climate change continues to make air pollution worse, and many Western cities saw record-breaking spikes in particle pollution because of wildfires. In fact, about 9 million more people are breathing dirty air than in last year's report.\n\nQueen Elizabeth II is getting a few royal birthday wishes for her big day. The British monarch turned 94 on Tuesday, which prompted her family of royals to take to social media to wish her well. Prince William and Duchess Kate posted a photo with the queen to their social media accounts. Prince Harry, Duchess Meghan and their son Archie called her with good wishes. Even the queen's Instagram account posted in celebration, sharing rare footage of the monarch when she was a child. That's as close as we'll get to a celebration - the queen asked that there be no gun salutes to mark her special day and chose not to celebrate.",

    "Coronavirus, contact tracing: States scramble to fill COVID-19 jobs": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "Rachel Brummert left her home in Charlotte, North Carolina, just once after March 2: to pick up a prescription at CVS on March 18.\n\nThat made the job of the contact tracer from the Mecklenburg County health department a lot easier after Brummert, 49, got her positive COVID-19 results on April 9.\n\nThe tracer had only two other transmission possibilities to consider. She had to talk to people near Brummert's husband at the financial services company office where he worked until March 18, and find a 26-year-old neighbor who two days later left groceries on the bottom step while Brummert stood on the top step.\n\nPublic health officials are counting on such methodical contact tracing coupled with aggressive testing as the nation's strategy to combat the coronavirus that causes COVID-19, which has killed more than 81,000 Americans at a continued rate of about 2,000 a day.\n\n\"This tidal wave has hit,\" said David Levy, CEO of EHE Health. \"Other than an effective antiviral or vaccine, the only solution is testing and tracing.\"\n\nBut Levy said the lack of a coordinated, national approach has left \"50 different states and 50 different approaches\" to control a virus that does not stop at state or county borders. If states are unable to get adequate controls in place, some warn that a surge in infections would overwhelm the ability of contact tracers to help slow the spread.\n\nCOVID-19 Expert:Coronavirus will rage 'until it infects everybody it possibly can'\n\nAntibody tests: They were supposed to help guide reopening plans. They've brought more confusion than clarity.\n\nStill, other than keeping stay-at-home orders firmly in place, public health officials say rapid testing and contact tracing give states the best chance to slow the virus and restart the economy crippled by the highest rate of unemployment since the Great Depression. And as states ease stay-at-home restrictions and allow people to return to work, shopping and social activities, testing and tracing the contacts of infected people will become crucial.\n\nThe federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has issued broad guidelines and training resources for state and local public health agencies. The Trump administration, however, halted the release of a plan that would advise local public health agencies on strategies to reopen public places, the Associated Press reported.\n\nCDC Director Robert Redfield said during a U.S.Senate hearing Tuesday that contact tracing is \"going to be the difference from succeeding in containing this outbreak\" or widespread transmission in communities.\n\nHe said the agency has 500 staff members on the effort and is looking to add another 650, but he stressed efforts to work with local health departments to get contact tracing capability in place by September.\n\n\"It's going to be significant effort to build the contact tracing capacity that we need in this nation,\" he said.\n\nWithout an overarching plan, state public health agencies are developing their own strategies on hiring and training contact tracers.\n\nMassachusetts has added more than 1,000 workers and sent some into communities with large numbers of cases. California last week began training the first recruits of a planned 20,000-person contact tracing team. And New York plans to add as many as 17,000 contact tracers through a partnership with former Mayor Mike Bloomberg, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and Resolve to Save Lives, headed by former CDC Director Tom Frieden.\n\nDr. Marcus Plescia is chief medical officer of the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials. The organization completed a study with Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security that estimated 100,000 new contact tracers are needed nationwide. The estimated price tag: $3.6 billion.\n\nHe said testing, isolating and tracking the contacts of new cases is pivotal as the nation enters a new phase of the pandemic.\n\n\"Everybody is impatient and ready to start reopening society and the economy,\" Plescia said. \"Unless we have some kind of infection control mechanism in place, it's just a matter of time until we rev right back up into the same situation we're starting to recover from.\"\n\nBrummert was impressed by the efficiency of Mecklenburg County health department's investigation.\n\nOn April 21, health department officials told her they cleared other potential sources and concluded she was likely infected by the CVS keypad when she typed in her debit card number to pay for her prescription back in March.\n\nCVS has had \"very few engagements\" with state and local health department contact tracers investigating COVID-19 cases involving customers, said Mike DeAngelis, a senior director of corporate communications\n\nThe chain pharmacy frequently cleans hard surfaces and commonly handled items, has reduced the number of keypad prompts a customer must touch and puts disinfecting wipe stations at the front of each store, according to DeAngelis.\n\n\"We've enacted measures in our stores to help ensure proper social distancing, including floor markers to help our customers be mindful of how close they are to others, and we have installed protective panels at our pharmacy counters and front-store checkout stations in all stores,\" DeAngelis said.\n\nBrummert, who has the inflammatory disorder sarcoidosis, was picking up her immune suppressant medications on March 18. She looked for face masks in the aisle near the pharmacy, but to be extra cautious, she said she didn't stop for her usual snacks.\n\nBy March 21, she had a high fever, headache and trouble breathing, but she couldn't get tested until April 2. A week later, she learned she had COVID-19, and she was contacted by a county health department contact tracer within a couple of days.\n\nShe couldn't get tested earlier because she had not knowingly come in contact with anyone who was infected or traveled out of the country. She was told to isolate for 14 days.\n\nOn April 2, she went to the local emergency room in what she described as \"respiratory distress,\" and was prescribed the antibiotic azithromycin and the breathing treatment albuterol. Her chest X-ray was filled with what she said appeared to be \"white smoke.\" She wasn't hospitalized because \"our hospitals were overwhelmed with people who needed to be on ventilators,\" she said.\n\nThe health department said she could come out of isolation one week after her symptoms disappeared, including at least 72 hours fever-free without Tylenol. That happened on April 26, though she has stayed home to be extra cautious after hearing people can become reinfected.\n\nBrummert said she doesn't want to rely on contact tracing, even with increased testing, to keep people safe now that shelter in place restrictions are being lifted.\n\n\"Contact tracing is complicated by itself and becomes a more complex issue when we consider those who are essential workers or have to travel,\" said Brummert, a consumer representative on advisory committee for the the Food and Drug Administration's Center for Devices and Radiologic Health. \"What makes contact tracing even more disconcerting is that people who are asymptomatic can also spread the virus.\"\n\nNorth Carolina is working to rapidly expand its ranks of contact tracers under the state's newly adopted Carolina Community Tracing Collaborative.\n\nUnder the program, Community Care of North Carolina will use state funding to hire 250 contact tracers. Community Care will not know how much the independent contractors will be paid until state funding amounts are finalized, nor does it know how long the positions will last given the unknowns about COVID-19's trajectory.\n\n\"We've gotten a surge of applications, nearly 5,000 applications,\" said Paul Mahoney, Community Care's vice president for communications. \"The unemployment rate is off the charts right now.\"\n\nContact tracers will be hired from communities with the greatest need based on number of cases and resources of the local health departments, Mahoney said. That might mean contact tracers working from their own homes in small and rural towns that need help the most, Mahoney said.\n\nMassachusetts has tapped Partners in Health, a Boston-based nonprofit with extensive experience in international public health responses.\n\nPartners in Health contact tracers are making thousands of calls a day to Massachusetts communities hard hit the virus. With the stay-at-home orders leaving thousands of workers furloughed or laid off, there's no shortage of applicants. Partners in Health has hired more than 1,000 from a pool of about 40,000 people who applied for positions in the state, said John C. Welch, director of partnerships and operations for the MA Covid Response project.\n\nWelch said the large pool of job-seekers means Partners in Health can quickly add staff if Massachusetts has a surge of cases.\n\nThe nonprofit recruited for three types of jobs. Case investigators contact a person who tests positive, advises them to isolate and interviews them to get a list of contacts who might've been exposed to the virus.\n\nContact tracers, which make up the bulk of new hires, reach out to people the infected person contacted. Those interviews can be done over the phone or face-to-face if the person can't be reached by phone.\n\nThe CDC defines a close contact as someone within 6 feet of an infected person for at least 15 minutes. The agency recommends close contacts of an infected person should stay home and monitor symptoms until 14 days after a known exposure.\n\nA third group of new hires, care resource coordinators, connect people who must isolate with resources such as food delivery services, medical care or other social services.\n\nContact tracing helped end the Ebola out: Public health experts say it can stop COVID-19, too\n\nPublic health agencies are well versed on contact tracing for infectious diseases such as measles or HIV. Given the fast spread and spread of COVID-19, contact tracers hired to counter novel coronavirus face a much larger job.\n\n\"It's really important to teach the public about what contact tracing is,\" Welch said. \"Contact tracing happens every day for over 90 reportable infectious diseases. People aren't necessarily aware of those day-to-day activities by the public health sector.\"\n\nPartners in Health has sought to raise awareness of what it does statewide but also through targeted outreach and engagement in Boston-area communities such as Chelsea, Revere and Brockton, Welch said.\n\n\"Those areas have had relatively high transmission rates populated by a lot of working class individuals,\" he said. \"These are the folks who are keeping food on our table, keeping gas in our cars and keeping our hospitals clean. Those folks are experiencing the burden of disease transmission.\"\n\nThe state released a public awareness video about contact tracing to encourage people to pick up the phone. Many were ignoring calls because they feared being scammed or getting an unwanted call. The nonprofit worked with telecommunication companies to make sure their calls were not blocked, Welch said.\n\n\"The people who we've been in touch with have been happy to hear from us and glad to have positive outreach,\" Welch said. \"Contact tracing is an act of caring, and by and large, people see that.\"\n\nOthers say large-scale contact tracing will be difficult to put in place in time to make a meaningful difference.\n\nDr. Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, said hiring thousands of people with limited or no public health experience to do contact tracing is \"a great idea on paper\" but will struggle to keep up with the pace of the virus.\n\nHe advocates a more limited approach: Public health workers contacting infected individuals and encouraging them to stay home until they recover.\n\n\"Once you see a big escalation in cases, contact tracing absolutely cannot work,\" Osterholm said. \"You will be having contacts by the thousands and thousands and thousands. It's just not going to work.\"\n\nMore: Apple and Google join forces on tech for app that could warn you of coronavirus exposure\n\nOthers worry about how effective or complete tracking will be.\n\nDr. George Fallieras of Los Angeles returned from a ski trip in Aspen, Colorado, when he suddenly felt a \"crushing fatigue\" and body aches. However, he did not have a fever, cough, sore throat or trouble breathing - classic symptoms of COVID-19.\n\nHe knew something was wrong but could not get a test based on his symptoms. He did not want to potentially expose others at a hospital emergency room or his patients to anything.\n\nFallieras talked with a colleague, an infectious disease doctor, who arranged testing. He tested positive for COVID-19, isolated himself and has recovered. Since then, because he has antibodies believed to offer some immunity, he began working at Los Angeles Surge Hospital, a newly opened facility in downtown L.A. for COVID-19 patients.\n\nWhile the hospital caters to patients with more serious complications from COVID-19, Fallieras wonders about patients like himself, those with mild symptoms or symptoms different from those most commonly described.\n\nHe worries people with mild cases might not ever get tested and could pass the virus to someone more vulnerable, such as an older adult or a person with an underlying health condition that makes them more susceptible to complications.\n\n\"It is a blessing that many people are asymptomatic,\" Fallieras said. But \"that makes it very difficult to contact trace and isolate.\"\n\nCalifornia will attempt exactly that with an army of 20,000 contact tracers, under an ambitious initiative announced by Gov. Gavin Newsom last week. The University of California-San Francisco and the University of California-Los Angeles will train the new workers, many of whom have no public health experience. Newly recruited tracers began a 20-hour online training course last week.\n\nPlescia, of the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials, said it's important for states to hire contract tracers by this summer. He said states partnering with universities and cities such as San Francisco, which is using librarians and medical students, will have an advantage to quickly get contact tracers in the field.\n\n\"It has to be in place,\" he said. \"If we don't, the concern is the next surge will not come in the fall, it will come sooner.\"\n\nFrieden, a former New York City heath commissioner who headed the CDC during the Obama administration, acknowledged that contract tracing will become more difficult as social distancing protocols ease.\n\nUnder social distancing, Frieden said, he has had only two contacts. That could expand from 20 to 100 as his state loosens restrictions, making tracing much more difficult.\n\n\"This is a big challenge to do contact tracing on this scale and with this speed,\" Frieden said. \"There is skepticism. Is it really possible? The truth is we are not going to be able to find every case.\n\n\"Just because you can't solve all of the problem doesn't mean you shouldn't solve any of the problem.\"\n\nThings are tough right now, and we want to help you get through it.

    "Coronavirus: 'COVID toes' may be symptom of COVID-19 in young people": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "Doctors identified a new symptom of COVID-19, caused by the novel coronavirus, informally dubbed \"COVID toes.\"\n\nThe presence of purple or blue lesions on a patient's feet and toes puzzles infectious disease experts.\n\n\"They're typically painful to touch and could have a hot burning sensation,\" said Dr. Ebbing Lautenbach, chief of infectious disease at the University of Pennsylvania's School of Medicine.\n\nWhat doctors said is most interesting about \"COVID toes\" is that they appear in COVID-19 patients who don't exhibit any other symptoms. Similarly, the loss of taste and smell was found to be associated with COVID-19 among otherwise asymptomatic patients by the American Academy of Otolaryngology - Head and Neck Surgery and ENT UK in late March.\n\n\"This is a manifestation that occurs early on in the disease, meaning you have this first, then you progress,\" Lautenbach said. \"Sometimes this might be your first clue that they have COVID when they don't have any other symptoms.\"\n\n\"COVID toes\" in some people can disappear in the course of a week to 10 days, but others progress to respiratory symptoms, he said.\n\nThe new symptom appears in more children and young adults than any other age group. Ebbing suggested this may be because children and young adults have better immune systems.\n\nAccording to Lautenbach, \"COVID toes\" were discovered in March by Italian doctors. Once experts were informed of the strange symptom, they began recognizing more and more cases in the USA.\n\nThere are two running hypotheses on what could cause \"COVID toes.\" One possible explanation, Lautenbach said, is that there is an inflammatory response more localized to a patient's foot and toes. Or it could be a clotting of blood vessels.\n\n\"The short answer is nobody knows,\" he said.\n\nSusan Wilcox, chief of critical care for the emergency department at Massachusetts General Hospital, saw the purple lesions on her most critically ill COVID patients and suspected it was purpura fulminans. This occurs when inflammation from a severe infection causes the body to make micro-clots in tiny blood vessels in the toes, fingers and even nose, she explained.\n\n'Almost like an eternity': 3 months since US confirmed its first coronavirus case, what have we learned?\n\nWilcox said this is most common in patients who develop acute respiratory distress syndrome, or ARDS, the majority of which die of intense, systematic inflammation.\n\n\"You get the infection, and then your body will release a cascade of inflammation,\" she said. \"In many ways, it's beneficial, but then sometimes it can either be too much, so the inflammation can lead to its own damage.\"\n\nWilcox said she's seen this happen in cases of viral pneumonia or a bad flu, so it wasn't surprising when she saw it in COVID-19 patients.\n\nWhile experts learn more about the disease and how it relates to \"COVID toes,\" Lautenbach said an abundance of caution and a low bar of suspicion will stop the spread of the coronavirus.\n\nAlthough patients with \"COVID toes\" are more likely to test negative for COVID-19, as the virus is in its earliest stages, he said patients should quarantine at home and monitor closely for developing symptoms.",

        "body": "GADSDEN, Ala. -- From the White House to the state house, and many of the houses throughout this community, people are clamoring to reopen the country.\n\nIn the houses of the Woods, Posey and Porter families -- all relatives -- they think that's a mistake.\n\nWhile others talk about reopening their businesses, these families are preparing to close the caskets of three family members.\n\nIn one week's time, they lost Phacethia Posey, her father Billy Ray Woods, and cousin Michael Woods to COVID-19.\n\nTyrone Posey said when the novel coronavirus started making news, his wife, Phacethia, began researching. The couple and other family members started doing the things they heard would help.\n\n\"We were over steam,\" he said, \"and took vitamins.\" Phacethia took other suggested remedies -- elderberry and zinc.\n\n\"To think that she's gone because of that virus,\" Posey said.\n\nPhacethia Posey died April 13, after spending seven days hospitalized.The tragedy of her passing is only part of the story for her family.\n\nOn Saturday, Billy Ray Woods, Phacethia's father, died, and so did Michael Woods.\n\nPosey, Phacethia's mother Barbara Woods, sister Johnjalene Woods, Kyra Porter and her husband Tony, all tested positive for COVID-19 -- a total of nine family members.\n\nPorter said Tyrone Posey Jr. was the first to get sick; Porter's father was the first to be hospitalized, on March 30.\n\n\"After that, we all started getting tested,\" Kyra Porter said. Porter said she sought testing at an urgent care facility in Gadsden, but was told they only had three tests and they were testing sparingly.\n\n\"They said I didn't have serious symptoms,\" she said, although she had a fever, coughing and chills.\n\nAs some of the family members got sick, Johnjalene Woods took care of them. \"She was asymptomatic,\" Porter said, but she also tested positive for COVID-19.\n\nFamily members quarantined themselves, they said, and continue to as some family members still are recovering.\n\nKyra and Tony Porter live in Anniston. Billy Ray and Barbara Woods, Phacethia, Tyrone Posey and their son, Tyrone Jr.; and Johnjalene Woods live about 30 miles away in Gadsden. All of them, and their cousin Michael became infected.\n\nKyra Porter said the family was always together on Sundays, but considering the way people fell ill, she didn't think it was a family gathering that caused the spread.\n\nThey apparently contracted the virus in the course of normal activities, even though they were trying to avoid it. Some family members had worked in health care in the past, but were not currently.\n\nPosey and Porter shared their family's story Saturday, before they learned of Billy Ray and Michael's deaths.\n\nPosey said he believed people in Gadsden need to \"wake up\" to the danger of the virus that cost his wife her life, and take the social-distancing guidelines seriously.\n\nPhacethia took medication for rheumatoid arthritis and had slight high blood pressure. She wasn't being treated for the underlying conditions -- the heart, lung and kidney problems -- often cited as making people more vulnerable to the virus.\n\nFor Phacethia, he said, the virus made her very weak, \"it just drained her.\" Her body started shutting down, he said.\n\n\"She really was a good person,\" Posey said. \"She was the type person, when she left the house, she presented herself well. She didn't go around and collect a lot of friends.\"\n\nBut if social media is an indicator, Phacethia Posey had many good friends, who treasured her and her family. They have flooded Facebook in recent days with concerns for this family hit so hard by COVID-19.\n\nThey've shared recollections of good times, good meals cooked, and kindnesses shown, by the members of the family lost to the virus, by those recovering for it, and dealing with its aftermath.\n\nWith the toll it's taken so far on their family, they know the seriousness of the virus and want others to know also -- that's why they spoke out.\n\n\"People aren't taking this virus seriously,\" especially, it seems the younger people, Posey said. He's seen people come to visit hugging on each other.\n\n\"I see people out without masks, \" Posey said. \"They know it's happening, but they're not taking it seriously.\"\n\nPorter and Posey are troubled by people shouting to reopen businesses and gathering places, as their family grieves.",

        "body": "ALBANY, N.Y. -- Three children have died in New York from inflammatory disease that might be linked to coronavirus, Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Saturday.\n\nThe announcement adds to the state's worry that it might be entering a new phase of the COVID-19 pandemic where it strikes children, who before had been deemed at low risk for the virus.\n\n\"This is the last thing we need at this time,\" Cuomo said at his daily briefing in Manhattan.\n\nCuomo said New York is up to at least 73 cases of the illness, which appears similar to Kawasaki disease or toxic shock syndrome, including a persistent fever.\n\nThe governor didn't give details about where the deaths occurred, but he said Friday that one was of a 5-year-old boy in New York City, and Westchester County officials said Friday that one death happened locally, along with 11 children who had been hospitalized.\n\nThe illness has been called \"Pediatric Multi-System Inflammatory Syndrome Associated with COVID-19,\" and Cuomo said the state will launch an investigation into it in conjunction with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nMore kids are falling ill to mysterious Kawasaki-like disease: What is it and is it related to COVID-19?\n\nAccording to the state Department of Health, the potential symptoms that should prompt caregivers to seek immediate medical attention for a child include:\n\nCuomo's directive to the health department will aim to develop \"a case definition\" for the illness \"to determine whether the remaining cases under investigation are definitively associated with the syndrome.\"\n\nNew York has been the epicenter for COVID-19 in the nation, with another 226 deaths on Friday alone, bringing the state's death toll to 21,045, by far the most in the U.S.\n\nIn Westchester, the children had symptoms four to six weeks after initial exposure to the coronavirus disease, local officials said Friday.\n\nOn Wednesday, New York issued a health advisory to medical professionals to be on the lookout for the virus among children and to report any cases to the state.\n\nThe symptoms have been considered similar to Kawasaki disease or toxic shock syndrome due to their inflammatory nature and fever, but experts have been unsure whether the diseases are linked.\n\nThe new condition was first reported by doctors in Britain, Italy and Spain in late April, and experts said it appears to particularly hit children aged 2 to 6.\n\n\"With each passing day, we're learning more about this terrible virus, and this potentially new development requires even greater understanding,\" Dr. Howard Zucker, the state health commissioner, said in a statement.\n\n\"We'll devote the resources of the department to research each potential case and share our findings with healthcare providers around the state and country.\"\n\nJoseph Spector is the New York state editor for the USA TODAY Network.

        "authors": [],
        "body": "On Thursday, Costa Cruises revealed an additional 14 crew members tested positive for coronavirus on the Costa Atlantica, raising the number of cases on the ship from 34 on Wednesday to a total of 48. The ship has been in dry dock for repairs in Nagasaki, Japan, since Jan. 29.\n\nThe 14 new positives came from a round of 66 tests, Costa Cruises said in a release provided to USA TODAY by Roger Frizzell, spokesperson for parent company Carnival Corp.\n\nJapanese officials are investigating the coronavirus outbreak on board Costa Atlantica, which has puzzled authorities. The southern port city has a relatively low number of infections and the vessel has been docked for almost three months.\n\nThe outbreak on the Italian-operated Costa Atlantica surfaced Tuesday when officials from Nagasaki and Mitsubishi Heavy Industry, which is in charge of repairs and maintenance on the ship, announced that a crew member developed a cough and fever.\n\nAs of Thursday, 47 of those crew members remained quarantined on board. Frizzell said one was medically disembarked Wednesday after becoming seriously ill and has since been put on a ventilator.\n\nCosta Cruises said the ship has 623 crew of 36 different nationalities, including a Japanese translator. There are no passengers on board due to the ongoing repair work. Costa Atlantica's repair work was moved to Nagasaki due to the pandemic, which began in China, where the work was originally scheduled to be done.\n\nThe remaining staff do not have serious symptoms and remain quarantined on board in single rooms, except for those on essential duties, including cooking and delivering food for their colleagues, officials said. Some of the essential crew also are infected.\n\nNagasaki officials have said they plan to have the crew of the Costa Atlantica quarantine themselves on board unless they develop serious symptoms, and seek ways to let others who tested negative return to their countries.\n\nNagasaki is getting support from a military medical team and plans to test all the remaining crew by Friday.\n\nDetails of the movements of the crew are not clear, but officials suspect they had either contracted the virus while in town or when the ship switched crew in the past few weeks.\n\nMitsubishi initially said the crew has not left the dock since March 14, when Nagasaki reported its first coronavirus case and asked all crew members to stay on board. But the company acknowledged the following day that some members who passed body temperature checks and other requirements had been allowed off the ship.\n\nThere have been other people outside of the crew that have come and gone from the ship though.\n\n\"Outside technicians and local agents have been on the ship as part of the dry dock maintenance program being undertaken in Japan,\" Frizzell told USA TODAY Thursday. \"They have been required to undertake temperature checks before being permitted to board.\"\n\nAs infections in Japan continue to spread nationwide, the outbreak on the ship has raised concerns about testing and hospital capacity in Nagasaki, which has 17 people infected, 11 of whom are hospitalized. As of Thursday, Japan had nearly 12,000 cases and 299 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins data.\n\nEarlier this year, the U.S.-operated cruise ship Diamond Princess had 712 infected people among more than 3,700 passengers and crew while it, too, was quarantined in Yokohama, Japan, near Tokyo. A total of 13 people have died, according to Johns Hopkins data.\n\nIn mid-February, while discussing evacuation plans for Americans on board, health official Dr. Anthony Fauci said the quarantine on the Diamond Princess had failed. At the time, 454 people had been infected.\n\n\"As it turned out, that was very ineffective in preventing spread on the ship,\" Fauci told the USA TODAY Editorial Board. Every hour, another four or five people were being infected.\n\nThe MS Artania, a German-flagged ship owned by Phoenix Reisen, was quarantined in the Western Australian port of Fremantle for two weeks due to coronavirus and is now on her way back to Europe, according to a release posted on the cruise line's website. The ship still has passengers on board, and three passengers died of COVID-19; all had underlying conditions.\n\nThe quarantine began on April 3, according to an earlier release, after at least 36 people on board had tested positive for coronavirus in late March.\n\nOn March 15, after learning that ports in the South Pacific would be closed, Phoenix Reisen gave passengers the opportunity to return home on flights organized by the line or to remain on the ship for the journey home.\n\nOn March 16, 199 passengers chose to return home and 832 remained on board with 515 crew members.\n\nLater, on March 25, while the ship was stopped in Fremantle to refuel, people on board began exhibiting coronavirus symptoms, and local authorities found that seven of nine people tested were positive. They were taken to local hospitals.\n\nOn March 29, another 860 passengers and crew members were flown back to Germany on four chartered planes. More than 800 of the people who flew back were passengers, but 16 passengers chose to remain on board.\n\nMS Artania left Australia Saturday, the day after local officials ended its 14-day quarantine. During its time in quarantine, the ship was cleaned and disinfected by local authorities, according to the release.\n\nOn Sunday, 41 nonessential European crew members flew home from Perth. They were joined by 18 passengers who had been quarantined in hotels due to positive COVID-19 tests who were deemed healthy. Another eight who completed their quarantine re-boarded the ship to make their way back to Germany.\n\nJust over 400 other crew members remained on board when the ship departed Australia. Since the majority of the remaining crew is from the Philippines and Indonesia, MS Artania has set sail towards Southeast Asia to bring crew members to Bali on Thursday and Manila the following Tuesday for disembarkation, according to the release.\n\nThen, MS Artania, which will have about 75 crew, its captain and an unspecified number of remaining guests on board, will transit the Suez Canal. According to the release, the ship is expected to arrive in Bremerhaven, Germany, on May 31.\n\nNine passengers remain in quarantine in Australia due to positive tests.\n\nUSA TODAY has reached out to Phoenix Reisen for comment.\n\nTwo other cruise ships, the Costa Serena and the Costa Neo Romantica, are also docked in Nagasaki with 669 and 393 crew members, respectively. Nagasaki city official Kaori Matsuo said so far there has been no report of anyone showing symptoms.\n\n'Inherently high-risk setting': Are cruise ships unsafe - and will they change?\n\nPrincess Cruises, Ruby Princess, which prompted a criminal investigation after it became the country's largest single source of coronavirus infections, left that countryThursday.\n\nThe Ruby Princess has been linked to 19 deaths in Australia and two in the United States. According to Johns Hopkins data, Australia has recorded 67 coronavirus deaths. A government inquiry is underway into why 2,700 passengers and crew were allowed to disembark in Sydney on March 19, before the test results of sick passengers were known.\n\nMany passengers have since flown out of Sydney. Two died at home in the United States, including 64-year-old Los Angeles resident Chung Chen, whose family is suing Princess Cruises for more than $1 million for failing to alert passengers to the risk. Princess Cruises is a subsidiary of Carnival Corp., which is incorporated in Bermuda and headquartered in California.\n\nNew South Wales state, which includes Sydney, has banned further cruise ship arrivals until new health protocols are agreed with the federal government.\n\nThe Ruby Princess had delayed its departure from Port Kembla, south of Sydney, because of sick crew members, several of whom have died in Sydney hospitals.\n\nIt left the cargo port with a skeleton crew late in the afternoon nudged by two tug boats.\n\nA large banner strung across its stern said: \"Thank You Illawarra,\" referring to the coastal region around the port.\n\nPrincess Cruises did not immediately disclose where the ship was heading, though media reports have said its destination is the Philippines.\n\nOn Thursday morning, 300 Filipino crew left the ship and were taken to Sydney to catch a charter flight to Manila. They traveled from Port Kembla in 40 buses because of social distancing rules.\n\nHealth authorities said everyone who remains on board has been cleared of the virus.\n\n\"We've had the isolation procedures long enough, we've not seen new cases, we also understand the medical capability on this ship, so for all of those reasons, we have formed the view that the ship is now in a position to set sail,\" New South Wales Chief Health Officer Kerry Chant told reporters.\n\nState police are investigating whether the ship's management downplayed potential virus cases before passengers disembarked.\n\nPolice ordered all foreign cruise ships to leave the state in late March, fearful that sick crews could overwhelm Sydney hospitals.\n\nRuby Princess refused to leave, fearing a coronavirus emergency on the open seas.\n\nThe ship's doctor, Ilse Von Watzdorf, told the first day of a New South Wales government inquiry on Wednesday that she was surprised health authorities had allowed passengers to leave in Sydney before the test results were known.\n\nVon Watzdorf gave evidence to the inquiry by video link from the ship, where she has been in quarantine.\n\nThe ship had returned to Sydney after an 11-day cruise to New Zealand, which was regarded as a low-risk destination.",

        "body": "WASHINGTON -- Five sailors on the U.S. aircraft carrier sidelined in Guam due to a COVID-19 outbreak have tested positive for the virus for the second time and have been taken off the ship, according to the Navy.\n\nThe resurgence of the virus in the five sailors on the USS Theodore Roosevelt underscores the befuddling behavior of the highly contagious virus and raises questions about how troops that test positive can be reintegrated into the military, particularly on ships.\n\nAll five sailors had previously tested positive and had gone through at least two weeks of isolation. As part of the process, they all had to test negative twice in a row, with the tests separated by at least a day or two before they were allowed to go back to the ship.\n\nRelated: Return of COVID-19 may delay USS Theodore Roosevelt's departure from Guam\n\nThe Roosevelt has been at port in Guam since late March after the outbreak of the virus was discovered. More than 4,000 of the 4,800 crew members have gone ashore since then for quarantine or isolation. Earlier this month hundreds of sailors began returning to the ship, in coordinated waves, to get ready to set sail again.\n\nIn a statement Friday, the Navy said that, while onboard, the five sailors self-monitored and adhered to strict social distancing protocols.\n\n\"These five Sailors developed influenza-like illness symptoms and did the right thing reporting to medical for evaluation,\" the Navy said, adding that they were immediately removed from the ship and put back in isolation. A small number of other sailors who were in contact with them were also taken off the ship.\n\nPentagon spokesman Jonathan Hoffman said the outbreak has been a learning process.\n\n\"This is a very stubborn, infectious disease,\" he told Pentagon reporters during a briefing on Friday. He said that because of the Navy's quick action, medical crew were notified right away and determined who might have also been exposed and got them all off the ship.\n\nAs of Thursday, more than 2,900 sailors have reboarded the ship, and about 25% of the more than 1,000 who had tested positive have now recovered, according to the Navy.\n\nOne U.S. official familiar with the situation on the ship said commanders don't know why this is happening but suggested it could be related to questions about testing accuracy.\n\nThe official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations, said that screening has been intensified on the ship. And, anyone who exhibits any flu-like symptoms at all is being tested and removed.\n\nThe sailors have been tested using the nasal swab. And in some cases the infection can be at such a low level that it is not detected by the test. It's not clear whether cases like these are actual relapses, or if people tested negative without really being completely clear of the virus.\n\nMore from USA TODAY\n\nNavy orders deeper dive into Roosevelt incident, delays decision on future of Capt.

        "body": "HAGATNA, Guam -- In a month, the Navy has tested all of the nearly 5,000 sailors of the virus-stricken USS Theodore Roosevelt.\n\nThe latest updates as of Friday morning show positive results for coronavirus have climbed to 840 on the aircraft carrier. Negative results amount to 4,098, with 100% of the crew tested, according to the Navy. Dozens of sailors who initially tested negative later tested positive.\n\nOf the total cases, 88 sailors have recovered, up from the 63 reported on Thursday.\n\nThe Navy reported 4,234 sailors moved ashore into housing on Naval Base Guam and into hotels in Tamuning and Tumon.\n\nAs of Friday, there were four sailors at the U.S. Naval Hospital and none in the ICU.\n\nSince the ship pulled into Guam on March 27, one sailor from the crew, Aviation Ordnanceman Chief Petty Officer Charles Robert Thacker, died after testing positive for the virus.\n\nSailors quarantined in hotels sent thank you messages to the Marines providing support in the hotels. A video showing some of the thank you notes was uploaded to Facebook.\n\nCapt. Vicente Huerta said in the video that one night the sailors coordinated a time to show their appreciation by cheering all at once.\n\n\"They came out on the balconies and started cheering and clapping,\" Huerta said. \"I started getting goosebumps and I was like, 'OK, this is a different type of deployment.'\"\n\nOnly sailors who test negative and who are asymptomatic are quarantined in Guam's hotels. Sailors who test positive remain on base, according to Joint Region Marianas and Gov. Lou Leon Guerrero. Additionally, if sailors show symptoms while in hotels they are taken back to the base, officials have said.\n\nFact Check: Trump claims coronavirus tests are widely available. They are not",

    "Coronavirus: A family ravaged by COVID-19 struggled to get tests, care": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "DETROIT -- The man who raised Keith Gambrell, who loved him like a son and married his mother, died in a blue recliner of novel coronavirus in his Michigan home.\n\nGary Fowler, 56, went to the emergency rooms of three metro Detroit hospitals in the weeks leading up to his death, begging for a coronavirus test, begging for help because he was having difficulty breathing, but was repeatedly turned away, Gambrell said.\n\n\"My dad passed at home, and no one tried to help him,\" Gambrell, 33, of northwest Detroit said through tears. \"He asked for help, and they sent him away. They turned him away.\"\n\nIn the hours before his death, breathing was so difficult, Fowler slept sitting up in the bedroom chair, while his wife, Cheryl Fowler, dozed in the bed by his side. When she woke, her husband of nearly 24 years was gone.\n\nBefore he took his last breaths, Gary Fowler had scrawled on a piece of paper: \"Heart beat irregular ... oxygen level low.\"\n\n\"My little brother called me, screaming, 'Daddy won't wake up!' \" Gambrell said.\n\nBy the time Gambrell got across town to their house on the morning of April 7, police and emergency medical workers had already arrived.\n\nHis dad was still in the recliner. A bluish tinge had settled on his lips and fingers.\n\n\"I went up and talked to him,\" Gambrell said, his voice breaking as he held back tears. \"I told him I love him, and that I'll see him again one day, and that I'm sorry we couldn't even have a funeral for him.\n\n\"I just felt so bad because he was begging for his life, and medical professionals did nothing for him.\"\n\nThe virus, which has hit Detroit harder than any other city in Michigan -- infecting at least 30,791 people and killing 2,308, of whom 7,497 are in the city of Detroit, where 589 have died -- has brought renewed attention to health disparities for people of color.\n\n\"About 33% of the cases of COVID-19 in this entire state of Michigan are in African Americans, and about 40% ... of the deaths,\" Dr. Joneigh Khaldun, the chief medical executive for the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services, said during a Facebook Live interview Thursday with Detroit's Civil Rights, Inclusion and Equal Opportunity Department. \"And that's incredibly concerning. We know that African Americans are only about 14% of the entire population.\"\n\nRacial disparities: Black people are overwhelmingly dying from coronavirus in cities across the US\n\nGambrell lives in Detroit's 48235 ZIP code, a coronavirus hot zone with the highest infection rate per capita -- with 162 cases per 10,000 residents -- and the highest number of confirmed cases of the virus at 724, according to data released Friday by the city.\n\nGambrell's grandfather, David Fowler, lived in the Boston Edison District. His 48202 ZIP code is in the top 10 for coronavirus infections, too, with 114 cases per 10,000 residents.\n\nDavid Fowler died of COVID-19 just hours before his son Gary was taken by the same disease.\n\nDenise Fair, Detroit's chief public health officer, said Friday that the ZIP code data still are huge under-estimations. Coronavirus testing remains a barrier for many in the community, as does access to care.\n\n\"It's estimated that there are upwards of 10 people with undetected infections for every confirmed case, and in some communities, the estimates are even higher,\" she said.\n\nDozens of factors feed the health disparities for people of color, said Khaldun, who formerly worked as the director and health officer for the Detroit Department of Health.\n\n\"It's a contagious disease,\" she said. \"That's the bottom line. And people who have chronic conditions, asthma, diabetes are more likely to get the disease and then have more severe illness.\"\n\nAnd in Detroit -- the biggest majority black big city in America -- rates of many of those chronic conditions are higher than the rest of the state, making Detroiters especially vulnerable. Add poverty to the mix, Khaldun said, and it's the perfect recipe for rapid-fire spread.\n\nFor many of the city's poor, it's impossible to practice social distancing and stay home because they are more likely to hold low-wage jobs in grocery stores, gas stations, and other work in services that are considered essential and still operating through this crisis.\n\nTransportation plays into it, too, Khaldun said.\n\n\"People who are more likely to be underprivileged and people of color, living in poverty, are more likely to get sick from this disease,\" Khaldun said. \"I think it's quite simple, actually. And I think we'll see that once we get more data and start doing the analysis.\"\n\nEven when people in poverty get the disease, Khaldun explained, isolating from others in a household might not be possible, increasing the chances that the virus will spread through entire families.\n\nBut even beyond the economic drivers that make the black community more vulnerable in this pandemic, there's also bias within the medical community, Khaldun said.\n\nThat bias might play a role in who gets a COVID-19 test and who does not, who gets hospitalized and who does not, and whose symptoms are taken seriously and whose are not.\n\n\"I'm a doctor and my own doctor did not listen to my concerns about a headache after I had my first child,\" she said. \"And I ended up in an ICU (intensive-care unit) with a head full of blood. ... My own doctors did not listen to me...\n\n\"We know there's often delays in diagnosis for all kinds of medical conditions in the black community and people of color. So are there delays in testing? Are there delays in treatment? Are we sending people home when they really should be admitted to the hospital because they're so at risk for deteriorating quickly? So those are the types of things that we're going to have to look at.\"\n\nHours before Gary Fowler died in his rocking chair, his father, David Fowler, also slipped away.\n\nCOVID-19 came for David -- a grandfather of 11 and great-grandfather of two -- while he lay alone in a hospital bed about a dozen miles from his son, who was \"his best friend,\" Gambrell said.\n\nHe was 76.\n\nDavid, a retired tool and dye maker who loved camping and the outdoors, took ill in mid-March.\n\nOn the morning of March 22, Gambrell went to visit his grandfather to check on him. Gambrell's mom and dad went, too.\n\n\"We just thought he had the flu,\" Gambrell said. But that afternoon, it was clear to them all that David's illness was serious -- he'd passed out in the bathroom.\n\nThey called 911, and an ambulance took David to Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit, where he was admitted. He tested positive for the virus, and was put on a ventilator.\n\n\"The following week, my father started developing a cough,\" Gambrell said, \"and the cough was getting worse and worse by the hour.\"\n\nIn the last week in March, Gary Fowler spiked a fever, too, and his breathing was becoming labored. He went to Beaumont Hospital in Grosse Pointe for help, Gambrell said.\n\n\"He tells them, 'My father has the coronavirus. I would like to get a test because I am showing symptoms. I am coughing,' \" Gambrell said. \"He had a fever of 101. He had shortness of breath. He was showing all the signs.\n\n\"They tell him, 'Sir, more than likely the fever is from bronchitis.' And they tell him to go home. But they also give my dad a piece of paper saying to act like you have the virus.\"\n\nGary Fowler was not tested for COVID-19. He followed the instructions and went back home.\n\nThe same scenario played out at several other hospitals in the days that followed as Fowler continued to seek medical care, knowing his body was starting to fail.\n\nAfter going to Detroit Receiving Hospital, Fowler was told he'd get better care at Henry Ford.\n\nWhen he arrived at Henry Ford, Gambrell said his father explained: \" 'My chest hurts. I can't breathe. I have a fever that has not broke. I've been taking Tylenol, I've been drinking stuff and it is not breaking. I think I have the virus because my father tested positive for it and I saw him ... the day he went to the hospital.'\n\n\"But it was the same thing. They tell him: 'You're fine. You have bronchitis. Go home. Drink water. Act like you have the virus.' \"\n\nGary Fowler was never tested. He was never admitted to any hospital or given any treatment, his son said, perplexed by the way each hospital turned away his father in his moment of need.\n\n\"If I have to act like I have a virus, does that mean I have a virus and you guys are sending me home until I'm on my deathbed?\" Gambrell asked. \"And then, when I come back to the hospital, it's too late?\n\n\"I honestly think that's why the death rate for blacks is so high. It's because we're being pushed to the back and told to go home, but come back if you can make it before you die.\n\n\"That shouldn't be the medical procedure for anything.\"\n\nBeaumont issued the following statement after questions about how Gary Fowler was treated:\n\n\"COVID-19 is hitting southeastern Michigan particularly hard. As patients come to Beaumont for care during this extraordinary time, we are doing all we can to evaluate, triage and care for patients based on the information we know at the time. When making care decisions, we do not discriminate against anyone based upon their gender, race or any other factor. We grieve the loss of any patient to COVID-19 or any other illness.\"\n\nHenry Ford Health System said Saturday that no one who comes to the hospital is denied care.\n\n\"All patients who come to our emergency departments receive care and assessment,\" said Brenda Craig, vice president of integrated communications at Henry Ford Health System. \"Some patients will meet criteria for admission at the time, while others may not. In the case of COVID-19, we have a multi-step triage process. As patients arrive to our emergency department, all are screened for COVID-19 symptoms. Those with mild or moderate symptoms who do not meet admission criteria at the time they present may be sent home with strict instructions to return immediately if symptoms worsen.\n\n\"Our thoughts and prayers are with the Fowlers and all families devastated by the effects of COVID-19. We're not able to share details due to patient privacy, but we don't take lightly any concerns of biased care given our dedication to putting patients first. Throughout this pandemic, we have followed CDC (Centers for Disease Control nad Prevention) guidelines related to testing and clinical care protocols. Henry Ford has also been a leader in addressing health disparities and driving true health equity as part of our core mission and values and that work will continue.\"\n\nCraig acknowledged that testing for coronavirus remains limited.\n\n\"Given the U.S. currently does not have the ability to widely expand testing to everyone, the CDC has issued guidelines to health systems to prioritize testing,\" she said. \"We've followed these guidelines closely, whereby patients who are currently admitted and health care workers experiencing symptoms are among those receiving top priority for testing.\"\n\nEven though his father never had a COVID-19 test, Gambrell said his dad's death certificate says he died of the virus.\n\n\"There's no question,\" he said.\n\nDespite the fresh grief of losing both of the family patriarchs within hours of one another, the coronavirus still wasn't done with the Fowler family.\n\nThe day her husband died, Cheryl, 57, got sick, too.\n\n\"She started coughing and had a fever of 102\" degrees, said Gambrell, who was terrified about waiting too long to get help for her.\n\nCheryl's cousin, state Rep. Karen Whitsett, who also had COVID-19, heard about the deaths of Gary and David Fowler, and called the family.\n\nWhen she learned that no one else had been able to get tested, and that Gary had been unable to get hospital care, Whitsett gave them a number for the doctor who treated her for COVID-19.\n\nBut even Whitsett said she'd had trouble getting tested.\n\n\"The part that bothers me the most through this whole entire process is that ... if I hadn't used my name, if it wasn't for my name and my job title, I don't think I would have gotten anywhere, either,\" with testing and treatment, said Whitsett, a Detroit Democrat.\n\nWhitsett made national headlines earlier this month for praising President Donald Trump and crediting him with saving her life because he'd touted the anti-malaria drug hydroxycholoroquine as a potential treatment for coronavirus. Last week, she went to the White House to meet him.\n\nObstacles to getting COVID-19 testing and care are not just happening in Detroit's black community.\n\nThe American Hospital Association sent a letter last week to U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar about the racial disparities in the federal COVID-19 response, highlighting a lack of available tests for African Americans, unequal medical treatment for those who have the disease and lack of public health information about coronavirus for communities of color.\n\nLatino community: Latinos disproportionately dying, losing jobs because of the coronavirus\n\nAnd the CDC released on Friday its first national report on race and coronavirus. It suggests 30% of COVID-19 patients so far in the outbreak are black, though the U.S. population is only about 12% black. The federal agency acknowledged, however, that race data was missing from 75% of the cases it examined.\n\nThe doctor who prescribed hydroxychloroquine for Whitsett wrote prescriptions for Cheryl Fowler, Gambrell, his brothers, sister and niece to get coronavirus tests, Gambrell said.\n\nBut before any of them could get in for testing, Cheryl's condition worsened. Her fever was rising and she was having trouble breathing, too.\n\nGambrell drove her to Beaumont Hospital, Grosse Pointe, the night of April 7 -- just hours after her husband's body was taken to the funeral home.\n\n\"Before they even looked at my mother, there was a young Caucasian lady complaining about sushi she got from GrubHub that upset her stomach, and they swooped her in the back like she had coronavirus,\" Keith said.\n\n\"But my mom, she had all the symptoms, and they tell her just go home. That makes no sense. ... They helped a girl who ate bad seafood over someone with all the signs of needing medical need help.\n\n\"I felt like they sent my mother home to die.\"\n\nUnderlying issues: Health issues for blacks, Latinos and Native Americans may cause coronavirus to ravage communities\n\nGambrell refused to give up. Next, he took Cheryl to Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit.\n\nHe said he kissed her forehead before she entered the doors of the emergency room alone -- during the pandemic, most hospitals don't allow adults to have support people with them inside to avoid further risk of infection.\n\nGambrell wondered whether it would be the last time he'd see her alive. The grief was still raw from the death of his father. He prayed he wouldn't lose his mother, too.\n\n\"I was very concerned that my mother wouldn't walk out of that hospital, especially after what just happened to my dad,\" he said.\n\nThere was relief when he got a call about an hour after he dropped off Cheryl at Henry Ford. She was being admitted.\n\n\"She tested positive for the virus as well,\" he said. \"It was a blessing they kept my mom. I think the only reason they kept my mom was because she had prescriptions to get tested for the virus.\"\n\nCheryl Fowler soon also needed a ventilator to help her breathe. Gambrell got daily updates from the hospital, and his sister frequently checked on her by calling the nurse's station.\n\nGambrell said he began to feel a little off as well. He had a tickle in the back of his throat, felt hot and cold flashes and had lost his sense of taste and smell.\n\nHis youngest brother, Ross, was sick, too.\n\n'Tuskegee always looms in our minds': Some fear black Americans, hardest hit by coronavirus, may not get vaccine\n\nOn April 8, while their mother struggled for air at Henry Ford Hospital, the rest of the family went to get coronavirus tests.\n\nKeith and Ross, 19, and their brother Troy, 21, sister, Paris, 28, and her daughter, Logan, 7, all got tested at an urgent care clinic. They were told it would be at least five days before they got results.\n\nGambrell took him to Henry Ford in Detroit, too. Ross had been complaining of chest pain, and also had fever and a cough. It was the same hospital where their mother was starting to show signs of improvement.\n\n\"He said every time he inhales, it hurts. It hurts very bad,\" Gambrell said the evening of April 9. \"They did a chest X-ray and were like, 'Oh, you have pneumonia. So here's a piece of paper. Go home, and act like you have the virus.'\n\n\"I am so tired of hearing that. If I have it, I have it. Please let me know that I have it so I can save my life.\n\n\"If my dad could have gotten tested the first time he went to the hospital, he would be here today.\"\n\nCheryl came off the ventilator April 10, Gambrell said. And two days after that, she had recovered enough to be discharged home.\n\nShe'll be on supplemental oxygen for at least two weeks, he said, but she's slowly healing through her grief.\n\nGambrell and his brother Ross both tested positive for COVID-19, but both are feeling much better now. Everyone else in the family who was tested got negative results.\n\nHe is shaken, he said, by all the family has endured in this crisis, and what it has revealed about inequities in this country.\n\n\"Why isn't there enough testing in the areas that are mostly impacted, which are black areas?\" he asked.\n\n\"This coronavirus is gonna cause so much PTSD for people. It's sad. There's going to be a major fallout after this.\n\n\"It's not right at all. ... I don't try to put color on things and say, 'Oh this is black or this is white.' I don't do that with anything in my life, but when you see it, you have to call it how it is.\"",

        "body": "ANCHORAGE, Alaska -- Selling Girl Scout cookies is normally a foolproof business model, but the coronavirus outbreak cooled sales of the treats in Alaska.\n\nThe Girl Scouts of Alaska sought assistance, and the organization received a federal recovery loan to help compensate for lost cookie sales.\n\nFirst National Bank Alaska facilitated the federal Paycheck Protection Program loan, The Anchorage Daily News reported Sunday.\n\nLeslie Ridle, head of one of two Girl Scouts councils in Alaska, said fears of girls becoming infected with COVID-19 forced the organization to cut its six-week sales season in half.\n\nSales of the famed cookies fund nearly everything the council does, including camps and scholarships for 3,500 girls and wages for 20 full-time employees.\n\nMore: Girl Scout Cookies move to online orders amid coronavirus pandemic\n\nMore: Coronavirus wrecks Girl Scout cookie season, so scouts get creative\n\n\"It was frenzied shopping, and people were hoarding cookies like they were toilet paper,\" Ridle said of sales before the state ordered business closures last month.\n\nNow her Anchorage-based council is sitting on about 144,000 unsold boxes filling the homes of scouting families in southern Alaska, Ridle said.\n\n\"I'm hearing from lots of families: 'When am I getting these out of my living rooms?' \" Ridle said.\n\nThe First National Bank Alaska loan officer called at night and on weekends, including Easter Sunday, to gather information to obtain the loan, which arrived in the council's bank account last week, Ridle said.\n\nThe funding allowed employees to continue working and provide online programs for Girl Scouts stuck at home, like magic trick lessons and flamenco dancing. A new COVID-19 badge emphasizes good hygiene.\n\n\"It's our bridge to keep things going,\" Ridle said.\n\nCompanies including ConocoPhillips Co., GCI LLC and First National Bank Alaska have also made big cookie purchases to help the Girl Scouts.\n\nPeople whose lives have been altered by the pandemic still want the cookies, the \"ultimate comfort food,\" Ridle said.\n\nFor most people, the new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia, and death. The vast majority of people recover.",

    "Coronavirus: At least 8 fatal cases as FedEx workers' complaints mount": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "NEWARK, N.J. - Pamela Pope spent her days doing a mix of work at FedEx's Newark Liberty International Airport facility, from deliveries to unloading the dozens of cargo planes flying in and out every day. It was a job she loved, and one the 56-year-old from Neptune had done for more than half her life.\n\nBut as coronavirus cases began to spread among her coworkers, fears of contracting the virus dominated her thoughts, family members said.\n\n\"Today I am scheduled off from work and am grateful,\" she wrote a cousin in a text message. \"My FedEx location has nothing for me. They said they ordered stuff for us but it was backordered? In this stage we can't find masks, the bacterial gloves, sanitizer, nothing, cuz, and we are required to be at work.\"\n\n\"She became really afraid to even go to work,\" said her sister Debbie Hyman, who said Pope brought her own masks, gloves and cleaning supplies to work.\n\nPope died of coronavirus on April 25, her sister said.\n\nShe is not the only FedEx worker whose symptoms have turned fatal.\n\nThe day prior, eight FedEx Express domestic workers deaths were cited in an internal document obtained by the Memphis Commercial Appeal and Bergen Record.\n\nAt least five fatalities have occurred in Newark, according to family members who spoke with reporters from both newspapers. The death of a sixth person, identified as a FedEx Newark worker on her personal LinkedIn and Facebook accounts, was also attributed to COVID-19 complications in the social media posts of family members. Attempts to reach that family were unsuccessful.\n\nFedEx confirmed in a statement that \"some\" of its Newark employees have tested positive for COVID-19, with most of them receiving treatment or having recovered from the disease.\n\n\"We are deeply saddened that a small number of team members have succumbed to the virus or complications related to it,\" FedEx said in its statement. \"We have been in contact with these families to offer our deepest condolences.\"\n\nInterviews with multiple family members and FedEx workers, coupled with a trail of complaints, filed with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, reveal a pattern of allegations that there was little and often delayed communication with FedEx workers about whether they had contact with a positive colleague; personal protective equipment has been lacking; and insufficient or no cleaning took place at sites where people who tested positive worked.\n\nA few days before Pope's death, Clara Newkirk, who logged cargo data at the Newark site, died at age 70, according to her daughter, Stephanie Newkirk-Miller.\n\nA 24-year FedEx veteran, Newkirk came home coughing from her last day of work before a two-week leave of absence she decided to take to reduce her risk of exposure, her daughter said.\n\n\"She was known as Mama Clara. She was sweet, a hard worker, she loved FedEx,\" her daughter, Stephanie Newkirk-Miller said. \"I begged her not to go to work when COVID started, but she said she had to go to work to do her duties.\"\n\nDuring that leave, FedEx sent Newkirk an email, that she'd been exposed to a coworker who tested positive, Newkirk-Miller said.\n\n\"They should have called and told her. They dropped the ball,\" said Newkirk-Miller, who believes her mother might have received care sooner if she had known someone had tested positive.\n\nHyman also thinks the company should have taken worker safety more seriously.\n\n\"They are a huge company and it's like, 'Why couldn't you afford all this? You're not a little, tiny, ten-people company. You are a huge company, all over the world,'\" Hyman said of FedEx, which has a market value of more than $30 billion.\n\nFedEx said it \"has found no objective evidence to suggest our employees are at any greater risk than the surrounding community, and we continue to assess each confirmed case of our employees in detail.\" It pointed to the high overall number of cases in the New Jersey and New York areas, saying positive COVID-19 tests among its employees are in line with state infection trends.\n\nNew Jersey has the second-highest number of deaths and known positive cases of coronavirus in the country, behind neighboring New York. Essex County, where Newark is located, has the highest number of deaths in the state at 1,240, as of May 1, and the third-highest number of positive cases compared with the state's 20 other counties.\n\nThe Newark hub, located at Newark Liberty International Airport, handles regional sorting and processing for FedEx Express' global delivery network. The facility can sort up to 156,000 documents and packages per hour - only the FedEx Express World Hub in Memphis and the national Indianapolis hub have higher capacities.\n\n\"Newark is a regional overlay, meaning if Buffalo (New York) has a lot of shipments going to the Northeast instead of going to Memphis, they will have a second plane that goes to Newark,\" said Dean Maciuba of consulting service Logistics Trends & Insights.\n\nAmid the COVID-19 pandemic, FedEx said it is diverting package volume away from Newark to \"promote social distancing and limit the number of people working\" at the hub.\n\nMaciuba worked at FedEx in various positions, including in aircraft ramp operations management, for more than 35 years. He said FedEx could shut down a regional hub like Newark and redirect those packages to its larger hubs in Memphis and Indianapolis in response to a COVID-19 outbreak. Because of that, FedEx is better positioned to handle an outbreak in its air network than rivals UPS or Amazon.\n\n\"FedEx is more able to respond to ad hoc circumstances because their air network and resources are just so vast\" compared to rivals UPS and Amazon, he said.\n\nAt least 464 of FedEx Express' U.S. employees have contracted the coronavirus, according to figures in the internal company report obtained by the newspapers, which FedEx did not dispute. FedEx Express employed around 112,000 domestic workers as of 2019, part of FedEx's overall U.S. workforce of 293,000. The 70-acre Newark location has about 2,000 employees.\n\nWorkers in at least 13 states have filed 26 complaints related to COVID-19 workplace safety with the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration as of April 22 - when OSHA data shows another 45 investigations involving as-yet undisclosed employers in the courier industry were underway.\n\nAllegations raised in complaints to OSHA included:\n\nOSHA wrote that it would not provide the findings of its investigations into the 26 FedEx worker complaints the agency has closed, unless a Freedom of Information Act was filed. A spokesperson said inspectors do not close complaints for which citations have been identified, though inspectors can use discretion in deciding not to issue a citation if they believe the employer is acting in good faith.\n\nThe complaints echo the claims of multiple whistleblowers at FedEx's main hub in Memphis - and concerns sent to the office of U.S. Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., a spokesperson said.\n\nIn a letter sent Friday to FedEx Chairman and CEO Fred Smith, Booker said he was \"deeply troubled by reports\" of FedEx Newark hub workers contracting COVID-19 and \"several\" having died from the disease.\n\nBooker urged the company \"to take immediate and decisive action to properly enforce and strengthen social distancing policies, expand access to PPE, enhance sanitization practices, and drastically improve transparency and communication with workers\" if reports around the country on FedEx workplace safety shortcomings are accurate.\n\n\"If we are to successfully mitigate the spread of the COVID-19 virus in America, FedEx, which directly employs thousands of people across the country and reaches millions more through its services, must prioritize the safety and wellbeing of its employees and customers through stronger safety protocols and enforcement oversight,\" Booker said.\n\nBooker said multiple FedEx employees have informed his office \"that they only learned of their exposure to coworkers that have tested positive for COVID-19 from other colleagues, and heard no such information from management.\"\n\nAccording to Booker, some employees who came in contact with COVID-19 positive workers reported that management advised them \"to only quarantine for one or two days\" rather than the CDC-recommended 14-day self-isolation.\n\n\"Employees who were diagnosed with COVID-19 have also reported that FedEx never advised them how long they should stay home from work, nor did FedEx request that they identify any coworkers with whom they had been in close contact,\" Booker said.\n\nEmployees also told the New Jersey Senator that when they requested masks in early March, \"they were informed by management that it was not FedEx's responsibility to provide them.\"\n\n\"I understand that masks have since been provided to some employees, but not consistently,\" Booker said in his letter. \"I have also received reports that despite many confirmed positive cases of COVID-19 at your Newark Shipping Center, the facility has not been consistently cleaned, nor has FedEx been adequately sanitizing work stations, bathrooms, or common areas.\"\n\nFor its part, FedEx said in a statement it has made several safety improvements at the Newark hub.\n\n\"We are conducting temperature screenings for all team members, vendors and visitors entering the Newark hub; providing personal protective equipment to all team members, with masks and gloves required; enhancing sanitization practices with more frequent deep cleanings of common areas and vehicles.\"\n\nFedEx notifies employees, customers and vendors who may have had close contact \"as defined by CDC guidelines\" with an employee with COVID-19, according to its statement. Employees in close contact are contacted by FedEx and asked to call a doctor and self-quarantine for 14 days, the company said.\n\nFedEx did not respond when asked how soon its employees are contacted after possible contact with someone who tested positive.\n\nWhile some of these changes have been made in recent weeks, more could be done, said several workers who asked that their identities be protected because they feared retribution.\n\n\"The temperatures (screenings) are awesome. I think that helps out a lot because there are people that are probably sick and want to come to work,\" one worker said. He and other workers noted that temperatures were being checked at only one of the hub's three entrances.\n\nSome personal protective equipment is now being provided, with N-95 masks going to some departments, but not others. One ramp worker said they receive one, maybe two, surgical masks per week, and gloves that break easily during a shift that includes moving heavy cans of parcels or freight on and off planes and operating machinery.\n\nSuggestions have been made to stagger shifts to help with distancing and reduce exposure, but that has not happened, one FedEx employee said.\n\nFedEx said in a statement it has provided \"clear and frequent communication that reinforces the importance of personal hygiene, self-monitoring for symptoms and staying home when unwell.\"\n\nBut workers say the process of notifying them about when they have been around peers who have tested positive has been uneven.\n\nSome workers said they received notifications from headquarters about people in their work area testing positive - but in some cases they were told more than a week later. Then they were told to quarantine for the remaining days of the CDC-suggested 14 days after contact. Others have not received any notifications.\n\n\"They try not to say much when it comes to the virus, they don't really want to really talk about it,\" he said.\n\nAs their ranks have tested positive, died and others go out on leave, some have begun to feel scared and nervous for their well-being.\n\n\"These guys have been working for FedEx for years, I mean years, and we lose them, but nobody wants to talk about it,\" one worker said. \"They just want to keep producing, keep people in the boxes, keep people on the cans. ... If one person goes down, there's another guy to take his place - that's how I feel.\"\n\nOne of those guys was FedEx ramp worker Alex Lopez.\n\nLopez, who worked at FedEx for eight years on the ramp helping to on-load and off-load freight from planes, left for Florida on March 10. It's unclear how Lopez, 48, contracted coronavirus, but while on vacation he started getting chills in the morning, but didn't have any other unusual symptoms, according to his sister, Lexi Lopez.\n\nAfter returning from Florida, Lexi Lopez said he stayed home as his symptoms worsened, eventually going to Trinitas Regional Medical Center in Elizabeth, New Jersey, where his oxygen levels became dangerously low.\n\nOn the morning of April 2, Lopez wrote to his family and friends on Facebook that he was going on a ventilator.\n\n\"This coronavirus is trying to kick my butt and I'm fighting it. Need some love n prayers come my way please. Tyvm in advance!!!\"\n\nLopez died later that day.\n\nNow, Lexi Lopez is finalizing the retirement for her 74-year-old father, who worked alongside his son at FedEx in Newark.\n\nDebbie Hyman, Pamela Pope's sister, is currently attempting to manage her sister's cremation and apartment from afar, in Maryland. A FedEx supervisor was in touch with her immediately to provide information on accessing Pope's death benefits, she said. Since the family lacks the funds needed to pay for Pope's cremation, the information was welcome, Hyman said.\n\nBut she wants to know why FedEx didn't act as swiftly when her sister was still alive.\n\n\"They need to secure their employees. Because that did not have to happen,\" she said of her sister's death. \"If they knew that other employees were going through that, it should have been more secure ... with what they needed.\"\n\nFedEx credits its workers with \"providing critical services for healthcare providers, government agencies and families across the globe.\"\n\nThe dozens of FedEx cargo planes flying to and from Newark daily couldn't safely do so without the work of people like Orlando Gutierrez and Elvis Reed.\n\nGutierrez, a 60-year-old machine operator at the FedEx Newark hub, died April 18 from COVID-19 complications, according to Newark employees.\n\nReed, a 53-year-old ramp agent who lived in Linden, died April 20 after testing positive for COVID-19, said his brother, Robert Reed.\n\n\"He did the weights and balances on the airplanes,\" Robert Reed said. \"He was the guy doing the numbers behind the scenes.\"\n\nReed prepared for COVID-19 at work - Robert Reed said his brother sanitized his own workspace and came to work with his own mask and gloves. He had expressed frustration in employees not practicing social distancing and a lack of personal protective equipment, according to his brother.\n\n\"He was the one who cared,\" Robert Reed said. \"He stated to everyone, 'Look, why are you guys congregating when you know there has to be separation? This thing is attacking people left and right, and there are people dying from this.'\"\n\nElvis Reed initially believed he had a nasal issue, his brother said, but went to a hospital and tested positive for COVID-19. His condition worsened \"phenomenally quickly,\" Robert Reed said.\n\n\"He was concerned about it on a Friday, and by Monday, he was already gone,\" Robert Reed said.\n\nContributing: Daniel Connolly\n\nMax Garland reports for The Commercial Appeal in Memphis.

    "Coronavirus: Barbers and hair stylists defy stay at home orders": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "Carmelle Harris saw the man standing at the open front door of her house.\n\n\"Are you here for the haircut?'' she asked.\n\nHe was, and so Harris, wearing an N95 face mask, handed sanitary wipes to the man, and led him to the makeshift barber's chair in the living room.\n\nSoft music played in the background as a breeze kicked up and wind chimes jingled. The smell of citrus-scented candles and incense co-mingled as the customer, John Batinovich of Hollywood, settled into the barber's chair.\n\n\"You've got a great set up here,'' he said.\n\nIt's also illegal -- and during the coronavirus pandemic, the hair industry is drawing legal scrutiny across the country.\n\nThe number of hairstylists setting up shop at home or coloring and cutting hair at customers' homes is on the rise as stay-at-home orders in states like California have stretched beyond eight weeks, more than a dozen hair stylists and industry experts told USA TODAY.\n\nFinancial pressure is cited as the chief reason hairstylists like Harris of Compton, California have put their cosmetology licenses at risk. Two weeks ago, Harris decided she had little choice.\n\n\"Do I take a chance and get turned into a criminal because I decided to work and pay my bills on time?'' said Harris, 38. \"Or do I just sit and watch my bills pile up, so when the economy does open up I'm thousands and thousands of dollars in debt?''\n\nThere is no legal ambiguity in the state.\n\n\"California law requires that all services be performed in a licensed establishment,'' Cheri Gyuro, public information officer for the California Department of Consumer Affairs, told USA TODAY. Similar laws are in effect in every other state, said Steve Sleeper, executive director of the Professional Beauty Association.\n\nBut the hairstylists and barbers are fighting to regain legal work opportunities during the pandemic.\n\nLast week , The Center for American Liberty filed a federal lawsuit against California Gov. Gavin Newsom on behalf of the Professional Beauty Federation of California. It was an attempt to get hair salons reopened statewide.\n\nIn Connecticut, Salon owner Odete DaSilva said she is among thousands of hairstylists and salon owners urging Gov. Ned Lamont to push back the May 20 date when salons and barbershops will be allowed to reopen. She said they fear the risks of getting infected with COVID-19 are too high to go back to work and allowing them to do so would end their ability to collect unemployment benefits.\n\n\"It's such a divisive issue, right?'' said Steve Sleeper, executive director of the Professional Beauty Association. \"Our members are the same way that the rest of the country plays out. Half are thinking, 'Hey, it's too soon, let's wait and make things safe.' And the other half is, 'Let's go-go-go-go.' \"\n\nThe sense of urgency led one Southern California hairdresser to create in her garage a makeshift salon, complete with a hood dryer and a shampoo bowl. She spoke on the condition of anonymity because she said her cosmetology license could be revoked but allowed USA TODAY to take photos.\n\nUpon arrival, the hairdresser said, her clients have been instructed to text her rather ring the doorbell to keep her two dogs from barking and eliminate unnecessary noise that might draw attention from neighbors.\n\nThe choice to defy or abide by state orders that govern the hair industry has become part of pandemic politics.\n\nAfter Luther was released from a Dallas jail, Texas senator Ted Cruz got a haircut at her Salon \u00e0 la Mode. Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick announced he would pay Luther's $7,000 fine, although the salon owner now has ample money to handle it.\n\nShe received more than $500,000 from a GoFundMe campaign that was started a day before she reopened her salon, and recently Luther started a nonprofit called \"Courage to Stand.''\n\nOn May 14, Luther told USA TODAY she was driving from to Michigan to offer support for Manke, the barber who is facing jail time after refusing to close his barbershop in Owosso, a town of about 15,000.\n\n\"My attorneys have been in touch with his attorneys,'' said Luther, 46. \"Even if it's just showing my face, I need to go out there and support this man.\n\n\"Right now, I want to speak with actions and make sure everybody in the United States realizes that we're getting our rights and freedoms taken away, and we need to take them back immediately.''\n\nManke did not reply to interview requests.\n\nIn an interview at the small stucco house where she lives with two roommates, Harris did not speak about politics. But she spoke intently about health and safety, saying she recently completed two online courses and received COVID-19 certification from Barbicide, a company that sells products designed to clean and disinfect salons.\n\nOne of Harris's roommates was helping her disinfect between customers.\n\n\"Everything is super clean,'' Harris said of her makeshift salon.\n\nBut it's unlikely the California State Board of Barbering and Cosmetology will be impressed based on warning it issued May 1 by social media.\n\n\"The Board urges licensees to follow the stay at home orders,'' the post read. \"If businesses continue to put public health and safety at risk by not following the guidance provided, and if circumstances warrant it, the Board may pursue disciplinary action against their license. This will not be taken lightly.''\n\nBut last week, at the Sassoon Salon in Beverly Hills, the front door was open and a hairstylist was cutting a man's hair. Neither were wearing a face mask. Susie Mutch, the global marketing director for Sassoon, did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nIn Brookhaven, Mississippi, Dedra Edwards said she's worried for hairstylists and barbers going back to work after her brother Eugene, a longtime barber, died of COVID-19 in April at the age of 46.\n\nDedra Edwards said her family thinks 46-year-old Eugene Edwards was infected with COVID-19 during a hair show in Jackson, Miss. on March 15. Eugene Edwards, who lived in Brookhaven, Miss., was not wearing a face mask because the hair show was held before the state-at-home order was imposed in Mississippi, according to Dedra Edwards.\n\nShe said safety should be paramount as salons and barbershops reopen.\n\n\"I know they're using masks,'' Dedra Edwards said. \"But you don't know the client you're working with, and you can carry COVID-19 and not have any symptoms.''\n\nSafety was part of the motivation when the Center for American Liberty filed the lawsuit on behalf of the PBFC, said attorney Fred Jones, counsel for the group representing the beauty and barbering industry.\n\n\"Tell me, what's safer,\" Jones said, \"having (hairstylists and barbers) go from one kitchen to the next kitchen? Or having all of those ladies and men come into the controlled environment of the salon, where they maintain cross-contamination controls?''\n\nAfter entering Harris's home, Batinovich explained that he'd seen her on Craigslist, where a slew of hairstylists are advertising their services. The demand is high, several hairstylists told USA TODAY, and Harris said she averages between five and 10 customers per day.\n\nShe is charging $20 a haircut and making about as much as she does when she's working at a Floyd's 99 Barbershop.\n\nWorking with an electric razor, small comb and scissors, Harris needed about 20 minutes to complete Batinovich's haircut.",

        "body": "WASHINGTON -- By the time Andrea Circle Bear was pronounced dead Tuesday -- just weeks after giving birth by cesarean section while on a ventilator -- she was among hundreds of federal prisoners who have tested positive for COVID-19 and dozens who have died.\n\nThe number of coronavirus infections in the country's largest detention system has surged since prison officials announced last week that they're expanding testing to seek out asymptomatic inmates. Coronavirus cases have doubled to more than 1,300 as of Tuesday, not including 335 Bureau of Prisons staffers who have tested positive.\n\nThirty prisoners have died. Six, most of whom had long-term, pre-existing medical conditions, died in the past five days alone.\n\nNearly 70 percent of all infections are at three facilities in California, Texas and North Carolina. Terminal Island Federal Correctional Institution in Los Angeles County has the highest number of coronavirus cases -- 443 as of Tuesday.\n\nIsolated and scared: The plight of juveniles locked up during the coronavirus pandemic\n\nPrisons in crisis: Mass virus testing in state prisons reveals hidden asymptomatic infections; feds join effort\n\nCircle Bear was serving the first few months of a two-year sentence for a drug charge. The 30-year-old inmate died a little over a month after she was transferred to the Carswell Federal Medical Center, a women's prison in Fort Worth, Texas.\n\nOfficials said Circle Bear, 30, was taken to a local hospital on March 28 because of potential concerns with her pregnancy. She was discharged on the same day, although her condition deteriorated. Circle Bear was taken back to the hospital two days later because of symptoms such as fever and dry cough and was placed on a ventilator. She gave birth on April 1, tested positive for COVID-19 three days later, and died after three weeks.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention does not list pregnancy as among the underlying medical conditions that could make someone at risk of having a severe case of coronavirus, and little is known about how pregnant women could be affected by COVID-19. But pregnancy causes immunologic and physiologic changes that might make women vulnerable to viral respiratory infections.\n\nThe Bureau of Prisons has joined a small number of states that expanded coronavirus testing to asymptomatic inmates to try to slow the spread of the virus. State prisons in North Carolina and Ohio have also expanded testing, revealing hundreds of asymptomatic infections.\n\nMass testing: Federal prison system expands virus testing to find hidden asymptomatic infections\n\nThe Justice Department has been reviewing conditions at some of the most hard-hit federal prisons in Louisiana, Ohio and North Carolina, which has seen a larger share of deaths. The department's inspector general is conducting a separate inquiry.\n\nAttorney General William Barr has ordered the expedited release of vulnerable inmates and has directed the Bureau of Prisons to prioritize moving certain prisoners to home confinement.\n\nAn affidavit by Jennifer Broton, an associate warden at a federal prison in Miami, said the Bureau of Prisons is prioritizing prisoners who have served at least half of their time. Those who have have served a quarter of their sentence and have 18 months or less left will also be prioritized for release.\n\nAs of last week, about 1,500 prisoners have been moved to home confinement, officials said.\n\nMichael Cohen, President Donald Trump's former personal lawyer who's serving a three-year prison sentence, was among those granted early release.",

You've got to bundle up your clothes, you've got to start drowning yourself in fluid,\" Cuomo said on air two weeks ago.\n\nHe said he had begun to feel symptoms a few days before officially testing positive and knew \"as an essential worker\" that he needed to be tested, \"because I was in the mix.\"\n\nMore: Chris Cuomo lost 13 pounds in 3 days; fellow CNN host Brooke Baldwin positive for coronavirus\n\nCuomo also announced Monday his wife, Cristina Greeven Cuomo, had been cleared by the CDC, less than a week after he revealed in an on-air interview with brother New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo that she had tested positive.\n\n\"She doesn't have a fever, she doesn't have the symptoms anymore, she's 7 days from quarantine,\" Cuomo said in the video. \"We're still a little scared so I'll just give you one of these,\" he added, waving at his family members in lieu of hugging them.\n\n\"This is the dream, just to be back up here doing normal things,\" he added. \"Thank you for being so nice to me, thank you for taking care of everything you had to, thank you for taking care of me, and Bella, thank you for stepping up and now adding family videographer to your resume.\n\n\"She's rolling her eyes,\" he told viewers of his 17-year-old daughter Bella standing behind the camera.\n\nCuomo previously praised the way his kids - Bella, 14-year-old Mario and 11-year-old Carolina - helped out around the house while he and Cristina were sick.\n\n\"My wife and I have to be separated for another two weeks, which means our house is dependent on a 17-year-old, my daughter Bella, who's stepping up,\" Cuomo said last week. \"But you may hear them because this is now 'Lord of the Flies' in my house. The kids are in control.\"\n\nNow, the journalist is working on getting back to normal life: He's slowly re-introducing workouts, spending 20 minutes on the elliptical and going on a 25-minute walk around the neighborhood with Cristina. Both were successfully completed without breaking out into fever.",

    "Coronavirus: COVID-19 caused strokes in young patients: NYC doctors": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "New York City doctors say the coronavirus is triggering a surge in strokes in younger patients, causing alarm among medical experts.\n\nOver a two-week period, Mount Sinai doctors reported five patients who suffered large vessel strokes in patients under the age of 50, according to letter they published in the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM).\n\nAll five patients tested positive for COVID-19 but had very mild to no symptoms.\n\n\"That creates a big alarm,\" said Dr. J Mocco, director of the Cerebrovascular Center at Mount Sinai and one of the letter's authors. \"Our spider sense goes up to say that there's something not right here.\"\n\nOut of the five patients, one died, one is still hospitalized, one was discharged from the hospital and two are in rehabilitation. The youngest patient was 33 and only one patient had a history of stroke.\n\nDr. Shazam Hussain, director of the Cerebrovascular Center at the Cleveland Clinic, said he was surprised when he saw the reports coming from New York. The normal stroke population is typically older patients with high blood pressure or cholesterol problems.\n\nMocco said these stroke patients in New York were 15 years younger than the normal stroke population, had no risk factors and were statistically more likely to be male.\n\nReports of this phenomenon first came from Wuhan, China, according to the NEJM letter, where approximately 5% of patients who were hospitalized with the coronavirus suffered a stroke. The youngest reported patient was 55.\n\nAccording to the Mayo Clinic, a stroke occurs when blood supply to the brain is interrupted or reduced, preventing oxygenation and causing brain cells to die. Both Mocco and Hussain believe the coronavirus is causing blood clots that block or narrow the blood vessels.\n\nCould a heartburn drug be used to treat coronavirus? The theory is trending online, but there's no data to support it.\n\n'They're playing Russian roulette': As states reopen amid coronavirus, experts warn of risks\n\nHowever, it's not just stroke doctors that have seen this trend in clotting. Mocco said he's heard from colleagues in heart, lungs and kidney medicine who have also seen complications in coronavirus patients caused by blood clots.\n\n\"People were very focused on the fever and shortness of breath,\" Hussain said. \"There's a lot of parts of the body that is affected by the virus as well.\"\n\nA study from the Netherlands published in early April looked at 184 patients who were checked into the intensive care unit for COVID-19 pneumonia. Nearly a third of those patients had suffered from thrombotic complications, more commonly known as blood clotting.\n\nAlthough doctors can't confirm why the coronavirus seems to induce this, some experts have an educated guess. Mocco said research suggests the virus attaches itself to a host cell that not only exist in the respiratory tract, but also in blood vessels. This means the virus can go anywhere inside the body.\n\n\"A big part of the way this disease hurts people is in blood clots whether it's in the lungs or the kidney or the heart or the brain,\" he said.\n\nWhile coronavirus hotspots, such as New York, are seeing a surge in strokes, Hussain said most of the country is seeing a decline. He believes fear of contracting COVID-19 is what's keeping people away from the emergency rooms, even in the event of an emergency.\n\nMocco said New York has experienced that fear as well. Anecdotally, he has patients who have had symptoms of a stroke but delayed calling the hospital because they said they're afraid of catching COVID-19.\n\n\"We're combating a population that has become petrified to go to the hospital,\" Mocco said.\n\nThe Mayo Clinic says symptoms of a stroke can include:\n\nBoth Hussain and Mocco urge people to go to the hospital if they believe they're experiencing stroke symptoms.\n\n\"The hospital is the best place for you to come,\" Hussain said.",

While kids are more resilient, they can suffer same severity of symptoms. I'm applying a modified version of my remedies for his protocol with a focus on lots of vitamins,\" Cristina wrote.\n\n\"Since his sense of smell and taste have disappeared, I am feeding him healthy foods that I normally can't get him to touch. I kept a diary of the past week including my remedies and things that I did to stay sane through it all,\" she continued, sharing a link to her website.\n\nCristina Cuomo's post was timed to Earth Day. \"On this 50th anniversary of Earth Day, show kindness toward our planet and every creature who inhabits it, as the transcendent photographer, adventurer, preservationist and raconteur Peter Beard advised us,\" she wrote. \"My old friend's recent death offers an eerily timely punctuation on this virus and a reminder that we can't forget to protect one another, and the animals that roam the Earth.\"\n\nBoth Cristina and Chris Cuomo have been battling COVID-19. While the CNN anchor has finally emerged from quarantining in his basement, Cristina is still experiencing symptoms.\n\n\"I feel pretty good today,\" she told Entertainment Tonight on Friday.\n\nCristina said her symptoms started around Day 18 of her husband's coronavirus diagnosis.\n\n\"I was highly congested, had a terrible sinus headache, and I just thought, 'You know what, I'm so run down. I'm not getting enough sleep, I'm feeling a lot of stress from caregiving and managing the kids and my own business that it just caught up with me,' \" she said.\n\nChris Cuomo revealed more details about he and his wife's COVID-19 diagnosis in a conversation Thursday night with Anderson Cooper and Dr. Sanjay Gupta on his show, \"Cuomo Prime Time.\"\n\n\"This was tough for Cristina to get it,\" Cuomo said. \"We have a lot of fear because we don't have a lot of facts.\"\n\nHe said that they have \"completely different symptoms.\"\n\n\"She's stronger than I am. She's got a stronger immune system, a stronger constitution and a stronger character,\" Cuomo said.",

    "Coronavirus: Counting dead complicated by lack of tests, uniformity": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "BREVARD COUNTY, Fla. -- Michael Pellettiere had been fighting a persistent cough for a week.\n\nThe 54-year-old Melbourne man usually doesn't go to the doctor.\n\nBut his cough apparently concerned him enough that he reached out to his family to let them know he was sick, and headed to urgent care on April 6. The wait was so long he left.\n\nHe had multiple health conditions that put him at high risk from the new coronavirus: he was overweight, had gout and was immunocompromised. But his father and brother will never know if COVID-19 contributed to his demise. His listed cause of death: heart attack. An autopsy was never performed and his body cremated last week.\n\nAcross Florida, medical examiners are responsible for investigating and confirming any possible COVID-19 deaths. Counting the coronavirus dead as accurately as possible is critical to assessing just how great a threat the virus poses.\n\nBut what constitutes a coronavirus death? The answer, it seems, changes depending on who's doing the counting.\n\nAt the start of the pandemic, state and federal authorities issued guidance aimed at ensuring an accurate death count.\n\nFor medical examiners in Florida this included instructions on how to handle a death if it was referred from a hospital, the public or a funeral home. In every case, a positive COVID-19 test was required, according to guidance from the state Medical Examiners Commission.\n\nThat can mean waiting on a test result taken at a hospital before a patient died.\n\nIt also can mean testing the dead.\n\n\"The only way currently to confirm a positive case is with testing,\" Brevard Medical Examiner's Office investigator Craig Engelson wrote in an email.\n\nWhile securing testing has been a challenge for the living, medical examiners offices across Florida have not reported difficulty securing tests when needed, according to the chair of the Medical Examiners Commission, Dr. Stephen J. Nelson. He was aware of at least a handful of cases confirmed post-mortem.\n\nAll that's needed is a request to the Department of Health, said Nelson, who is also the chief medical examiner for Polk, Hardee and Highlands counties.\n\nIn Brevard at least three post-mortem tests have been conducted and all have come back negative.\n\nEngelson said his office has provided funeral homes with questions to ask prior to picking up a cadaver from a hospital. If any dead had tested positive or awaiting results, the funeral home notifies the Medical Examiner's office and will not handle the body until cleared to do so.\n\n\"If we find out that just prior to death they were showing signs of COVID-19, that's when we perform post-mortem test,\" Engelson said.\n\nBut what of those who are found dead on the street, such as a homeless person, or found dead in their homes, such as Pellettiere?\n\n\"Under any of the scenarios you mentioned we would use due diligence to ascertain the person's (past medical history),\" Engelson wrote. \"We would focus heavily on their health status prior to death.\n\n\"If we find they were showing symptoms, we would seek direction from (Department of Health). If they say yes, we would perform a post-mortem. If not, we would proceed with our normal procedures.\"\n\nThe Department of Health did not respond to inquiries on how many post-mortem tests have been conducted across the state, or what criteria it uses to approve a test.\n\nEngelson added that post-mortem testing is decided on a case-by-case basis. \"We report as much information as possible to include if there are clues left at the scene as to cause of death,\" he wrote, adding that criteria is \"strictly\" determined by the Department of Health.\n\nThe Melbourne police officer responding to Pellettiere's residence contacted the Brevard Medical Examiner's Office, which decided not to investigate.\n\n\"The totality of the case is always taken into consideration. Yes, he had a cough but no reported fever. As you noted he had several comorbidities. There was no indication of travel or a known exposure,\" Engelson wrote. \"We felt that the case did not fall within our jurisdiction.\"\n\nPellettiere's brother Joseph, 49, questioned the decision and said he fears the COVID-19 death toll could be undercounted.\n\nAccording to Joseph Pellettiere, the medical examiner's office told him that Michael would have only been tested if he met three symptom criteria, most important among them a fever.\n\n\"Well, no one really took his temperature to know if he developed a fever because he didn't get treated at the clinic,\" he said.\n\nWhile Joseph Pellettiere said he understands following protocols, the absence of a post-mortem test left the family with more questions about what caused his brother's death - and a lack of closure.\n\n\"You can see that it was relayed to (the ME's office) that he was a vulnerable population (and) seeking care, he should have been tested,\" Joseph Pellettiere said.\n\nJoseph regrets not speaking up sooner, as by the time he questioned the Medical Examiner's office it was too late to perform a viable test, which he was told had to be performed within 48 hours of death.\n\nFact check: Is US coronavirus death toll inflated? Experts agree it's likely the opposite\n\nThe scale of how many COVID deaths were not accurately accounted for may take months or years to determine, but analysis of data from several European nations by The Economist indicates that the number of COVID-19 deaths may be 30% higher than reported in those localities.\n\nThat's concerning because an accurate death toll is an important piece of data to be considered as elected officials such as Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis plan for reopening the state. How confident can they be in that tally, which currently stood just below 900 as of Wednesday morning.\n\nThere's no easy answer. Medical examiners say they can't test everyone on the slightest suspicion, nor have they been directed to.\n\nEngelson in emails to FLORIDA TODAY, said that so far there has been \"no direction that every death is to be considered a COVID case. We still have all types of deaths occurring.\"\n\nThen there's the question of how long the virus survives after death. There's no guidance from the CDC and it's still a \"developing science,\" wrote Nelson of the Medical Examiners Commission.\n\n\"I would suggest treating the dead as though they are potentially infectious,\" he added.\n\nAs for when to conduct a post-mortem test, Nelson said he would follow the CDC guidelines \"recognizing the test kits are not plentiful for 'surveillance' testing of everyone.\"\n\nThe latest Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines from March 25 do not indicate a window of time after which COVID-19 testing is no longer viable after death.\n\nThen there's the question of whom should be counted among a state's COVID-19 death toll. If a New York resident dies of COVID-19 in Florida, is that a Florida death or a New York death?\n\nDisagreements between the Medical Examiners Commission and the Florida Department of Health meant that snowbirds and other non-residents who die in the state are recorded by medical examiners but not reflected in the DOH state death totals.\n\nTwo weeks ago that discrepancy was as high as 40 deaths, but by Wednesday morning it had dropped to less than a handful when medical examiners had recorded 891 deaths statewide, compared to 893 reported by DOH.\n\nWhile this suggests that DOH may have decided to count previously excluded deaths, the agency did not provide an explanation for the change.\n\nThe tension escalated earlier this month when the Florida Department of Health tried to block medical examiners from releasing any data their offices routinely collect on COVID-19 deaths.\n\nNelson told FLORIDA TODAY that the DOH's general counsel in a phone call with the commission's counsel tried to argue that \"anything dealing with death registration\" is confidential and is not a matter of public record.\n\n\"For them to tell us that what we do is now confidential: it's just the most bizarre legal theory,\" Nelson said.\n\nThe DOH countered that it had reached out to medical examiners \"to explain concerns on disclosing personal identifiable information.\"\n\nAfter initially releasing the information upon request, as of this week, Nelson said he is blocked from releasing their table of deaths because of two columns of information which the Department of Health contends are not public record. These are the columns that report the cause of death and a brief description of the incident.\n\nAdding to the complications of getting clarity around the COVID-19 death toll is that states don't count uniformly. While in Alabama some deaths with a positive test result aren't counted, in Colorado cases that fit a diagnostic profile but are absent a positive test are added to the total.\n\nThe Colorado method is consistent with CDC guidelines revised in the past week that do not demand a positive test for the fatality to be counted. In New York, that change permitted an additional 3,700 deaths to be counted last week.\n\nFor now Florida has not adopted the CDC's updated guidelines. The criteria remains that a positive test must accompany the dead.\n\nAnd as Pellettiere's case shows, it's still unclear how wide a net will be cast by post-mortem testing.",

    "Coronavirus: Couple of 73 years dies within hours of each other": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "Wilford and Mary Kepler died within hours of each other April 18. They had been married for 73 years.\n\nWilford and Mary Kepler first started talking while they were thousands of miles away from each other, separated by oceans and land during World War II.\n\nThey spent their final moments with each other just feet apart, separated by a hospital bed frame.\n\nMary, who began writing to Wilford while he was serving in the Pacific in World War II, died April 18 at Froedtert Hospital -- just six hours after Wilford.\n\nFroedtert staff moved their beds closer together during their final days at the hospital so they could hold hands. They were able to communicate with their family via phone and video calls.\n\nAlthough both tested positive for the coronavirus, the Milwaukee County Medical Examiner's Office confirmed only Mary died from the virus.\n\nWilford's cause of death was listed as a traumatic head injury after he suffered a fall on Easter Sunday. Wilford and Mary were both admitted to the hospital after being transported by ambulance after Wilford's fall April 12.\n\nWilford tested positive after being admitted to the hospital. Mary had tested positive for the coronavirus April 8 and was in quarantine at her home at the time.\n\nTheir granddaughter, Natalie Lameka, was one of the last people to see them alive. She met with them for an hour April 17.\n\n\"They were aware of what was going on, and they were at peace with it,\" she said.\n\nLameka said the couple went through so much during their lives. The Great Depression. World War II. The Vietnam War. Several recessions.\n\nIt was because of this that they were who she would call whenever anything went wrong in her life. They always seemed to be able to put things in perspective for her.\n\nThe Keplers will be buried together at a later date in a cemetery near Boaz, Wisconsin, where Wilford grew up. Mary grew up 20 minutes away in Blue River.\n\nTheir son, Michael Kepler, said they were a kind and caring couple.\n\n\"They took care of their children,\" Kepler said. \"They lived a good life, and they got their kids educated. They did the things that most people would want to do for their children and for their families.\"\n\nWilford was 94. Mary was 92.\n\nMary said before her death she was being cared for by \"angels,\" her obituary read.\n\nLameka said the hospital picked one nurse to watch over the couple in the week they were there. That nurse called the family several times a day to update them on the couple's condition.\n\nMore: What we know about coronavirus keeps changing. Here's all the things you may have missed.\n\nMore: These are the 6 new possible symptoms of the coronavirus the CDC added to its list\n\nBecause of strict restrictions, the hospital allowed only one visitor per patient. Lameka was joined by her brother, Spencer, to visit their grandparents April 17. Hospital staff gave them personal protective equipment to wear during that final visit.\n\nKepler said he was appreciative that staff was able to let him video chat with his parents. He was able to express his love to his mom and dad one last time.\n\n\"My family really appreciated that,\" he said.\n\nLameka, a nurse, has seen firsthand how the coronavirus pandemic has affected the hospital system.\n\nBut it hit home for her with the deaths of her grandparents.\n\n\"This is affecting families in a big way. We lost our family,\" Lameka said.\n\nShe said her grandparents were extremely careful as well. She isn't aware of where they were exposed to the coronavirus. However, they did have to go out to get groceries and run other errands.\n\n\"They still had to live their lives, as much as we wanted to help them,\" Lameka said.\n\nWilford and Mary graduated from Richland Center High School, although Wilford was drafted and reported for duty in World War II before his class graduated in 1943.\n\nWilford served on the USS Wilkes-Barre, which was involved in the Battle of Okinawa. It was around this time a good friend of Mary's told her to write to her friend's brother.\n\nWhen Wilford returned from the war, he started to work as a cheesemaker in Richland County. He also started to date Mary.\n\nThey married in 1946. They moved from Beloit to Milwaukee to New Berlin, and finally to Wauwatosa.\n\nWilford was a machinist at Harnishfeger Corp., where he worked for 35 years. Mary worked as the vice president of U.S. Steel Supply, the first woman in such a position. Mary took night classes at Alverno College, and graduated with a college degree in 1981 when she was 54.\n\nIn their later years, they both enjoyed gardening, playing cards and visiting with their grandchildren. They loved to host Thanksgiving and Christmas celebrations for the family. Michael Kepler expressed how great of a hostess his mom was.\n\n\"She didn't want other people in the kitchen or doing the dishes. That was her domain,\" Kepler said.\n\nIn a eulogy, Kepler spoke about how both of them were hard workers. Wilford volunteered at the Milwaukee VA Hospital for more than 20 years. Mary served on the Milwaukee County Commission on Aging.\n\n\"Mom always joked that he hardly ever missed work, and if he had missed work, his fellow workers would have taken up a collection for his funeral,\" Kepler wrote in the eulogy.\n\n\"He wasn't really loud but he liked to be with people, and he liked to joke,\" Kepler also said.\n\nLameka remembered her grandpa as being quiet. \"But when he did say something, it was very meaningful and thoughtful,\" she said.\n\nLameka shared that her grandma loved to have fun. She often danced well into the night at family weddings, including at her wedding -- a memory she'll never forget.\n\n\"Whenever she would do something nice for someone she would say, 'you may not be in a position to do something like this for someone now, but someday you will be, and I hope you pay it forward,' \" Lameka said. \"That's how they lived their lives.\"\n\nWilford and Mary are survived by their children, Michael (Mary Beth Keppel), Sandra and Michelle (Dan) Pike; grandchildren Christopher and Andrew Kepler, Natalie and Spencer Lameka, Maria and Sasha Arevalo, Jessica and James Pike; and six great-grandchildren.\n\nThere will be no services at this time.",

    "Coronavirus: Deaths, case rate up in counties with no nearby hospital": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "Dr. Karen Kinsell is shown at her medical practice in Fort Gaines, Ga., on Thursday May 14, 2020.\n\nAt Dr. Karen Kinsell's southwest Georgia practice, patients showing coronavirus symptoms have infiltrated an appointment schedule usually crowded with bladder infections and sinus trouble.\n\nAn outbreak following a March funeral service in Albany, Georgia, two counties away, brought COVID-19 to Kinsell's community of about 3,000, situated a stone's throw from Alabama.\n\nFar from the West Coast and Northeast metropolises at the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak, Clay County has seen the number of local COVID-19 infections climb. The community has 27 cases, three virus-induced deaths, one ambulance and -- like 20% of counties nationwide with at least one coronavirus case -- no local hospital.\n\nRural communities like this, experts say, may be on the brink of disaster.\n\nA USA TODAY analysis found that new cases have been confirmed at faster rates in rural and nonmetropolitan counties since mid-March, which is when growth began to slow in hard-hit cities but sped up everywhere else.\n\nA similar trend can be seen in death counts: The tally of deaths rose fastest outside America's major cities. And now, as the daily tally of new coronavirus cases starts to shrink in cities, it continues to grow in rural areas. For the week ending May 9, metropolitan counties announced 10% fewer new cases than the previous week. By comparison, rural counties announced 8% more cases than the previous week.\n\nFor residents in those communities, including those in the highest risk categories for COVID-19 -- poor, elderly and suffering from underlying health conditions -- a spate of recent hospital closures means the nearest emergency room is sometimes hours away and plagued by staff shortages and financial deficits.\n\nAt least 130 rural hospitals have closed nationally in the past decade, according to the University of North Carolina Sheps Center for Health Services Research.\n\nThe majority were in states where lawmakers didn't expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, leaving already struggling hospitals the burden of millions in uncompensated costs from uninsured patients. In Texas alone, more than 20 rural hospitals closed. Tennessee lost 13. Nine closed in Oklahoma and seven in Georgia.\n\nClay County's only hospital closed in the 1980s. It lost its last pharmacy in 2018. Kinsell is the lone physician.\n\n\"There's no way a hospital would be viable here,\" Kinsell said, because the county has too few residents. \"There are hospitals in two adjoining counties that have high infection rates,\" she said. \"I don't know how they stay open.\"\n\nNearly 600 U.S. counties without a hospital have at least one reported coronavirus case, according to a USA TODAY analysis. Together, these counties have seen more than 15,000 COVID-related deaths -- or 23 per 100,000 residents. That's higher than the death rate among counties with a hospital, which claims 17 per 100,000.\n\nThe gap is wider if urban hotspots like New York and New Jersey are excluded.\n\n\"The death total and infection rate in New York, New Orleans, Los Angeles and the big cities is a story and is significant,\" said National Rural Health Association CEO Alan Morgan. \"But the percentage of these rural towns that might be at risk -- I don't see a path forward that doesn't play out horribly in rural communities.\"\n\nMany of Clay County's residents reflect rural America. They are elderly, uninsured, chronically ill or all of the above. Poverty, obesity and underlying diseases are prevalent.\n\nKinsell's $10 fee for the uninsured -- about one-third of her patients -- is still too steep for some. She sees them anyway. \"We don't turn anyone away,\" she said.\n\nShe refers those with coronavirus indicators to hospitals an hour drive away. Several have declined emergency care, fearing a bill they can't afford.\n\n\"We've had quite a few people who just toughed it out at home,\" Kinsell said, referring to those who earn too much to qualify for Medicaid but too little to cover the cost of private health insurance. \"If you have some money, have some assets, those are the people that have to make a decision about whether to go to the hospital because they could lose their house over it.\"\n\nState lawmakers in Georgia and 13 other states have declined to expand Medicaid eligibility to patients like Kinsell's under the federal Affordable Care Act. The decision stymies those patients' access to medical care and leaves rural hospitals to foot the bill for millions in uncompensated costs when the uninsured seek treatment in their clinics and emergency rooms.\n\nBut lawmakers in states that eschewed Medicaid expansion argued they didn't trust the federal government to reimburse them for the program's costs. Plus, they contended, Medicaid already was plagued with problems, including low payment rates to doctors and hospitals.\n\nAs the largely partisan arguments over Medicaid played out over the last decade, hospitals continued to close at an alarming pace, particularly in the rural South.\n\nSince 2010, Georgia has lost six hospitals and more than 210 hospital beds.\n\nIn 2019 alone, 18 hospitals closed nationwide, more than any previous year. Already 12 have closed in 2020, and experts expect COVID-19 to drive another record-setting year of closures.\n\nRural hospitals in danger: Coronavirus strains cash-strapped hospitals, could cause up to 100 to close within a year\n\nThe pandemic exposes the already thread-bare reality of medical infrastructure in areas like Clay County, where hospital closures compound long-standing socioeconomic disadvantages that put the community's health at risk.\n\nIn Clay County now, a lone ambulance is responsible for a territory spanning more than 200 square miles. It waits in Fort Gaines, near the state line and equidistant from the county's farthest corners, to ferry patients east to Albany, Georgia, or southwest to Dothan, Alabama.\n\nA round trip to either medical center could occupy the emergency transport for four hours, Kinsell said, \"so you don't just casually call an ambulance.\"\n\nAs the pandemic encroached on her community, the ambulance's sirens blared more than usual, a reminder that many poor, uninsured nonmetropolitan residents rely on emergency rooms for primary care.\n\n\"They wait until they're very sick and then present themselves,\" Morgan said. \"Outcomes are worse, treatments are more difficult -- and it's going to be the same case for COVID-19.\"\n\nThe difficulties facing rural populations extend beyond a lack of nearby options, though, University of Minnesota School of Public Health researcher Carrie Henning-Smith noted in a May 5 press conference.\n\nTheir counties -- even those that have hospitals -- are less likely to have ICU beds or ventilators available. Hospitals in metropolitan areas have 25 ICU beds on average compared to just six in nonmetropolitan and rural facilities, according to a USA Today analysis. While urban hospitals routinely used seven ventilators each week before the pandemic, others used less than two.\n\nRural areas might face other challenges. They may not have broadband internet and cellular connectivity. Some rural communities do not have running water and therefore the ability to regularly wash hands.\n\n\"This makes it difficult to access health care, including through telehealth,\" Henning-Smith said. \"It also makes it really difficult to remain socially connected or to have the opportunity to work remotely while maintaining physical distance.\"\n\nAs of May 4, she said, 86% of all rural counties had at least one COVID-19 case, and one-third of rural counties had at least one COVID-19 death.\n\nRural households include more people than urban households. And since those who lack Medicaid or other insurance often shy away from seeking care, sicknesses spread quickly through family clusters.\n\n\"Rural America is the place where those who are most in need have the fewest options available,\" Morgan said.\n\nAfter the closures, there are roughly 2,000 rural hospitals left nationwide. Nearly half were operating at a financial loss before the pandemic required that they shut down most outpatient services, Morgan noted -- resulting in a 70% to 80% slash in revenue. Struggling to make payroll, they looked to furlough or lay off staff.\n\nAlready short on staff and equipment, the remaining medical centers now have even smaller margins for error. What happens when a rural hospital's sole ventilator is occupied, or a town's only doctor falls ill?\n\n\"It's a really quick shift from 'we've got enough' to 'we have none,'\" said Mark Holmes, director of the Cecil G. Sheps Center for Health Services Research at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. \"Rural areas are used to living on tighter tolerances. What this (pandemic) exposes more than anything is how tenuous that is.\"",

    "Coronavirus: Delaware chicken plant workers among most vulnerable": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "WILMINGTON, Del. - A perfect storm has settled over rural Sussex County, where issues that have defined the area for decades have helped lead to an alarming increase of coronavirus cases in recent weeks.\n\nSmall Delaware towns - like Seaford and Georgetown - are now reporting some of the highest numbers of cases statewide, poising Sussex to push past more urban and populated New Castle County for the most confirmed cases.\n\nWith the large presence of Hispanic and Haitian immigrant communities, health care workers, advocates and elected officials say those residents face many challenges, including language barriers, when trying to access emergency resources and learn what safety precautions they need to take.\n\nMany of those residents work in the county's largest industry - chicken processing plants - where to complete their jobs, workers must stand close together, not adhering to social distancing guidelines.\n\nLow-income workers in the heart of Sussex County can't afford to lose a paycheck during this pandemic, causing hesitation about whether to get tested - even if they have potentially been exposed to the infection. Others are concerned that seeking treatment could jeopardize their immigration status.\n\nAnd, on top of all of this, Delaware's limited testing capability in the early weeks made it difficult to identify COVID-19 patients and further stop the spread.\n\n\"Because of this crisis, everything that hasn't been addressed before is exacerbating,\" said Erika Gutierrez, the Latino outreach coordinator for the Delaware Campaign for Achievement Now, a nonprofit that advocates for student achievement.\n\nDelaware Online/The News Journal found that the growth rate of COVID-19 cases in Sussex County is more than double New Castle County's, once adjusted for population size. The number of cases in Sussex County is also doubling faster than it is in New Castle County.\n\nAs of April 23, health officials have confirmed 1,377 cases in Delaware's most rural county, making up more than 40% of the state total.\n\nDr. Karyl Rattay, director of the Division of Public Health, said the state doesn't have \"one great explanation\" for why there's been a rise in Sussex County cases. But she said those who are unable to social distance, live in crowded homes and are essential employees have a high risk for the chance of infection.\n\nIt's why the state has drastically increased testing in the area, both at poultry plants and at community sites, and will now provide no-cost housing to some who are sick and unable to self-quarantine.\n\nThe reality is that the poultry plants are just a symptom of a much larger problem in Sussex County, where million dollar homes line the beaches, but socioeconomic and racial issues saturate the county west of the waterfront.\n\n\"We are very focused on Sussex County right now,\" she said. \"For us, this is an all hands on deck approach.\"\n\nWhen the results finally came in early April, nurse practitioner Emanie Dorival was not surprised.\n\nHer patient - a Haitian immigrant, who works in a chicken processing plant and lives in the Seaford area - had tested positive for the coronavirus, adding to the almost two dozen patients of Dorival's who have been confirmed with the virus. She said all of her COVID-19 positive patients work at a chicken processing plant.\n\nThe man lives with his pregnant wife, his brother and sister-in-law, who is also expecting. They all have since tested positive for the coronavirus, according to the nurse practitioner.\n\n\"I am really worried,\" said Dorival, whose practice primarily serves the Haitian community in Seaford. \"I am really worried for the Haitian and Hispanic community, and I don't feel like there are protections in place.\n\n\"I am feeling helpless.\"\n\nThe Haitian community makes up about 8% of Seaford's population. Census data shows more than one-third of Georgetown residents are Hispanic, pointing to southern Delaware's need for resources and health information to be provided in languages like Haitian Creole and Spanish.\n\nAccording to the Delaware Community Foundation, 80% of Latinos in Sussex County live in poverty.\n\nDorival said she has done outreach with local churches and hosts information sessions through conference calls every Saturday. But she worries it won't be enough.\n\nHer patients are afraid to get tested, she said. They fear they could be separated from their families due to their immigration status or not be able to return to work. Many of her patients, she said, are the breadwinners for their family.\n\n\"All they are thinking,\" Dorival said, \"is 'Am I going to lose this paycheck?'\"\n\nIn Georgetown, Dr. Rama Peri hears the same concerns.\n\nThe family medicine physician, who primarily cares for the Hispanic community, has been holding drive-thru clinics at local churches in the past month.\n\nOftentimes, her biggest battle is making sure her patients are properly informed about how dangerous the coronavirus is. Some, she said, have incorrectly likened it to the flu. Like Dorival, the physician said many of her patients are afraid to seek help.\n\n\"We're trying to do outreach of 'You don't need to be afraid. And no one is out there to try and get you.'\"\n\nPeri believes testing has played a large role in why the state is now seeing an increase in cases. And though testing capacity has improved, Peri said she is still limited in testing those who are demonstrating symptoms of the virus.\n\nState Sen. Brian Pettyjohn (R-Georgetown) wonders if more \"blanket communication\" should have been done earlier in the outbreak, particularly with the Hispanic community.\n\n\"Everyone could Monday morning quarterback this till the cows come home,\" he said. \"I'm sure once this was done there will be a look at what actions the state took ... and try to learn from some of the difficulties of what happened.\"\n\nRattay, the director of the Division of Public Health, said the state is working with a hotel in Sussex County to provide no-cost temporary housing for those who have tested positive and are unable to quarantine because they live in a crowded home. Right now, about 100 people can be accommodated, health officials said.\n\nRattay said the state does have concerns for black and brown communities in Delaware, which already experience disparities in health outcomes. The state has yet to release race and ethnicity data for those who are COVID-19 positive.\n\nAcross the country, people of color - particularly black Americans - are being infected and dying from coronavirus-related complications at a disproportionate rate.\n\nThis includes immigrant employees who work for wages to keep America - and their families - fed, said Gutierrez, the outreach coordinator.\n\n\"This is the moment of truth,\" she said. \"This is the moment to change the way our state functions.\"\n\nMuch of the chicken that adorns American dinner tables comes from poultry processing plants like those in southern Delaware, where employees stand side-by-side to debone, gut, and strip each bird of feathers, then cut and package the meat.\n\nThe work is demanding, low-paying and essential, meaning employees have to come into the plant to do their work.\n\nThough plants have taken some preventative steps, some employees say they still fear they are at high risk for infection. These workers have told Delaware Online/The News Journal that the lack of both social distancing and information about which of their colleagues has been infected makes the job more dangerous than it already is.\n\nThese employees also said fewer people are showing up to work either because they are sick or fear they will be infected. The recent preventative measures, including temperature checks, that have been put in place since the pandemic, however, have eased some concerns.\n\nAcross the country, more than 150 of the largest meat processing plants are in counties where the rate of coronavirus infection is already among the nation's highest, based on an analysis by USA TODAY and the Midwest Center for Investigative Reporting of slaughterhouse locations and county-level COVID-19 infection rates.\n\nRates of infection around these beef, pork and poultry plants are higher than those of 75% of other U.S. counties, the analysis found.\n\nUSA TODAY INVESTIGATION: Coronavirus at meatpacking plants worse than first thought\n\nThis week, the state began rapid coronavirus testing at Delaware chicken processing plants, said Dr. Rattay, the director of the Division of Public Health.\n\nThough not mandatory, the tests are free for workers at the plants, which employ more than 6,000 people and offer contract work to hundreds of local farmers.\n\nSince Delaware had confirmed its first case at a plant one month ago, the poultry industry has worked on creating social distancing, screening employees and having workers wear masks, Rattay said.\n\nPerdue Farms plant employees practice social distancing on the production lines \"where possible,\" according to the company's website.\n\nA Perdue Farms spokesperson said there have been a \"limited number of cases\" throughout the company's facilities.\n\nWhen asked for specific numbers of cases, the spokesperson declined to provide numbers, citing \"privacy under applicable confidentiality guidelines.\"\n\nMountaire Farms said it has its facilities disinfected every night and has \"redoubled\" efforts to clean and disinfect common areas and cafeterias.\n\nGutierrez has heard from families about how scared they are to go to work.\n\n\"While businesses are telling the governor they are complying and doing everything possible,\" she said, \"our families are not agreeing with that.\"\n\nEnvironmental reporter Maddy Lauria contributed reporting to this article.",

    "Coronavirus: Doctors learn more about new COVID-19 symptom, COVID toes": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "Doctors are learning more about COVID-19's newest and oddest skin manifestation, dubbed COVID toes, as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention adds to the growing list of symptoms associated with the coronavirus.\n\nThe American Academy of Dermatology has compiled a registry of skin manifestations associated with COVID-19. About half of the more than 300 total cases on the dermatological registry consist of COVID toes.\n\nThe registry is made up of entries by physicians and other health care professionals who fill out a 5-7 minutes survey about patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 who develop skin manifestations, as well as patients with existing dermatological conditions who develop COVID-19 and patients on dermatological medications who developed COVID-19. Entries can not be made by patients themselves.\n\nDr. Esther Freeman, director of Massachusetts General Hospital Global Health Dermatology and member of the AAD task force on COVID-19, said COVID toes are pinkish-reddish \"pernio-like lesions\" that can turn purple over time.\n\nShe said this shouldn't be confused with a different medical condition that occurs in critically sick patients called purpura fulminans.\n\nWhen she first started the registry with the academy, she was expecting to see viral rashes often driven by inflammation.\n\n\"What was more surprising to me was this overwhelming representation of these 'COVID toes,'\" she said.\n\nWhere can I get a COVID-19 antibody test? And is it reliable? Here's everything you need to know.\n\nPernio, also called chilblains, are skin sores or bumps that occur on a patient's feet when they're exposed to cold temperatures. The reason why Freeman calls the new symptom \"pernio-like\" is because she believes COVID toe lesions aren't a result of cold temperatures.\n\nWhile experts can't confirm why COVID toes appear, they have some educated guesses. One could be inflammation in the toes' tissue, which is similar to pernio. Another hypothesis is inflammation of the blood vessel wall, medically known as vasculitis. And finally, Freeman said it is possible COVID toes could be caused by small blood clots that form inside the blood vessel.\n\nDoctors at the American Academy of Dermatology have discovered trends studying the registry that weren't previously known about COVID toes. Freeman says COVID toes have appeared in very few cases of asymptomatic patients. The majority of COVID toe cases have manifested simultaneously or even after more commonly known COVID-19 symptoms.\n\nFreeman said most patients test positive for the COVID test when they develop COVID toes, which allows experts to assume that the symptom may appear later in the infection.\n\n\"The timing is complex and difficult to pin down,\" she said.\n\nWhat we know about coronavirus keeps changing: Here's all the things you may have missed.\n\nHydroxychloroquine: States build stockpiles of the malaria drug touted by Trump to treat coronavirus\n\nThe majority of COVID toe patients in the registry are younger people in their 20s and 30s, Freeman said, and doctors haven't seen a lot cases reported from older people. She also said most patients with COVID toes are healthy and \"have done well in their clinical course.\"\n\n\"I think it's important not to induce panic if you were to develop these lesions on your toes,\" she said. \"Most of our patients seem to be doing well.\"\n\nFreeman recommends patients speak to their health care provider if they develop these lesions to assess if they are caused by a different medical condition, or any other reason.\n\n\"But if there isn't, then they should talk about COVID testing or isolate or consider other ways to reduce the spread,\" she said.",

        "authors": [],
        "body": "LONDON -- Doctors in Britain, Italy, and Spain have been warned to look out for a rare inflammatory condition in children that is possibly linked to the new coronavirus.\n\nEarlier this week, Britain's Paediatric Intensive Care Society issued an alert to doctors noting that in the past three weeks, there has been an increase in the number of children with \"a multi-system inflammatory state requiring intensive care\" across the country. The group said there was \"growing concern\" that either a COVID-19 related syndrome was emerging in children or that a different, unidentified disease might be responsible.\n\n\"We already know that a very small number of children can become severely ill with COVID-19 but this is very rare,\" said Russell Viner, president of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health. \"New diseases may present in ways that surprise us and clinicians need to be made aware of any emerging evidence of particular symptoms.\"\n\nThe cases were also reported to have features of toxic shock syndrome or Kawasaki disease, a rare blood vessel disorder. Only some of the children tested positive for COVID-19, so scientists are unsure if these rare symptoms are caused by the new coronavirus or by something else. Health officials estimate there have been about 10-20 such cases in Britain and NHS England said it is urgently investigating the reports.\n\nWho's getting it right, or wrong? These countries are doing the best and worst jobs fighting coronavirus\n\nSpain's Association of Pediatrics recently made a similar warning, telling doctors that in recent weeks, there had been a number of school-age children suffering from \"an unusual picture of abdominal pain, accompanied by gastrointestinal symptoms\" that could lead within hours to shock, low blood pressure and heart problems.\n\n\"It is a priority to recognize these (symptoms) to urgently refer these patients to a hospital,\" the pediatric association said.\n\nIn Italy, Dr. Angelo Ravelli of Gaslini Hospital and a member of the Italian Paediatricians Society, sent a note to 10,000 colleagues with related concerns. He and his team reported an unusual increase in the number of patients with Kawasaki disease, noting some children had COVID-19 or had contacts with confirmed virus cases.\n\nKawasaki symptoms include a high temperature that lasts for 5 days or more, a rash and swollen glands in the neck, according to Britain's National Health Service.\n\nDr. James Gill, an honorary clinical lecturer at Warwick Medical School, said while the reports were concerning, there was still no solid evidence that the rare syndrome was caused by COVID-19.\n\nOpinion: Keep up with children's health during pandemic. Especially now, pediatricians can help.\n\n\"Regardless of source, multi-system inflammatory diseases are exceptionally serious for children and already stretched intensive care teams, so keeping an extra eye out for new symptoms arising in the patients we see is always a good thing,\" he said.\n\nSome possible cases have also been reported in France and Belgium.\n\nTo date, children have been among the least affected group by the coronavirus. Data from more than 75,000 cases in China showed they comprised 2.4% of all cases and mostly suffered only mild symptoms.\n\nThe World Health Organization said it was attempting to gather more information on any new, coronavirus-related syndrome in children from its global network of doctors but had not received any official reports about it.",

    "Coronavirus: Domestic violence case uptick may be lower than reported": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "Media outlets around the globe tell of a huge uptick in reports of intimate partner violence during the COVID-19 pandemic. France has seen a 30% increase in reports. In the United States, San Francisco, New York and Washington, D.C. are witnessing upticks as well. Pop Icon Rihanna and Twitter founder and CEO Jack Dorsey have donated millions in aid to provide resources for women in Los Angeles seeking shelter. Domestic violence has been called \"the other epidemic.\"\n\nWe wonder if, during this pandemic, the hammer of domestic violence prevention doesn't see every interpersonal conflict as a nail.\n\nThat is, in order to prioritize and respond to intimate partner abuse properly, we must understand that not every domestic combustion right now indicates an abusive relationship.\n\nWithout looking at the facts of each individual case of alleged abuse, it's impossible for even trained psychologists to know if any of these spikes in domestic violence reporting contain any over-reporting, the behavioral equivalent of a false positive.\n\nBut we do know that it's possible for the request for intervention to outmatch the risk of harm. In a study on validity of the Conflict Tactics Scale, a tool used to measure intimate partner violence, researchers found that over-reporting exists in domestic disputes.\n\nThis isn't to say that over-reporting consists of lies; it doesn't necessarily. But we can't escape that victimization is a combination of facts, perception and proportion. Psychologists call this appraisal distortion. Indeed, that's the problem with truly abusive situations; many times, the victim doesn't even know they're living in harmful conditions. People who grow up with abuse may think it's normal.\n\nIf people fail to recognize abuse where it exists, then it's possible that they also label it as such when it doesn't rise to that level.\n\nDuring the pandemic, even in the best of relationships, people are stressed. According to one study, the stressors of quarantines longer than 10 days worsen symptoms of post-traumatic stress significantly. We are over one month into shelter-at-home, so the impact of quarantine is getting more severe by the day.\n\nPeople's perceptions and reactions to these new sides of their partners -- ones that would have been hidden had the \"new normal\" matched the \"old normal\" -- may be heightened because we are all living through a mass trauma. Trauma causes people to sense what's happening around them as a greater threat than it might be and fosters the use of maladaptive strategies.\n\nA national crisis: How the coronavirus pandemic collided with America's critical shortage of housing\n\nFor example, an argument between a woman who threw away a cheesecake because she thought it was infected and her husband exploded into a drawn gun and 911 calls. Another woman called police and asked them to arrest her daughter for walking outside. These cases likely wouldn't have happened outside the quarantine.\n\nIn order to understand what isn't domestic violence, we must look at what is. Domestic\n\nviolence is driven by power and control. Outbursts of anger or frustration during the pandemic don't necessarily signal a relationship wrought by intimate partner violence.\n\nActions that erupt between loving family members in the trauma of quarantine are far different than oppression. In a different context, now that couples and their children live in what is essentially a more liberal form of what correctional facilities call solitary confinement, we all need to be easier with each other. Psychologists have explained how the lack of choices and stimulation in these conditions adversely affect the decision-making faculties of prisoners. It's a widely accepted way of understanding inmates' abnormal behavior.\n\nHOTLINE: Share your coronavirus story\n\nWe need to extend the same understanding we show inmates and defendants with trauma histories to ourselves right now and know that every act is not born of pathology, but of circumstance.\n\nFor instance, in Chicago, the number of 911 calls has increased about 13%, while the number of domestic violence related police complaints filed has decreased. This divergence has been interpreted as women fearing more violence if they pursue charges against abusers. While that's one way to look at it, another theory is that the people involved in the various incidents simply cooled off after the call.\n\nIn fact, calls to police end in mandatory arrests in 22 states and the District of Columbia. Out of control emotions and reactions can backfire very quickly.\n\nSome may object that insisting that people deescalate arguments shifts the burden of preventing conflict to alleged victims. That's not the case. We know there are some threats that leave no room for interpretation and some disputes have turned deadly. The case of a man who allegedly shot and killed his ex-girlfriend's 15-year-old twin daughters in southern California last week comes to mind. Violence is never acceptable, and it shouldn't be condoned.\n\nDoctors: Violent trauma will surge amid coronavirus upheaval. We're already seeing it.\n\nBut identifying everyone who is reacting to the unusual times we're living by exploding in anger as a domestic violence perpetrator who other family members need to escape, uses too broad a brush. Labeling cases in this manner will cause a tightening of resources for people who really do need to exit oppressive domestic arrangements.\n\nRather than referring every instance of conflict for shelter and separation, we can work on preventing these escalations in the first place and learn how to manage our emotions with the skills of emotional intelligence. That way, we can reserve domestic violence resources for truly inescapable abusive relationships.",

    "Coronavirus: Don't exercise TOO much during quarantine. Here's why": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "The coronavirus crisis upended most Americans' lifestyles in March - including their exercise routines.\n\nZipping past pedestrians during a run or lifting weights at the gym right after someone else are things of the past, with socially distanced running routes and at-home workouts becoming more mainstream.\n\nBut if you find yourself with extra time on your hands and the sudden urge to channel your coronavirus anxiety into breaking a sweat, make sure you're doing so safely. Because, yes, there is such a thing as getting too much exercise. And overdoing it could actually do more harm than good, pandemic or otherwise.\n\nThe standard exercise recommendations are simple: Adults should be getting at least 150 minutes of moderate physical activity every week (like brisk walking), and do muscle-strengthening activities two days per week, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. You can, of course, mix the moderate physical activity with more vigorous exercise like running.\n\nYou might logically assume that more exercise is better because you have more time on your hands, but that's not really the case. Benefits top out at about 300 minutes per week.\n\n\"Whatever your regular exercise routine was, I wouldn't alter it because of COVID-19 per se,\" says Linda S. Pescatello, a kinesiology professor at the University of Connecticut.\n\nChris Travers, an exercise physiologist at Cleveland Clinic Sports Health, points out that any amount of exercise is better than none. Research shows that even a five-minute walk or run is helping improve your cardiovascular system, and that you can do a total body strength program in seven minutes, he says.\n\nStaying Apart, Together: A newsletter about how to cope with the coronavirus pandemic\n\nQuarantined at home and need to move? Here are 10 Instagram Live workouts you can join, for free\n\nYou can experience a host of symptoms when overexercising. These include:\n\nBeyond roughly 300 minutes of working out, you're probably not gaining much more benefit anyway, says Robert Sallis, co-director of the Sports Medicine Fellowship at Kaiser Permanente.\n\nThe overarching rule is to \"listen to your body,\" Travers says. It's OK to skip a day if you're feeling fatigued.\n\nIf you're feeling severe symptoms such as dizziness, chest pain or fainting, seek medical attention.\n\nIt's still too soon to make any kind of definitive determination.\n\nPescatello cautions that while it's unclear if you could be more susceptible, you wouldn't want to put yourself in a position of weakening your immune system, given the unknowns.\n\nThough studies aren't available for COVID-19, we know other viruses are much less likely to affect humans who exercise regularly, Sallis says.\n\nDavid Nieman, a biology department professor at Appalachian State University, says people shouldn't even be thinking about overtraining (more than 300 minutes per week) right now.\n\nExisting research data supports the view that overtraining isn't recommended in parts of the world where COVID-19 transmission risk is high.\n\n\"Intense exercise when infected with COVID-19 or other systemic viruses should be avoided,\" Nieman says in a review paper coming out in June in the Journal of Sport and Health Science. The U.S. has more than 1 million coronaviruses cases, per Johns Hopkins data.\n\nNow more than ever, though, physical activity is important to strengthen immune function and combat psychological stressors associated with the pandemic.\n\n\"Exercise is our best medicine to try to combat those,\" Sallis says.\n\nRemember that fitness levels vary person to person. That 150-minute threshold might be too much if you're starting out, Pescatello says.\n\nJust lacing up your running sneakers won't turn you into Olympic champion Usain Bolt. In fact, trying a new exercise at a high intensity could prove dangerous.\n\n\"You're not going to improve your physical fitness in a day, but you could hurt yourself in a day,\" Travers says. He normally advises patients to walk before they run - literally.\n\nOn the flip side: What if your typical exercise routine is gone because of pandemic restrictions? Keep in mind that activities as basic as going for a walk could prove beneficial. Activities like tennis, hiking and bike riding are other socially distanced options to consider for exercise.\n\nYou'll be thankful later. Nieman thinks this epidemic is a wake-up call to the world to reverse trends of obesity and lack of exercise to keep immune systems in solid shape.\n\n\"We can do a lot with exercise and leanness to help fend off the virus, or if we get it, to reduce the symptoms and the duration of the symptoms,\" Nieman says.\n\nYou can continue to train for that race you were getting excited about. Alternatively, you can find an event for this fall and start training again.\n\nIf you opt to run your distance anyway, see if you can participate in the event virtually if a race is taking that approach. It won't be the same as you planned, but it's still a way to achieve that goal.\n\nRemember, though, that running a full marathon can prove a great strain on a body. Nieman recommends people don't train for a marathon (a 26.2-mile race) until the virus is under control.\n\nSo what's the major takeaway? When it comes to exercise, don't overdo it, but don't do nothing. Regular daily exercise gives a boost to immune cells that target viruses when they enter the bloodstream, and exercise will better your mental health, too.\n\n\"You don't really have to do a lot to get these tremendous (exercise) benefits,\" Sallis says.\n\nYes, yes, yes: Why I'll keep running, so long as it's legal, during the coronavirus pandemic",

        "authors": [],
        "body": "WASHINGTON - The federal prison system, confronted with mounting infections and deaths attributed to the coronavirus, is expanding testing to seek out previously hidden asymptomatic inmates in an attempt to control the spread.\n\nThe Bureau of Prisons, the largest detention system in the country, now joins a small number of states that have adopted a testing regimen to include suspected carriers of the virus beyond those who display common symptoms of infection.\n\n\"Expanding the testing ... on asymptomatic inmates will assist the slowing of transmission with isolating those individuals who test positive and quarantining contacts,\" the agency said Thursday. \"The deployment of these additional resources will be based on facility need to contain widespread transmission and the need for early, aggressive interventions required to slow transmission at facilities with a high number of at-risk inmates such as medical referral centers.\"\n\nAt the time of the announcement, the BOP reported that 620 inmates and 357 staffers had been infected, while 24 prisoner deaths have been attributed to COVID-19's spread.\n\nVirus sparks prison inquiry: DOJ team reviewing conditions at virus-plagued federal prisons; IG leading separate probe\n\nLawsuit targets troubled prison: Prisoners sue for release from troubled federal prison where coronavirus has killed 5 inmates\n\nOfficials said that the agency had obtained additional testing capacity that would be deployed at especially hard-hit facilities across its 122-prison system.\n\nThe largest numbers of infections were reported at bureau prisons in Fort Worth, Texas; Lompoc, California; and Terminal Island, California. Seven inmates, meanwhile, have died at the prison in Oakdale, Louisiana; six deaths were reported at the Elkton, Ohio facility.\n\n\"Asymptomatic inmates who test positive for COVID-19 can transmit the virus to other inmates,\" the agency said. \"The testing of asymptomatic inmates will assist in slowing transmissions within a correctional setting along with increasing the number of COVID-19 positive tests...\"\n\nState prison systems in Ohio and North Carolina have already expanded testing in search of asymptomatic inmates, resulting in a surge of new infections.\n\nIn Ohio, authorities have tested the entire inmate population at three separate prisons, revealing startling numbers of new infections. The expanded testing has pushed the number of infections at one prison, the Marion Correctional Institution, to more than 2,000 - the largest outbreak in the country.\n\nAsymptomatic inmates accounted for more than 90% of those infections, officials said.\n\nOfficials in North Carolina recently completed mass testing at a prison near Raleigh where more than 90% of the 458 infected inmates displayed no common symptoms.\n\n\"Expanding COVID-19 testing for asymptomatic inmates ... with public health entities will improve the BOP's ability to manage COVID-19 at facilities experiencing widespread transmission,\" the bureau said.\n\nFor more than a week, a Justice Department team has been reviewing conditions at coronavirus-plagued federal prisons.\n\nA group of senior advisers to Attorney General William Barr have conducted in-person inspections of the hardest hit units in Louisiana, Ohio and North Carolina. A virtual inspection was scheduled at the facility in Lompoc.\n\nJustice's inspector general, Michael Horowitz, also is conducting a separate inquiry into conditions at the agency.",

Southwest Airlines CEO Gary Kelly earlier this week said the Transportation Security Administration should add temperature scans at the security checkpoint. The TSA said no decisions have been made.\n\nBiffle said Frontier believes the TSA should handle screenings and that the agency and airport authorities \"may be working to lay that groundwork.''\n\nUntil then, Frontier wants to do its own screenings of passengers. Employees will be subject to the same standard, Frontier said.\n\nFrontier said passengers will be screened with touchless thermometers prior to boarding. If a traveler's temperature reading exceeds 100.4\u2109, they will be given time to rest before receiving a second check if there is time before boarding.\n\nIf the second reading exceeds 100.4\u2109, the passenger will not be able to board that day. Frontier said it will work with passengers to rebook traveler on a later date or \"otherwise accommodate the traveler's preferences with respect to their reservation.''\n\nFrontier passengers already must fill out a health acknowledgement form on the airline's website or mobile app prior to check-in saying that neither they nor anyone in their household has had COVID-19 related symptoms in the last 14 days, that they will not head to the airport if they have a fever and that they acknowledge the airline's new face mask requirement.\n\nThe face mask requirement begins Friday.\n\nThe new normal?

    "Coronavirus: Guillain-Barre syndrome tingling associated with COVID-19": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "Doctors are paying close attention to trends that could be associated with COVID-19 as the list of coronavirus symptoms continues to grow.\n\nWhile neurological experts say isolated tingling in the hands and feet is probably not a common symptom of the virus, it is a symptom of a rare disorder that may be associated with COVID-19 called Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome.\n\nGuillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome (GBS) is a rare disorder where the immune system attacks the body's nerves, according to the Mayo Clinic website. Weakness and tingling in the hands and feet, medically known as paresthesia, are usually its first symptoms.\n\nAn April study from Italy published in the peer-reviewed New England Journal of Medicine found five out of 1200 coronavirus patients developed GBS.\n\n\"After a person has an infection, there can be an immune system confusion where the immune system attacks the insolation, or myelin sheath, around the peripheral nerves,\" said Dr. Robert Fox, staff neurologist at the Cleveland Clinic's Mellen Center for Multiple Sclerosis.\n\nWhile it does happen, Fox said it's very rare for a COVID-19 patients to develop this disorder.\n\nDr. Anthony Geraci, director of Neuromuscular Medicine at Northwell Health in New York, says most coronavirus-related GBS cases occur in the middle to later part of the infection process, about two weeks after the onset of COVID-19 symptoms.\n\nWhile the vast majority of his patients exhibited common COVID-19 and GBS symptoms concurrently, he said one or two had a tingling in their hands and feet with no other symptoms. Other patients experienced more nuanced symptoms like diminished reflexes, he said.\n\nFox said if tingling doesn't progress to other symptoms after a day or two, it's unlikely GBS. Even if it's not GBS, it can still be related to COVID-19.\n\n'Something we've never seen before': Scientists still trying to understand baffling, unpredictable coronavirus\n\nTingling in the hands and feet can be associated with another more acute condition: anxiety. Fox said many people who get anxious and have panic attacks will report having a tingling sensation in their hands, feet or around their mouth.\n\n\"Sometimes patients think when we say it's from anxiousness, we don't believe them,\" Fox said. \"We really do believe them. We think (the tingling) is real.\"\n\nHowever, both Geraci and Fox say it's difficult to pinpoint the cause of tingling as it is a common symptom of multiple conditions.\n\n\"The problem with tingling is that anything is possible,\" Geraci said. \"It can come from so many realms and domains of the nervous system.\"\n\nAn in-depth look: How does the coronavirus cause COVID toes or loss of smell? Here's how the immune system reacts.\n\nWhether it's a serious condition like GBS or something more acute like anxiety, Fox urges patients not to self-diagnosis to avoid the hospital. Contact you doctor with any concerning symptoms, either virtually or in person.\n\n\"It's important for patients to know that it's not their jobs to figure it out, but for them to pay attention to their symptoms and share that with a provider,\" he said.",

The other is to develop strategies and interventions to protect them.\n\nMore than 5,000 health care workers have signed up for the HERO Registry since it launched last week. Those who are registered will be sent surveys asking about their backgrounds, experiences and what they've encountered, Hernandez said.\n\nHealth care workers are also invited to send in videos of themselves addressing issues critical to them, their families and their future. So far, the concerns include the lack of personal protective equipment, their health status and the potential to infect the people they love.\n\nHERO also will use the registry to enroll health care workers in studies where they will have first access to drugs that could protect them from the coronavirus. The first study will focus on hydroxychloroquine and requires 15,000 participants.\n\nWhat are 'COVID toes'?: Doctors discover symptom of coronavirus mostly seen in kids\n\nOut of the health care workers who signed up, Hernandez said 29% are nurses.\n\nAngela Larson, a critical care clinical nurse specialist at the University of Florida in Gainesville, registered. She saw it as an opportunity to contribute to research that could help her and her colleagues going forward.\n\n\"I'm not surprised that it's the majority of nursing that's a part of this,\" she said. \"That's what we want to do. We want to be a part of something and help.\"",

    "Coronavirus: Hawaii travel restrictions keep virus numbers down": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "HONOLULU (AP) -- Flying to a faraway beach might seem like the perfect way to escape a pandemic, but for isolated Pacific islands, controlling the coronavirus means cutting off tourism.\n\nHawaii has among the lowest COVID-19 infection and mortality rates in the U.S. As cases rose in March, Gov. David Ige did something no other state can -- effectively seal its borders. People who do come face a two-week quarantine, stopping the flow of tens of thousands of tourists who typically arrive every day.\n\n\"We are the most isolated community on the planet,\" Ige told The Associated Press last week. \"As such, we've got to be more self-reliant, but we also had the opportunity to enact a quarantine, make it meaningful and most importantly, know that we could really dramatically reduce the number of visitors we get.\"\n\nWith more than 2,000 miles (3,220 kilometers) of ocean separating it from the rest of the world, Hawaii has an advantage over other remote states with low rates of infection and death. Unlike Alaska, Montana and Wyoming, there's no driving or taking a train to the islands, so fewer people will be arriving and spreading the disease as businesses begin to reopen.\n\nBut the travel restrictions have walloped an economy dependent on tourism, and they will be among the last to end, officials say. Hawaii now has one of the nation's highest unemployment rates.\n\n\"The sacrifice of keeping our community safe and healthy,\" Ige said, \"has come at the expense of more than 225,000 residents who are now unemployed\" -- about a third of Hawaii's workforce.\n\nOf the few places in the world with no confirmed COVID-19 infections, nearly all are islands in the Pacific.\n\nAmerican Samoa, a U.S. territory west of Hawaii, is the nation's only jurisdiction with no cases to date. Officials have asked Hawaiian Airlines to halt daily flights from Honolulu to try to stay virus-free, and travelers must quarantine for two weeks.\n\nEvery other U.S. state and territory, including the islands of Guam and Puerto Rico, have the virus. Once there, it's hard to contain, especially if visitors keep arriving.\n\nHawaii became the first state to require travelers to quarantine, and others have followed, though enforcement has been spotty.\n\nHawaii has arrested several tourists for breaking quarantine, which can mean a $5,000 fine and up to one year in jail. More than 200 visitors arrived on Friday.\n\nTravelers must give Hawaii airport officials an address they will go for quarantine, which is verified, and their cellphone number. If the number doesn't ring in front of an agent, the visitor is turned over to police. National Guard troops also check people for fevers and other signs of illness at airports.\n\nThe state has at least 16 deaths and more than 600 confirmed cases. For most, the coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms like fever or cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness.\n\nHawaii has prevented wide community spread despite some clusters of cases, including at a Maui hospital and a fast food restaurant on the Big Island.\n\nIts strategies are familiar: stay-at-home orders, social distancing and business closures. But the mandatory quarantine for travelers made the biggest impact.\n\nAverage daily arrivals for this time of year plummeted from about 30,000 people a day to a just few hundred. Most are returning residents.\n\nMary Ann Jenkins left Honolulu to see family in Indiana in early April and was prepared to quarantine for two weeks when she flew home last week. She said she faced no such restrictions on the mainland.\n\n\"There was really no problem going into Indiana,\" Jenkins said. \"When I left ... it was more of a secure thing than when I got there.\"\n\nShe agrees with Ige's order to limit visitors.\n\n\"On the mainland, you can go from one state to the next and you're just still driving down the road so you never know who, what or where you're coming in contact with,\" Jenkins said.\n\nHawaii also expanded testing to close contacts of infected people, said Lt. Gov. Josh Green, a practicing emergency room doctor. Officials are now developing ways to slowly restart the tourism economy.\n\nGreen is recommending that for the next year, or until the virus is no longer a major threat, travelers should be tested 72 hours before arriving. And he said partnering with places like New Zealand and Australia, which also have low infection rates, could slowly rebuild tourism with countries known to be safe.\n\nBartender Jason Maxwell, who works at two Honolulu hotels, is trying to apply for unemployment benefits through the overloaded state system and using vacation and sick time in the meantime. Once that's out, he's not sure what's ahead.\n\n\"It's not going to get any easier. And I don't anticipate this thing ending anytime soon. So the stress of the unknown is kind of the biggest thing that's happening right now,\" Maxwell said.\n\nThe governor says he's extending unemployment benefits to more workers and allowing businesses like real estate agencies, car dealerships and golf courses to reopen.\n\nBut the quarantine rules for travelers will last at least through May.\n\n\"We are flattening the curve,\" Ige said. \"However, my greatest fear is that if we move too quickly to reopen, we will see a sudden surge in new cases that would result in overrunning our health care system and more deaths.\"\n\nMore: Hawaii is slowly shutting down vacation rentals, one county after another",

        "body": "We are all adapting to the new normal of navigating COVID-19, with innovative approaches emerging. But not all are good ideas. A case in point is the Republican leadership's proposals to immunize businesses from accountability if they follow \"government guidelines\" for operating \"safely.\" They make it sound reasonable, but when you take a closer look, the proposals would actually jeopardize both workers and consumers and damage our economic recovery.\n\nMany companies are doing their best to address COVID-19 by keeping their workers and customers safe and offering paid leave to employees who show symptoms. But immunizing all companies based on compliance with guidelines is problematic.\n\nFirst, no authoritative guidelines exist. The Trump administration recently blocked the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's detailed reopening guidelines for certain industries because they were overly prescriptive, according to The Associated Press.\n\nThe only other federal guidelines, from the CDC and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, offer \"recommendations\" rather than actual rules. Similarly, some states have created their own guidelines, but they vary greatly.\n\nWe know that certain industries have failed to take reasonable precautions to protect the public and their workforce. What standards will they be held to? Even if such guidelines existed, accountability should never be based solely on compliance with standards. In fact, under current law, compliance with government standards is already a defense from liability; if the standards are sound and a business has complied, companies face no liability. However, all the facts must be considered, including whether the standards are sufficient and applicable to the particular situation.\n\nOUR VIEW: Coronavirus lawsuits immunity requires public health guidelines\n\nAmerican Association for Justice: Blanket legal immunity will prolong pandemic\n\nThe Chamber of Commerce, which is supporting immunity, recently wrote that a \"one-size-fits-all regulatory approach is simply impossible when talking about adapting safety measures for every workplace in America.\"\n\nThis is exactly why the flexibility that exists in current rules works -- to determine whether a business acted reasonably toward consumers and workers. Congress shouldn't add another layer of broad immunity based on phantom guidelines and politicians' whims.\n\nSally Greenberg is the executive director of the National Consumers League.",

    "Coronavirus: Is there COVID-19 antibody testing near me? Probably not.": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "Coronavirus antibody testing in the U.S. is starting to ramp up as government officials discuss when they can reopen communities and health experts survey hotspots.\n\nFrom coast to coast, epidemiologists are using some of the many antibody tests that have entered the market recently to determine how much COVID-19 has spread.\n\nThe importance of these tests are not lost on Americans, who are itching to go back to work, see loved ones and find out if they have been infected with the virus. Many have questions about where to find antibody tests, how they work and if they can even be trusted.\n\nThere aren't easy answers. With little public data about the tests' accuracy, experts question whether they will give people false reassurances by indicating they have immunity to the disease.\n\nTesting to see if people have antibodies in their blood isn't the same as testing to see if they are infected with the coronavirus that causes COVID-19.\n\nAn antibody test can determine if someone has been infected and recovered, whereas a molecular test - a \"PCR\" test that usually uses a nose or throat swab - shows whether that person was infected with the virus at the time the test was taken.\n\nAntibodies are the body's way of remembering how it responded to an infection so they can attack again if exposed to the same pathogen. If a person has antibodies in her blood, that means she has immune cells available to fight the virus, which lowers the risk of getting sick.\n\nThe blood tests for COVID-19 look for antibodies specific to this coronavirus. Health care workers take a sample of a patient's blood and isolate the parts containing the antibodies into a serum. If someone has coronavirus antibodies, they would be found in the blood, along with other antibodies.\n\nSome tests use a simple finger prick to draw a blood sample, which is collected with a thin straw and deposited in a small cartridge along with a special solution of liquids that will cause a reaction. Ten minutes later, the test promises to tell you whether you've had COVID-19.\n\nIn theory, antibody tests can reveal who is immune to a disease. They can also determine how widely it has spread and how deadly it is.\n\nBroad testing of even a portion of the population in the coming months could give researchers a sense of how many Americans have been infected. They could use that to predict who might be immune if COVID-19 cases spike again this fall.\n\nOpinion: Why coronavirus antibody test will not be a panacea\n\nAntibodies for similar coronaviruses can be present in the body for a couple of years, said Dr. Liise-anne Pirofski, professor of biomedical research at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine. However, scientists don't know how long antibodies for the new coronavirus remain in the body, and how much is required to be immune.\n\nAntibody testing is also important because people with the antibodies may qualify to donate blood that can be used to manufacture convalescent plasma, an experimental treatment for people who are seriously ill from COVID-19.\n\nBut there are many questions about the tests now available.\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration has issued emergency use authorization to just four serological tests developed by Cellex, Chembio Diagnostic Systems, Ortho Clinical Diagnostics and Mount Sinai Laboratory. The FDA said it expects to authorize more in the coming weeks.\n\nEmergency use authorization allows unapproved medical products to be used during a public health crisis, without the benefit of the validated testing that would normally take place.\n\nMore than 100 tests are coming on the market, but the vast majority has not been authorized by the FDA. In March, the FDA allowed companies to sell antibody tests if they conduct internal evaluations of the tests and notify the FDA. The FDA did not review those tests, as it typically would, in an effort to put them in use as quickly as possible.\n\n\"There's even more concern there. They've had even less regulatory control,\" said Dr. Greg Poland, director of the Mayo Clinic's Vaccine Research Group. \"How are manufacturers testing these? Are they rushing these out prematurely? That economic motive is what requires regulatory oversight.\"\n\nUnder the FDA's updated policy, dozens of new antibody tests are being marketed without emergency use authorization. So while tests are becoming available to the public, they haven't received much scrutiny.\n\nDr. Stephen Hahn, who heads the Food and Drug Administration, said earlier this week that his agency and others are examining some of the antibody tests offered by manufacturers.\n\nDepending on where you live, you may not have access to antibody testing. Most people can't drive up to their local pharmacy, lab or hospital and ask for an antibody test.\n\nHowever, some private labs are offering antibody tests to the public, with or without a doctor's referral, for a fee. These include labs such as ARCpoint Labs in Greenville, North Carolina ($75), National Jewish Health in Denver, Colorado ($94), and Innovative Express Care in Chicago ($250).\n\nSome states have set up antibody testing sites for a limited number of people. The New York State Department of Health recently conducted a statewide survey that tested 3,000 people in 20 different grocery stores, finding that 13.9% tested positive for the antibodies. That would mean 2.7 million residents could have had the virus already.\n\nThe study suggests a death rate of about 0.5% of those infected because about 15,500 New Yorkers have died of confirmed COVID-19 cases, and there are about 19.5 million people in the state.\n\nGov. Andrew Cuomo said the results are an important indicator of the spread of the virus, though the death rate is probably higher than the results showed.\n\n\"It's still preliminary, and when we say there are 15,000 deaths, those numbers are going to go up,\" Cuomo said. \"These are only hospitalization or nursing home deaths. It does not include so-called at home deaths.\"\n\nEpidemiological experts don't know enough to make sweeping generalizations on the study, Pirofski said during a teleconference hosted by the Infectious Diseases Society of America.\n\n\"We need to slow our roll; these tests have not been available for that long,\" she said. \"This is our first dive into understanding what's coming, and the deeper dive is coming.\"\n\nThe Red Cross announced Thursday it is seeking people who have fully recovered from COVID-19 to sign up to donate plasma (which contains antibodies) to treat current COVID-19 patients.\n\nU.S. hits 50,000 deaths from coronavirus - just as many states announce plans to ease social distancing\n\nWill the curve hold steady?: The coronavirus curve bends toward reopening in hard-hit counties.\n\nDonors must meet certain requirements to donate, including having a prior, verified diagnosis of COVID-19. Pirofski said the donor must have documentation, such as a positive PCR test or an official isolation order, and can donate up to 28 days after the resolution of their symptoms.\n\nThis is not a diagnostic test to determine if you had the virus in the past.\n\nResearchers have raised many questions about the accuracy of antibody, or serology, tests.\n\n\"Nobody's done what I would call a thorough head-to-head comparison with a validated gold standard,\" Poland said. \"I'm actually surprised that some of these kits can be used clinically.\"\n\nPoland said he's concerned about the tests giving false positives.\n\n\"One of the things I'm afraid of is that people are going to go to drive-thru testing who have not had (the) disease and are going to be told that they're protected\" because the test shows they have antibodies. \"And they're going to act and react according to that misinformation. That's a problem.\"\n\nUnproven tests. Inaccurate results. Public health labs worry 'bad data' could taint US recovery from coronavirus crisis.\n\nFor instance, a positive result could mean a test detected antibodies developed from exposure to other coronaviruses, not COVID-19. \"We want to make sure you're not having any cross-reactivity\" to other viruses, said Kelly Wroblewski, the director for infectious diseases at the Association of Public Health Laboratories.\n\nA key question is the \"specificity,\" or the false-positive rate. For instance, a specificity rate of 98% suggests a test would report just two false positives out of 100.\n\nHowever, biochemists and infectious disease experts say the false-positive rate should be considered in relation to the prevalence of the virus in the community. If few people have actually contracted the virus, there will be more false positives. Those people may think they're immune when they're not.\n\nAnother issue is that testing positive for the presence of antibodies doesn't mean you have enough antibodies to be immune. Researchers don't know how many antibodies would confer immunity, assuming it does.\n\n'Our moon shot': Vaccine makers go ahead with unproven candidates to meet 2021 goal - that experts say may\n\n\"When you say positive, what does that mean? The lower limit of detection? Or a high enough level that you're protected? What they don't say, and they should, is does this result mean I'm protected?\" Poland said. \"It's a difficult discussion because people leap to the idea, 'Oh, I have antibodies, so I'm safe.' But by some of these (tests), the odds are a flip of a coin. That's inherently dangerous.\"\n\nMany larger institutions, including the Mayo Clinic, are now creating their own antibody tests because they've found others to be unreliable, Poland said.\n\n\"The science has not kept up with the test,\" said Dr. Mary Hayden, professor of Internal Medicine and Pathology at Rush University Medical Center. \"The tests are out there but we need to do research to understand what the tests mean.\"\n\nDozens of serology tests have not received FDA emergency use authorization, and some are falsely marketing themselves as having received authorization, according to the FDA.\n\n\"Be aware that not all marketed serological tests have been evaluated by the FDA,\" the agency said in a letter to health care providers. \"Some firms are falsely claiming that their serological tests are FDA approved or authorized, or falsely claiming that these tests can diagnose COVID-19.\"\n\nThe FDA said it's working with the National Institutes of Health and the Centers for Disease Control and Infection on a \"validation project\" to help identify the most promising serological tests.\n\nIf we're able to test people for antibodies, the theory goes, we can figure out who is immune and can go back to work. Or, for health care professionals and first responders, we can figure out who can stay at work.\n\nBut the questions about antibody testing mean we're not close to that being reality.\n\n\"The whole presupposition around the testing is, on the one hand, they have central importance in reopening, and on the other hand, there are complete unknowns,\" Poland said. Among them: \"Is the test accurate? What does it mean? How long might someone be protected that has a positive test?\n\n\"This is all resting on a very shaky foundation,\" he said.\n\nIf antibody tests reveal a community has developed \"herd immunity\" -- that's when a large portion of the population becomes immune to a disease or virus, inhibiting its spread -- then states may be able to lift lockdowns and more Americans could return to work, some argue.\n\nTolbert G. Nyenswah, Senior Research Associate at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, believes achieving \"herd immunity\" in the U.S. isn't realistic given the size of the population and the relatively small number of people who have recovered from the coronavirus. There are about 330 million people in the U.S., and about 885,000 people have contracted the coronavirus as of Friday afternoon, according to Johns Hopkins University.\n\nSome criticize relying on \"herd immunity\" because they believe it's a passive solution to the pandemic that could cost more lives and overload the health care system.\n\nJohn C. Welch, director of Partnerships & Operations for the Massachusetts COVID Response at Partners in Health, leads a statewide contact tracing effort and has firsthand experience combatting infectious disease such as the Ebola epidemic in West Africa.\n\n\"To talk about herd immunity is sensationally offensive,\" he said. \"Herd immunity assumes you're okay with people dying.\"\n\nAt Chicago's Innovative Express Care on the North Side, dozens of people had lined up in cars and on foot by 9 a.m. to get an antibody test. It was 40 degrees, and many wore hats and gloves.\n\n\"I want to know if I had it because I was sick from November to mid-January, and so was my entire family,\" said Lincoln Park resident Amber David. \"If it's like most viruses, if you get it again, it's not as bad. That's my thought process. I won't be as concerned. ... If I know that I had it, I already know what I dealt with, so I know my kids didn't end up on a ventilator.\"\n\nFellow Lincoln Park resident Natalie Patterson said she had experienced chest pains and a cough at the beginning of March.\n\n\"I'm hoping that I already had it and recovered. Put my mind at ease. I would have known how my body reacted to it - that I already had it and it wasn't terrible,\" she said.\n\nPatterson said she hoped her three kids already contracted the disease, too.\n\n\"My youngest son has asthma, so, at this point, I kind of hope that he was exposed but had no reaction,\" she said.\n\nSkokie resident Ken Rzepecki said he hoped to get proof of immunity so he could visit his grandchildren. \"I figure, it's a walk-up test. I'll come and get tested and see if that helps me go see the kids,\" he said.\n\nChicago resident Tony Unruh said he and his girlfriend were sick in February while visiting Colorado. They sought the test so they could donate plasma.\n\nMany of the people lined up to get an antibody test were aware of the uncertainties. For most, a potentially flawed answer was better than nothing at all.\n\n\"I figure that it's early, and if this test ends up being the one that everybody wants, it's better that I got it sooner rather than later,\" Patterson said.\n\nThe clinic began offering tests Wednesday. The online booking system immediately filled up.\n\n\"Within a day, we were booked till May 31st,\" said Dr. Rahul Khare, founder and CEO of Innovative Care. \"The website crashed.\"\n\nThe clinic completed 150 tests Wednesday, followed by another 250 Thursday, Khare said.\n\nInnovative Care initially said it was using a test by PerkinElmer, and that it had received FDA emergency use authorization.\n\nWhen USA TODAY pointed out the FDA hadn't authorized that test, Innovative Care said it would update its website.\n\nThe lab later said it was actually using a test by Abbott Labs. The FDA has not given emergency use authorization to an antibody test made by Abbott.\n\nLater Friday, the company removed any reference to what test it was using.",

        "body": "Arjanae Avula talks to her younger brother twice a week. Phone calls last about three minutes before they're cut off. During their last conversation, she said, he was crying.\n\n\"When am I going to get out of here? ... Do you know anything? Can you talk to anybody?\" Avula recalled him asking.\n\nHer 18-year-old brother is at Bon Air Juvenile Correctional Center, a coronavirus hot spot near Richmond, Virginia, where at least 25 youths and 10 employees have tested positive for COVID-19.\n\nYouths at Bon Air have been locked in cells no bigger than a bathroom for 23 hours a day, families and attorneys said. They're allowed one hour to either shower, brush their teeth or call home. Classes have been canceled, and they have little to no human interactions.\n\nAvula, 19, is not just worried about the virus; she also fears for her brother's mental health. She said he has attention deficit disorder, depression and post-traumatic stress disorder. He's prone to outbursts, Avula said, and the isolation is making them worse.\n\n\"The best thing for people to do is to remain safe and quarantined with their family rather than being locked up in a cage,\" she said. \"These are not 40-year-old men. ... This is not a state max prison.\"\n\nAs the coronavirus pandemic spreads at Bon Air and other juvenile facilities across the country, attorneys and advocates are scrambling to get young detainees released, especially those serving time for nonviolent offenses and probation violations or who have underlying health conditions. But the process isn't easy.\n\nBecause the juvenile system is dependent on judges' discretion, releasing someone is largely based on which judges are presiding in what jurisdiction - instead of the severity of offenses, attorneys and advocates say. The result is a patchwork of decisions, a slow slog to bring cases in front of judges at a time when courts across the country are shut down.\n\n\"It's justice by geography. Depending on where you live, you may have greater or lesser access to the courts, or greater or lesser opportunity to have your case reviewed,\" said Marsha Levick, chief legal officer of the Juvenile Law Center in Philadelphia.\n\nAcross the country, 116 youths at juvenile facilities have tested positive for coronavirus, according to the Sentencing Project, which has been tracking cases nationwide. In Louisiana, 28 juveniles have tested positive at facilities across the state.\n\nBon Air, an all-male facility for teens and young men ages 14 to 20, has among the highest number of cases for a single facility.\n\n'It would cripple us completely': Coronavirus takes toll on rural police agencies\n\nPolice and coronavirus: How the pandemic has changed policing in the country\n\n\"These numbers are untenable,\" Levick said. \"The public health crisis is something that has sent all of us home hunkered down, and yet here we are, allowing children and other incarcerated individuals living in group-living situations where the risk of spreading the contagion is just extreme.\"\n\nVirginia's Department of Juvenile Justice said the majority of the nearly two dozen who tested positive at Bon Air did not show symptoms and are no longer in medical isolation. Four had minor cold and flu-like symptoms. Two of the 10 staffers who tested positive have since returned to work, according to the department.\n\n\"As an agency that provides care for children, our first priority has been keeping residents and staff safe and healthy,\" the director, Valerie Boykin, said in a statement.\n\nBut families remain uneasy.\n\nAvula said her brother has not been tested for coronavirus and doesn't have any symptoms. That worries her, she said, because many people with the virus don't show symptoms early on - or at all. Plus, her brother has asthma.\n\nOther family members, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to avoid drawing attention to their relatives' cases, said they have received little information from officials about how their loved ones are doing.\n\nOne woman said after her relative tested positive, no one at the facility told her or anyone in the family about it. She said the family found out after the boy told his grandmother on the phone that he had tested positive.\n\n'Complete chaos': How the coronavirus pandemic is upending the criminal justice system\n\n\"I was upset. The father was upset,\" she said. \"Before I got to speak to him or to the doctor, I didn't know if he had more symptoms or build up in his lungs. I didn't know anything.\"\n\nOne mother said her son tested negative, but there have been many sleepless nights. Juveniles like her son have been separated from their support system, she said.\n\n\"I think that just makes them sad. It makes my son sad. He's sad, he's isolated, he's anxious,\" she said. \"These boys have had some kind of trauma in their life. ... When my child says to me, 'Mom, I don't know how to stay well anymore,' it breaks your heart because that should never happen to any child. We're failing, and it is extremely upsetting to me as a parent.\"\n\nIn a letter sent to Bon Air earlier this week, the Legal Aid Justice Center in Virginia said juveniles they represent learned they have COVID-19 when they were told they'll be moved to the medical unit. There were no explanations about the implications of the virus, or what a positive test means, leaving juveniles in fear and confusion, the letter said.\n\nAttorneys for the center also said their clients have not received counseling services for weeks. Juveniles were given washable masks, but they're often unable to wash them. They said one client who has tested positive has not been examined by a doctor. Another client who felt ill said his complaints about symptoms were overlooked, the letter said.\n\n\"The kids developmentally are in this sort of malleable state. They're growing their identity, rehabilitating,\" said Amy Walters, an attorney at the Legal Aid Justice Center. \"If you're in this psychologically traumatic experience where your health is compromised, that's going to have ramification for the rest of their lives.\"\n\nA spokesman for the Virginia Department of Juvenile Justice said it is preparing to respond to the center's letter, and the agency hopes to continue a \"constructive dialogue.\"\n\nOfficials said in a statement last week that those with coronavirus are receiving adequate medical care at Bon Air, and families were notified when their relatives tested positive.\n\nOfficials also said they've ramped up testing. Temperatures are taken twice daily, and those with a reading of 100.3 degrees or higher are tested for coronavirus. Youths and employees have also been given masks.\n\nJennifer Jones, whose 17-year-old is at Swanson Center for Youth in Columbia, Louisiana, said her son is scared, and he worries about who will have the virus next. Twelve have tested positive at the center, nearly half of all cases at juvenile facilities in the state.\n\nVirus tears through jails: Hundreds of infected, quarantined inmates in prisons and jails challenging officials\n\n\"It's like all around him but never got to him yet,\" Jones said. \"I just try to tell him to just keep his head up, continue to wash and try to stay safe.\"\n\nShe said her son has three months left for probation violation.\n\nAcross the country, adult jails and prisons have rushed to release hundreds of inmates to avoid massive outbreaks behind bars. But the juvenile system has been slow to respond, attorneys and advocates say. Judges in some jurisdictions have rejected requests for such large-scale releases for juveniles.\n\nIn Pennsylvania, the state supreme court rejected a petition to release children who have health problems or are being held for nonviolent offenses or probation violations. Judges acknowledged that the potential for outbreaks at facilities is \"undeniable,\" but they said a blanket release \"fails to take into account the individual circumstances of each juvenile, including any danger to them or to others.\" The court, instead, directed county judges to review juvenile cases.\n\nThe Maryland Court of Appeals rejected a similar petition and directed lower court judges to identify juveniles who can be released.\n\nIn Virginia, where Bon Air is located, judges decide whether to release juveniles who are facing more serious offenses. For others, the state's Department of Juvenile Justice, which oversees Bon Air, has that authority. The department said it has reduced the correctional center's population by 10% since mid-March.\n\nPrison releases: AG William Barr expediting release of vulnerable inmates at federal prisons swamped by coronavirus\n\nLevick, of the Juvenile Law Center, said because the juvenile system has been so accustomed to thinking about kids through a very specific lens, it is unable to respond swiftly during a pandemic. Trying to get courts to \"pivot on a dime\" has been impossible, she said.\n\n\"The good story about the juvenile justice system is that it's designed to be very individualized. You look at every kid individually,\" Levick said. \"The bad news is it's individualized. ... A framework that works when the world is not facing a pandemic does not work when there's a pandemic.\"\n\nRenee Slajda, spokeswoman for the Louisiana Center for Children's Rights, said she doesn't think the individualized system makes releasing juveniles harder.\n\n\"Judges know these kids. They should be regularly checking on them on their progress and understand the severity of this moment,\" she said.\n\nStill, in some jurisdictions where attorneys have asked judges to review their clients' individual cases, there has been little success.\n\nThe Louisiana Center for Children's Rights, the public defender agency for juveniles in New Orleans, has filed motions asking judges to reconsider their clients' sentences. But the juvenile court has yet to schedule a hearing, Slajda said.\n\n\"There are a lot of good candidates (for release). We just can't get the state or the judges to review,\" Slajda said. \"There's no sense of urgency. ... We're not against individualized decision-making. We're just asking that no matter what the mechanisms are for sending kids home, that actions are taken quickly.\"\n\n'It gets more frightening: As coronavirus surges in prisons, families of elderly inmates wait in fear\n\nVulnerable inmates: Feds to expand home confinement for elderly inmates to avoid larger coronavirus outbreak\n\nIn Houston, public defenders filed writs to challenge their clients' detention, but those have been rejected, said Steven Halpert, juvenile division chief of the Harris County Public Defender's Office. One court rejected their petition without a hearing, he said.\n\n\"Judges are really hesitant to release kids with more serious charges,\" Halpert said. \"But they didn't sign up to be in a facility where coronavirus can spread quickly.\"\n\nIn Los Angeles, a judge denied a juvenile's petition even though the teen's probation officer asked for an early release.\n\nIn some cases, children don't have homes to go to.\n\nMarissa Boyce, an assistant public defender for the Virginia Indigent Defense Commission, said she has one such client, a 15-year-old.\n\n\"We have had multiple detention hearings to try to get him placed. His family can't take him. He doesn't have any other family,\" Boyce said.\n\nThe bottom line, Boyce said, is that judges have to consider two things when deciding whether juveniles should be released: danger to the community and likelihood of becoming a flight risk.\n\nBut, she added, \"I'm hard-pressed to think of a reason why a child should be locked up during a pandemic.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the pandemic spreads and families are left in fear.\n\nAvula said she has many questions.\n\nShe wonders how coronavirus started inside Bon Air in the first place. She wonders why the outbreak isn't enough reason to release her brother, who she said is at the end of his sentence.\n\n\"My brother has done everything he's supposed to complete,\" she said, \"and he should be out right now.\"",

    "Coronavirus: Kentucky woman wears apocalypse outfit to grocery store": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "CINCINNATI -- You may have caught a glimpse of a vast black hoop skirt swish down an aisle, or a long, ornately patterned, begoggled beak nosing its way through the produce section if you made a recent trip to Jungle Jim's grocery store in suburban Cincinnati on the same day as Karen Hinrichs Lukes.\n\nIf so, you were treated to a snapshot of just how wild fashion could be even just raiding the grocery in a post-apocalyptic world.\n\nYou may have even seen her getup being shared on Reddit or Facebook, where photos of her shopping trip exploded in popularity, causing her DMs to be stuffed with friend requests, exclamations of \"OMG we could be best friends\" and people asking her to teach techniques or do a class.\n\n\"In apocalyptic movies, everyone has a crazy getup and I always wanted to see the prequel where they're raiding the craft store and getting their stuff together. I thought this is the time to decide what we're wearing,\" Hinrichs Lukes said.\n\nCoronavirus and the zombie apocalypse: Author Max Brooks sees a fine line between fiction, reality\n\nHinrichs Lukes, a 46-year-old Kentucky resident, is a costume-crafting aficionado, having made a hobby of winning costume contests and crafting killer ensembles from her kids' Halloween fantasies.\n\nHer daughter wanted to be Medusa for Halloween, so she carved 16 snakes from a block of foam and mounted it to a hat. Her son wanted a costume from the video game \"Plants vs. Zombies,\" so she fashioned a giant Venus' flytrap head out of cardboard.\n\nHer hobby leads her to frequent visits to thrift stores to find inspiration, so it's not surprising she already had all the parts for her apocalypse costume at home.\n\nHer creativity doesn't end there. There's also her urge to perform. She spent two years with Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus, Clyde Beatty and Cole Bros. and the Kelly Miller Circus\n\n\"I used to be a circus clown, so this costume hit the sweet spot for performance for me of 'Look at me, look at me, look at me,' but with anonymity. Make people laugh, smile, and not be recognizable after the fact,\" she said.\n\nNorth Carolina pug tests positive for coronavirus: Possibly the first dog in the U.S.\n\nShe distilled and dramatized her fears of the new coronavirus pandemic and put them on parade: an enormous hoop skirt to ensure everyone keeps their distance, a dramatically large and sharp beak-like mask to prevent breathing in the virus.\n\nBut Hinrichs Lukes ensured she was being responsible with displaying her flair for the dramatic. Her friends, who had watched the month-long process of the costume's realization, said she just had to go to the grocery store. But she wanted to do the right thing and waited until she had an actual grocery list.\n\n\"I was legit trying to grocery shop. The only time I stopped and posed was if I knew for sure there was nobody trying to get around me. I was just trying to do a regular, quick, 'you're going in and you're getting out,' grocery run,\" she said.\n\nHer friend accompanied her with her camera but found it difficult to shoot Hinrichs Lukes as she zoomed through the store.\n\nBack to the costume, though: The whole concept started with the mask. Then she thought of the cage petticoat, which she expected to fail in creating. It's made from a smaller petticoat that came out of a prom dress. She widened the skirt even further by taking apart a sun shelter pop tent that had two big rings in it. Those poles were threaded through plastic tubing and fastened with a ton of bias tape.\n\nCoronavirus symptoms vs. allergies: How to tell the difference\n\nShe recorded several live videos on Facebook as she went through the process. The whole thing took about a month to make during breaks from homeschooling her three children who are 16, 14 and 11 (she's a homeschool mom even when there's not a pandemic), and sewing about 100 face masks for Living Arrangements for the Developmentally Disabled.\n\n\"Right now, before I make anything else stupid and fun, I'm cutting up the majority of my fabric stash and making about 600 more masks for them. If once this is over, I had a fabric stash that didn't help people, I'd feel bad.\"\n\nThe costume may make another appearance at some point, too. She might hit the grocery store in dramatic fashion again, of course during a time when the least amount of people are there and somewhere where the aisles are wide.\n\nOr, \"Instead of going for a walk around my neighborhood, I might go for a very dramatic walk around my neighborhood.\"",

        "body": "Tennessee Sen. Lamar Alexander will self-quarantine for 14 days after a member of his staff tested positive for COVID-19.\n\nThe 79-year-old Republican is doing well and has no symptoms of the respiratory illness, according to a Sunday night statement from his office. He also tested negative for COVID-19 last week.\n\nBecause of his age, Alexander is among older adults who are considered at high risk for the coronavirus, which has killed nearly 80,000 Americans and more than 280,000 worldwide.\n\n\"After discussing this with the Senate's attending physician, Senator Alexander, out of an abundance of caution, has decided not to return to Washington, D.C., and will self-quarantine in Tennessee for 14 days,\" said David Clear, Alexander's chief of staff, in the statement.\n\nLittle information has been released about the staffer who tested positive, but the senator's office said that person is recovering and doing well.\n\nAlexander will continue to oversee the Senate health committee hearing during his self-quarantine.\n\nThe news of the senator's self-quarantine comes days after Vice President Mike Pence's press secretary tested positive for COVID-19. The White House denied reports Sunday that Pence was self-isolating.\n\nAlso Sunday, the White House announced a series of additional precautions to ensure the safety of the president and his staff after two administration aides tested positive for the coronavirus.\n\nPresident Donald Trump and Pence will be tested daily for the virus, as will every staff member in close proximity to them. White House guests will be tested, workspaces will undergo regular deep cleaning, and staff will follow social distancing guidelines, undergo daily temperature checks and have their symptom histories reviewed, White House spokesman Judd Deere said Sunday.\n\nA Navy valet who had been in the same room with Trump on Tuesday tested positive last week for the virus.",

    "Coronavirus: Las Vegas is struggling to survive without tourists": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Slot machines are powered down, casinos boarded up and barricaded.\n\nSidewalks are largely deserted and electronic marquees that once flashed neon calls for nightclubs, magic shows and topless revues instead beam somber messages of safety.\n\nThe famous fountains of the Bellagio casino, where water choreographed to lights and music shoots hundreds of feet in the air, are still. Throngs of visitors who made it tough to maneuver on sidewalks have been replaced by the occasional jogger or skateboarder.\n\nOn the always busy, always noisy, never sleeping Las Vegas strip, you can now hear birds chirping.\n\n\"It's crazy,\" said Chris Morehouse, a 70-year-old Elvis impersonator who spent a recent afternoon sipping Miller High Life and posing with a few locals who took advantage of the eerie silence to take photos at the neon-bedecked welcome sign on the Las Vegas Strip. \"It's like the end of the world.\"\n\nInstead of hosting throngs of visitors for one of the busiest seasons of the year, with March Madness drawing swarms to sportsbooks, or the now-scuttled plan to host the NFL draft this weekend, ferrying players in boats to a red carpet stage on the Bellagio lake, Las Vegas is trying to survive.\n\nTrump says he's 'OK' with Las Vegas shutdown after mayor calls it 'total insanity'\n\nNevada's tourism, leisure, hospitality and gambling industry accounts for one in three jobs in the state - making the state more dependent on tourism than Alaska on oil.\n\nWorkers are expected to lose $7.7 billion in wages and salaries over the next 18 months if the tourism industry is shuttered between 30 and 90 days, according to a study from the Nevada Resort Association.\n\nWith the industry effectively closed for more than five weeks now, more than 343,000 residents have filed for unemployment, and state and local governments could lose more than $1 billion in tax revenues.\n\nThe politically independent mayor of Las Vegas, Carolyn Goodman, has issued public pleas calling for the Democratic Gov. Steve Sisolak to end the statewide shutdown of casinos and non-essential businesses, which she calls \"total insanity.\"\n\n\"For heaven's sake,\" Goodman said at an April city council meeting, \"being closed is killing us already, and killing Las Vegas, our industry, our convention and tourism business that we have all worked so hard to build.\"\n\nSisolak has declined to give a date for when he'll start easing restrictions, saying the state has to see at least two weeks of declines in deaths and new cases, along with more widespread testing and tracking, with before he will start gradually easing rules.\n\nSisolak said in an interview on CNN Wednesday night that he didn't want workers to have to choose between their paycheck and their life and noted that the casino workers' union has reported 11 deaths among its ranks due to the virus.\n\n\"We will rebuild our economy. Las Vegas will continue to thrive. But I can't do that if I lose more people,\" he said.\n\nFor most people, the coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia, and death. The vast majority of people recover.\n\nMore: Coronavirus shutters Grand Canyon, San Diego Zoo, Six Flags, Eiffel Tower\n\nSo far, the casino closures are expected to extend at least into May, leaving workers like Kimberly Ireland struggling to find a way to hang on.\n\nThe 49-year-old was laid off from her job as a bell desk dispatcher at the Mirage casino-resort, where she worked for a decade.\n\nShe's living off her savings and the unemployment, and also supporting her adult daughter, who is on an unpaid maternity leave, and a new grandson, who was born days after the casinos were shuttered.\n\n\"Money is running out. It's getting low for the majority of us,\" she said.\n\nIreland said workers at her casino weren't given any guidance about when they'd be back or what it might be like then they return. For now, she doesn't think Las Vegas is ready.\n\n\"Everybody wants to get back to business. Everybody wants to get back to semi-normal,\" she said. \"I just don't think it's safe.\"\n\nVictor Chicas, a restaurant server in the Mandalay Bay casino-hotel, was facing foreclosure on his home before the virus shut down the city and the 54-year-old was laid off.\n\nHe immediately ended his cable and internet service to cut his expenses and drained his swimming pool to trim his electric bill. He's still waiting to find out if his home loan modification will be approved and if he'll get a chance to try to keep his house, while also supporting his sister and her two children, who immigrated to the U.S. from Guatemala.\n\n\"Now when we come back,\" he said, \"I'm going to be underwater.\"\n\nLike Ireland, said he wishes his employer would pay him through the shutdown but disagrees with the mayor's call to reopen Las Vegas.\n\n\"Life is more important than anything else,\" he said. \"You're not going to buy life with money.\"\n\nIf you're traveling between states, here's where you'll have to self-quarantine\n\nWhile about 24% of the state's workforce has filed for unemployment benefits since March 21, that doesn't include waves of others who haven't been able to get through the overburdened system. Nor does it include the self-employed and gig workers, who are newly eligible for benefits under a federal aid package that the state is scrambling to accommodate. Nevada officials say the state may not have a website ready for them to seek benefits until mid-May.\n\nThose who rely on the amusements of Las Vegas in non-traditional ways are trying to find a way to endure.\n\nWearing a white, rhinestone-studded jumpsuit, a thick black wig, a gold chain shining on his bare chest and sunglasses to match, Morehouse, the Elvis impersonator, has seized on the sunny weather and the restless locals visiting one of the few tourist attractions still open amid the COVID-19 outbreak--the iconic \"Welcome to Fabulous Las Vegas\" sign. He's brought a speaker to perform karaoke and a few cans of beer, which he sips as he sings and sways in the open-air park as people in groups of twos and threes still come up to take a photo with the sign.\n\nWhile foot traffic is light, Morehouse hopes he might lure curious drivers to pullover.\n\n\"They see an Elvis here. They think something's going on,\" he said. \"I'm like the sign.\"\n\nAt dusk falls and dim lights start glow, many locals slowly drive several miles of the Strip, with their car windows rolled down and phones raised to photograph and film America's most flamboyant party reduced to a vacant, muted spectacle, a post-apocalyptic remnant of a time before social distancing and stay-at-home orders, when excess and wild attractions were the main draw.\n\nBrandy Little, a 35-year-old economist and Las Vegas native, said she cried the first time she drove the empty Strip during the shutdown, knowing how devastating it is for the city.\n\n\"It wouldn't have been bad if we were only briefly in it,\" she said of the coronravirus. \"But the whole world is really being hit by it, and we rely on the world to come here and play. If they're hurting, they might not come and play.\"",

        "body": "Get ready, because if a Major League Baseball season is played this summer, it will look like nothing we've ever seen in the sport's history.\n\nGone will be the traditional exchange of lineup cards.\n\nThere will be no more bench-clearing brawls, or even hitters charging the mound, with fighting strictly prohibited.\n\nNo high-fives. No low-fives. No fist bumps. No spitting. No sunflower seeds. No chewing tobacco.\n\nPlayers will sit in the stands during games and stay six feet from one another in the dugouts.\n\nAnd bringing players back to their Little League roots, players will be asked to shower at home or in their hotel rooms on the road.\n\nThis is part of the draft health-and-safety proposal, the \"2020 Operations Manual,' from MLB to the Major League Baseball Players Association, and distributed Saturday to all of the players. This is just the first draft, which includes as many 10,000 COVID-19 tests conducted per week, which will be modified after consulting with the union, clubs and medical officials.\n\nIn this 67-page draft, the resumption of spring training would begin in mid-June, with teams having the option to stage it at their own home ballparks or at their spring-training sites in Arizona and Florida. The 82-game regular season would begin the first week of July.\n\nTEAM-BY-TEAM OUTLOOK: Will your MLB team be able to play at home?\n\n\"At first glance, I think it's very thorough,'' St. Louis Cardinals reliever Andrew Miller, who is on the union's executive subcommittee, said in a text to USA TODAY Sports. \"There is a lot of responsibility put on players and staff to do their part to avoid the virus. The vision for this season far different than any of ever of us ever imagined we would take part in.\n\n\"The challenge to socially distance from our teammates is especially daunting and sacrifices on how we prepare will be constant. I know the players' association is working right now to make sure nothing is overlooked.\n\n\"It will take time, but we will get it right.''\n\nYes, the responsibility to prevent the spread of the coronavirus pandemic is tremendous.\n\nThe proposal obtained by USA TODAY Sports, which was first reported by The Athletic, calls for daily multiple temperature screenings, including at home and on the road, before team members even coming to the stadium. There will be multiple COIVD-19 tests during the week given to the players, and even family members. The league will also offer free diagnostic and antibody/serology testing for healthcare workers or other first responders.\n\nThe proposal says that anyone who tests positive would be immediately quarantined. The player can return only after receiving two negative tests, showing no symptoms and being approved by team medical personnel. It also says that \"high-risk individuals'' have the option to opt out of playing.\n\nPlayers will be required to wear masks everywhere except the field and are prohibited from leaving the hotel on the road to frequent a restaurant, bar or even shop without receiving permission from team personnel. MLB is also prohibiting players from fraternizing or socializing with those on other teams before, during and after games, asking that they remain at least six feet from one another at all times.\n\n\"The careless actions of a single member of the team places the entire team (and their families) at risk, and teams should agree on their own off-field code of conduct for themselves and their family members,'' the document reads, \"to minimize the risk to the team.''\n\nMeanwhile, there would be three phases of a three-week spring training. It requires all players and support staff to undergo a screening within 72 hours of their report date, that will require a blood test, nasal swab or saliva and a temperature reading. Those who test negative after a 24- to 48-hour quarantine will be permitted to be in spring training while those who test positive would be placed in self-isolation until they twice test negative.\n\nPitchers and catchers will arrive first, then the positive players a few days later, and a limited number of exhibition games played. The workouts must be staggered throughout the day in small groups. Teams that choose to have spring training in Arizona and Florida will play those games between 7-9 p.m. local time because of the summer heat.\n\nThe proposal also limits the number of players and coaches and clubhouse staff on each team. There can be a maximum of 50 players, eight coaches, two bullpen catchers, two trainers, two team physicians and one strength and conditioning coach. They must use lockers situated six feet apart, while distancing themselves in the dugout.\n\nThe games will still have walk-up songs for the players, but there will be no out-of-town scores shown or replays since there will be no fans in attendance, anyways, at least at the outset.\n\nWhy, pitchers are even asked to bring their own rosin bag to the mound, with batters taking their own pine tar and batting donuts to and from the on-deck circle.\n\nSorry, there will be no batboys or batgirls to help.\n\nPlayers on opposing teams should not socialize, fraternize, or come within six feet of each other before the game, during warm-ups, in-between innings or after the game.\n\nWhen players are on the road, their freedom will be restricted. The only people permitted to visit players at their hotel are immediate family members. Socializing with friends or distant other family members is strongly discouraged.\n\nThe hotels on the road will be required to have a private entrance for the players or block off times when the players are leaving or entering the lobby. They will also request that all rooms are on lower-level floors to reduce the need for an elevator. And don't even think about using the hotel's pool, gym or sauna.\n\nIt's all wrapped up in 67 pages, complete with diagrams for social distancing recommendations, whether sitting in the dugout or organizing fielding practices.\n\nIt is daunting. Perhaps impractical to fully regulate. But then again, maybe completely necessary if there is going to be Major League Baseball this summer.",

        "body": "WASHINGTON - A member of Vice President Mike Pence's staff has tested positive for coronavirus, becoming the second administration aide this week to test positive for the disease just as the White House has sought to project a return to normalcy across America.\n\n\"There is a member of the vice president's team who is positive for coronavirus,\" White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany announced at a news briefing on Friday.\n\nMultiple media reports said the staffer who tested positive is Katie Miller, Pence's press secretary and the wife of Stephen Miller, a senior adviser to President Donald Trump known for his hard-line stance on immigration.\n\nAt the White House, Trump also identified the ill staffer as \"Katie\" during a roundtable discussion with congressional Republicans on Friday.\n\nThe aide tested positive as Pence was preparing to depart for Iowa, where he was to meet with faith leaders Friday to discuss reopening religious services to the public and to hold a roundtable discussion about securing the nation's food supply.\n\nA senior administration official told reporters traveling with Pence that the staffer tested positive Friday morning after testing negative the day before. The staffer had been in contact with six people scheduled to fly with Pence, the official said. Those staffers were removed from the plane, delaying Pence's departure from Joint Base Andrews in suburban Maryland for an hour.\n\n\"The person who tested positive was not on the plane and not scheduled to be on the trip,\" the official said.\n\nThe official said neither Pence nor President Donald Trump has had any recent contact with the staffer.\n\nThe news that one of Pence's aides tested positive for coronavirus comes just one day after the White House announced that a military valet to Trump had tested positive for the disease.\n\nTrump said Friday that the valet was in the same room with him on Tuesday, the day the Navy employee started exhibiting symptoms. But Trump said he does not recall any direct contact with the aide.\n\nThe White House has said that both Trump and Pence were tested for coronavirus and that both tests were negative. But Trump said his aides will now be tested for coronavirus daily instead of weekly.\n\nThe positive tests for the Pence aide and the military valet complicate the administration's efforts to project a return to normal life across the country amid the pandemic, which already has killed more than 76,000 Americans.\n\nThe White House has held several carefully orchestrated events in recent days to project the image of normalcy, including a series of Oval Office meetings between Trump and governors, nurses and business leaders.\n\nOn Tuesday, Trump traveled to Phoenix - his most extensive trip since the start of the pandemic - where he toured a Honeywell aerospace facility that makes respirator masks. Trump did not wear a face mask during the tour of the facility, despite a requirement that masks be worn on the site. Trump later told reporters he wore a mask briefly.",

    "Coronavirus: Norwegian Cruise Line lays out plan for its relaunch": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "The cruise line industry is caught between a rock wall and a hard place.\n\nNorwegian Cruise Line expects its entire fleet will be able to resume full operations in five to six months.\n\nThe cruise brand shared the news in its earnings report for the first quarter of 2020, which ended on March 31.\n\nFrank Del Rio, CEO of Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd., said that Norwegian is planning on carrying out a phased relaunch. He expects it will take up to six months to resume fleet-wide operations across Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings' 28 ships, which are spread across its three brands: flagship Norwegian Cruise Line, Oceania Cruises and Regent Seven Seas Cruises.\n\n\"Nothing will be more critical to resuming sustained and profitable long term operations than making cruising the safest option in (the) travel and leisure space and providing cruisers with peace of mind,\" Del Rio said on Thursday's earnings call.\n\nAll Norwegian Cruise Line cruises were suspended after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention imposed a 100-day no-sail order following outbreaks on ships belonging to multiple cruise lines. Both passengers and crew were infected and some vessels wereturned away from ports in several nations.\n\nPassengers on three Norwegian ships had symptoms or tested positive after their sailings, the CDC said.\n\nThe no-sail order - which was imposed April 15 - required cruise lines to cancel sailings through July 24.\n\nPassengers who had made a reservation on one of Norwegian Cruise Line's canceled sailings will receive a 125% or 150% future cruise credit, depending on the date of their trip. They can either use that credit through the end of 2022 or opt for a full refund, according to its website.\n\nCruisers who opt to rebook by Friday will receive an additional 20% discount on cruises scheduled between October 1 and December 31, 2022.\n\nAccording to the earnings report, as of May 11, just over half of the customers whose voyages were canceled had requested refunds.\n\nWhile Norwegian cruises are suspended through June 30, Del Rio said last week that he wasn't ready to say when they will sail again even if the CDC's no-sail order is allowed to expire.\n\nNorwegian is hoping to usher in a new era of cruising by taking a multi-faceted approach to setting back out to sea.\n\nIt will take time and require cooperation with government and health authorities - including the CDC. Del Rio said the first goal is to get the CDC to lift its no-sail order.\n\nHe wants to do \"everything humanly possible within the bounds of what technology offers today\" to be able to look his family members in the eyes and tell them that Norwegian's cruise ships are safe to board.\n\nHe said ships won't operate until that point, and when operations start to resume, it will be a gradual process that takes several months. \"We expect sailings to restart with a handful of vessels.\"\n\nDel Rio, who plans to relaunch roughly five ships per month, said more sailings will be added until the operations are fully back to normal.\n\n\"There will be fits and starts and it will require the implementation of new protocols as we learn what works,\" he added.\n\nOperations and itineraries are also contingent on which ports are open to receiving cruise ships.\n\nConsumer demand won't drive the timeline, Del Rio said; rather, the focus will be on the company's capability to resume operations.\n\nAnd does he expect full occupancy? No.\n\n\"I think it will take time to ramp up loads,\" he said. \"We don't know if government agencies will require us to sail at less than 100%, even if there was demand.\"\n\nNorwegian is consulting Scott Gottlieb, a former Food and Drug Administration commissioner, to develop its next level of health and safety standards before cruising resumes, according to the earnings report.\n\nIn an interview with USA TODAY last week, Del Rio detailed that cruise ship passengers may have to don masks, see fewer tables in the dining room and - fewer fellow guests aboard - when they eventually return to sea.\n\nAnd will that old cruise-ship standard, the self-serve buffet, be back?\n\n\"Likely not,\" Del Rio said.\n\nDespite the extra precautions, Del Rio says guests will have a great time once they return.\n\n\"All the basic elements cruising will always be there: the great value, the multiple destinations, the great dining,\" Del Rio said.\n\nCruise lines slow to issue refunds: Coronavirus 'dwarfs any disruption we've experienced'\n\nAccording to the earnings report, cruisers are still booking vacations with Norwegian, especially starting in the fourth quarter and through 2021.\n\nThe company is still taking reservations and deposits for future sailings scheduled in 2020, 2021 and 2022. Overall, the company's booked pricing and position for 2021 is \"within historical ranges,\" the report said.\n\nDuring the earnings call, Del Rio predicted there would be \"pent-up demand\" after the industry's four-month shutdown.\n\nJaime Katz, senior equity analyst for Morningstar, wrote in an analyst note Thursday that \"the majority of 2021 demand stems from new bookings, rather than canceled re-bookings,\" which indicates that customers are are not scared of cruising.\n\nThey expect to bounce back\n\nOne day after Norwegian warned of a cash crunch that threatened its future, its parent company said last week that it had lined up $2.2 billion in new financing that will carry it through the shutdown. By the time Thursday's earnings report was released, the company had boosted that figure to $2.4 billion.\n\nNorwegian Cruise Line: Gets rescue package a day after it warns of financial doom\n\nThe infusion of capital will keep the company afloat for another year and a half. It will still be able to relaunch operations even if it doesn't sail during that period, according to Del Rio.\n\nNorwegian CEO predicts:Cruising will 'bounce back very, very well'\n\nWhile major U.S.-based airlines were able to receive bailouts under the federal stimulus package, the largest cruise operators were shut out because they are registered in foreign countries - even if, like Norwegian, they have business offices in Miami. That has forced a scramble to line up investments to stay afloat.\n\nKatz said that given that all \"three majors\" - Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd., Royal Caribbean International and Carnival Corp. - have launched \"significant efforts to access liquidity\" to finance operations for the next year, the cruise lines are all looking to position themselves to survive.\n\n\"There's never been a full stop in cruising prior to this, so we think cruise companies have positioned themselves for a worst-case scenario,\" she said.\n\nDel Rio believes resuming service will be a different process for each cruise company. He's glad though, that at this time, his fleet is smaller.\n\n\"We feel like we will be one of the success stories that will write the history books on COVID-19 and we'll see where the chips fall for everyone else,\" he said.\n\nShould the cruise industry be bailed out? Maybe, say Florida leaders, but with hefty conditions",

    "Coronavirus: Nurse with COVID-19, a single mom, thought she was dying": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "LOUISVILLE - The day after Easter, Meghan Harpole was breathing 52 times a minute.\n\nThe assistant nurse manager sat on the edge of her bed, slipped on a pair of yoga pants and pulled a hoodie over her head. A hot shower hadn't helped the cough that seized her body in such a violent tear that she threw up.\n\nHer symptoms had started March 26. The next day she told her boss at a local emergency room that her arms were so heavy she felt exhausted.\n\nInitially, she'd had a fever and not much else.\n\nBut days three to 11 were a blur of high fevers, vomiting, diarrhea and such savage coughing that she crawled on the floor one night and asked her 13-year-old son, Gentry, to beat on her back. She was choking on her own phlegm.\n\n\"My body hurt so bad it felt like my bones were breaking,\" she said.\n\nMeghan, 43, vomited for three straight days and was so dehydrated an emergency room nurse -- a former co-worker -- came to her Louisville home to hook up an IV.\n\nShe clipped a portable pulse/oxygen monitor to her finger. It dipped to 91 but never below.\n\nMeghan sobbed on FaceTime with her brother's wife, Jackie Beckley. The pair had been best friends since Meghan was 16.\n\nJackie thought Meghan seemed lifeless, her skin gray. Meghan had a defeated look in her eyes.\n\nNursing friends checked on Meghan at all hours. They encouraged the power yoga enthusiast to do headstands so the infection would drain to the top of her lungs so she could cough it out.\n\n\"I thought I was going to die,\" she said.\n\nBy day 13 -- or maybe it was 16, she'd been sick for so long she couldn't be sure -- Gentry showed signs of the virus, too. Low-grade fever. Sore throat. Body aches.\n\nShe called his pediatrician.\n\nIt was too risky to bring him in for a test. He might infect other children. He likely had the virus, too, so he'd need to quarantine.\n\nGentry's symptoms didn't worsen the way Meghan's had. And her own symptoms seemed to ease.\n\nShe'd done everything she could to stay out of the hospital. She's a single mom. And since Gentry had the virus, too, no one could take care of him if she lay in a hospital bed.\n\nMeghan had signed legal papers with the state health department for court-ordered quarantine.\n\nSo, friends and family added grocery items to their Kroger Click Lists, dropped off meals on the front steps and later at the end of the sidewalk. Breakfast, lunch and dinner.\n\nThey called every day. Jackie and her daughter wrote uplifting messages in sidewalk chalk outside their front door.\n\nMeghan improved so much that she stopped checking her oxygen levels at home. She even did some yoga.\n\nBut by Easter weekend, the cough returned, mercilessly. And by that Monday she coughed so hard she threw up again.\n\nGentry urged her to check her oxygen level. So, in her yoga pants and hoodie, she clipped the pulse/oxygen monitor to her finger.\n\nShe couldn't believe what she saw.\n\n\"No,\" she said to herself. \"87% is hypoxic.\" Not enough oxygen in the body.\n\n\"All of a sudden I started seeing the patients I take care of and the patients on the news. They go in and get intubated.\n\n\"Oh my God, this is it. I may not make it. I may be on a ventilator. I may not be able to see my son for weeks.\"\n\nShe walked into the living room and told Gentry she had to go to the hospital -- 87% was dangerous.\n\nShe knelt to the ground.\n\n\"You know I love you,\" she told him. \"You're the best thing that's ever happened to me. And you're the best part of my story. So, I just need you to be real brave right now and know in your heart that everything is going to be OK.\"\n\nHe wasn't crying but looked at her with a puzzled, wide-eyed look.\n\n\"Mom, just promise me you're going to be OK,\" she heard him say.\n\nStaying Apart, Together: A newsletter about how to cope with the coronavirus pandemic\n\nSign up here to get Staying Apart, Together twice a week in your inboxes.\n\nWhat he didn't tell her was that he was worried she might die. And that if she was dying, he wasn't sure someone would bring him to see her.\n\nHe could tell she was scared but didn't let on.\n\nThey hugged and kissed goodbye, and as soon as Meghan shut the front door, she sobbed.\n\n\"I can't imagine being 13 and thinking my only person may die,\" she said. \"I just can't.\"\n\nShe called Jackie to let her know. They had a plan if Meghan was put on a ventilator. People would sign up to sit in the driveway so Gentry could see them from the front door -- every day until she got home.\n\n\"I realized the limitations I had and the support I could actually give,\" Jackie said. \"You know, it's strange. Normally you can hold someone's hand. You can take them to the hospital, and you could give that support.\n\n\"But you're on the phone, talking. Or you're looking at each other through FaceTime. And you're just numb. You don't know what to think or do. You're helpless.\"\n\nMeghan called her boss in the emergency department to let her know she was coming. They were ready when she arrived.\n\nNurses swarmed her room. They inserted an IV, ordered a chest X-ray and a breathing treatment and put her on oxygen. Meghan's levels rose.\n\nGentry called every half hour. The first time, he was elated she could still talk.\n\nBut he worried what the X-ray might show.\n\n\"We have lived in this city our entire lives,\" she told him. \"We have lots of people that love us. And everything is going to work out. I promise you.\n\n\"You've got to believe we are loved, that you're going to be taken care of and the people here who love me are going to take care of me. We're going to get through this.\"\n\nThe X-ray showed pneumonia in a small part of her lung.\n\n\"When people come in like this, they stay,\" Meghan heard the doctor say. \"Things can go bad.\"\n\nMeghan got emotional. If she stayed, no one could take care of her son. He was positive for the virus, too. And he was alone.\n\nMeghan stayed in the emergency room for five hours.\n\nThe doctor agreed to let her go home but warned her she might be back.\n\nShe went home with oxygen, breathing treatments and antibiotics.\n\nMeghan called Gentry from the car to let him know she was on her way home.\n\nMeghan set an alarm on her phone. For the first 24 hours she checked her oxygen level every 30 minutes.\n\n\"I was too scared not to,\" she said. \"I didn't want to leave my son a motherless child.\"\n\nShe didn't want him to find her dead.\n\nMeghan has been tested five times for the virus. Four have come back positive.\n\nShe's waiting for the results of the fifth.\n\nShe's lost 16 pounds and has just started to eat again. Gentry's symptoms have dissipated.\n\nAs a nurse for 21 years in emergency rooms in nine states, Meghan never once worried about protecting herself -- until the virus.\n\n\"I'm actually scared of the long-term effects,\" she said. \"Am I going to have asthma? Am I going to have problems breathing? Am I going to have a low immune system? No one knows enough about the virus to know the long-term effects of what this has done to me.\"\n\nMeghan is eager to get back to nursing. She will when she's well.\n\nShe's resting now and following her doctor's orders. This week, she felt well enough to argue with her teenage son about how many days it had been since he took a shower and how long he'd been playing his Xbox.\n\nIn fact, Meghan feels better than she has in a month.\n\nBut she's not taking any chances.",

        "body": "An Ohio man who came to the Washington, D.C., area to work as a nurse treating COVID-19 patients has been on a ventilator for almost a week after falling ill from the new coronavirus himself, his fianc\u00e9e says.\n\nMichael Rhodes left Columbus in April to help care for patients in D.C. after his small business, a company that works with commercial kitchens on fire prevention, slowed down amid restaurant closures under stay-at-home orders.\n\nRhodes, 46, is also a part-time nurse but wasn't guaranteed hours at his hospital in Ohio, his fianc\u00e9e Amber Wachenschwanz, who also works as a nurse, told NBC News. Forgoing pay from his small business and without sure work in the hospital, Rhodes knew he had to provide for his family while also helping fight the pandemic, Wachenschwanz told the network.\n\n\"He knew these hard-hit areas of the pandemic needed help and he could help,\" she said.\n\nSo Rhodes headed to the D.C. area, where there have been more than 3,000 deaths and 68,000 cases in the region, according to the Washington Post.\n\nRhodes worked on a non-coronavirus floor at a hospital in Prince George's County in Maryland, then took on hours at a makeshift hospital for COVID-19 patients, Wachenschwanz told NBC News.\n\n\"Working long hours on the COVID unit. Only a certain allowance of PPE. He was forced to wear a N95 for more shifts than he should and a gown for longer than safe. But taking care of these sick people, mostly elderly nursing home people needing constant turning and support, Michael gave full effort working long shifts sweating through the layers of PPE and totally exhausted and dehydrated at the end of the day,\" Wachenschwanz explained on Facebook.\n\nOne day, though, Rhodes began experiencing back pain.\n\n\"He went to a chiropractor because he thought it was maybe just from working long shifts,\" Wachenschwanz told NBC News.\n\nHowever, Rhodes woke up one night with a fever and eventually headed to the emergency room when he realized the extent of his symptoms, Wachenschwanz wrote on Facebook.\n\nLast week, after his symptoms had not improved, Rhodes was put on a ventilator. \"The (doctor) said Michael has done everything they've asked but his body is done fighting,\" Wachenschwanz wrote in a Facebook post.\n\nWachenschwanz said Rhodes continues to fight, but faces some complications as he has pulled out his breathing tube a few times. \"Our fighter, stubborn guy can't seem to leave that damn breathing tube,\" she wrote on Wednesday.\n\nOn Thursday, Wachenschwanz said Rhodes was improving: \"He's fully awake and grumpy. If you can imagine, he's been through hell. Tubes, tests, fighting to breathe and heal and then missing home terribly.\"\n\nThe mother of three said explaining Rhodes' illness to her children has been challenging.\n\n\"Their first thing to me was asking, 'Is Michael going to die?'\" Wachenschwanz told WCMH-TV. \"I had to explain to them he's very sick and the doctors are working very hard to get him better.\"\n\nHer twins, from a previous relationship, are 9 years old and understand the situation, she told the TV station. But her 2-year-old son, whom she had with Rhodes, just wants to see his father.\n\n\"He thinks about his dad all the time. He wants him home and so do I,\" Wachenschwanz told WCMH-TV in Columbus. \"It's not easy right now.\"\n\nTo help the family, one of Rhodes' friends started a GoFundMe, that has since raised $26,000 for the expected medical bills.\n\n\"Please keep praying! Let's hope for a better day. Thank you for your support,\" Wachenschwanz wrote on Facebook.",

        "body": "Jack Osbourne is sharing what life is like in coronavirus quarantine for his father Ozzy Osbourne.\n\nDuring an interview with Entertainment Tonight, Jack, 34, said the Black Sabbath frontman is \"doing pretty good\" amid the pandemic.\n\n\"He's a little depressed because he can't do anything. And he's fallen victim to watching the news all day,\" Jack added. \"I'm like, 'Dude, turn that crap off. (Watch) a little bit in the morning, a little bit at night. Get the, you know, the broad strokes. But let's unplug the IV of news right now.' \"\n\nJack also tried brining a bit of humor to the topic by referencing the story of his father once biting the head off of a bat during a 1982 concert. The CDC says the coronavirus has its origins in bats and might have jumped to humans through a \"wet market,\" or a live animal market, in Wuhan, China.\n\n\"Here's the thing, I am not letting a disease started by bats kill my dad. That's not how this is going, ok?\" he joked. \"This is not some giant revenge plot from bats to get my dad back.\"\n\nStaying Apart, Together: A newsletter about how to cope with the coronavirus pandemic\n\nJack said he's doing fine himself during the public health crisis as well.\n\n\"I'm doing great you know. Just been kind of keeping my head down and trying to stay as healthy as possible,\" he said. \"There's like this looming shadow of impending doom, and like, 'Oh my god, I can't believe this is happening.' But then I'm on a really good routine at home. I'm exercising everyday, I'm like being one of those (people). Trying to do good at home.\"\n\nEarlier this year, Ozzy revealed he was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease in a \"Good Morning America\" interview with his wife Sharon.\n\nAlthough fans have known Ozzy suffered from tremors and was diagnosed with Parkinson's symptoms in the early 2000s, the Prince of Darkness said he didn't find out about his diagnosis until 2019.\n\n\"I'm not good at secrets. I cannot walk around with it anymore,\" he said on \"GMA\" in January. \"I feel better now of owning up to the fact that I have a case of Parkinson's.\n\nContributing: Nicholas Wu\n\nMore: Ozzy Osbourne's darkest 'Ordinary Man' album lyrics: Filled with regret, death, drug havoc\n\nMore: Ozzy Osbourne's latest album 'Ordinary Man' is the first he's done 'completely sober'",

        "body": "A lack of personal protective equipment. Reductions in pay. Burnout.\n\nThose are among the challenges being faced by physician assistants during their ongoing frontline battle against the novel coronavirus, according to a survey released Tuesday by the American Academy of Physician Assistants. The survey took responses from 743 PAs over a 12-day period, according to the AAPA.\n\nAlmost 39% of respondents treating COVID-19 patients said they have gone without PPE. In one set of survey data, 3.6% of PAs said they've been infected with COVID-19.\n\nDr. Jonathan Sobel, senior administrative director of advanced clinical providers at North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset, New York, praised the versatile work of PAs, noting that 10% of survey respondents had changed practice settings.\n\nDespite FDA warnings: Trump says he's taking hydroxychloroquine, the drug he touted as coronavirus treatment\n\n\"PAs are trained, you know in this generalist model, and then we sort of differentiate out into the different areas we work so we're very flexible and adaptable to be able to go into those situations and so this was really the almost perfect use case for PAs,\" said Sobel, also a member of the AAPA board.\n\nThe AAPA noted: \"In most states, PAs are required to have and maintain a relationship with a specific physician in order to practice.\" Governors in Maine, Michigan, New Jersey, New York, Louisiana, South Dakota, Tennessee, and Virginia signed executive orders effectively waiving that restriction, according to the AAPA.\n\nSome PAs who answered the survey said the pandemic has impacted their employment status. Some were furloughed (22.1%) and others were terminated (3.1%). The majority (58.7%) said their hours were reduced, while 30.6% said their base pay was reduced.\n\n\"I think the survey is really vital because it shows that we're absolutely on the frontlines taking care of patients and that, in many areas, they were utilized in a way that helped the pandemic come under control,\" Sobel said.\n\nAre lockdowns being relaxed in my state? Here's how America is reopening amid the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nPAs also shared a fear for the health and safety of their families.\n\nMore than 650 of the nearly 700 practicing respondents to the question \"How worried are you about the health of you and your family?\" said they were at least \"slightly worried.\" The majority (43%) said they were \"somewhat worried.\"\n\nSome of the PAs who had clinically practiced in the last four months indicated they were feeling burnout. While the majority said they weren't feeling burnt out, 27.1% said they were feeling some symptoms - 2.5% said they \"often wonder if [they] can go on.\"\n\nDr. Tim McCall, the AAPA's associate director for surveys & analysis, said some of the survey results were surprising. McCall is also a faculty member at the School of Medicine and Health Sciences at George Washington University.\n\nMcCall pointed to the burnout -- or lack thereof.\n\n\"We're really surprised by, in a pleasant way, is that with PAs being on the frontlines, and this being a crisis that they're having to deal with, we're seeing similar rates of burnout to what we saw at this time last year,\" said McCall, adding that the AAPA will continue to monitor burnout in a follow-up survey in June.\n\nThe AAPA represents more than 131,000 PAs nationwide, according to its website.",

Mamas everywhere, you are doing amazing,\" she wrote.\n\nPink has been vocal about her and her 3-year-old son's coronavirus diagnoses after revealing they had exhibited symptoms in early April. She announced at the time she had donated a million dollars to relief efforts: $500,000 to the Temple University Hospital Emergency Fund in Philadelphia, where her mother worked for 18 years, and $500,000 to the City of Los Angeles Mayor's Emergency COVID-19 Crisis Fund.\n\nIn the column, Pink touched on her family's struggles with coronavirus, calling it the \" most physically and emotionally challenging experience I have gone through as a mother.\"\n\n\"Weeks after receiving our test results, my son was still ill and feverish,\" she added. \"It was a terrifying time, not knowing what might come next. But our story is not unique; there are mothers all over America, and the world, that are facing this same uncertainty every single day.\"\n\n'Really scary': Pink details coronavirus 'roller coaster' she and 3-year-old son face\n\nAnd she raised concerns for \"children and families around the world who are just beginning to know\" the effects of coronavirus,\" wondering if those families have the essential items to keep themselves safe and healthy.\n\n\"In many parts of the world it can take hours just to access water, and even then, soap may be an impossible luxury,\" she wrote. \"As we begin to envision what life will look like on the other side of this, we need to put ourselves in the shoes of moms around the globe and consider doing what we can to help keep their babies safe. How can we partake in ensuring their access to the basic human rights that so many of us are afforded each and every day?\"\n\nPink concluded: \"This Mother's Day, as you hold your babies tight, I encourage you to think about all the mamas around the world who still need our help... I know you would do anything to protect your own child, so let's make sure every mama has the same opportunity and resources to protect theirs.\"",

    "Coronavirus: Sewage can indicate virus spread before symptoms appear": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "A sample of wastewater awaits testing by researchers who are studying the evidence that COVID-19 can leave in human waste.\n\nIn hundreds of cities across the United States, monitoring systems now exist that scientists hope will provide an early warning if coronavirus infections reemerge as communities in some states cautiously reopen.\n\nThese monitors don't rely on testing patients or tracing contacts.\n\nAll that's required? Human waste.\n\nOver the past few months, private companies and university researchers have partnered with communities across the country to collect sewage at treatment plants and test it for the presence of the novel coronavirus. The results are reported back to municipal governments and state health officials to help them monitor the situation in their communities.\n\nTesting wastewater can reveal evidence of the coronavirus and show whether it's increasing or decreasing in a community, said Ian Pepper, a professor and co-director of the University of Arizona's Water and Energy Sustainable Technology Center, which is one of the group's tracking the virus through different municipal sewage systems.\n\nAlthough they cannot determine the exact number of COVID-19 cases from the wastewater, some researchers said they can estimate the potential case count based on the amount of genetic material detected, the number of customers per system and the volume of wastewater generated. They're continuing to improve upon those estimates with hopes of achieving greater accuracy.\n\nThey need a better understanding of \"how much virus is shed in the stool\" when someone is infected, said Newsha Ghaeli, president and co-founder of Biobot Analytics, a startup company formed by a group of researchers with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology that is heavily involved in the emerging science.\n\n\"As our understanding of this evolves, and as Biobot collects more and more data,\" Ghaeli said, \"our case estimates will be refined.\"\n\nWhen the novel coronavirus attacks a person's body, it leaves a trail of castoff genetic evidence that winds up in wastewater flushed from toilets across a community.\n\nScientists watched this spring as that evidence emerged at sewage treatment facilities in places like California, Florida, Massachusetts, Paris, Australia, and the Netherlands. By sampling the wastewater, researchers detected COVID-19 hot spots days, and sometimes weeks, before those cases appeared in hospital admissions data and clinical testing.\n\nSuch early detection -- the virus marks the body before or even without the development of physical symptoms like a fever or cough -- is aimed at helping communities better respond to the pandemic. Officials can issue stay-at-home orders to prevent further spread. Hospitals can stock and staff ahead of a wave of patients.\n\nThe information also can help local governments, many of which are now reporting declining COVID-19 case counts, spot the first signs of an anticipated autumn resurgence. And it can help them measure the effectiveness of their actions. In Paris, for example, the city's utility provider reported finding coronavirus particles in wastewater before the cases began to grow exponentially and then observed the quantities decrease as a result of the lockdown.\n\nPromising results from initial studies have since spawned widespread interest, and the science is now expanding to hundreds of public utilities across the United States through a collection of initiatives.\n\nMost prolific is Biobot Analytics, which previously worked with local governments to track the prevalence of opioid use through wastewater testing before shifting focus to COVID-19 earlier this year. Now it said it's monitoring wastewater data from 400 communities across 42 states.\n\nWith $6.7 million in seed money and collaborations with researchers at MIT, Harvard and Brigham and Women's Hospital, Biobot is providing the testing for free for now.\n\nThe company recently concluded that wastewater sampling in Massachusetts and Delaware indicated a bigger coronavirus outbreak than reported through hospital admissions and clinical testing. In New Castle County, Delaware, for example, the estimates were 15 times the laboratory-confirmed cases.\n\n\"This is a high level way of getting a quick snapshot of the scope of a virus in a community,\" Ghaeli said. \"We're hopeful this data becomes very useful in the long run, when we have opened up again, in determining the re-emergence of the virus.\"\n\nYour guide to COVID-19:What you need to know about the coronavirus\n\nThe sewage surveillance, in concert with clinical testing and reported cases, can give local officials a broad look at COVID-19 in the community, Ghaeli said. Biobot provides the numbers to participating utilities, which in turn provide the data to local officials and health departments, she said.\n\nAmong the participating utilities is the City of Albany, Oregon, which in early April started sharing with Biobot weekly samples of pre-treated sewage from the Albany-Millersburg Water Reclamation Facility.\n\nThe weekly sampling occurs alongside routine water testing, meaning little additional work for the staff, said David Gilbey, the city's environmental services manager. It costs about $120 a week for sample bottles and shipping, the city's website noted. Results usually come within a week, Gilbey said, and are shared with the county health department.\n\nThe research holds \"much promise,\" Gilbey said. So far, the community has seen declining coronavirus cases and things are starting to reopen, he said. But if the wastewater numbers increase, that information would help the utility and local governments \"get ready,\" whether that's adding more social distance measures or stockpiling more resources.\n\n\"It kind of gives us an idea of what we may be in for over the next couple of months,\" he said.\n\nAt the University of Arizona, Pepper chairs one of the many committees looking at how to handle the possible return of students to campus this fall. He said the university will sample the campus wastewater for at least a year to monitor coronavirus levels.\n\nAnd in Detroit, officials announced Monday they are refocusing a two-year-old study with Michigan State University to try to detect COVID-19 in the wastewater. The study was originally designed to see if they could track disease-causing viruses in the city's sewer system.\n\nSo far, city health officials said, the Detroit study found viruses in the sewer collection system about one to two weeks before those same viruses showed up in health departments data.\n\nBetween November 2017 and February 2018 and then again between October 2018 and March 2019, samples were collected weekly before treatment at Detroit's Water Resource Recovery Facility.\n\nScientists hope to promote development of a national wastewater surveillance network to monitor and respond to not just the coronavirus, but all kinds of infectious diseases, said Ghaeli and others.\n\nThey pointed to Israel, where a wastewater-based monitoring system for polio started in 1989. In 2013, when the surveillance indicated a polio outbreak was occurring, government officials swept in with polio vaccines and prevented any cases of paralysis.\n\nBut routine sampling for emerging viral diseases isn't yet standard practice at most wastewater treatment facilities. Ghaeli hopes it will become permanent and so prevalent that the information is routinely integrated into public health decision-making.\n\nMonitoring wastewater could be especially beneficial as an early warning in a \"micro context\" for example at nursing homes or care facilities, where the rapidly spreading coronavirus has been responsible for many deaths, concluded a group of researchers led by Gorka Orive, a biomedical researcher at the University of the Basque Country in Spain.\n\nEven in a larger context, such as a neighborhood or city, the information could help officials adopt more focused and balanced measures, including restricting movement in communities, the researchers wrote in a story to be published in the Elsevier journal, Science of the Total Environmental. Early warnings, the group wrote, could save lives.\n\nScientists have studied disease in sewage for years, said Kyle Bibby, an associate professor in civil and environmental engineering at Notre Dame. Researchers in Sweden two decades ago showed that a single infection in one person could be detected in the wastewater from 10,000 people.\n\nBut today, with the advances in genetic research and so many groups monitoring wastewater for the coronavirus, the science is moving very fast.\n\n\"Everyone is sort of learning as they go,\" Bibby said.\n\nBibby's team also is working with dozens of utilities. And the research groups are collaborating and sharing what they learn, he said.\n\nMore than a dozen research papers have been published, some in pre-print without full peer review, since the beginning of the year.\n\nAdditional research is planned.\n\n\"This is definitely a community effort,\" Bibby said, \"through a broad, scientific community.\"\n\nDinah Voyles Pulver is an investigative reporter and environment writer for the USA TODAY Network.

    "Coronavirus: Symptoms, masks, testing;  COVID-19 info keeps changing": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "Coronavirus has radically altered life in the United States at mind-bending speed in the past three months and our understanding of the virus is changing just as quickly.\n\nMore than 2.5 million cases have been confirmed worldwide, and the U.S. has reported more than any other nation. A large portion of the country now lives under stay-at-home orders, plaguing the economy and causing millions of Americans to lose their jobs.\n\nAt the same time, public health officials are often adjusting policies as new research reveals more about the virus and its symptoms. It's happening at a pace that can be bewildering and confusing to the average person.\n\nTo help you keep up with all the changes, here's a running list of what we know about the new coronavirus and the illness it causes, COVID-19:\n\nPresident Donald Trump announced the first coronavirus fatality on February 29, but California officials later announced coronavirus fatalities which occurred weeks earlier.\n\nThe medical examiner in Santa Clara County, southeast of San Francisco, said April 21 that autopsies on the bodies of two people who died Feb. 6 and Feb. 17 showed they were positive for the virus.\n\nThe victims \"died at home during a time when very limited testing was available only through the CDC,\" Dr. Michelle Jorden said in a statement. She said criteria set by the CDC at the time restricted testing to only individuals with a known travel history and who sought medical care for specific symptoms.\n\nFor months, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention urged the mass public not to wear a mask unless they were sick or caring for a COVID-19 patient, citing concerns about supply and effectiveness.\n\nThen they reversed this guidance in early April.\n\nNow, the CDC recommends people wear homemade or cloth masks in public. The agency says the mask should fit snugly against the face, be secured with ties or ear loops, include multiple layers of fabric and be laundered after every use.\n\nThe new guidance came after research suggested that presymptomatic and asymptomatic carriers were able to transmit the virus and infect healthy people.\n\nOfficials recommend wearing these masks in public settings where social distancing measures are difficult to maintain, such as grocery stores and pharmacies. Many cities and states require masks in public, including New York, New Jersey and Los Angeles.\n\nWhen the World Health Organization and the CDC first warned about the new coronavirus, they urged the public to be on the lookout for these three main symptoms: fever, dry cough and difficulty breathing.\n\nThere were some reports of gastrointestinal issues, such as diarrhea, but these symptoms appeared to be rare.\n\nSince then doctors have been able to identify more symptoms in patients.\n\nA loss of smell or taste may be an unassuming symptom of COVID-19, medical groups representing ear, nose and throat specialists have warned. Anosmia is the loss of smell while dysgeusia is an altered sense of taste.\n\nSouth Korea, China and Italy have all reported \"significant numbers\" of known COVID-19 patients with lost or reduced sense of smell, according to a joint statement by Claire Hopkins, president of the British Rhinological Society, and Nirmal Kumar, president of ENT UK.\n\n\"In Germany it is reported that more than 2 in 3 confirmed cases have anosmia. In South Korea, where testing has been more widespread, 30% of patients testing positive have had anosmia as their major presenting symptom in otherwise mild cases,\" they wrote.\n\nAnother more recent symptom accumulating more anecdotal evidence has been informally called \"COVID toes.\" It's the presence of purple or blue lesions on a patient's feet and toes, most commonly appearing in children and young adults.\n\nWhile experts can't pinpoint the condition, some have hypothesized that it could be excess inflammation, a clotting of blood vessels or a thrombotic disorder known as purpura fulminans.\n\nBefore the coronavirus was declared a pandemic, experts noted that coronavirus cases were incomparable to this season's influenza impact.\n\n\"Everybody is being cautious because we're still learning about it, but right now you're sitting in the midst of an influenza seasonal busy-ness,\" said Dr. David Hooper, chief of the Infection Control Unit at Massachusetts General Hospital, in late January.\n\n\"The risk is much higher for influenza for people in the U.S. than this new coronavirus.\"\n\nUSA TODAY investigation: Coronavirus at meat packing plants worse than first thought\n\nUS reopening: What states are relaxing social distancing restrictions and moving away from lockdowns?\n\nHowever, that quickly changed as COVID-19 spread rapidly and fatality rates surpassed those seen typically seen in the seasonal flu.\n\nIn a March 3 teleconference, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said that globally the seasonal flu kills far less than 1% of those infected while about 3.4% of reported COVID-19 cases have died.\n\nEven that fatality rate is uncertain and varies between countries, although most nations report a death rate significantly higher than the flu. In the U.S., limited testing has made it difficult to determine an accurate number.",

    "Coronavirus: Temperature checks coming to the airport": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "Air travelers are likely to see yet another change when they start flying again: A pre-boarding temperature check.\n\nSuch screenings could become standard as a tool to prevent the spread of the coronavirus, along with face masks, hand sanitizer and disinfectant wipes.\n\nAnd no, it won't be like visiting a doctor who sticks a thermometer in your mouth. Instead, the screener likely won't touch you at all, using either a thermal camera or a infrared thermometer held a few inches from your forehead.\n\nThe airlines are in favor of temperature checks. At least two North American carriers (Frontier and Air Canada) and one airport (Paine Field in Washington State) have already taken the initiative. However, most want the federal government - specifically, the Transportation Security Administration or U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention - to be responsible for carrying them out.\n\n\"We're urging the TSA to begin temperature scans as part of the screening process at the checkpoints,\" Gary Kelly, CEO of Southwest Airlines, the nation's largest domestic carrier, told CBS News. He believes that is the most logical place to check temperatures since all fliers must pass through that area.\n\nIn an interview with CNBC, he added, \"We'll need to work with the federal government in terms of screening customers to make sure, for example, that you don't have someone getting on the airplane that has a fever,'' he said. \"I think that that's going to be very important.''\n\nThe trade organization for U.S. and Canadian airports also wants the federal government to conduct the screenings.\n\nSouthwest CEO: TSA should check passenger temperatures amid coronavirus pandemic\n\nOn Tuesday, the Airports Council International-North America said that any health screening, should be \"performed by federal government officials, and minimize the impact on airport operations.\"\n\nThe Airports Council also asked the federal government to adopt guidelines for passengers to wear face coverings in airports. (Right now, the decision on whether to require masks is up to the individual carriers, although once the first did, others followed suit almost immediately.)\n\nThe new normal? US airlines announce requirements for passengers to wear face masks\n\nNeither the TSA nor the CDC has indicated any plans to take on that responsibility or when they might start. Even if they do, there is debate about whether checking for fevers has much impact on keeping sick people from boarding planes or from entering the country. After all, temperature scans done on travelers entering the country from China and Europe seemingly did little to slow the spread of COVID-19.\n\nTimeline: How COVID-19 has unfolded in the US\n\nLast week, after learning the White House was weighing re-implementing temperature checks at U.S. airports, the CDC's director of global mitigation and quarantine, urged TSA's parent agency, the Department of Homeland Security, to reconsider the idea, saying it was ineffective the first time they tried it, prior to the travel bans on China and Europe.\n\n\"Thermal scanning as proposed is a poorly designed control and detection strategy as we have learned very clearly,\" \u202fDr. Martin \u202fCetron wrote in an Thursday email to Department of Homeland Security officials obtained by USA TODAY. \"We should be concentrating our CDC resources where there is impact and a probability of mission success.\"\n\nAccordingly, Cetron asked that the CDC not be assigned temperature-screening duty again.\n\nIn a report released on Monday, the CDC concluded that the screenings were not effective because people can have the coronavirus and show no symptoms. Furthermore, a study published in the journal \"Nature\" also found that carriers may be most contagious a day or two before becoming symptomatic.\n\nStudy: COVID-19 patients may be most contagious one to two days before symptoms appear\n\n\"The benefits of screening for case detection at the airport might be limited for a respiratory disease with the potential for presymptomatic and asymptomatic transmission,\" the CDC reported.\n\nAnother issue: What happens to the data? The CDC report concluded that monitoring travelers would be labor-intensive for public health officials.\n\nLawrence Gostin, a professor of global health law at Georgetown University, called it \"a logistical nightmare.\"\n\n\"Even if the CDC had the resources, the information would need to go somewhere,\" he said. \"All the evidence that we have suggests that is has little or marginal effectiveness.\"\n\nIn spite of skepticism from the CDC, White House chief of staff Mark Meadows pressed ahead last week, directing the DHS to announce the airport screenings, which would be visible and aimed at instilling confidence in travelers, according to meeting notes obtained by USA TODAY.\n\nPassengers with fevers, Meadows said, would be referred to the CDC for clearance. However, the full plan has not been finalized. (Judd Deere, a White House spokesman, did not answer questions about the airport screening proposal.)\n\nRegardless of who ends up holding the thermometer, it seems that temperature checks will become a routine part of the process of checking in for a flight.\n\nIn some cases, it already is. Air Canada will require temperature checks starting Friday. On June 1, Frontier Airlines will become the first U.S. carrier to require them. Anyone who registers a temperature of 100.4\u2109 or above two times on the same day will not be allowed to board, including passengers and employees.\n\nFrontier goes first: Airlines becomes first U.S. carrier to announce passenger temperature checks\n\n\"Temperature screenings add an additional layer of protection for everyone onboard,\" said Frontier Airlines CEO Barry Biffle in a statement.",

    "Coronavirus: Testing in prisons reveals hidden asymptomatic infections": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "WASHINGTON - There have been much worse outbreaks during this pandemic. But 39 inmates testing positive for the coronavirus at the Neuse state prison in Goldsboro, North Carolina, was still cause for alarm.\n\nOf the more than 50 detention centers across the state, none had more infections at the time than Neuse, prompting officials to take the extraordinary step of testing all 700 prisoners at the medium security facility near Raleigh.\n\nWithin a week, infections had surged to 444. Perhaps even more revealing: More than 90% of the newly diagnosed inmates displayed no symptoms, meaning that the deadly virus could have remained hidden had the state followed federal guidelines that largely reserve testing for people displaying common symptoms, such as fever and respiratory distress.\n\n\"We would never have known,\" North Carolina Department of Public Safety spokesman John Bull said.\n\n'It gets more frightening':As coronavirus surges in prisons, families of elderly inmates wait in fear\n\nOutbreak: Hundreds of infected, quarantined inmates in prisons and jails challenging officials\n\nEven as vulnerable prison systems have ramped up scrutiny of inmates and staffers with broad quarantines and elaborate contact tracing investigations, increased testing is proving just as crucial in assessing the virus' spread within detention systems as it is in the free world.\n\nMass testing at three state prisons in Ohio has yielded results similar to North Carolina's, with officials suggesting that the strategy and findings could have broad implications, not just for containing outbreaks in detention centers but in making larger decisions about when states should re-open for business and loosen social distancing restrictions.\n\nThe federal Bureau of Prisons, the largest detention system in the country, has announced that it, too, is expanding testing for asymptomatic inmates in an attempt to control the spread of the virus that has so far infected nearly 1,000 inmates and staffers and claimed the lives of 24 prisoners.\n\nTesting capacity has been the central focus of many governors as they weigh when and how they will re-emerge from near total lockdowns prompted by the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nOhio Gov. Mike DeWine, who recently won approval from the federal Food and Drug Administration for use of a compound that can identify the virus in test samples, also has formed a special working group to find reliable sources of testing supplies.\n\nThe broader testing in prisons, however, has already produced striking findings.\n\n\"While we know coronavirus does pose a specific threat to congregate settings,\" DeWine said, referring to the prison testing, \"this comprehensive testing will give us insight on both how to best coordinate response at these facilities, as well as data and insight on how comprehensive testing within a cohort will affect testing numbers.\"\n\nLeonard Rubenstein, a professor at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, said the broader testing in detention centers where small cells and densely packed dormitories make social distancing directives nearly impossible to maintain underscores the need for testing beyond prison walls.\n\n\"Unless you do universal testing in all environments, the risk of spread is enormous,\" Rubenstein said. \"If you are waiting for symptoms to emerge before you do the testing, you are getting a false picture of what is going on. ... It's too late.\"\n\nOhio was among the first prison systems in the country to launch a mass testing program aimed at diagnosing the scope of infection at three virus-plagued prisons, including Marion Correctional Institution, which has contained the largest number of infections of any prison in the country - now at more than 2,000.\n\nAs expected, the universal testing yielded more infections, including a large contingent of asymptomatic inmates.\n\nIn one dormitory at Marion, officials said that of 152 prisoners tested, 39% tested positive for COVID-19 even though they displayed no symptoms, prison officials said.\n\nOhio has reported 3,762 total inmate infections and nine confirmed deaths while more than 28,000 of the state's 50,000 inmates were in some form of quarantine. By comparison, at least 620 of the more than 140,000 inmates in the federal Bureau of Prisons have tested positive, while 357 staffers have been infected.\n\nDeWine said the state numbers \"did not necessarily indicate a new problem at these facilities, but simply wider testing.\"\n\nStill, DeWine spokesman Dan Tierney said that the asymptomatic infections are striking and underscore the need for wider intelligence.\n\n\"Testing is going to be key for the recovery phase,\" Tierney said. \"We have been working hard to acquire more testing capacity.\"\n\nIn North Carolina, officials are considering a broader prison testing regime after learning this week that the virus had spread throughout the Neuse facility, largely undercover and without producing the tell-tale symptoms of fever, respiratory distress, muscle aches, cough, chills or the loss of taste and smell.\n\nSuspicions first peaked earlier this month when infection numbers involving symptomatic inmates began to mount at the facility.\n\n\"There was a feeling that we really needed to know more,\" Bull said. \"The interest was clear.\"\n\nTesting of the entire facility began last Thursday and ran through the weekend.\n\n\"I think we were very shocked to discover how many more had this virus,\" Bull said, adding that testing also was offered to all of the facility's 250 staffers. At least 22 have tested positive so far.\n\nThe results were so jarring that state authorities earlier this week announced the temporary closure of the nearby Johnston Correctional Institution and moved all 600 inmates to other facilities so staffers could help colleagues at the troubled Neuse prison.\n\n\"The staff at Neuse have been working in the toughest conditions, for weeks on end, and desperately needed support,\" North Carolina prisons Commissioner Todd Ishee said. \"They are owed everyone's thanks for their commitment to serving the public, standing tall in their daily responsibilities and helping ensure safety of their co-workers and those in custody.\"\n\nWith some test results still pending at Neuse, Bull said there have been \"discussions\" about expanding testing across the system to account for the so far unknown number of asymptomatic inmates who could be carrying the virus.\n\n\"So far, there have been plenty of discussions, but no firm path,\" Bull said. \"Nobody's confronted anything like COVID-19. This is a significant challenge for a prison population, which is a difficult environment on a good day. These have not been good days.\"\n\nConcern for the overall health of the Neuse facility has spilled into the broader North Carolina community of Wayne County, where a number of prison staffers live.\n\n\"We are all concerned,\" Wayne County spokesman Joel Gilley said. \"But we need more testing across the country; it's not just an issue for Wayne County.\"\n\nSo far, the overwhelming majority of the 572 infections in the county are the 458 cases inside the prison. Gilley said the staffers are quarantined in their homes, limiting the contact with other local residents.\n\nThere are regular conference calls, linking local officials with prison authorities for updates on the virus' spread.\n\n\"We want to make sure we are prepared,\" Gilley said.\n\nYet there are sad reminders that the threat is strikingly close to home.\n\nGilley said six local residents, all elderly with underlying health complications, have succumbed to virus so far.",

        "authors": [],
        "body": "CINCINNATI - Doug Hicks used to say he didn't get sick. Cold bugs. Flu season. None of it fazed him. His kids might get sick. His wife might get sick. Not him.\n\nUntil last month, the 33-year-old autoworker from St. Bernard, Ohio, had a hard time remembering the last time he'd caught anything but a pass in the football league he plays in.\n\nFew people are. The virus is a terrifyingly efficient marvel of evolution, built to spread easily from person to person, then settle in for a long stay.\n\nSometimes, the host barely knows it's there, allowing the virus to more easily travel and meet new hosts. Sometimes, the host can't get out of bed for days or weeks. On rare occasions, the host dies from all the damage the virus has done.\n\nWhy does the novel coronavirus do these things? It's a question that occurred to Hicks and his wife, Sheena, more than once as they endured three weeks of misery from the middle of March to early April.\n\nTo find an answer, the Cincinnati Enquirer asked Doug and Sheena to describe their symptoms and then asked an infectious disease specialist to explain what was happening to them and why.\n\nA warning: Like Doug, you might not be prepared for this. It's not a tale for the squeamish.\n\nSheena appears to have been the first to encounter the virus. It could've happened at her job at a call center or while visiting bars during a pre-St. Patrick's Day pub crawl. The location might matter to scientists tracking the pandemic, but it doesn't matter to the virus. Some public health experts say contact tracing is a key strategy in stopping the spread of the virus.\n\nDr. Carl Fichtenbaum is a professor and infectious disease specialist at the University of Cincinnati. He says the virus is spread when an infected person expels tiny droplets from the mouth, throat or lungs, usually during a cough or sneeze.\n\nThe virus can live for hours or for more than a day, depending on the surface and temperature, just waiting for someone new, like Sheena, to come along. Once she touched a droplet and then touched her face, the virus would have been well on its way to finding a home in her nose or throat.\n\nAt this point, Sheena wouldn't have felt any symptoms. But the virus was getting to work.\n\nIt can take two to 14 days for a person to develop symptoms after initial exposure to the virus, according to Dr. Martin S. Hirsch, senior physician in the Infectious Diseases Services at Massachusetts General Hospital. The average is about five days.\n\nThe coronavirus wastes no time. Within hours, it begins burrowing into the cells that line the nose and throat, which have receptors that allow the virus to attach and begin replicating. Soon, it's making billions of copies.\n\n\"Viruses need something else's machinery to help generate them,\" Fichtenbaum says. \"They're what we call a parasite.\"\n\nSheena might not have noticed this for days, or even weeks. Eventually, though, she got a scratch in her throat and a dry cough, the first sign of the body's immune response to the virus. Then she lost her sense of smell, a tell-tale sign the novel coronavirus had arrived.\n\nThe American Academy of Otolaryngology - Head and Neck Surgery said anosmia and dysgeusia are symptoms associated with COVID-19. Anosmia is the loss of smell while dysgeusia is an altered sense of taste.\n\nFichtenbaum says scientists haven't figured out yet why it happens, but the virus somehow interferes with the olfactory nerve, which transmits sensory data to the brain and is responsible for the sense of smell.\n\nThis is when Sheena started to worry she had COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus. She told Doug to stay away from her and started spraying bleach all over the bathroom.\n\n\"It smells like a swimming pool in here,\" Doug told her. Sheena couldn't smell a thing.\n\nBy then, it already was too late for Doug. The virus was going to work on him, too. He just didn't know it yet.\n\nWithin a week or two, the virus would have been churning out copies of itself at an incredible clip. And Sheena and Doug's immune systems would have shifted into overdrive.\n\nSheena's cough and runny nose? That was the immune system attacking the virus, causing tissue to swell and ache, and causing infected cells to slough off.\n\nDoug's headache and blazing fever? That's the body heating up to kill the invaders.\n\nThe full-body aches and fatigue they both felt for days? That's the collateral damage of the invisible war between the immune system and the virus. Turns out, battling billions of tiny microbes is exhausting.\n\n\"I felt like I got hit by a train,\" Doug says.\n\nFichtenbaum says the immune system was doing what it was built to do: protect the body. The problem, he says, is that sometimes the immune response can be so strong it does harm to the body it's supposed to be saving. This happens most often with a new invader, one the immune system doesn't recognize and attacks aggressively.\n\nIt's like carpet-bombing a big city in wartime. It might kill the enemy, but it wipes out a high percentage of the civilian population, too.\n\nThis is when things get particularly frightening with the coronavirus. The virus is happy in the mouth, nose and throat, but it really seems to thrive in lung tissue. And if it gets a foothold there, look out.\n\n\"It seems the kind of receptors this virus likes are in the lower lung,\" Fichtenbaum says. \"When it finds those things, it really does go crazy.\"\n\nDoug says he didn't have severe breathing trouble, but Sheena struggled so much she thought she might end up in the hospital.\n\n\"It was kind of hard to breathe,\" she says. \"That was scary.\"\n\nStaying Apart, Together: A newsletter about how to cope with the coronavirus pandemic\n\nSign up here to get Staying Apart, Together twice a week in your inboxes.\n\nThousands of COVID-19 patients do go to the hospital and some deteriorate so quickly they must be placed on ventilators to keep them breathing. The problem, again, is twofold: The virus is destroying cells and the immune system is attacking the virus.\n\nThe result can be bronchitis or, worse, pneumonia that fills the lungs with fluid and interferes with the body's ability to get oxygen to the blood.\n\nThis is the tipping point for the most seriously ill COVID-19 patients. Most endure the assault and begin to recover, but a minority don't. Their lungs essentially stop working.\n\nSheena and Doug never got to that point. By the first week of April, Doug's fever had broken and Sheena's breathing had improved.\n\nBut nothing about the coronavirus is easy, so the recovery has been a challenge. Doug bounced back faster and was cleared to go back to work a few days ago. Sheena is working again, albeit from home now like so many others, but she still doesn't feel right.\n\n\"I still don't feel all the way back to normal,\" she says. \"I can't explain it.\"\n\nFichtenbaum can. The doctor says Sheena, like anyone who's had a full-blown case of COVID-19, has been through the ringer and needs time to recover.\n\nSpecial cells in the body move into the former battleground areas and, essentially, start cleaning up the debris so new, healthy cells can generate. The recovery is underway, but the body still isn't what it was before it met the coronavirus.\n\n\"Your body has done a good job,\" Fichtenbaum says. \"The repair process begins, and that takes time.\"",

    "Coronavirus: Ticket refunds won't happen for many postponed concerts": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "A number of Americans are stuck with tickets to concerts that have been postponed indefinitely due to the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nGetting a refund has proven difficult in many cases.\n\nThat's because most major ticket sellers' policies differentiate between events that have been canceled and those that have been postponed.\n\nCanceled? Sure, you can get your cash back, often automatically. New Jersey rockers Bon Jovi, for instance, canceled their entire 2020 tour Monday, in an effort to help ticketholders \"pay their bills or buy groceries,\" the band said in a statement.\n\nBut postponed, even if a new date hasn't been set? The answer tends to be \"no.\" It's left fans fuming as the continuing crisis forces A-listers like the Rolling Stones, Elton John, Taylor Swift, Madonna, Kelly Clarkson, Cher and Jason Aldean to cancel or postpone their shows.\n\nJeni Garcia is one of the lucky ones. She had tickets to a Keane show on March 15 in Austin, Texas, that were automatically refunded when the show was canceled. Her tickets to a Glass Animals show in San Antonio, though, haven't been refunded because the concert is classified as postponed.\n\n\"I'm really not sure when I will feel comfortable attending a show again,\" she says. \"It will depend on the availability of a treatment and vaccine for COVID-19, as well as the trajectory of cases.\"\n\nCoronavirus fallout: Taylor Swift cancels all upcoming 2020 concerts, live appearances amid pandemic\n\nTicketmaster, in particular, has been taking heat, with some online posters claiming the company altered its policies because of coronavirus. (In a statement to USA TODAY, Ticketmaster said although it recently clarified the language used in the policy, the basics remain the same.)\n\nIn response to the criticism, Ticketmaster's parent company, Live Nation, announced an initiative Friday that will give ticketholders 30 days to request a refund once their postponed show sets a new date. If they don't want a refund, their tickets will still be good for the rescheduled show.\n\nThe new policy, which begins May 1, also gives fans the option to receive credit they can use for future tickets, or to donate tickets to healthcare workers.\n\nLive Nation's rival AEG Presents announced a similar 30-day refund program last week, also starting May 1.\n\nIn most cases, there's no set limit on how long organizers have to decide whether they're going to cancel or reschedule a concert. If a person can't attend a rescheduled show, Ticketmaster's website suggests selling the tickets via a resale site.\n\nEventbrite, another major ticket seller, suggests contacting event organizers directly for details on potential refunds for postponed shows and events. Organizers are expected to reply to inquiries within a week, according to Eventbrite's site.\n\n'I Dare You': In the middle of a pandemic, Kelly Clarkson wants you to love\n\nBut fans are finding it difficult to sell their expensive concert tickets when new dates and other details are scarce.\n\nAndrew Doebler is one of those stuck with tickets to a rescheduled event he can't attend. He says he spent $1,300 for two tickets and a tent at Bonnaroo.\n\nBonnaroo, on its website, says refunds are available \"in the event of a full cancellation,\" but the Tennessee music and arts festival wasn't canceled. Instead, it was pushed from June to September.\n\n\"I cannot attend Bonnaroo in late September because of prior commitments and would not have purchased the tickets and tent rental,\" Doebler says. \"I have lost my job in the wake of this craziness of COVID-19, and could really use my money.\"\n\nVenues have been scrambling to find new dates for shows they'd booked months or even years in advance, says Colleen Fischer, director of booking for the Austin City Limits Live venue, home of PBS's \"Austin City Limits\" TV show and countless other performances.\n\n\"The process of moving six or seven months' worth of concerts and corporate events has been daunting,\" she says. \"Calendar management is always a puzzle, but this pandemic has taken it to a whole new level.\"\n\nCoronavirus quarantine: 100 things to do while stuck inside due to a pandemic\n\nA lot of money is on the line for performers, promoters and venues, which could explain why refunds are hard to get. With concerts expected to be delayed or canceled into the summer, the industry is looking at a minimum projected loss of $10 billion, according to Dave Brooks, Billboard's senior director of live and touring. If the shutdown extends into 2021, it would be even more catastrophic.\n\n\"Like the airline industry, hotels, restaurants and any business where people celebrate in groups, the concert industry has been hit extremely hard by the coronavirus,\" he says.\n\n\"There's no income being generated for venues, artists or the hundreds of thousands of men and women who work in the events business, from talent agents and promoters all the way down to food service employees, ushers and security guards. Tens of thousands of people are out of work right now.\"\n\nAtticus Lite, who photographs concerts for a living, is one of those affected by the shutdown. The past few weeks have been overwhelming, Lite says.\n\n\"Everything is so uncertain at this point and reading articles as time passes is like reading symptoms on the internet when you're sick,\" Lite says. \"I've read that concerts might not return until fall 2021. I've read the six-foot rule might take us all the way through 2022, even if the world 'opens back up.'\n\n\"I have just a toe in the music industry and that's an entire business that I worry about during this pandemic,\" he says.\n\nStaying Apart, Together: A newsletter about how to cope with the coronavirus pandemic\n\nNikki Cali, who lives in Modesto, California, is one of many who've tried unsuccessfully to get money back for tickets purchased via Ticketmaster. She and a group of friends each have seats for a postponed Justin Bieber show.\n\n\"We all talked about whether or not we should get the tickets refunded or wait it out,\" she says. \"We came to the same agreement, let's just get (a refund).\"\n\nTheir hopes of a refund quickly vanished, though, after several back-and-forths with Ticketmaster representatives, she says.\n\nTickets to the show cost $250 each, Cali said. That's cash she could desperately use.\n\n\"That money would make all the difference right now,\" she says. \"Look at the circumstances. We've all lost our jobs, unemployment hardly covers our bills, and we have tickets for a show that is indefinitely postponed? It's madness.\"\n\nAs a Christmas gift, Scott Radcliffe got tickets from his wife to see the Avett Brothers at the Germania Insurance Amphitheater in Austin. The show, initially set for April 30, has now been pushed to June.\n\nBut Radcliffe suspects it may get bumped back again. He and his wife haven't requested a refund - yet - saying they're \"waiting things out to a degree.\"\n\nIf the show goes on as planned in June, will he attend?\n\n\"Hard to say, really,\" he says. \"If it would have held to the date in April, I can pretty safely say 'no,' we wouldn't be comfortable, but things are changing so fast that it's possible ... though I'm not sure we would even then.\"\n\nIf you paid with a credit card and a refund isn't being offered by your ticket seller, you could try to have your bank initiate a chargeback, says Billboard's Brooks. There's a chance, though, that the company you bought the tickets from could contest.\n\n\"Consumers will have to be patient as this complicated web gets untangled,\" he says.\n\nWhatever the outcome, don't settle for less money than you paid, Brooks cautions. If you're having trouble, he suggests contacting your state's consumer protection office.\n\nContributing: Charles Trepany, USA TODAY\n\nViral video: See high school's 'virtual choir' sing Belinda Carlisle's 'Heaven Is A Place on Earth' in quarantine",

        "authors": [],
        "body": "Tom Hanks is lifting the curtain on his and wife Rita Wilson's battle with the coronavirus that sent out global shock waves as they became the first celebrity couple to test positive for the disease last month.\n\nSpeaking during a Sunday interview with National Defense Radio Show, Hanks, 63, said he had \"some body aches and was very fatigued\" during medical isolation in the air-pressurized room of an Australian hospital. Wilson, 63, his wife of 32 years, had more serious symptoms.\n\n\"Rita went through a tougher time than I did,\" Hanks said. \"She had a much higher fever and she had some other symptoms. She lost her sense of taste and smell. She got absolutely no joy from food for a better part of three weeks.\"\n\nHanks said Wilson's condition, and side-effects from the anti-malaria drug hydroxychloroquine administered for her high fever, led to powerful bouts of nausea.\n\nMore: Tom Hanks and Rita Wilson are back in the U.S. after coronavirus diagnoses\n\n\"She was so nauseous she had to crawl on the floor from the bed to the facilities,\" said Hanks, \"and it lasted a while.\"\n\nHanks recalled attempting do a regular routine of sit-ups, stretches and floor exercises in the hospital.\n\n\"I was wiped after 12 minutes. I laid down in my hospital bed and just slept,\" said Hanks.\n\nAfter a member of the medical team came to check on him, he recalled, \"I said, 'I just had the weirdest thing. I just tried to do basic stretches and exercises on the floor and I couldn't even get halfway through.' And she looked at me through her glasses like she was talking to the dumbest human being. And she said, 'You have COVID-19.' \"\n\nHanks says he doesn't know how he and Wilson contracted the virus while Hanks was in Australia shooting Baz Luhrmann's Elvis Presley movie. (Hanks will portray manager Col. Tom Parker.) Hanks said most of the hospital isolation was need for monitoring precautions and to ensure he and Wilson did not spread the disease.\n\nAfter two weeks of isolation, the couple was able to return to their home in Los Angeles, where they have remained.\n\nHanks stepped out as the first ever host of a remote \"Saturday Night Live\" from his kitchen last week.",

Joe Cunningham, D-S.C., and Mario Diaz-Balart, R-Fla., are among six lawmakers on Capitol Hill who have tested positive for coronavirus so far.\n\n\"I was incredibly fortunate to only have extremely mild #COVID19 symptoms and now I'm grateful for the chance to help out someone who is critically ill,\" Cunningham wrote on Twitter. \"If you've recovered from coronavirus, I encourage you to do the same!\"\n\nDiaz-Balart wrote that he donated his plasma while his wife, Tia, donated blood \"to help those with critical health conditions.\"\n\n\"I strongly encourage people who have recovered from COVID-19 to become a plasma donor - someone's life could depend on it,\" he said.\n\nMore: Karen Pence says Mike Pence did not find out about Mayo Clinic mask policy until after visit\n\nEarly results of using blood plasma around the country have shown some positive results in the fight against the coronavirus.\n\nAs discussed with the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, some blood plasma projects are not coming from an official clinical trial but from patients who have been treated under the U.S. government's expanded access program. The program is meant to help patients now, before rigorous, time-consuming clinical trials have been completed.\n\nMore: Spike in US deaths and cases flagged as pneumonia suggests even greater COVID-19 impact\n\nNo definitive studies looking at outcomes in patients who either did or did not get the plasma have been released. However, a report on a series of cases from China that was published on March 27 also seemed to show the possibility of positive outcomes.\n\nBoth the Food and Drug Administration and the Red Cross have encouraged those who have fully recovered from COVID-19 to consider donating their blood plasma.\n\nDonors must meet certain requirements, including having a prior, verified diagnosis of COVID-19. Dr. Liise-anne Pirofski, professor of biomedical research at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine, said the donor must have documentation, such as a positive PCR test or an official isolation order, and can donate up to 28 days after the resolution of their symptoms.\n\nLifting coronavirus lockdowns: More than half of states are making moves to reopen.

        "authors": [],
        "body": "Parents already overwhelmed by the challenges of raising kids amid a global pandemic now have something else to worry about: a mysterious inflammatory disease most evident in New York - the nation's coronavirus epicenter - but also popping up elsewhere.\n\nIt's too early to tell how big a concern it will become, but the illness came up during a Senate hearing Tuesday when Dr. Anthony Fauci of the White House coronavirus task force warned against rushing to reopen schools in the fall. He referenced \"children presenting with COVID-19 who actually have a very strange inflammatory syndrome, very similar to Kawasaki syndrome.\n\n\"I think we better be careful if we are not cavalier in thinking that children are completely immune to the deleterious effects (of the virus).''\n\nDoctors are calling the new ailment pediatric multisystem inflammatory syndrome, and it shares some traits with Kawasaki, which typically afflicts children under 5 years of age. Their common symptoms: prolonged fever, a rash, conjunctivitis, swelling of the palms or soles of the feet, sometimes peeling of the skin in those areas and lymph node enlargement.\n\nIs there a link?: More kids fall ill to mysterious Kawasaki-like disease as officials test for coronavirus\n\nOn Tuesday, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said the state is investigating about 100 possible cases of the new disease, which has killed at least three and has also been spotted in Los Angeles, the San Francisco Bay Area (suspected), Chicago, Britain and Spain.\n\nDr. Charles Schleien, chair of pediatrics at Northwell Health in New York, said his hospital has seen about 40 cases since mid-April and the majority showed antibodies similar to the coronavirus, meaning they had been infected, but had no symptoms of COVID-19. Several others tested positive for the virus and didn't have symptoms either.\n\nThough a causal connection between the virus and the new illness has yet to be proven, \"The relationship seems pretty strong,'' Schleien said.\n\n\"First of all, we never see these many kids with Kawasaki. Usually we'll see a few kids a year. We won't see three dozen over a period of a few weeks. So, given the numbers and given the fact it's not acting exactly like Kawasaki, it looks like it's probably a post-COVID-19 infection inflammatory disease.''\n\nOne difference from Kawasaki, which develops in about one in every 10,000 American children under 5 every year, is the age range for this disease stretches into adolescence. Schleien said he has seen it in minors as old as 14.\n\nOne fortuitous similarity, though, is that both can be treated effectively, usually with intravenous immunoglobulin and sometimes steroids, followed by aspirin. Hospital stays for patients may last from 2-4 days. Parents are advised to check with a physician or take their children to an emergency room if their fever persists for more than 2-3 days, especially if some of the other symptoms appear, including a rapid heartbeat.\n\n\"The good news is that, like Kawasaki disease, almost all the kids are treatable,'' Schleien said. \"It is highly likely that, with treatment, they're going to be fine. It's not like the fear of COVID-19 where we know there are no treatments and it's a matter of luck.''\n\nBut the apparent link between the two raises concerns, and it's reasonable to expect more cases to be identified at other COVID-19 hot spots now that there's more awareness of the inflammatory syndrome.\n\nA nationwide view: US coronavirus map: Tracking the outbreak\n\nSchleien said the illness has become such a hot topic among New York-area pediatricians that when his hospital hosted a video call to discuss it, more than 600 logged on and the website crashed.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said it's currently studying the rare disease and does not have statistics about its incidence.\n\n\"As more data are emerging, CDC is working with the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists and other domestic and international partners to better understand and characterize this new syndrome, its prevalence and risk factors for it; and to develop a case definition that will allow us to keep track of it,'' the agency said through a spokesman.\n\nThe children's hospital next to the Stanford University campus, about 35 miles south of San Francisco, may have discovered the first case of the new disease in a 6-month-old baby who was initially diagnosed with Kawasaki, then tested positive for the coronavirus March 16.\n\nDr. Yvonne Maldonado, a professor of pediatric infectious diseases at the university, hosted a webinar that addressed the case on Friday as scientists try to find out whether the virus precipitates the syndrome.\n\n\"The question is, will this be something to look out for in children over time?'' she said. \"It may be that it's another inflammatory reaction, like we're seeing in adults who have inflammation of their lungs. It seems like this virus triggers in some people a really intense inflammatory response.''\n\nResearchers from the UK, where a few dozen cases of the syndrome have been reported, participated in the webinar and pointed out that the few children who had COVID-19 symptoms did not show signs of the new disease.\n\nHowever, children who remained asymptomatic despite being in a family with several infected and sick members developed the inflammatory response a week or two later.\n\nThrough the haze of uncertainty still surrounding the coronavirus and its offshoots, Maldonado wants to appease parents while reminding them to practice social distancing and encourage it on their children. And she has these messages about the new syndrome:\n\n\"We have to do two things,'' she said. \"We have to reassure people that it's very rare. And at the same time, we need to make people aware this is not a made-up disease. This is real.''",

        "body": "You wake up with a dry cough or headache. It could be the common cold or allergies, or it could be the coronavirus.\n\nSo, what should you do next?\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other public health experts recommend taking the following steps if you're feeling sick and think you may have COVID-19.\n\nDo an inventory of symptoms: Dry cough is one. Are you also short of breath? Do you have a fever? Normal body temperature is 98.6 Fahrenheit, and anything above 100 degrees is considered a fever. New symptoms recently added by the CDC also include chills, repeated shaking with chills, muscle pain, headache, sore throat and new loss of taste or smell.\n\nNot everyone with COVID-19 will have all symptoms and a fever might not be present.\n\nStay home: Most people with COVID-19 have mild symptoms and can recover at home with medical care. Monitor your symptoms while getting rest, staying hydrated, and taking over-the-counter medicines, such as acetaminophen.\n\nSeparate yourself from other people: As much as possible, stay in a designated room and away from other people and pets in your household. If you need to be around people, wear a mask.\n\nAvoid sharing personal household items such as dishes, drinking gasses, cups, eating utensils, towels or bedding with other people in your home. Wash these items thoroughly after using them with soap and water or put them in the dishwasher.\n\nPractice good hygiene: Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue when you cough or sneeze. Throw away used tissues in a lined trash can and immediately wash your hands using soap and water or hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol. Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed hands.\n\nCall ahead before visiting your doctor: If you're seeking medical attention, health care providers recommend calling ahead. Most medical consultations are happening remotely through the phone or video conference.\n\nHowever, you should seek emergency medical attention and call 911 if you experience trouble breathing, persistent chest pain, bluish lips and sudden confusion.\n\nIf you had COVID-19 symptoms, the Virginia Department of Health says you can leave your designated \"sick room\" after you haven't had a fever for at least 72 hours without fever-reducing medicine, other symptoms have improved and at least seven days has passed since your symptoms first appeared.\n\nMasks: Amid coronavirus shortages, manufacturing face mask filters in China is like printing money\n\nIf you tested positive for COVID-19 but were asymptomatic then you can leave your \"sick room\" after you received two negative tests in a row, 24 hours a part.\n\nThe state health department recommends to take extra precautions for at least three more days by keeping at least six feet apart from others and wearing a cloth face covering.",

    "Coronavirus: Why tennis might be  perfect sport for social distancing": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "Part 24 of USA TODAY's Working Out From Home (#WOFH) series focuses on how to safely play tennis under social distancing guidelines. Sign up for Good Sports, our weekly newsletter that will bring you more home workout tips and the best stories of the good throughout the world of sports:\n\nEven as the parts of the country start the process of opening back up in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, the truth is that most recreational sports are not compatible with the kind of measures to keep people healthy that may be in place for weeks and months to come.\n\nBut that's where I'm lucky. My sport is tennis, and according to the United States Tennis Association, there's a way to play it safely in cities and states that have entered Phase 1 of the White House's reopening guidelines.\n\n\"Our sport is conducive to social distancing,\" the USTA's CEO and executive director Michael Dowse said in a phone interview. \"Health and safety is paramount and tennis comes second, but once that first box is checked and it's deemed safe, it's the perfect sport for all of us to participate in coming out of this pandemic.\"\n\nSTRENGTH TRAINING: Yes, you can do strength training at home without fancy equipment. Here's how.\n\nDowse, of course, has an interest in promoting tennis. But if you follow the guidelines his organization released last week, it really is an ideal competitive activity to take up during this period where it's uncertain when pickup basketball or flag football games will be safe to play.\n\nFirst and foremost, tennis is a non-contact sport played mostly outdoors where the participants in a singles match are typically at least 60 feet from each other. But even then, the USTA has produced a document in accordance with its Medical Advisory Group that suggests ways to make tennis even safer.\n\nIn addition to all the obvious suggestions like hand washing/sanitizing, avoiding touching your face or other surfaces and staying home if you are experiencing any symptoms associated with coronavirus, the USTA suggests the following modifications to typical tennis protocol:\n\n- Wipe down and disinfect racquets and all equipment after use.\n\nAnd though there's no evidence that coronavirus can be transmitted via a tennis ball, Dowse said the scientists have advised that there are \"too many variables to really understand it\" and thus advise an extra layer of precaution by using four or six balls instead of the usual three. That way, you can ensure each server only touches balls from their own can. In the event that your ball ends up on the other side of the net, your opponent should scoop it with their racquet or use their foot to send it back across the court.\n\n\"We always want to err on the side of being overly cautious, so as much as we can put in to make it safer, each player having their own can of balls makes a tons of sense,\" Dowse said.\n\nThough singles is the preferred style of play for optimum social distancing, the USTA says \"all incidental contact\" should be avoided in doubles including no chest bumps or whisper strategy sessions.\n\n\"Ultimately, it's up to each individuals' decision-making whether it's proper to come back in the communities they live in,\" Dowse said. \"But if the local guidelines have approved outdoor recreation, go for it. Tennis is the perfect sport to start playing in this phase. It's social, it's physical and it's intellectual and that's what we're starved for.\"\n\nThe hardest part may be finding a court, at least until more clubs, parks and public tennis facilities open up around the country.\n\nBut some early indications suggest that more and more people are gravitating toward tennis since the pandemic began. Dowse, who was the former president of Wilson Sporting Goods before moving over to the USTA late last year, said he's heard reports that mass merchants of tennis balls and pre-strung racquets had a double-digit surge of sales at the end of March.\n\nThat suggests the purchasers are new players, not people who already have equipment.\n\nAs far as people who already play competitively or in local leagues, the USTA is stressing that they should follow community guidelines on when it's safe to play. USTA sanctioned leagues and tournaments have been paused through May, and Dowse said they'll revisit that decision at the end of next month to see when it might be appropriate to start up again.\n\nIn the meantime, though, there's light at the end of the tunnel for tennis players. Whether it's going out for a casual hit or playing a match, tennis might be the safest sport around that combines competition and cardiovascular exercise.\n\n\"When tennis is played in a safe way it can provide all of that,\" Dowse said. \"People are hungry and starved for that -- not just current players but new people to the sport as well.\"",

        "authors": [],
        "body": "MILWAUKEE, Wis. - All African Americans, Latinos and tribal community members in Wisconsin will have access to free COVID-19 testing under a plan announced Thursday by Gov. Tony Evers.\n\nEvers' plan is an effort to combat the staggering racial and ethnic disparities Wisconsin and many other states are facing when it comes to COVID-19 cases and deaths.\n\nAfrican Americans and Latinos account for about half of all coronavirus cases in Wisconsin. Latinos make up less than 7% of the state's population, but account for 29% of the COVID-19 cases. African Americans make up only about 6% of Wisconsin's total population but account for 21% of the confirmed cases statewide.\n\nAbout 30% of Wisconsinites who've died after contracting COVID-19 are African American.\n\n\"These disparities existed before this pandemic. But what we can do in this present circumstance is we have to, have to, have to test more people,\" Evers said in an interview with the Journal Sentinel. \"In order for us to do the best job possible serving the disadvantaged groups in this state who are disproportionately impacted by this virus, we have to test more.\"\n\nThe free testing will be conducted by Wisconsin National Guard members at community testing sites throughout the state.\n\nRace and class spell the difference: Coronavirus spares one neighborhood but ravages the next\n\n\"We can bend the curve on this if we test more,\" Evers said. \"Is that going to solve economic disparities? No. But hopefully, it's going to save some lives, that's the critical thing right now.\"\n\nEvers wants people in high-risk groups, including African Americans and Latinos, to get tested, regardless of whether they are experiencing symptoms.\n\nClusters of COVID-19 cases emerged early amid the pandemic in African American neighborhoods on Milwaukee's north side, northwest side and Sherman Park. As of Thursday, Milwaukee County data showed there were 1,490 cases in the African American community, or about 40%, of the county's cases. African Americans are about 27% of the county's population.\n\nMore recently, spikes in coronavirus cases have been reported in largely Latino neighborhoods on the city's south side. As of Thursday, 828 of the county's 3,685 cases, or about 22%, were in the Latino community in the county, despite being about 15% of the county's population, according to county figures.\n\n\"The truth is that Latinos, I would say we're over-represented in the food industry and other industries where we would be deemed essential workers,\" said Milwaukee Alderwoman and state Rep. JoCasta Zamarripa, who represents much of the 53215 ZIP code that has seen an uptick in cases among Latino residents.\n\nWisconsin's racial disparities linked to coronavirus are stark, but the state is not alone in this troubling trend.\n\nAlthough it is too early to determine the full magnitude of racial inequities, many of the largest coronavirus outbreaks have occurred areas with large low-income and diverse communities.\n\nDemocratic members of Congress, including Wisconsin's Moore, U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin and Reps. Mark Pocan and Ron Kind, have called on federal officials to monitor and address racial disparities in nation's response to the coronavirus outbreak, and make that information publicly available.\n\nWithout compete demographic data, policymakers and researchers will not have information necessary to stop the escalating impact of coronavirus, the lawmakers warn.",

At the time of the announcement, some on social media voiced their opposition to wearing masks while shopping.\n\nNevertheless, as BuzzFeed News reported, safety guidelines from Costco have been loosened since May 1.\n\nThe customer retorted that he's not putting on a mask \"because I woke up in a free country.\"\n\nTison, the Costco employee, proceeded to take the customer's cart away, politely wished him a great day several times and informed him that he is \"not welcome here in our warehouse\" and that he needed to leave.\n\nThe customer then offered up insults to the Costco employee as he walked away and culminated the video saying, \"there he goes, 'cause I'm not a (expletive) sheep.\"\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control has recommended \"wearing cloth face coverings in public settings where other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain (e.g., grocery stores and pharmacies) especially in areas of significant community-based transmission.\"\n\nAfter some social media backlash, the customer posted another video saying, \"I've got every (expletive) right to not wear a mask anywhere because this isn't about the mask - this is about control.\" He added, \"I was one of the only people in that store not wearing a mask, which means you're protected from me and I'm protected from you.\"\n\nThis perspective doesn't align with what the CDC has said.\n\nIn its recommendation, the agency notes: \"We now know from recent studies that a significant portion of individuals with coronavirus lack symptoms ('asymptomatic') and that even those who eventually develop symptoms ('pre-symptomatic') can transmit the virus to others before showing symptoms. This means that the virus can spread between people interacting in close proximity.\"\n\nThough the CDC's guidelines refer to wearing a cloth face covering as a \"voluntary public health measure,\" Costco has adopted face coverings as mandatory for entrance to the store.\n\nIn unrelated posts on the Costco (Arvada, CO) Facebook page, users were praising the requirement of masks for customers and employees. Support for Tison has also been pouring from Twitter, including from Rep. Ted Lieu, D-Calif., who tweeted the video adding: \"Costco has the right to require that customers wear a mask. Businesses have the right to prevent people from spewing saliva droplets in their stores. Because we live in a free country.\"\n\nCostco said that management had no comment at this time when USA TODAY reached out.\n\nIn a previous statement, the wholesale retailer said: \"We know some members may find this inconvenient or objectionable, but under the circumstances we believe the added safety is worth any inconvenience. This is not simply a matter of personal choice; a face covering protects not just the wearer, but others too.\"",

        "authors": [],
        "body": "Montgomery: Public schools closed because of the coronavirus could bring some students back in June as part of a phased reopening before the next full school year, the state's top official for K-12 schools said. Children 13 and older could return to campus in groups of 10 or fewer people for athletic practice and possibly summer school starting June 8, Alabama State Superintendent Eric Mackey told AL.com. Younger students could get the go-ahead to return for summer literacy camps as early as July 6, and band and athletic practices could start in early August, he said. But Mackey warned that the timeline was tentative and dependent on the impact of the virus. \"We may move forward, and then we may have to retract,\" he said.\n\nAnchorage: An oil field contractor plans to lay off 304 workers as the coronavirus pandemic continues to hurt the state's oil industry, the company said. Doyon Drilling, a subsidiary of Interior Alaska Native Regional Corporation Doyon Ltd., informed state regulators of the job losses last week. The company's staff reductions will remain permanent until the industry recovers from the economic crisis sparked by the outbreak of COVID-19, Doyon Drilling General Manager Ron Wilson said in an April 30 letter. Doyon Drilling is demobilizing its rig fleet because of \"the unforeseen business circumstances resulting from the sudden and dramatic effects of the coronavirus outbreak, the declaration of a national emergency and the drop in oil prices on our business and client's operation,\" Wilson wrote. Doyon Drilling provides rigs and services to ConocoPhillips Co. and other oil companies.\n\nPhoenix: Two sheriffs are refusing to enforce Gov. Doug Ducey's stay-at-home order as the state continues to deal with the coronavirus. Mohave County Sheriff Doug Schuster and Pinal County Sheriff Mark Lamb both said they aren't going to hand out fines or citations or arrest people who disobey the governor's mandate that has been extended through May 15. \"I'm not going to make criminals out of law-abiding citizens,\" Schuster told Phoenix TV station KTVK. \"As a sheriff, I cannot in good conscience issue citations or arrest people for not social distancing.\" \"It's unfortunate that we're here, but I need to make a stand for the people and for freedom,\" Lamb said. \"I don't want to cite, fine or arrest fine people.\" Ducey already has laid out consequences for violating his stay-at-home order: a $2,500 fine and up to six months in jail. But Schuster and Lamb said they will not enforce the mandate.\n\nLittle Rock: The Arkansas Department of Corrections said Sunday that two more state prison inmates who were being treated for the coronavirus have died. Department spokesman Solomon Graves said medical officials would determine the cause of the deaths at the Cummins unit. The inmates died Sunday at separate hospitals. \"Both inmates were undergoing treatment for COVID-related symptoms. Both inmates had preexisting conditions susceptible to COVID-19,\" Solomon said. State health officials say at least two other Cummins inmates have died of COVID-19, and at least 860 prisoners there have tested positive. The state Health Department on Sunday reported at least 3,431 confirmed cases of coronavirus statewide and 76 deaths, an increase from 3,372 cases and 73 deaths reported Saturday. The number of cases is likely higher because many people have not been tested, and studies suggest people can be infected and not feel sick.\n\nYuba City: Two more counties in Northern California allowed many businesses to reopen Monday in defiance of Gov. Gavin Newsom's orders intended to slow the spread of coronavirus and prevent the health care system from being overwhelmed. Yuba County and adjacent Sutter County followed the lead that rural Modoc County took Friday amid pressures to restart California's economy even as hospitalizations and deaths from COVID-19 continue. While the governor has promised a cautious, phased reopening of the state, some people don't want to wait. A recent heat wave brought thousands out to major beaches in Orange County, leading Newsom to order that county's beaches closed, which sparked protests and efforts by some to head to the water anyway over the weekend. Newport Beach city spokesman John Pope said lifeguards and police officers asked more than 2,500 people to leave.\n\nDenver: A retired paramedic who died from coronavirus after volunteering to help combat the pandemic in New York City was honored Sunday as his body was returned to Denver. Paul Cary, 66, who worked 32 years as a firefighter paramedic in the Denver suburbs, died April 30, a month after he began working in New York. He was part of a wave of out-of-state medical technicians, doctors and nurses who came to the city to help relieve a health care system being overwhelmed by the virus. Gov. Jared Polis said Cary had \"heroically\" served his community and country and traveled thousands of miles to help others. He had reportedly been planning to stay for a second, one-month tour before getting sick. A large procession of fire trucks, EMS and other emergency vehicles drove from the airport after Cary's body was returned Sunday night.\n\nHartford: Workers at the state's only nuclear power plant worry that managers are not taking enough precautions against the coronavirus after 750 temporary employees were brought in to help refuel one of the two active reactors. Ten employees at the Millstone Power Station in Waterford have tested positive for the virus, and the arrival of the temporary workers alarms some of the permanent employees, The Day newspaper reports. Millstone security officer Jim Foley, vice president of the local chapter of the United Government Security Officers of America, said security personnel have had to fight for personal protective equipment and for partitions at access points to separate staff from security. Foley also has filed a complaint with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration saying Millstone staff are using ineffective cleaning materials and citing a lack of cleaning and sanitizing.\n\nWilmington: Police are arresting and ticketing far fewer people during the coronavirus pandemic. In the month leading up to Gov. John Carney's March 12 stay-at-home order, police recorded just under 8,600 felony and misdemeanor arrests statewide. In the month since, they've made about 4,650 such arrests through April 14, according to state statistics. Likewise, in the month prior to the emergency declaration, police recorded about 23,500 traffic violations and just under 7,000 in the month following. But exactly why the numbers have decreased isn't entirely clear. Some police don't want to talk about how the pandemic has changed the way they enforce the law. Some police chiefs say the sharp drop is due to fewer people being out and about during the emergency declaration. Other chiefs acknowledge that the times require a change in strategy, with orders to their officers to use more discretion deciding whether to make traffic stops.\n\nWashington: A high school senior in D.C. has spearheaded an effort to get thousands of critical face shields into local hospitals. Georgetown Day School senior Jonah Docter-Loeb, a self-professed \"news junkie,\" says he was transfixed by television footage of the \"suffering on such a large scale\" caused by the coronavirus pandemic. After learning that supplies of protective medical gear were being depleted, Docter-Loeb tapped into the online community of \"makers\" - 3D printer enthusiasts - and found an open-source design for a welder's mask-style face shield he could print at home. In less than a month, that idea has mushroomed into Print to Protect, a network of about 100 3D printers, most in individual homes, producing face shields for distribution to Washington area hospitals. The group says it has printed 3,000 shields so far with a goal of completing 10,000 in April.\n\nDaytona Beach: Seniors at two high schools won't be taking the traditional walk across the stage to receive their diplomas because of the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. Instead, they'll be driving across the finish line at the Daytona International Speedway. The school district announced the ceremonies will take place May 31. Matanzas High School's graduation will begin at 11 a.m., followed by Flagler-Palm Coast High School's ceremony at 4 p.m. Each graduate will be allowed one car. The ceremonies will be simulcast via radio inside the facility and will be livestreamed on the FlaglerSchools.com website, school officials said. \"This class has gone through school closures caused by three hurricanes and a global pandemic so they all envisioned a 'historic ceremony' to close out their high school careers,\" according to a release from the district.\n\nAtlanta: The region's largest malls have begun reopening, though not all the stores inside are restarting business, as restrictions enacted in the state because of the coronavirus have been eased. The Outlet Shoppes in Woodstock opened for the weekend, but some individual stores in the complex stayed closed. John Rampsott was among the few shoppers. \"It ended up just being kind of surreal where you just go, and no one's there,\" he told WSB-TV. At Lenox Square in Buckhead, which reopened Monday, the owners are requiring workers to take safety precautions, such as being symptom-free and wearing masks at the mall. Arbor Place Mall in Douglasville set up sanitizing stations as it opened its doors and kept the children's play area and food court seating closed. Some shoppers think the openings are too soon and too risky. \"I'm fearful of people not taking safety precautions, and (I'd) rather be safe than to shop right now,\" Tanya Moor said.\n\nHilo: Tenants and landlords have been offered free mediation services by a Hawaii County program aimed at preventing a flood of evictions following an eviction ban during the COVID-19 pandemic. The Rapid Response Landlord Tenant Mediation Program intends to help residential and commercial tenants and landlords reach agreements about individual cases rather than resorting to legal action, The Hawaii Tribune-Herald reports. Democratic Gov. David Ige issued a moratorium last month outlawing eviction of residential tenants for failing to pay rent through May 31 as part of the state's response to the COVID-19 outbreak, which has left many residents furloughed or unemployed. Once the moratorium ends, tenants who were unable to pay rent will have overdue payments due all at once, Hawaii County Councilwoman Ashley Kierkiewicz said. \"We want to get ahead of this tsunami of evictions that's coming,\" she said.\n\nBoise: A plan to reopen Idaho during the coronavirus pandemic hinges on understanding what the state and individuals have to do to defeat the illness, the co-chair of Gov. Brad Little's COVID-19 Testing Task Force said. \"The long-term success for all of us in this pandemic, which is going to be a long game here, absolutely hinges on our people understanding the enemy better,\" said Jim Souza, chief medical officer for St. Luke's Health System. The Republican governor's four-stage plan to reopen the state by incrementally lifting restrictions spaced by roughly two-week intervals started Friday. It will conclude in June if there isn't a second wave of infections that forces a reversal. The virus \"is not that tough; it's actually kind of wimpy,\" Souza said. \"Simple soap and water will dissolve it. Alcohol wipes will dissolve it. It doesn't have a brain. We can totally outsmart it.\" However, he said, the virus does a good job of hiding in the population.\n\nLena: A small northern Illinois church defied crowd restrictions in the state's latest stay-at-home order, holding a Sunday service with dozens of people. Gov. J.B. Pritzker's extension of the order, which took effect Friday and lifts May 30, allows for worship limited to groups of 10, along with other social distancing measures. Roughly 100 people attended The Beloved Church in Lena, according to WREX-TV, which was denied entrance but interviewed attendees and neighbors who counted congregants. Officials with the evangelical church sued in federal court arguing Pritzker's order violates the First Amendment right to free religious practice. However, U.S. District Judge John Z. Lee on Sunday rejected the church's request for a temporary restraining order because such large gatherings could \"magnify the risk of contagion even when participants practice preventative measures.\"\n\nCrown Point: A helpline has been set up to provide services for front-line workers and families in need in northwestern Indiana and the Chicago area during the coronavirus pandemic. Dr. Kalyani Gopal - a clinical psychologist and the president and founder of SAFE Coalition for Human Rights, a nonprofit that aims to protect the human dignity of trafficked personsed - said she thought about the need for the helpline one day while she was leaving work, The (Northwest Indiana) Times reports. The Rapid Outreach Amplified Response Helpline Team includes SAFE Coalition, Greenleaf Consultants, Marram Healthcare, Continuum of Care, local food banks, Mid-America Psychological and Counseling Services, Mid-America Mental Health, seniors and volunteers. The main number for the helpline is 219-200-0003.\n\nWoodward: Six residents at a facility for people with intellectual disabilities have tested positive for the new coronavirus, although none have shown symptoms of COVID-19, officials said. The Iowa Department of Human Services announced April 27 that a resident at the Woodward Resource Center tested positive for the virus after seeking treatment for an unrelated medical issue. By Saturday, five more residents - all tied to one home on campus - had tested positive for the virus. Three employees at the multi-building campus have also tested positive. Diane Stout, assistant superintendent at the center, said in a letter to guardians and families that the department has begun contact tracing staff members. The state is working to get more COVID-19 testing on the campus, DHS spokesman Matt Highland said. Residents who tested positive have been moved to separate on-campus housing.\n\nTopeka: Shuttered retailers, dine-in restaurants and offices in some parts of the state reopened Monday as Gov. Laura Kelly gradually begins lifting a stay-at-home order amid the coronavirus outbreak. Social distancing still must be observed, and masks are strongly encouraged under the first reopening phase. Many businesses - including bars, gyms, theaters, barbershops, hair and nail salons, or state-owned casinos - must remain closed until the second phase, expected to begin May 18. That's when the 10-person mass gathering limit will begin to gradually increase, rising to 30 until June 1 and 90 until June 15. Churches, however, will be exempted from the mass-gathering rules, although worshippers must spread out and not pass collection plates. There will be no immediate change in some counties, including hard-hit Johnson and Wyandotte in the Kansas City area.\n\nLexington: A history museum in central Kentucky is asking for submissions to document how the coronavirus has affected lives. The Lexington History Museum told WKYT-TV that the Lexington Pandemic History Project seeks to build a historical record. Residents are encouraged to send stories and photos by email or traditional mail to the museum. Officials say the length and content of submissions are up to senders. The submissions will be reviewed by a historian when the virus has passed, the museum said. The collection can help future leaders make informed decisions when there's another crisis, chief historian Foster Ockerman Jr. said.\n\nBaton Rouge: With some in masks and others uncovered, state lawmakers on Monday resumed the final four weeks of a legislative session stalled by the coronavirus, trying to get their arms around the scale of the budget problems caused by the outbreak. The return to the Capitol has caused a new rift between Republicans, who hold the majority and pushed for a restart of work, and Democrats, who said it was too risky to have hundreds of people in the building in a state that is one of the nation's hot spots for the COVID-19 disease. Seventy-eight of 104 House members returned for work, with attendance from Democrats lighter than Republicans. Democrats who showed up were wearing masks, while Republicans were mixed in whether they donned a face covering. Masks are \"encouraged,\" but no one is required to wear one in the building - even as Gov. John Bel Edwards repeatedly calls on state residents to do so when encountering people outside their households.\n\nPortland: The governor's phased reopening plan that includes an extended stay-at-home order through the end of the month will cost thousands of jobs and spur economic turmoil, Republican members of the state Senate said Monday. The charge from the GOP came after some Republican members of the Maine House of Representatives called on Democratic leaders to call the Legislature back into session to end the state of civil emergency declared by Democratic Gov. Janet Mills. Republicans have been signaling growing buyer's remorse since the Legislature gave Mills more powers with a March vote that passed unanimously without a roll call. Mills placed the state under a stay-at-home order until May 31 and has announced a phased plan of reopening that began Friday. The Senate Republicans said Mills' decision \"could devastate families in our districts\" because of the loss of businesses and jobs.\n\nAnnapolis: Maryland is opening the first state-run drive-thru testing site for the coronavirus in western Maryland, Gov. Larry Hogan announced Monday. The governor said the testing site in Hagerstown will open Tuesday at a Vehicle Emissions Inspection Program station. \"With the tests we recently acquired from South Korea, Maryland continues to implement an expanded testing strategy,\" Hogan said in a news release. Last week, the governor announced expanded testing to address poultry plant outbreaks in Wicomico and Caroline counties on the Eastern Shore. Meanwhile, Maryland Senate President Bill Ferguson and House Speaker Adrienne Jones joined a group of bipartisan leaders of state legislatures around the country in a letter to U.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi urging Congress to help state governments facing big budget shortfalls due to the virus.\n\nBoston: Gov. Charlie Baker said Monday that the state is seeing hopeful data about its effort to limit the spread of the coronavirus. \"In the course of the past few days, we have seen some positive downward trends,\" Baker said, pointing in part to a general decline in new hospitalizations for COVID-19, the illness caused by the coronavirus. The state processed nearly 16,000 COVID-19 tests Sunday, the highest daily tally since the start of the pandemic. About 12% came back positive, lower than previous daily highs that had exceeded 20%, Baker said. But the Republican warned that the extension of Massachusetts' state-of-emergency and stay-at-home advisory until May 18 doesn't mean the economy will be \"off to the races\" on that date.\n\nFlint: A woman, her adult son and her husband have been charged in the fatal shooting of a security guard who refused to let her daughter enter a Family Dollar because she wasn't wearing a face mask to protect against transmission of the coronavirus. Calvin Munerlyn was shot Friday at the store just north of downtown Flint a short time after telling Sharmel Teague's daughter she had to leave because she lacked a mask, according to Genesee County Prosecutor David Leyton. Teague, 45, argued with Munerlyn, 43, before leaving. Two men later came to the store. Teague; her husband, Larry Teague, 44; and Ramonyea Bishop, 23, are charged with first-degree premeditated murder and gun charges. Larry Teague also is charged with violating Gov. Gretchen Whitmer's executive order mandating that all customers and employees must wear face coverings inside grocery stores, Leyton said. About 150 people attended a candlelight vigil Sunday night. On Monday, a makeshift memorial was started outside the Family Dollar.\n\nMinneapolis: The number of people in the state hospitalized in intensive care with COVID-19 has jumped for three straight days to the highest levels yet, health officials said Monday. The Minnesota Department of Health reported 166 patients in intensive care units as of Monday, up 11 from a one-day high of 155 set Sunday and a high of 135 set Saturday. A total of 396 patients were hospitalized, up 23 from Sunday. The state's count of confirmed cases rose by 571 to 7,234 . Health officials say the confirmed case counts are substantially lower than the actual number of coronavirus infections because many patients don't get tested, and many don't show symptoms. Minnesota's death toll rose by nine to 428. Out of that total, 345 deaths have been in residents of long-term care or assisted living facilities.\n\nJackson: Commencement ceremonies in the state are looking a bit different from usual as graduates began to receive their degrees via virtual celebrations. Alcorn State University awarded degrees to 466 students, including 73 graduate degrees, in ceremonies Saturday. The university encouraged the students' friends and relatives to gather online at the university's website to mark the occasion. Graduates also will be given a chance to walk at a commencement in the future. Mississippi State held its graduation ceremony Friday and livestreamed the event to comply with social distancing restrictions in place because of the coronavirus pandemic. The occasion marked just the third time in the university's 142-year history that a traditional graduation ceremony was not possible, the university said. The Spanish flu and World War II stopped earlier ceremonies.\n\nSt. Louis: Business began reopening in the state Monday, although some cities hit hard by the coronavirus are keeping restrictions in place a little longer. In lifting the statewide stay-at-home order, Gov. Mike Parson placed no limit on the size of social gatherings if people maintain the current 6-foot social distancing efforts. But some businesses - such as retail stores - will be required to take extra steps, such as limiting occupancy. Among the businesses that can resume operations are restaurants, manufacturing plants, gyms and hair salons, along with churches and sporting events. But nursing homes, long-term care facilities, retirement homes and assisted living homes must continue stronger guidance to reduce the risk of spreading COVID-19. Stay-at-home orders will remain in effect through mid-May in St. Louis County and the city of St. Louis. In Kansas City, Mayor Quinton Lucas is allowing the reopening of some \"nonessential\" businesses starting Wednesday.\n\nBillings: Restaurants, bars, brewpubs and casinos began reopening Monday with limits on crowds and servers donning masks and gloves, as the state lifts more closures imposed to fight the coronavirus. Not all restaurants were reopening immediately, and some industry workers have expressed concern that interacting with customers could put them at risk. But with confirmed virus infections down sharply since peaking in late March, Montana officials have moved methodically in recent days to reopen sectors of the state's economy even as other states extended closure orders. Churches and retail shops opened last week, and a stay-at-home order was lifted except for vulnerable populations including the elderly. Schools can reopen May 7 under the latest directive from Gov. Steve Bullock, but many districts already have canceled in-person classes through the end of the year.\n\nLincoln: State officials are struggling to keep up with the flood of unemployment claims that have been filed since the coronavirus pandemic began. Nebraska Labor Commissioner John Albin said the state has been adding workers and streamlining its processes, but there have still been unacceptable delays that left workers waiting for their checks. \"I apologize if anyone's been out there waiting a long time,\" Albin told the Omaha World-Herald. \"I don't know that it's any comfort, but we're not meeting our own standards on this.\" Since March 8, the state has received 129,309 new unemployment claims, which is more than the total claims filed during the three previous years combined. The state has processed 96,024 of those claims, but that leaves 33,000 requiring a response. Albin said the state normally tries to process all new jobless claims within 21 days.\n\nLas Vegas: A task force of business leaders trying use to their global contacts to bolster the state's coronavirus response has expanded its initial focus from obtaining protective equipment to ramping up testing and helping businesses figure out how to reopen. Former MGM Resorts International CEO Jim Murren said the task force he's running began in recent weeks working to get test kits and machines, allowing Nevada to test more people and get results faster. Weeks ago, the state was able to process less than 1,000 tests a day, but the task force is hoping to help the state grow to a point where it can processes 30,000 a day by June 1. Murren said members of the Nevada COVID-19 Response, Relief and Recovery Task Force use their contacts and business expertise to find equipment that can be donated to the state or purchased with donated money, moving faster than governments limited by regulatory rules about purchasing.\n\nConcord: Housing agencies throughout the state will get nearly $3.6 million in coronavirus aid, the state's congressional delegation said Monday. The funding was distributed through the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development's Public Housing Operation Fund, used to support housing authorities for the operating and maintenance expenses of their buildings, and its Housing Choice Voucher Program, used to help low-income, disabled and elderly poor people afford housing. Meanwhile, though many libraries are closed during the coronavirus pandemic, one in Laconia is among those providing \"take-out\" service. The Laconia Daily Sun reports patrons pick up books and other items in shopping bags outside the front door. When returned, the books are quarantined for a week and sanitized. Patrons are asked to wipe down any items they pick up and return them.\n\nTrenton: Schools will remain closed for the rest of the academic year due to the coronavirus outbreak, Gov. Phil Murphy said Monday. Teachers will be required to continue conducting online instruction, which schools have been doing since they shuttered in mid-March. \"I had hoped we could get back to a sense of normal by allowing our children to return to the schools they love and to be with their friends and classmates,\" Murphy said. \"But the reality is we cannot safely reopen our schools to provide students and families, or faculty and staff, the confidence needed to allow for a return to in-person instruction.\" Private schools with later academic years are closed until at least June 30, Murphy said. State officials will meet with parents and other stakeholders to consider summer courses, as well as to discuss the 2020-2021 school year, he said.\n\nEunice: Another small city is vowing to reopen despite a statewide health order to keep nonessential businesses closed to stop the spread of COVID-19. Officials with Eunice say the southeastern New Mexico city will open its library, youth center and activity center two weeks ahead of a plan outlined by Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham, the Hobbs News-Sun reports. Eunice City Manager Jordan Yutzy said the city sent Lujan Grisham a letter outlining plans to reopen and asked for a response by April 30. The letter covered a City Council-approved resolution that proposed three phases to gradually reopen businesses. Yutzy said the city never got a response, so officials will begin their own plan for a phased-in reopening. Lujan Grisham has said cities that reopen early face fines. The city of Grants allowed businesses to reopen last week, and state police have issued warnings and fines and warnings to businesses and the city.\n\nNew York: The mayor rejected calls Monday to stop having police officers enforce social distancing during the coronavirus crisis after one was caught on video pulling a stun gun on a man and violently taking him to the ground. Mayor Bill de Blasio called Saturday's confrontation in Manhattan's East Village \"very troubling\" and \"absolutely unacceptable\" but contended it was an outlier among \"tens of thousands of interactions between police officers and civilians over the last weeks that went very well.\" The officer was stripped of his gun and badge and placed on desk duty pending an internal investigation. The police department assigned 1,000 officers to social distancing patrols over the weekend as New Yorkers ventured outside to enjoy warm weather. They'll also be part of a new effort to distribute 7.5 million protective masks over the next few weeks.\n\nCharlotte: A judge has ordered public officials to turn over detailed information and what steps they are taking to prevent coronavirus outbreaks in state prisons. The ruling issued late last week by Superior Court Judge Vinston Rozier comes in connection with a lawsuit filed by the state conference of the NAACP and other advocacy groups as prison officials grapple with two major outbreaks of the virus. At Neuse Correctional Institution in Goldsboro, more than 460 inmates have tested positive, and two have died. At the North Carolina Correctional Institution for Women in Raleigh, 90 inmates have been diagnosed with the virus. The judge's order gives the state prisons until Friday to provide information about whether each prison provides face masks for inmates equivalent to those provided to prison staff, unrestricted access to soap and hand sanitizer, and bunks arranged to allow for 6 feet or more between inmates.\n\nFargo: A widespread outbreak of the coronavirus that has shuttered a wind turbine plant in northeastern North Dakota and initiated a massive contact tracing effort has led many of the state's largest manufacturers to review and relay their safety measures. No company wants to be the next LM Wind Power. Officials with two of the state's largest plants, window and door maker Marvin and agriculture and construction components producer John Deere Electronic Solutions, say there are new rules of the road. And they're doing more than the standard protocol of proper hygiene, high-tech protective gear, social distancing and stickers that say, \"IF YOU CAN READ THIS YOU ARE TOO CLOSE.\" Hallways, entrances and exits are strictly one-way. Other changes have included temperature checks, unique equipment like \"no touch\" door openers, liberal leave policies and pay provisions, and an added emphasis on communication between management and workers.\n\nColumbus: Gov. Mike DeWine lit into protesters Monday, saying some had crossed the line when it came to how they treated the media and state health director Dr. Amy Acton. \"It's not fair game to disrespect the news media, to be obnoxious to the news media,\" he said. \"They're informing the public about what you think, what you're saying. To treat them with disrespect, to not observe social distancing with them, to be just obnoxious, I just find that very very sad.\" DeWine didn't reference a specific event, but a viral video from a Friday protest showed a maskless protester refusing to distance from a masked TV reporter and accosting that reporter, who was trying to cover the protest. \"Come after me. I'm fair game. They're not,\" DeWine said. DeWine also said it was out of bounds to protest outside the home of his health director, Dr. Amy Acton, as some did over the weekend.\n\nOklahoma City: The Oklahoma Capitol reopened to the public on a limited basis this week as the Legislature prepares to return and residents began returning to businesses amid the coronavirus pandemic. State Senate President Pro Tem Greg Treat and House Speaker Charles McCall said the public can enter the building starting 10 a.m. Monday after being screened and under social distancing and health safety protocols. \"Capitol access is being phased in cautiously just like Oklahoma's reopening is being phased in cautiously,\" McCall, an Atoka Republican, said in their joint statement released late Saturday. Treat, an Oklahoma City Republican, said lawmakers are following the guidance of health officials at the University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center. Lawmakers have met just twice since closing the Legislature in mid-March.\n\nPortland: State officials reported the number of Oregonians sick enough to be hospitalized with coronavirus hit a new low Sunday. The Oregonian/OregonLive reports there were 92 active hospitalizations May 3. That number represents a drop of more than 40% from the 156 reported hospitalizations on April 8, the first day state officials disclosed active hospitalizations for confirmed cases of COVID-19. And on Sunday, the Oregon Health Authority reported no new coronavirus deaths and disclosed 45 additional infections, raising the statewide total of confirmed infections to 2,680. At least 109 people have died.\n\nHarrisburg: The state has passed 50,000 confirmed coronavirus infections, health officials reported Monday. About 825 additional people tested positive for the virus that causes COVID-19, according to the Health Department. There were 14 new deaths, raising the statewide total to 2,458. The numbers of new infections and deaths have been trending down, prompting Gov. Tom Wolf to allow construction work statewide to resume and golf courses, marinas, guided fishing trips and privately owned campgrounds to reopen. On Friday, he plans to lift his stay-at-home order and allow some retail shops to reopen in the least impacted parts of the state. The number of infections is thought to be far higher than the state's confirmed case count because many people have not been tested, and studies suggest people can be infected with the virus without feeling sick.\n\nProvidence: Lawmakers face some tough decisions as the state emerges from the coronavirus crisis and tries to plug a budget gap of at least $400 million, but higher taxes appear to be off the table, several legislators told The Providence Journal. \"Those most impacted by the pandemic should not bear the costs of rebuilding Rhode Island, so I am vehemently opposed to tolling cars and raising taxes on our working families and small businesses,\" Democratic Senate Majority Leader Michael McCaffrey said. Republican Sen. Elaine Morgan said she is opposed to any sales or income tax hikes or toll expansion and against legalizing marijuana, but she suggested furloughs or layoffs of \"nonessential\" state workers. Democratic House Speaker Nicholas Mattiello said his team is looking for creative ways to use the $1.7 billion the state has received from Washington for COVID-related expenses.\n\nColumbia: The state has officially begun loosening restrictions on travel, commerce and recreation implemented during the initial spread of the coronavirus, as the Palmetto State tries to regain its economic footing ahead of the summertime tourist season. Monday marked the end of Gov. Henry McMaster's stay-at-home order, which placed a $100 fine on anyone outside their home for a reason other than work, visiting family, exercising alone or going to an essential business such as a grocery store. Dine-in restaurants and close-contact businesses such as barbershops and gyms remain closed, along with playgrounds and nightclubs. But restaurants were being allowed to begin serving people in outdoor dining areas Monday, as long as tables were at least 8 feet apart, parties were limited to eight people and strict sanitation guidelines were followed.\n\nSioux Falls: A pop-up testing site at a high school parking lot will test Smithfield Foods meatpacking plant employees and their families over the next week, officials say. The Washington High School site is specifically for the plant's employees and their families to be tested, Sioux Falls Mayor Paul TenHaken said Monday. The testing is part of the Virginia-based company's plan to slowly reopen the Sioux Falls plant after a coronavirus outbreak infected more than 850 employees and several hundred more \"close contacts\" and family members. The plant partially reopened the facility starting Monday with a limited number of department employees returning to work, TenHaken said. Several Smithfield employees said while the plant was closed that they wanted to see required testing among employees before the plant opened.\n\nNashville: Vanderbilt University Medical Center had to scramble for personal protective equipment even before the coronavirus hit, after a deadly March 3 tornado tore through the state and took out its distribution center. \"Our supply chain is great at crisis management,\" said Robin Adkins, a nurse who consults with Vanderbilt on sterile processing and logistics. N95 masks have been the most difficult to come by, Adkins said. In normal times, they are discarded after a single use, but faced with a nationwide shortage of PPE, Vanderbilt at first began sterilizing masks using ultraviolet light, allowing them to be reused up to three times. More recently, it has started using hydrogen peroxide vapor for sterilization and can now reuse a single mask up to 10 times, according to the hospital. Vanderbilt also found a way to \"reuse\" its valets. Faced with the prospect of laying off about 100 people, the hospital instead retrained them to screen people entering the hospital for symptoms of COVID-19.\n\nAustin: State health authorities reported 17 new coronavirus-related deaths Monday, the lowest daily increase in seven days. The latest numbers from the Department of State Health Services show 884 people have died from the coronavirus in Texas. The health agency also reported 784 new daily cases, bringing the total number of known COVID-19 cases statewide to 32,332. For the first time over the weekend, Texas reached more than 25,000 tests in a single day - a goal that Gov. Greg Abbott set for the state as he announced loosening restrictions for certain businesses last week. The health agency reported more than 28,000 COVID-19 tests Saturday. But tests dropped to 9,912 on Sunday - the same day Texas reported its fourth straight day of more than 1,000 new cases. The Department of State Health Services has noted it receives fewer lab reports on Sundays and Mondays, which could explain the decrease in tests.\n\nSt. George: Government officials from southwestern Utah are asking the state if the region could skip ahead to a \"yellow\" designation and loosen some of the restrictions put in place to fight the coronavirus pandemic. St. George Mayor Jon Pike confirmed Saturday that the city and other local governments have put in the request, with the support of the Southwest Utah Public Health Department, after the state moved from a high-risk \"red level\" to a moderate-risk \"orange level.\" Pike said the request has already been sent to Gov. Gary Herbert's office, and the hope is that southern Utah will receive a response from the governor's office in 10 to 14 days. SWUPHD Public Information Officer Dave Heaton said the department is basing its recommendation for a yellow level on ample hospital and testing resources, along with a relatively low case count.\n\nMontpelier: The state is allowing some elective health care procedures to resume as the state emerges from its COVID-19 shutdown, Gov. Phil Scott announced Monday. Outpatient clinics and surgeries may resume if the providers and the patients comply with measures designed to prevent the spread of the coronavirus that causes COVID-19. Elective surgeries that require a hospital stay are not yet allowed, the governor said at his weekly news conference. The resumption of some medical care and other aspects of the state's reopening are made possible by Vermont's expanded program to test for new cases of the virus and try to stop its spread. \"As we find an outbreak, like a brush fire, we are able to put it out before an out-of-control forest fire erupts,\" Scott said. Separately Monday, more construction and manufacturing workers returned to their jobs after Scott loosened some restrictions.\n\nRichmond: Gov. Ralph Northam said he anticipates nonessential businesses in the state reopening May 15, saying more time is still needed to help contain the coronavirus pandemic. Northam announced Monday that he is extending by another week an executive order mandating that some nonessential businesses close and banning large gatherings. \"The message today is that we will reopen Virginia next Friday,\" Northam said. The governor said while the state has made improvements in flattening the curve, it needs to ensure positive trends continue related to testing, hospital capacity and the state's supply of medical equipment. \"I want to make it very clear: This virus is still here,\" Northam said. \"We must not relax our vigilance.\" His executive order, which forces closing some businesses and severely restricting how others operate, was set to expire May 8. His order also bans gatherings of 10 or more in public or private.\n\nSeattle: Hundreds of health care workers and dozens of first responders in the state have become sick with the coronavirus while on the job, according to workers' compensation claims. The new data provides some insight into how the coronavirus has affected the health care community, but it underestimates how many doctors and nurses have tested positive for the disease. That number is not known because state and federal health officials have failed to collect the information, and they've made no improvements since the Associated Press first reported the problem in April. \"Our data on occupations are not complete, so we do not report the information since it would not be reliable,\" said Annie Johnson, a spokesperson for the Washington health department's Joint Information Center. Experts say knowing how COVID-19 is affecting front-line workers in the health care system is vital in handling the crisis.\n\nCharleston: Some restaurants are balking at the chance to reopen as Gov. Jim Justice's plan to get the state economy moving again in response to the coronavirus enters its second week. Despite the chance to recoup lost revenues, Super Weenie hot dog shop owner Jason Myer told the Charleston-Gazette Mail he won't reopen, closed since March, \"until it makes sense.\" Starting Monday, Justice's reopening plan includes small businesses with fewer than 10 employees, restaurants with outdoor seating, barbershops and dog groomers. The risk of reopening during the pandemic isn't worth a potential boost in sales, said Keeley Steele, who operates three businesses on Charleston's East End, including the Tricky Fish restaurant and Starlings Coffee & Provisions. Steele said she's not convinced reopening would be profitable due to limited seating and buying personal protective equipment for employees.\n\nMadison: Gov. Tony Evers on Monday announced that every nursing home resident and worker in the state will be tested for free for the coronavirus. The expanded testing is part of the state's plan to ramp up testing to 85,000 per week. Evers said Wisconsin has the capacity to provide that many tests. Expanding testing to all residents and workers at all 373 nursing homes in Wisconsin is part of the plan to make more tests available to targeted high-risk populations. Evers said state health officials started contacting nursing homes Monday to coordinate supplies in advance of testing more than 10,000 residents and staff each week. Other steps to increase testing include using the National Guard and local health agencies to test workers and families associated with outbreaks at businesses; increasing from 10 to 25 National Guard units to help with setting up testing sites to respond to outbreaks; and increasing free drive-thru testing sites.\n\nCheyenne: A round of intensive testing for the coronavirus among patients and staff at the state's primary psychiatric hospital turned up no new cases. The Wyoming Department of Health, working with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, sampled 46 patients and 172 staff members Friday at the Wyoming State Hospital in Evanston, department officials said Monday. Testing was voluntary, and those tested accounted for 61% of the hospital's patients and staff. Such studies can help provide a better understanding of how a disease affects people and circulates in a given location, State Health Officer Dr. Alexia Harrist said in a release. Two of the hospital's patients have tested positive for the coronavirus, both after transferring there from another facility in mid-April. Wyoming as of Monday had recorded 435 lab-confirmed cases and 151 probable cases of COVID-19; 191 people had recovered.",

    "Discrimination, racism fuel COVID-19 woes for LGBTQ Americans": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "Transgender singer and actress Mizz June was coughing up blood and wheezing. Her ribs hurt when she breathed. She had painful migraines.\n\nBut when she called 911, the telecommunicator kept putting her on hold. When someone got on the line, they told her she shouldn't go to the emergency room unless she was really sick.\n\n\"I said I needed to go. I'm in pain. It hurts to breathe,\" she said. \"They were like, you're just going to sit there. So do you want to at three o'clock in the morning, go to this emergency room and just sit there?\"\n\nMizz June pushed back. I can't breathe, she told them.\n\n\"They began questioning me, but I was so angered that I demanded to go to the hospital,\" she said. \"If I had not been the kind of woman that I am, a black transgender woman who has been through so much adversity. I would be dead.\"\n\nThe coronavirus outbreak is pummeling LGBTQ Americans, especially those of color, leaving a population already vulnerable to health care and employment discrimination suffering from high job losses and a growing rate of positive cases, according to preliminary data collected from multiple LGBTQ advocacy groups.\n\nMany LGBTQ Americans live in states that have seen the highest number of coronavirus cases, including California, New York and Washington. These areas have also been hit by job losses driven by economic shutdowns.\n\nAs a result, many more LGBTQ people are struggling with unemployment, homelessness and food insecurity compared with other Americans, while simultaneously facing increased rates of health issues stemming from bias, mental illness and lack of insurance.\n\nScout, a transgender activist and deputy director at the National LGBT Cancer Network, a non-profit organization based in New York City, said many LGBTQ Americans already face discrimination when seeking health care, and are worried these barriers could make it harder to get treatment during the pandemic. Scott cited a recent controversy over a field hospital in New York's Central Park that required employees to sign a pledge against same-sex marriage.\n\n\"Imagine if you were in New York City and you're queer and your partner gets COVID. Your closest hospital might be that one in Central Park that is very anti-LGBT,\" he said. \"Can you imagine what kind of fear you might have to send your partner to the hospital knowing you couldn't visit them again, right, because you can't visit the hospitals. And you can't be there to protect them and to make sure that they get the kind of care they deserve.\"\n\nAdvocates said the U.S. needs more comprehensive data on who is being tested for COVID-19. So far, many states have collected COVID-19 data based on age, race and ethnicity, but are not collecting sexual orientation and gender identity data.\n\nThat's prompted activists to try to create their own data on positive cases in the LGBTQ community, while also surveying respondents on health care disparities stemming from discrimination from medical providers, including being turned away because of their sexual orientation and gender identity.\n\n\"I would say that there is definitely not as much research out there as other communities because so few surveys ask questions about sex orientation and gender identity,\" said Naomi Goldberg, policy research director of the Movement Advancement Project, a non-profit think tank that provides LGBT research in Colorado.\n\nScout said the health care system needs to take into account prior medical histories, as well as societal issues, while treating Americans for coronavirus, especially LGBTQ people.\n\n\"No one's measuring our outcomes, which, in my mind, is people in the health care system forcing us back in the closet,\" he said. \"They're hiding the way this pandemic is going to play out our extra vulnerabilities and have a disproportionate impact on us.\"\n\nExperts agree that LGBTQ people may have health complications that could put them at higher risk of contracting COVID-19 or heighten complications after contraction. For example, LGBTQ people are more likely to be smokers than other Americans, according to the Human Rights Campaign. They also are more likely to have asthma. LGBTQ Americans, especially those who are non-white, are also more likely to have chronic medical conditions such as HIV or AIDS.\n\nAccess to health care can also be contributing to high cases of COVID-19 among LGBTQ Americans. Roughly 17% of LGBTQ adults do not have any kind of health insurance coverage, compared with 12% of non-LGBTQ Americans, according to the National Center for Transgender Equality based in Washington, D.C.\n\n\"We need to be talking about disparities, especially around race and class, recognizing that people of color have less access to health care,\" said Daniel Ramos, executive director of One Colorado, a LGBTQ advocacy group based in Denver.\n\nStigma and discrimination can also deter LGBTQ people from seeking medical care, even when they do have health insurance. One in four LGBTQ people reported experiencing discrimination, while 8% of lesbian, gay and bisexual adults and 29% of transgender adults reported that a health care provider refused to see them because of their sexual orientation or gender identity, according to a national survey by the Center for American Progress, a policy research organization in Washington, D.C.\n\nSean Cahill, director of health policy research at the Fenway Institute, a center for research and advocacy in Massachusetts, said there is still anti-LGBTQ stigma in health care.\n\n\"This affects their health, well being and affects their sense of safety,\" he said.\n\nMichael Adams, chief executive officer at SAGE, a non-profit organization focused on LGBTQ aging in New York, suspects that many older Americans dying from COVID-19 could be part of the LGBTQ community. LGBTQ older adults are twice as likely to be living alone and four times less likely to have children compared to non-gay people their same age, which means that older LGBTQ people are especially at risk to lack care or support from family during COVID-19, according to a study by SAGE.\n\n\"In a public health crisis like this there are very thin support networks among LGBT older adults,\" Adams said.\n\nTo help raise awareness, activists plan to host virtual pride events starting June 1, the beginning of gay pride month, said Brian Hujdich, executive director of HealthHIV, one of the largest national HIV nonprofit organizations in Washington, D.C.\n\nMizzJune said she contracted COVID-19 in mid-March and fears she may get it again. The symptoms initially left her with a dry cough and blood in her mucus. Then she felt constipated for a week.\n\n\"I had a mild case but still I was coughing up blood, wheezing and I could feel my lungs and ribs hurting when I breathed,\" she said. \"It's just a disgusting virus.\"\n\nShe said was she baffled by the claims from the 911 operators that she should avoid going to the emergency room because it was too crowded. Only three other patients were waiting when she arrived.\n\n\"They told me I could contract the disease if I went. How could I when there were only three people, I expected at least a full room of 100 coronavirus patients,\" she said.\n\nShe has recovered since her hospital stay, but is worried that other black transgender women might have the same experience where \"symptoms weren't taken seriously.\" She's been encouraging other black transwomen to get tested for the virus.\n\n\"I don't think people understand the seriousness of it,\" she said. \"Whenever I go outside I put on gloves and a mask, I keep my distance because I've had it. I don't know if I can still pass it on to people but also I don't want to catch it again.\"\n\nFor LGBTQ Americans who don't get sick from coronavirus, many are struggling with unemployment or other financial burdens, activists said.\n\n\"When we think about the kind of economic earthquake that has happened as a result of COVID-19, with job losses and unemployment benefits, there's a lot of reason to be concerned about the precariousness of LGBTQ people and their families at this moment,\" said Goldberg of the Movement Advancement Project.\n\nAs the economy plummeted, more than 5 million LGBTQ workers were likely to have been impacted by COVID-19, according to recent estimates from the Human Rights Campaign. Jobs in restaurants and food service, hospitals, K-12 and higher education and retail industries have been hit, making up about 40% of all industries where LGBTQ people work, the organization found. More than 33 million Americans have submitted unemployment claims since March.\n\n\"While we do not have official numbers on how many LGBTQ people have contracted coronavirus or have died because of it, we know in addition to health disparities, LGBTQ people are employed in the industries heavily impacted by the pandemic, such as retail, nightlife, restaurants, and they are more likely to live in poverty, be food insecure, and uninsured,\" said Tyrone Hanley, senior policy counsel of the National Center for Lesbian Rights, the first national LGBTQ legal organization founded by women in California.\n\nRoughly 9% of LGBT were unemployed, compared with 5% of all Americans, before the outbreak. About 27% LGBT people were food insecure, compared with 15% of all Americans.\n\nLGBTQ Americans are also more likely to be homeless than other Americans. Up to 45% of homeless youth are LGBTQ, while LGBT people ages 18 through 25 are two times more likely to be homeless than their peers, according to the Williams Institute, a leading research center on sexual orientation and gender identity at the University of California, Los Angeles, School of Law.\n\n\"We estimate that 139,700 transgender adults were unemployed at the time the coronavirus pandemic began. Recent job losses due to official orders enforcing social distancing practices will likely increase this number and exacerbate existing employment disparities,\" said Jody L. Herman, a scholar of public policy at the Williams Institute and co-author of a recent report on COVID-19 and transgender Americans.\n\nLGBTQ people of color tend to face much harsher discrimination compared with their white counterparts because of their ethnicity, in part because of barriers such as inadequate or non-existent non-discrimination protection for LGBT workers, and a lack of mentoring, said Goldberg.\n\n\"We know that with the economic issues arising many of them won't be able to work at their jobs, or their jobs aren't remote, meaning they'll lose a paycheck,\" Goldberg said.",

    "Dispelling the belief that 5G networks are spreading coronavirus.": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "Superimposed over a city skyline, a red and white cell tower and a businessman using a smartphone.\n\n\"A lie can travel around the world and back again while the truth is lacing up its boots.\"\n\n- Mark Twain (and others)\n\nArsonists in the United Kingdom and across Europe are destroying cellphone towers. Vodafone says that 20 towers were attacked, including one serving a field hospital treating COVID-19 patients. The arsonists believe that 5G networks are helping spread coronavirus.\n\nThis conspiracy theory isn't the first one connected to either cellphone signals or COVID-19. But a lack of understanding of how the cellular system works, blended with the overall global panic of the pandemic, is gaining traction.\n\nConspiracy theories aren't the only thing spreading like wildfire online right now. Cybercriminals are after your $1,200 stimulus payment, and they have a slew of clever tactics. Tap or click for 7 scams you need to be on the lookout for.\n\nSome people are ready to latch on to virtually anything when it arrives in the social media feed of celebrities. Woody Harrelson (who holds a B.A. in Theater from Hanover College) shared a report with his 2 million Instagram followers that claimed \"5G radiation\" is \"exacerbating\" the spread of the coronavirus.\n\nJohn Cusack (who dropped out New York University after one year) tweeted to his 1.6 million followers, \"5 - G wil [sic] be proven to be very very bad for people's health.\" He later deleted the tweet but not before calling his followers who disagreed with him \"just DUMB and f---ing sheep.\"\n\nAlso spreading the 5G conspiracy theory to followers are rapper Wiz Khalifa (who attended Taylor Allderdice High School in Pittsburgh), singer Keri Hilson (she studied theater at Oxford College of Emory University in Atlanta) and a judge on \"Britain's Got Talent,\" Amanda Holden (who attended London's Mountview Academy of Theatre Arts).\n\nI included the educational background of these vocal conspiratorialists because no legitimate physician, researcher, engineer or scientist has found any evidence whatsoever that 5G causes, helps spread, or that exposure to 5G signals mimics COVID-19 symptoms.\n\nCoronavirus myths and fake prevention tips are everywhere, too. Tap or click for a 90-second video that busts the myths I've seen spreading.\n\nSo why do people believe such loony conspiracy theories? According to Dr. David Ludden, writing in Psychology Today, one of the main reasons is that we, as humans, have a natural desire for control and security.\n\nA global pandemic is beyond our control and threatens our security. In most conspiracy theories, followers claim that since there is no evidence to prove them wrong, the lack of such evidence becomes their evidence that they are right.\n\nMost of the electronics that we use today emit some form of radiation. For those who don't know better, that fact alone could frighten many people into signing a petition to ban all electronics.\n\nThe key is a bit of knowledge. Consider your non-5G cellphone. Common speculation is that it may cause brain tumors and skin cancer. Yet, according to the American Cancer Society, \"the RF (radio frequency) waves given off by a cellphone simply does not have sufficient energy to damage or DNA or cause heating in body tissues.\"\n\nThis explanation has been independently proven and reproven many times with the best researchers and the best scientific methods. In fact, the Federal Communications Commission ruled months ago that we have nothing to worry about. Tap or click to hear what the commission had to say about cancer fears surrounding old and new smartphones.\n\nReasonable people, therefore, accept this view.\n\nHowever, if one becomes emotionally committed to a belief (and posting that belief publicly to the world on social media with a loyal following looking up to them), there comes a need to defend or surrender the argument. Obviously, some will go to outrageous lengths to avoid surrender. And thus, a conspiracy theory is fueled.\n\nOn January 22, 2020, a small Belgian newspaper \"Het Laatste Nieuws\" published an interview with Dr. Kris Van Kerckhoven, an unknown general practitioner. The newspaper's headline read, \"5G is life-threatening, and no one knows it.\"\n\nDr. Van Kerckhoven claimed that 5G was dangerous and might be linked to coronavirus. That's all it took. One small newspaper most people never heard of printed a frightening headline and one minor physician with no known credentials in radio frequency engineering and no scientific research to back himself up making up facts. Although the newspaper deleted the article from its website, the conspiracy was ignited and passed on through internet comments, blogs, and posts.\n\nNaturally, if a medical doctor could make such outrageous statements with no evidence, then vapid celebs, looking for attention in a locked-down world, could have a field day. They blindly continue to spew out the ridiculous rumor to their fans.\n\nThis point brings us to today with endless online threats and silly hysteria. There's also the vandalization of cellphone towers, the loss of which could cause even more turmoil and danger for medical personnel, first responders, hospitals and government officials during the pandemic.\n\nThe 5G network is simply made of radio waves that are received and emitted by mobile phones and the related cellular phone towers. Their radio waves are non-ionizing; that is, they cannot burn or cause cellular damage. They are like any other wireless network, with the exception that their radio frequencies operate in the low, mid and high microwave bands.\n\nThis array of frequencies can both penetrate buildings better and transmit much more massive amounts of data much faster than any cellular system that has ever existed. Yes, once again, radio waves are a form of radiation. So are television signals, shortwave radio, AM, FM and satellite radio, and even the light from the sun and household light fixtures.\n\nThe radio waves coming from your microwave oven are vastly more powerful than radio waves you will be exposed to coming from cellular systems, including 5G. But one thing 5G cannot do nor can any other radio wave is this: It cannot transmit a virus or bacteria.\n\nFor many, the COVID-19 and 5G rollout timelines, more or less, match up. And so, the argument is that 5G somehow weakens our immune systems, making us more susceptible to coronavirus.\n\nAnd that's the unproven and unprovable theory.\n\nThis science is settled. If television, radio in all its forms, satellites and cellular phones have not killed off the world's population by now, they never will. Neither will 5G.\n\nOur real enemy is deadly, invisible and very mobile. Researchers are scrambling to study this contagion and develop a vaccine. Until then, we must rely on expert advice.\n\nJust as scammers and cybercriminals are trying to take advantage of all the chaos, conspiracy theorists get a lot of attention for touting baseless claims as truth. This kind of rumor-mongering is reckless and irresponsible, and it can worsen an already dire situation.\n\nMy advice: Go to the source. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has a comprehensive website and well-curated Twitter account.

    "During COVID-19 crisis, prioritize release of pregnant inmates": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "Andrea Circle Bear was 30 years old and had only recently given birth when she died of COVID-19. Circle Bear was incarcerated for a drug-related charge at the time of her death. She spent the final weeks of her pregnancy in a local jail and then a federal prison, spaces that are known hotbeds for virus transmission -- and it's likely in one of these places that she contracted the virus. She shared the planet with her baby for only 28 days before she passed.\n\nWhile much attention has rightly been given to the risks of COVID-19 in prisons, jails, and detention centers, the risks to pregnant and postpartum women like Circle Bear have largely been overlooked.\n\nPregnancy alone does not appear to be a risk factor for severe illness from COVID-19, but the data is clear that incarceration compounds the dangers associated with pregnancy. They are much more likely to get infected in prison or jail than in the community.\n\nCOLUMN: Ben Crump: Ahmaud Arbery killing reminiscent of lynching\n\nPeople who are incarcerated also have higher rates of underlying medical conditions -- as Circle Bear did -- that put them at increased risk of severe COVID-19 illness. Some suggest that people in prisons or jails who have symptoms of COVID-19, including those who are pregnant, be placed in solitary confinement as a form of quarantine. But solitary confinement can be especially damaging to prison or jail populations that are pregnant or have recently given birth because it can limit access to timely, adequate medical care.\n\nDuring this time of rampant coronavirus spread and attempts at social distancing to avoid infection, it's imperative that pregnant populations are prioritized for release and diversion from prisons, jails and detention centers.\n\nThe situation is dire.\n\nA new study estimates that at least 72% of people held in immigration detention centers are likely to get infected within the next 90 days. And the danger in jails and prisons is equally serious: Prisons that have conducted universal testing have found that an overwhelming number of the people they incarcerated are positive for COVID-19. One model estimates that 100,000 more people could die from COVID-19 than current estimates indicate if jail populations are not immediately and dramatically reduced.\n\nCOLUMN: Former felons should not be pushed out of loans under CARES Act\n\nA recent study that I conducted as a doctor and Johns Hopkins OBGYN researcher estimated that from 2016 to 2017, there were nearly 3,000 admissions of pregnant women to U.S. prisons and 55,000 to jails. Thousands are at risk for contracting COVID in custody and exposing their babies to danger.\n\nAs a physician and an attorney who work with populations that are pregnant and incarcerated, we have seen dangerous variability in their care. There is a dearth of protections for them, leaving many vulnerable to inadequate medical care and abuse: loss of reproductive choices, shackling during childbirth and solitary confinement, as well as the inevitable separation from their newborns.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic is terrifying for anyone who is pregnant. Those who are incarcerated are wrestling with the added COVID risks of their environment, such as close quarters, lack of adequate cleaning and limited protective equipment. These fears only exacerbate the existing dangers and stressors of being pregnant while incarcerated. Pregnancy, incarceration and COVID are a recipe for both increased medical risks and psychological trauma.\n\nCOLUMN: I'm a nurse battling against COVID-19, but DACA fight could end in my deportation\n\nHaving coronavirus also may mean being separated from newborns at the hospital. This would be a difficult experience for any new parent, but it is particularly devastating and harmful for those who are incarcerated because they are quickly sent back to the prison or jail, unable to see or hold their infants. And since prisons and jails have suspended visitations as a COVID prevention measure, the few opportunities new parents might have had for contact visits are gone. These traumatic separations interfere with their ability to bond with their children and cause severe emotional harm -- for both the parent and the child.\n\nAdvocates and officials have made tremendous and rapid strides in depopulating prisons and jails, often focusing on releasing those who are medically vulnerable to COVID-19. We have seen success in some places. In North Carolina, more than a dozen pregnant women were moved out of prison last month. But more efforts are needed.\n\nThe situation for pregnant populations in our nation's jails, prisons and detention centers has long been serious. But with COVID-19, it is now an emergency.\n\nCircle Bear's child should never have been left motherless, and she should not have had to face the dangers of incarceration, where she contracted COVID-19.\n\nWe must and we can prevent such senseless suffering.\n\nLauren Kuhlik is an Equal Justice Works fellow at the ACLU National Prison Project.",

        "authors": [],
        "body": "Hoover: Alabama's largest shopping mall reopened for the first time in weeks Tuesday, while demonstrators in the capital protested in favor of further accelerating the state's economy, even as cases of the coronavirus continue to rise. Shoppers returning to the Riverchase Galleria in suburban Birmingham found most of its roughly 150 stores still closed and many people wearing face masks. Chairs were missing in the mostly empty food court because of state rules, but only a couple of restaurants were open for lunch anyway. Some stores were empty save for an employee or two, but there were lines at a jewelry kiosk and an athletic shoe store, where a worker raised and lowered a metal gate to let one customer enter at a time. Meanwhile, in Montgomery, about 60 people attended a rally outside the Capitol to express frustration with the continuing state-ordered closures of businesses that had previously been categorized as nonessential, such as hair salons and gyms. One woman carried a sign reading, \"We don't buy the lie,\" and a man shouted \"Freedom!\" and \"Read our Constitution.\"\n\nBethel: The U.S. Census Bureau plans to restart its efforts to personally reach residents without a listed physical address. The agency was expected to renew its door-to-door canvassing Wednesday after hand delivery of census materials that began March 15 was postponed by the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, KYUK-AM reports. Teams delivering the materials have been trained to observe social distancing and will following federal health and safety guidelines, the Census Bureau said. Temporary field staff will also use protective equipment provided by the government while distributing census materials to households, the agency said. The bureau expects its field operation to deliver materials to 110,000 households in Alaska as part of the national census conducted every 10 years.\n\nPhoenix: Nearly half of nonprofits in the state will be unable to serve the public within the next month because of the heavy toll brought by the coronavirus pandemic. Arizona State University released a survey Tuesday that found many nonprofits are facing bleak prospects due to losses in revenue and volunteering. While some programs like food banks and child care are seeing their demand balloon, other nonprofits such as performing arts groups continue to spiral. Those surveyed cited cancellations of major fundraisers and few donations because of rising unemployment. Stay-at-home orders also forced groups to cease regular in-person activities. The report found more than 40% of nonprofits believe they will stop offering services in the next four weeks. Furthermore, nearly 20% expect to be able to cover payroll for only another eight weeks.\n\nLittle Rock: Prison staff who test positive for the coronavirus have been allowed to work at a facility where at least 876 inmates have the virus, a correction official said in a court document filed Tuesday. Arkansas Division of Correction Director Dexter Payne said the agency has allowed staff who have tested positive to work at the Cummins Unit if they are asymptomatic. The staff are only allowed to work with inmates who have tested positive for the virus, he said. Payne's comments detailing the policy were among documents filed in response to a lawsuit by inmates that accuses the prison system of not doing enough to prevent the virus's spread. Payne said the agency is following recommendations by the Health Department that positive, asymptomatic staff be allowed to work only if there is a critical shortage of workers and as long as they follow other safeguards. Dr. Nathaniel Smith, the state health secretary, said the \"ideal\" would be for staff who test positive to stay home.\n\nLos Angeles: A plan to temporarily move homeless people into a Ritz-Carlton hotel has gotten pushback from residents of multimillion-dollar apartments on the upper floors of the Los Angeles high-rise, according to a news report. City Councilman Mike Bonin said luxury hotels should not be exempt from Project Roomkey, a statewide effort to shelter some of the most vulnerable homeless people in empty hotel rooms during the coronavirus pandemic. KABC-TV obtained an email from the Homeowner's Association for the Ritz-Carlton Residences that said it's resisting Project Roomkey at the Ritz and the adjoining J.W. Marriott hotels. The email lists concerns about safety, security, property values and overall lifestyle. Bonin has asked city and county entities to report which hotels are not participating. Bonin's motion also directs them to create a list of hotels that have received any sort of \"public subsidy, tax breaks, or economic development incentives.\"\n\nFort Collins: The Colorado Attorney General's Office issued a cease-and-desist letter to Functional Medicine Center of Fort Collins for false or misleading marketing of coronavirus antibody tests, reflecting elevated scrutiny of a testing approach currently under review by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Antibody tests, also known as serology tests, analyze a person's blood for the presence of antibodies that indicate they were previously infected with a disease. For some infections, the presence of antibodies indicates some level of immunity to the disease. But it's still unclear whether that's the case for coronavirus. That uncertainty, paired with limited regulatory oversight of the tests, has cast doubt on the idea that they could be used to determine who can safely return to work. Even high-quality tests are likely to yield some inaccurate results, experts say.\n\nHartford: Gov. Ned Lamont on Tuesday canceled in-person classes at all of the state's K-12 public schools for the rest of this school year amid the coronavirus pandemic, requiring districts to continue distance learning for the final weeks. \"It breaks my heart,\" Lamont said during his afternoon news briefing. \"I wanted to do everything I could to find some way to keep the school year at least partially open, just for a couple of weeks, some sense of conclusion for our students.\" But Lamont said he and his education commissioner heard concerns from school superintendents, parents and teachers about a continuing increase in COVID-19 infections in some parts of Connecticut and determined that \"this was no time to take that risk\" of reopening schools. Lamont's reopening committee is expected to make recommendations in the coming weeks about summer school, which could open in July.\n\nDover: Some small businesses will be allowed to resume limited operations starting Friday, Gov. John Carney said Tuesday. The announcement is aimed at gradually starting to lift restrictions the Democratic governor imposed more than seven weeks ago in an effort to stem the spread of the coronavirus. \"I've heard the anguish in the small-business owners' voices about just the economic carnage that has visited on them and their employees and their businesses in every corner of our state,\" Carney said, describing the change as a \"baby step\" toward a broader reopening of the economy while carefully monitoring the number of COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations. Under the new state guidelines effective Friday morning, retailers such as department stores, tobacco shops, bookstores and thrift stores will be allowed to do business using curbside pickup. Hair salons can resume operations by appointment, but only for people who work at businesses deemed \"essential.\"\n\nWashington: The district has released neighborhood coronavirus data that shows the number of positive COVID-19 cases in specific areas of the city, WUSA-TV reports. Data from DC Health shows that the 16th Street Heights and Columbia Heights neighborhoods in Wards 4 and 5 have the largest numbers of cases, followed by Chinatown, Brightwood and Logan Circle/Shaw. Wards 2 and 3 continue to have the lowest rates of infection in the city, according to the neighborhood-specific data, which the city released in an effort to monitor key areas in the district that may be disproportionately affected by the coronavirus, Mayor Muriel Bowser said.\n\nTallahassee: As the state slowly reopens, officials are now contemplating what they should do if the coronavirus outbreak lingers into hurricane season, Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis said Tuesday. Hurricane season begins June 1 and usually peaks from late August through September. Florida is often a target for storms, forcing thousands of people to evacuate, with many fleeing to shelters. \"This virus really thrives and transmits when you have close sustained contact with people inside an enclosed environment,\" DeSantis said. \"As you're looking at sheltering for a hurricane, you have to keep that in mind.\" Florida emergency management Director Jared Moskowitz is working with the Federal Emergency Management Agency on potential changes to how the state handles evacuations and sheltering. Moskowitz said that might include shelters that only accept people infected with the virus, or orders for people to shelter in place depending on the strength of the building and the power of the storm.\n\nAtlanta: Gov. Brian Kemp warned Tuesday that a growing coronavirus outbreak is stressing resources in northeast Georgia. Kemp has moved aggressively to allow businesses to reopen even though infections are on the rise in some areas of the state. He made his remarks about northeast Georgia while touring a temporary medical pod in the southwestern city of Albany, one of the state's earliest and worst hot spots for COVID-19. The state Department of Public Health reports nearly 30,000 Georgians have had coronavirus infections confirmed by a test. About 1,300 in the state of 10.6 million people have died. Gainesville, a city about 50 miles northeast of Atlanta that is synonymous with Georgia's large poultry industry, is quickly becoming one of the state's most affected areas.\n\nHonolulu: A streak of more than two weeks of single-digit daily new cases of coronavirus is allowing the state to take the next step in reopening its economy, Gov. David Ige said Tuesday in announcing more businesses that will be allowed to operate. Starting Thursday, businesses including some shopping malls, astronomical observatories, car washes and pet groomers may reopen, Ige said. Shopping malls will be limited to retail and repair services, according to a supplementary emergency proclamation. Retail businesses won't open in Honolulu until May 15, and Maui County won't allow its shopping malls to reopen yet, according to the proclamation. Patrons must practice social distancing and wear cloth masks, Ige said. The governor previously allowed businesses such as golf courses, some real estate services and car dealerships to reopen. Ige's stay-at-home order that allowed for activities such as outdoor exercise will now be called a \"safer-at-home\" order, he said.\n\nBoise: The state will give coronavirus economic relief grants up to $10,000 to small businesses, and no other state in the country is putting up more money in direct cash support for small businesses. Gov. Brad Little announced the Idaho Rebound Grant program at a press conference last week. Idaho will use $300 million of the $1.25 billion it received from the federal government through the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act. \"Small businesses will be eligible to receive the Idaho Rebound Grants if they haven't already received a Small Business Administration grant (through the Paycheck Protection Program) or received less than $10,000,\" Little said. The state will open up the application process May 11 for the rebound grants, which will be run by the State Tax Commission.\n\nSpringfield: Gov. J.B. Pritzker on Tuesday outlined a five-phase plan for reopening the state as the threat from COVID-19 subsides, but there were no surprises - the speed with which people may resume former activities remains dependent on vigilance against the coronavirus. Under pressure to show signs of a return to normalcy, the Democrat unveiled \"Restore Illinois,\" which indicates the state has already entered the plan's second phase. It's defined by loosened restrictions on the governor's stay-at-home order, allowing more social interaction while wearing face coverings. \"We all have a passionate desire to return to the sense of normalcy that we felt before the world knew of COVID-19,\" Pritzker said in Chicago. \"Here's the truth, and I don't like it any more than you do: Until we have a vaccine, or an effective treatment or enough widespread immunity that new cases fail to materialize, the option of returning to normalcy doesn't exist.\"\n\nIndianapolis: Hoosiers should be wary of false or misleading claims some companies are making about their ability to combat the spread of the coronavirus with disinfectants or cleaning services, state officials said. The Office of the Indiana State Chemist said cleaning services and cleaning product manufacturers have claimed they can disinfect homes, workplaces, hospitals, cars and other spaces with products that will specifically kill the coronavirus, which causes the respiratory disease COVID-19. \"Companies are using a variety of marketing opportunities to advertise these claims - websites, TV, radio, flyers, mailers and social media,\" said Sarah Caffery, a pesticide product registration specialist with the State Chemist's office. Consumers are urged to visit the Office of the Indiana State Chemist website to find a list of products that are effective against the virus, according to U.S. Environmental Protection Agency criteria.\n\nDes Moines: Des Moines Public Schools has opened the door to in-person graduation ceremonies after previously saying ceremonies would be held online to reduce the potential spread of novel coronavirus. \"I very much want us to have an in-person, live graduation where our students can walk across the stage and be recognized for their accomplishments,\" Superintendent Tom Ahart said at a Tuesday night school board meeting. A final decision on live graduations has not yet been made, \"but we're trying,\" Ahart said. The city school district announced last week that it would hold virtual graduation ceremonies in June - a decision that prompted parent Uniz Ceballos to start a Change.com petition calling for live graduations that has garnered more than 1,600 signatures. Several districts in the Des Moines metro, including Ankeny and West Des Moines, have announced plans to hold in-person graduations over the summer.\n\nMission: Taiwan is donating 100,000 surgical masks to Kansas to help medical and meatpacking workers amid the coronavirus outbreak. U.S. Sen. Jerry Moran, a Kansas Republican, announced Wednesday that the shipment of masks is expected to arrive next week. The move comes as Taiwan seeks to be included in the upcoming World Health Assembly. Moran, who requested the masks, has been supportive of including Taiwan. He thanked the country's President Tsai Ing-wen in a statement, saying it is \"another great reminder that we are all in this together.\" Four counties with meatpacking plants - Seward, Ford, Finney and Lyon - have a combined 2,258 confirmed cases, 41% of the state's total. And an outbreak at the state's largest prison in Lansing has now infected 551 inmates and 88 staff members. Most of the infected inmates don't have symptoms.\n\nFrankfort: A prison has been hit by hundreds of coronavirus cases, prompting action to separate inmates into housing units based on their health conditions to try to contain the outbreak. Testing of inmates and staff at the Green River Correctional Complex in Central City revealed more than 300 additional virus cases, Gov. Andy Beshear said Tuesday. The prison accounted for nearly half the statewide total number of cases reported Tuesday, resulting in a one-day high for the state. Beshear called it a \"concerning situation\" as his administration takes steps to contain the virus's spread at the western Kentucky prison. When factoring in previous coronavirus cases, the infection rate has reached about 40% at Green River, he said. J. Michael Brown, secretary of Beshear's executive Cabinet, said at least least two people at the prison have died from COVID-19. A third death last weekend is potentially virus-related, he said.\n\nBaton Rouge: With fewer cars on the road because of the coronavirus outbreak, the state's transportation department is taking the opportunity to clean up those areas that are normally filled with traffic. The agency said its maintenance crews will spend the next two weeks launching an extensive cleanup effort of usually high-traffic state roadways. The crews will be picking up litter, removing debris, trimming overhanging trees and removing overgrown vegetation. The Department of Transportation and Development is urging those who are driving to use caution when traveling through the work zone areas with crews and equipment.\n\nAugusta: State lawmakers held an \"emergency meeting\" Wednesday to delve into delays in the processing of unemployment claims. More than $200 million has been distributed to more than 70,000 Mainers since the global pandemic forced the governor to declare an emergency and impose a stay-at-home order, according to the labor department. Since March 15, more than 100,000 claims have been filed, compared with 35,000 for all of last year. The agency is trying to keep up with demand, said Jessica Picard, spokeswoman for the department, which enlisted a private call center to help handle the massive volume of calls. Meanwhile, a high school in Norway, Maine, has come up with a novel way to hold graduation despite the pandemic. Oxford Hills Comprehensive High School will hold its ceremony next month at a drive-in movie theater. Families will be able to bring one vehicle, and the school will mail home caps, gowns, sashes, cords and tickets, school officials announced.\n\nBaltimore: The state has missed out on more than $60 million in revenue from its casinos being closed last month due to the coronavirus, compared to how much the state generated last April. The state lottery said in a news release Tuesday that the state's six casinos generated no revenue in April. In April 2019, total revenue was about $145.2 million. Contributions to the state in that month were about $60.2 million. That includes $45.2 million set aside for the state's Education Trust Fund. Casino revenues also support jurisdictions where the casinos are located and Maryland's horse racing industry. The casinos were closed March 16. \"These are truly unprecedented times,\" Maryland Lottery and Gaming Director Gordon Medenica said. \"The casinos generate vital revenue for the state, but we remain focused on the health and safety of the casinos' patrons and employees as we plan for reopening.\"\n\nBoston: The Boston Pops Orchestra has released a musical tribute to health care workers, first responders, supermarket clerks and other critical personnel on the front lines of the coronavirus pandemic. The performance of \"Summon the Heroes\" released Tuesday was composed by John Williams for the 1996 Olympic Games and includes an introduction from conductor Keith Lockhart, as well Williams himself, recorded at his home studio in Los Angeles. The virtual performance includes 78 musicians playing from their living rooms, kitchens, basements and bedrooms. A recording engineer and a video engineer edited the piece from their homes. Williams compared workers on the front lines of the pandemic to the athletes for whom the piece was composed. \"Like our wonderful athletes, they are performing Olympic feats of their own, tending to our health and wellbeing, and by doing so lifting all our spirits through the care and compassion they show the world each and every day,\" he said in a statement released by the Pops.\n\nLansing: The Republican-led Legislature sued Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer on Wednesday, asking a judge to declare invalid and unenforceable her stay-at-home order and other measures issued to combat the coronavirus pandemic. The lawsuit, filed in the state Court of Claims, says a 1945 law that gives the governor broad emergency powers to order such restrictions governs local, not statewide, declarations like one that has been in place since March. A 1976 law gives Whitmer emergency authority only for a limited period that expired when the House and Senate did not extend her emergency and disaster declarations last week, according to the suit that alleges a \"patent disregard for the law.\" Whitmer spokeswoman Tiffany Brown called the suit a \"partisan game.\" Whitmer's \"No. 1 priority is saving lives,\" Brown said. \"She's making decisions based on science and data, not political or legal pressure.\"\n\nMinneapolis: A coalition of hospitality organizations is urging state legislators to provide an economic relief package to help save the industry's businesses. The coalition includes Hospitality Minnesota, the Minnesota Licensed Beverage Association, the Community of Minnesota Resorts and the Craft Brewers Guild. A recent survey by Hospitality Minnesota says more than half of hospitality businesses may be forced to close permanently in the next two months because of the effects of the coronavirus and the state's stay-at-home order. Minnesota Hospitality says federal relief so far is not tailored to work for hospitality businesses. The coalition said that in addition to reopening businesses safely and swiftly, many will also need additional financial support. \"Hospitality businesses and jobs are teetering on an economic cliff,\" said Liz Rammer, President and CEO of Hospitality Minnesota.\n\nJackson: State legislators will be back at work Thursday to consider proposals to help businesses that have been hurt by the coronavirus outbreak, House and Senate leaders said Tuesday. It will be the second time in less than a week for legislators to return to the Capitol after putting their session on hold in mid-March because of the pandemic. They passed a bill Friday to give the Legislature control over spending $1.25 billion that Mississippi is receiving from the federal government in a massive coronavirus relief package. Republican Gov. Tate Reeves has called that bill a power grab by the Republican-majority Legislature, saying he's best positioned to spend the federal money as needs arise. During a news conference Tuesday, Reeves mentioned the possibility that he would veto the bill, setting up further confrontation with lawmakers.\n\nO'Fallon: St. Louis and St. Louis County will both begin easing stay-at-home orders starting later this month, but officials caution that the process will be slow for the area of Missouri most ravaged by the coronavirus. St. Louis Mayor Lyda Krewson and St. Louis County Executive Sam Page both announced late Tuesday that public health restrictions would be reduced starting May 18. Page said Wednesday that the reopening process will be driven by metrics like hospitalizations, ventilator usage, and rises or falls in confirmed cases. The city and county are coordinating their plans, and Page and Krewson said details will be released soon. But Page said the plan will include a recommendation that workers wear masks \"and we will request everyone out in public wear masks, especially when social distancing measures, being at least 6 feet away from someone else, can't be easily followed.\" The mayors of 25 St. Louis County municipalities want those details immediately.\n\nHelena: Gov. Steve Bullock on Tuesday announced $123 million in grants for small businesses, nonprofits and state residents affected by the coronavirus pandemic. The spending is the first phase of distributions of the state's $1.25 billion in federal coronavirus relief funding. Applications can be submitted starting Thursday via covidrelief.mt.gov. \"I want to be clear that this is just an initial round of funding based on the immediate needs identified by Montanans, small businesses,\" Bullock said. The governor is creating a $50 million grant fund for small businesses who have lost revenue due to the coronavirus and another $50 million in rent or mortgage assistance for people who have lost jobs or substantial income. Other funding includes $10 million for nonprofit social service agencies and $2 million for food banks.\n\nLincoln: The state has opened a new lab to analyze the results of about 3,000 coronavirus tests per day and will launch more testing sites beyond those operating in Omaha and hard-hit Grand Island, officials said Tuesday. CHI Health St. Elizabeth in Lincoln will serve as the state's lab under the TestNebraska program, which state officials launched through a contract with a Utah startup. \"This is going to allow us to greatly expand our testing,\" Gov. Pete Ricketts said. Nebraska officials have sought to increase the state's testing capacity to get a better sense of where the coronavirus is and how quickly it's spreading. Under the $27 million, no-bid contract with Nomi Health and other firms, Nebraska received 540,000 tests, plus equipment needed to analyze them and website support to help people enroll. Ricketts said about 122,000 Nebraska residents have signed up so far.\n\nLas Vegas: MGM Resorts International has announced that the furloughs of more than 60,000 employees caused by the coronavirus pandemic could turn into layoffs. Acting company CEO Bill Hornbuckle sent a legal notice Tuesday to employees saying a tourism forecast predicts some furloughed workers might not be back for more than six months and some not at all. \"When we first furloughed our employees, we hoped the spread of the virus could be contained or that an effective treatment would emerge quickly,\" Hornbuckle said. \"Based on the current situation, we now believe that some of our colleagues may not return to work this year.\" Employees will remain on furlough status until Aug. 31, then the company is allowed to begin layoffs. The notice complies with the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act, which is intended to ensure employees have advance notice before significant layoffs.\n\nConcord: Drive-thru ceremonies with no handshakes, hugs or high-fives may mark the end of high school for some of the state's graduates. The Department of Education has released guidance to school districts about how to plan graduation ceremonies in light of the state's prohibition on gatherings of more than 10 people. Officials said schools should consider limiting audience size to a maximum of two guests per student, depending on the ability to practice safe social distancing. The department said one option could be to have people stay in their cars, parked in every other spot, and graduates would exit in small, appropriately spaced groups, to get their diplomas. Diplomas also could be distributed \"drive-up\" style, or participants could be spread out among classrooms within a school.\n\nTrenton: Gov. Phil Murphy on Wednesday extended the public health emergency declaration stemming from the coronavirus outbreak for another month. He first signed the declaration in March and renewed it in April. The declaration allows the Democrat to invoke emergency powers, like ordering businesses to close. Murphy said he decided to extend the declaration because it automatically expires after 30 days, and the underlying conditions making it necessary haven't changed. He also announced about 1,500 new positive cases, putting the total at about 132,000, along with 308 new deaths, for a death toll of 8,549. Despite the climbing death toll and increase in positive cases, Murphy said the number of people in hospitals with the virus continued to decline, as did the number of patients on ventilators.\n\nAlbuquerque: A rural sheriff has deputized about 20 church members at an in-person church service, working around Democratic Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham's public health order designed to combat the spread of the coronavirus. Sierra County Sheriff Glenn Hamilton said the effort is about recruiting help and preparing for the worst, but he also noted that law enforcement is exempt from the governor's stay-at-home order, meaning people can now attend future services, KOB-TV reports. Sierra County, about 140 miles south of Albuquerque, is one of many rural counties that often use law enforcement volunteers because there are not enough deputies to cover the territory. \"Should riot conditions start existing, should civil disobedience, it could be everything from crowd control measures to as simple as administrative staff duties,\" Hamilton said. Hamilton has extended the deputization offer to all churches in Sierra County and expects more to sign up.\n\nNew York: The great majority of people being newly hospitalized with the coronavirus in New York either are retired or are unemployed and were avoiding public transit, according to a new state survey, the first such look at people still getting seriously ill despite six weeks of severe social distancing. The survey of 1,269 patients admitted to 113 hospitals over three recent days confounded expectations that new cases would be dominated by essential workers, especially those traveling on public transportation. Retirees accounted for 37% of hospitalizations during the survey period. Another 46% were unemployed. Almost three-quarters were 51 years or older. Only 4% used public transportation in their daily life, according to the survey. \"It reinforces what we've been saying, which is much of this comes down to what you do to protect yourself,\" Gov. Andrew Cuomo said at his daily briefing. \"Are you wearing a mask? Are you doing the hand sanitizer?\"\n\nCharlotte: The North Carolina Air National Guard will conduct flyover salutes to food bank workers, medical staffs and other front-line workers in the fight against COVID-19. The flyover Thursday will be performed by a C-17 plane, according to a release by the Guard. The planned route will start over Asheville in the western part of the state before heading to Wilmington and circling back to Charlotte. Along the way, the route will include medical facilities in Morganton, Winston-Salem, Chapel Hill and Greenville. It will fly over food banks in Asheville, Raleigh and Charlotte, among other cities and facilities. The North Carolina flyover is part of a project called Operation: American Resolve, and the Guard says it will cost no additional taxpayer money.\n\nBismarck: Backers of paid family leave will again push legislation to establish a program in the state, saying the COVID-19 pandemic has heightened awareness of its need. \"The coronavirus, or a health crisis of any type, can put a family in extreme financial difficulty,\" said Kristie Wolff, executive director of the North Dakota Women's Network. The nonprofit and the North Dakota AFL-CIO on Wednesday launched their renewed effort for a paid family leave law, saying the state \"must do more to protect workers during critical life-changing circumstances.\" Paid family leave legislation in North Dakota has been largely backed by Democrats but has failed in the Republican-controlled Legislature over the years. That includes in 2019 with a bill to use $5 million of earnings from the state's voter-approved oil tax savings account to start the program, to be paid off by contributions from employees and employers after 20 years.\n\nColumbus: Republican lawmakers frustrated with Ohio's aggressive stay-at-home orders voted Wednesday in the GOP-controlled House to limit the authority of the state's health director. The move seeks to restrict mandatory closure and stay-at-home orders issued by the health department to 14 days. After that, the orders would need approval from a legislative rule-making body. Gov. Mike DeWine blasted the move, saying his fellow Republicans should be focused on increasing coronavirus testing, dealing with a $775 million budget deficit and reopening the economy. Republican backers said the measure was an appropriate legislative check on the power of DeWine and his health director, Dr. Amy Acton, who issued Ohio's orders. Acton has won praise for her aggressive decisions to combat the coronavirus' spread, but those who think the state is moving too slowly in reopening its economy have directed their anger toward her in recent weeks.\n\nOklahoma City: The state is reopening businesses that were closed due to the coronavirus pandemic at the right time, U.S. Sen. James Lankford said Tuesday. \"I don't think it's soon. We've already got about 15 states in the same process,\" and even hard-hit New York is considering how to follow suit, Lankford said. \"There will always be second-guessing on the timing ... it's still the right time.\" Gov. Kevin Stitt in April announced plans to allow a phased reopening, first of businesses such as barbershops and hair and nail salons, followed by restaurants, malls, gyms and churches. Stitt said the state has met White House criteria for reopening, including fewer new coronavirus cases and deaths, and a decline in hospitalizations. Oklahoma's official count of people who have contracted the coronavirus has topped 4,200, and the number of deaths due to COVID-19 has surpassed 250, the state State Department of Health reported Wednesday.\n\nPortland: The first person in the state to be diagnosed with the new coronavirus has been discharged from the hospital more than two months after being admitted, the hospital said Tuesday. Hector Calderon spent many days in the intensive care unit, where he was sedated and intubated, before he recovered enough to be transferred to a skilled nursing facility Monday, Kaiser Permanente Northwest said in a statement Tuesday. Calderon, who is a janitor at an elementary school in Lake Oswego, tested positive for COVID-19 in late February. He was listed as the state's first confirmed coronavirus case Feb. 28, prompting the school where he worked to close for several days. In addition to being the state's first confirmed case, he was the second patient in the U.S. determined to have contracted the virus through community spread and not from direct contact with another infected person or from travel to a country with an outbreak.\n\nHarrisburg: The state reported another 554 deaths from the coronavirus to pass 3,000 total, while Gov. Tom Wolf said Tuesday that he is not committing to a particular schedule to lift stay-at-home pandemic restrictions in the state's counties or regions. The large number of new deaths reported Tuesday by the state Department of Health was spread out over the previous two weeks, the agency said, as it reconciles its data with deaths being reported by local agencies or hospitals. Still, it was as stark a figure as the state has reported since the first case of the new coronavirus was detected in Pennsylvania in early March. It comes as the growth in cases appears to slow down in many parts of Pennsylvania and as Wolf's administration moves to lighten its restrictions on movement and business activity.\n\nProvidence: An investigation into possible unemployment benefits fraud related to the coronavirus pandemic is expanding with as many as 2,000 cases in the state, authorities said. State and federal law enforcement agencies are investigating fraudulent unemployment insurance claims submitted to the state Department of Labor and Training. The department has received roughly 2,000 reports to date from people who say they have been the victims of \"imposter fraud,\" agency spokeswoman Angelika Pellegrino said in an email. Anyone who believes their personal information has been used to file or secure a false claim is being asked to call the FBI's Providence office or the state Department of Labor and Training. Ellen Martin told WPRI-TV she received a letter last week informing her that her jobless benefits had been approved even though she was still working.\n\nColumbia: The University of South Carolina plans to return to on-campus classes in the fall, although with plenty of changes to protect students, professors and employees from the coronavirus. The college announced its intention Wednesday, the same day a group of education leaders met remotely to talk broadly about what public schools for children may look like next fall - teachers changing classes instead of students, children not going to the cafeteria for lunch, and maybe fewer class periods and semester courses in high school. The key from both groups of educators was flexibility. While plans are to be back in the classrooms in August, a lot could change in three months. The University of South Carolina is the first major college in the state to announce a plan to reopen. President Bob Caslen said that depends on the ability to test any student or worker and, if they test positive, to trace everyone with whom they were in contact.\n\nSioux Falls: State health officials on Wednesday reported five more deaths from COVID-19, along with 58 new confirmed cases. All five deaths were in Minnehaha County, which has seen most of the infections in South Dakota. A total of 2,779 cases of coronavirus have been confirmed statewide, but the actual number of infections is thought to be far higher than the number of confirmed. Health officials reported that most people who have tested positive have recovered, but 29 people have died in South Dakota from COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus. A Smithfield pork processing plant in Sioux Falls, where over 800 employees became infected with COVID-19, is reopening this week. The state has tested nearly 2,500 people as part of a mass testing event set up for Smithfield employees and their family members, which health officials said will likely result in another spike in testing.\n\nNashville: Officials have reported the first death of a state inmate who tested positive for the coronavirus: a man who was among the nearly 1,300 inmates who tested positive at one prison. The state Department of Correction said Tuesday that the 67-year-old man was an inmate at Trousdale Turner Correctional Center, run by the Tennessee-based private company CoreCivic. The inmate was taken to the hospital April 25, tested positive there and died Monday, the department said. The inmate had underlying health conditions, said state Health Commissioner Lisa Piercey. Officials say six inmates who tested positive in Tennessee's prison system are hospitalized, including one in serious condition. In recent mass testing, nearly 1,300 inmates - about 50% of all prisoners - and 50 staffers tested positive at the facility, while 583 - or about 25% - of the Bledsoe County Correctional Complex's 2,322 inmates tested positive. Most had no symptoms.\n\nWest Odessa: A bar owner and armed protesters were arrested in western Texas after the bar reopened despite the governor's orders to remain closed amid the fight against the coronavirus pandemic. Ector County Sheriff Mike Griffis told the Odessa American that authorities on Monday apprehended Gabrielle Ellison, the 47-year-old owner of Big Daddy Zane's Bar, in West Odessa for violating Gov. Greg Abbott's order that prohibits drinking establishments from opening until mid-May. Six men who had loaded \"AR-15-type weapons\" were also arrested for possessing firearms on a licensed property, Griffis said, adding that one observer was detained for interfering with a peace officer's duties. More than 20 people participated in the protest with help from Open Texas, an armed group that travels around the state trying to help reopen the doors of businesses that Abbott deemed \"nonessential.\"\n\nProvo: Dozens of workers tested positive for the coronavirus after two Utah County businesses instructed employees not to follow quarantine guidelines and required people who tested positive to continue reporting to work, leaders said. Nearly half the employees at one business were infected, authorities said. One establishment was temporarily closed, and both have been required to follow strict cleaning and inspection requirements, the Daily Herald reports. \"This is completely unacceptable,\" Utah County commissioners wrote in a Monday letter also signed by the mayors of all the cities in the county. A total of 68 people tested positive, the letter says. Health department officials made the connections through contact tracing. Neither business was named due to privacy concerns, said Carrie Bennett, chronic disease prevention program manager for the Utah County Health Department. She also declined to say what services they provide.\n\nMontpelier: The Vermont Department of Public Service is proposing a plan to provide broadband internet service to everyone in the state. About 23% of the state, or 70,000 homes and businesses, doesn't have access to high-speed internet service. That's defined as speeds of 25 megabits per second for download and 3 megabits per second for upload. \"The internet is necessary infrastructure that is essential for Vermonters to stay safe when they shelter at home during a crisis, such as the COVID-19 emergency,\" June Tierney, the commissioner of the Department of Public Service, said in a statement announcing the plan. The cost estimate is approximately $300 million. The plan assumes that Vermont will receive an additional infusion of federal aid to support recovery from the pandemic.\n\nVirginia Beach: Mental health experts say military families and veterans are reaching out more for assistance during the coronavirus pandemic. The Virginian-Pilot reports clinicians providing help online have seen requests skyrocket. Sarah Pitzen, the lead clinician at the Steven A. Cohen Military Family Clinic at The Up Center in Virginia Beach, said staff have had to provide additional support to current clients because their \"preexisting conditions had worsened.\" Pitzen said they're also seeing a rise in risks associated with domestic violence, suicide, child abuse, and drug and alcohol addiction. They're also seeing more stress, anxiety and depression. \"There's just an increased need for connection, to be quite honest,\" she said.\n\nWalla Walla: Some people are intentionally flouting health recommendations by exposing themselves and others to COVID-19 in Walla Walla County, officials said. Meghan DeBolt, director of the county's Department of Community Health, told the Union-Bulletin this week that contact tracing has revealed some are attending parties with the idea that it is better to get sick with the virus and get it over with. New positive test results in the county have resulted from such gatherings, she said. \"We ask about contacts, and there are 25 people because: 'We were at a COVID party,' \" DeBolt said. She called the parties irresponsible and unacceptable. Walla Walla Police Chief Scott Bieber noted that disobeying Gov. Jay Inslee's March 23 \"Stay Home, Stay Healthy\" order is illegal.\n\nHuntington: Two cities are giving some employees a one-time extra payment for continuing to work with the public during the coronavirus pandemic. Huntington City Mayor Steve Williams announced $900 will be awarded to all the members of unions representing city police, firefighters and administrative employees who did not work remotely during the virus outbreak. Nearly 285 employees will receive the extra-duty pay in May. Administrative staff who changed their schedule for remote work will receive 50% of the payment, the city said in a statement. The more than $200,000 needed for the extra payments will come from the city's budget. In Charleston, the City Council on Monday approved Mayor Amy Shuler Goodwin's request for $100,000 to match a $100,000 grant from the Kanawha County Commission to go toward police officers, firefighters, and members of the refuse and recycling department.\n\nMadison: Nearly all hospitals must affirm they can treat all patients without crisis care in order for the first phase of Gov. Tony Evers' coronavirus reopening plan to be met, state health officials said Tuesday. Ninety-five percent of the state's hospitals would also have to arrange for testing for all symptomatic clinical staff treating patients to meet the first phase under Evers' plan. A third criteria - a downward trend in COVID-19 cases among health care workers calculated weekly - has currently been met, but it could be reversed if cases start to increase, said Wisconsin Department of Health Services Deputy Secretary Julie Willems Van Dijk. Other previously announced criteria for entering the first phase of the reopening plan include fewer new diagnoses of coronavirus, fewer new reports of flu-like symptoms, and a downward percentage of positive coronavirus tests over 14 days.\n\nJackson: Frustration and displeasure with changes in the rules governing Wyoming antler hunting was nearly unanimous in recent days among the many hundreds of people who flocked to the forest adjacent to the National Elk Refuge, the Jackson Hole News & Guide reports. Most came from out of state, and their presence and inkling to continue an annual Jackson Hole tradition was an act of defiance and disregard for requests to stay home while the novel coronavirus was keeping the community largely closed. Gov. Mark Gordon had issued an unenforceable directive that instructed people crossing state lines before May 8 to quarantine themselves for 14 days. Teton County law enforcement officers, who corral the shed hunters every spring, echoed that request over social media and in advertisements for weeks leading up to the hunt. Driving the concern was COVID-19, which has hit Teton County worse on a per-capita basis than anywhere else in Wyoming.",

    "Elon Musk: Tesla CEO restarts Fremont, Calif. factory amid lockdown": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "FREMONT, Calif. (AP) -- Tesla CEO Elon Musk confirmed Monday that the company has restarted its California factory, a move that defied local government orders involving measures to contain the coronavirus.\n\nIn a tweet, Musk practically dared authorities to arrest him, writing that he would be on the assembly line and if anyone is taken into custody, it should be him.\n\nState law allows a fine of up to $1,000 a day or up to 90 days in jail for operating in violation of health orders.\n\nThe plant in Fremont, a city of more than 230,000 people south of San Francisco, had been closed since March 23.\n\nEarly Monday, the parking lot was nearly full at the massive factory, which employs 10,000 workers, and semis were driving off loaded with vehicles that may have been produced before the shutdown.\n\nThe restart defied orders from the Alameda County Public Health Department, which has deemed the factory a nonessential business that can't open under virus restrictions. The department said Monday it warned the company was operating in violation of the county health order, and hoped Tesla will \"comply without further enforcement measures\" until the county approves a site-specific plan required by the state.\n\nThe department said it expects Tesla to submit such a plan by 5 p.m. Monday. \"We look forward to reviewing Tesla's plan and coming to agreement on protocol and a timeline to reopen safely,\" the statement read.\n\nNo agency appeared ready to enforce the order against Tesla. County Sheriff Sgt. Ray Kelly said any enforcement would come from Fremont police. Geneva Bosques, Fremont police spokeswoman, said officers would take action at the direction of the county health officer.\n\nCounty Supervisor Scott Haggerty, who represents Fremont, said he's been working on the issue for weeks trying to find a way for Tesla to reopen in a way that satisfies the health officer. He said officials were moving toward allowing Tesla to restart May 18, but he suspects Musk wanted to restart stamping operations to make body parts needed to resume assembling electric vehicles.\n\nTesla planned to maintain worker safety, including the wearing of gloves and masks and social distancing. Haggerty said the company initially pushed back on checking employee temperatures before boarding a company bus to get to work. But Tesla relented, he said, and agreed to check workers.\n\n\"I'm seeing emails going back and forth between the plant and our public health department so I'm encouraged by that, and that's what I mean by cooler heads,\" he said. \"There's a lot of people whose lives depend on that plant opening safely.\"\n\nThe restart came two days after Tesla sued the county health department seeking to overturn its order, and Musk threatened to move Tesla's manufacturing operations and headquarters from the state.\n\nTesla contends in the lawsuit that Alameda County can't be more restrictive than orders from California Gov. Gavin Newsom. The lawsuit says the governor's coronavirus restrictions refer to federal guidelines classifying vehicle manufacturing as essential businesses that are allowed to continue operating.\n\n\"Frankly, this is the final straw,\" Musk wrote in a now-deleted Saturday tweet. \"Tesla will now move its HQ and future programs to Texas/Nevada immediately.\"\n\nHe wrote that whether the company keeps any manufacturing in Fremont depends on how Tesla is treated in the future.\n\nNewsom professed not to know if Tesla had reopened. \"Not aware (of) the details of that,\" he said.\n\n\"I have great expectations that we can work through at the county levels,\" the governor said about conflicts involving the Fremont plant. He said county health directors are in charge of restrictions and the timing of any resumption of manufacturing.\n\nAlameda County was among six San Francisco Bay Area counties that were the first in the nation to impose stay-at-home orders in mid-March.\n\nThe order in the Bay Area has been extended until the end of the month, but the counties plan to allow some limited business and manufacturing starting May 18, the same day Detroit automakers plan to reopen auto assembly plants.\n\nThe governor has repeatedly said that counties can impose restrictions that are more stringent than state orders.\n\nEarly in the coronavirus crisis, Newsom praised Musk as the \"perfect example\" of the private sector assisting the state in the pandemic. His comments came after Musk pledged to provide more than 1,000 ventilators to California hospitals, a fact Newsom repeated often and called a \"heroic effort.\"\n\nBut whether Musk made good on the promise remains in dispute. Several weeks after Newsom was touting the ventilators, the state said it hadn't heard of any being delivered. Musk responded, demanding on Twitter that Newsom correct the record and sharing tweets and screenshots from hospitals and Los Angeles County thanking him for sending supplies.\n\nMusk has been ranting about the stay-home order since the company's April 29 first-quarter earnings were released. He called the restrictions fascist and urged governments to stop taking people's freedom.\n\nThe coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms for most people. But it has killed nearly 80,000 people in the U.S., with the death toll rising.\n\nDespite Musk's threat, it would be costly and difficult to quickly shift production from Fremont to Texas or Nevada. The Fremont facility is Tesla's only U.S. vehicle assembly plant, and the company would lose critical production if it shut down the plant to move equipment.\n\nMusk plans another U.S. factory to increase output, possibly in Texas, and could move production once that plant is up and running.",

        "body": "The debate over when to reopen states amid the coronavirus pandemic has escalated quickly.\n\nFrustration with the extended quarantine is mounting on social media, and residents around the country have defied social distancing orders to attend rallies demanding an easing of restrictions.\n\nProtesters say the COVID-19 pandemic has slowed enough to justify reopening, given the mounting economic and health impacts.\n\nOne viral Facebook post -- making the case to move toward reopening in Wisconsin -- says we need to get used to living in a world with COVID-19.\n\nIt was posted April 26 by Dr. David Murdock, a research cardiologist with the Aspirus health system in Wausau who was placed on leave after attending an April 19 reopen rally.\n\nMore: Coronavirus is changing everyday life across the US\n\n\"The consensus medical view is that this virus is here to stay. In other words, this virus cannot be defeated simply by staying inside for a couple of months,\" wrote Murdock, who said he was observing from the rear of the rally at a safe distance to gather material for a memoir. \"The world will likely see periodic outbreaks, and we need to accept that and be prepared to deal with COVID long term.\"\n\nMurdock makes an array of points in the wide-ranging post, which has been shared more than 2,000 times. But we're especially interested in the claim about the longevity of COVID-19.\n\nOf course, the \"Safer at Home\" order from Gov. Tony Evers -- and similar efforts across the country, including guidance from President Donald Trump -- is not designed to eradicate the disease. It was implemented to slow the spread so hospitals aren't overwhelmed.\n\nMore: Despite COVID-19, delivery workers continue to deliver\n\nUnderstanding that, we still wanted to examine the underlying claim.\n\nCOVID-19 has sickened 3 million and killed more than 200,000 globally. Is it really here to stay?\n\nWe asked the experts.\n\nMany experts have said a true return to normalcy likely isn't possible until a vaccine is widely available, which could be a year or more.\n\n\"We're going to probably all need to be used to social distancing for the next 12 to 18 months,\" John Raymond, CEO of the Medical College of Wisconsin, said during an April 27 online briefing for the Greater Milwaukee Committee. \"Until hopefully we have an effective vaccine, it's likely we're going to be living with COVID-19.\"\n\nBut a vaccine doesn't necessarily mean the end of COVID-19.\n\n\"Absent a vaccine, I think it would quite likely become like seasonal flu or perhaps like some of the other coronaviruses that we are familiar with,\" said Bill Hanage, an associate professor of epidemiology at Harvard University's School of Public Health. \"It is entirely plausible that this could become part of our regular landscape of respiratory viraI infections.\"\n\nMore: How to tell the difference between coronavirus symptoms and allergies\n\nThe vaccine he references would be a theoretical one that is 100% effective and gives lifelong immunity. But vaccines are \"almost never perfect,\" notes Barry Bloom, a professor of public health at Harvard.\n\nBloom also expressed concern over the volume of misinformation about COVID-19 vaccinations on social media, which include a host of conspiracy theories about pushing people to vaccinate and concerns about how the vaccines may be dangerous. That could affect willingness to take a vaccine once it's available.\n\n\"The vaccine is only a tool if it's used,\" Bloom said.\n\nHanage said an array of key unknowns will determine the long-term future of COVID-19:\n\nEven if the virus does stick around, though, it may not be the threat it is today.\n\n\"If that immunity is not very long-lasting -- and we have good reason from other coronaviruses including the original SARS, that it won't be -- what type of infections will people have when their immunity starts to wane?\" Hanage said. \"The first thing to say is we don't know, but I think it's also plausible to suggest they might be milder.\"\n\nIt's worth noting that SARS -- a disease caused by a coronavirus that killed 774 during a 2003 outbreak -- has been eradicated. But there are key differences that make COVID-19 a more formidable foe.\n\nIn a March 5 article for The Lancet medical journal, Annelies Wilder-Smith noted COVID-19 can be passed on by those with minor symptoms or none at all; SARS patients generally weren't contagious until they had severe symptoms. And COVID-19 is more easily transmitted and has had a more prevalent community spread.\n\n\"The virus remains, and we need to learn how to deal with it,\" said Wilder-Smith, a professor of emerging infectious diseases at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. \"Certainly lockdown is only a temporary solution whilst we gear up to provide the true solution. Yes, we need to prepare for this reality.\"\n\nCharles Branas, chair of the epidemiology department at Columbia University's Mailman School of Public Health, said eradicating the virus like we did with smallpox \"will be challenging, to say the least.\" Ali Khan, dean of the College of Public Health and professor of epidemiology at the University of Nebraska Medical Center, said COVID-19 sticking around is \"likely, but not inevitable.\"\n\nMore: Fact check: What's true and what's false about coronavirus?\n\nKhan noted some countries already are attempting to eliminate the virus. China, New Zealand, Australia and Vietnam have all set a goal of not just containment, but elimination. The New York Times reported April 24 that the adjoining nations of Australia and New Zealand are seeing just a handful of new infections each day and closing in on their \"extraordinary goal.\"\n\nBased on what we know now, we rate this claim as TRUE. Experts say it's still too early to know this with complete certainty, since much remains unknown about the nature of immunity. And we have no clue how effective a future vaccine may be. But a best guess at this point is that COVID-19 could indeed stick around long-term, waxing and waning similar to the seasonal flu. Experts say there's also reason to believe that lingering version could be less severe, though.\n\nContact Eric Litke at (414) 225-5061 or elitke@jrn.com. Follow him on Twitter at @ericlitke.",

    "Fact check: Foot sores may be COVID-19 symptom; more research needed": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "The claim: Chicken-pox-like sores, particularly on the feet of young COVID-19 patients, are a new coronavirus symptom\n\nWhen \"Inside Edition\" reported a new foot-sore symptom of COVID-19 on April 16, the claim was quickly met with skepticism.\n\nMany Facebook users questioned the claim in the comment section: \"So let me get this straight anything is a symptom now?\", \"Hair falling out, tongue swelling..let's add a few more\" and \"Looks like a bruise to me .. he stubbed his toe.\"\n\n\"Doctors in Europe (reported) they are seeing foot sores on a number of patients, similar to chicken pox,\" Inside Edition's Steven Fabian reported.\n\nThe small, blue patches are showing up, in particular, on kids' feet and appear to be more common than once believed Dr. Mehmet Oz of \"The Dr. Oz Show\" told \"Inside Edition.\"\n\n\"Doctors initially thought they were spider bites or some unrelated condition, but it turns out they're probably from blood vessels blocked-off from the virus,\" Oz said. \"And if you see them, that's one of the signs that you may actually have COVID-19.\"\n\nSeveral news outlets, including The Daily Mail, partnering newspaper Metro, New York Post, the \"Today Show\" and USA TODAY have since reported this new possible symptom that dermatologists have now dubbed \"COVID toes.\" Some doctors agree these foot sores are likely a symptom of COVID-19, however, the cause is still up for debate.\n\n\"They're typically painful to touch and could have a hot burning sensation,\" said University of Pennsylvania Oerelman School of Medicine's Chief of Infectious Disease Dr. Ebbing Lautenbach.\n\nThe symptom is unique because it tends to appear in asymptomatic patients, as with the sudden loss of smell or taste.\n\n\"This is a manifestation that occurs early on in the disease, meaning you have this first, then you progress,\" Lautenbach said. \"Sometimes this might be your first clue that they have COVID when they don't have any other symptoms.\"\n\nThe sores have presented in patients in Spain, Italy, France, Thailand and now the United States. The condition, documented in the Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology, has been described as a rash resembling Dengue, another infectious disease, or a type of Transient Livedo Reticularis, a temporary skin condition with a blotchy, net-like pattern.\n\nIn an April 9 statement, The Spanish General Council of Official Podiatrist Colleges wrote that the sores are \"increasingly being detected in patients with COVID-19, especially children and adolescents,\" though they can also appear on adults.\n\nThe council also announced its plan to create a registry to monitor COVID-19 cases involving these lesions.\n\nThe American Academy of Dermatology has also created a COVID-19 registry to track incidents of COVID-19 cases involving skin conditions and preexisting conditions. About 130 cases have been submitted to the registry, so far, according AAD President Dr. Bruce H. Thiers.\n\n\"The skin is the body's largest organ and, in some cases, changes in the skin - often in the form of a rash - can be a sign of an underlying health condition,\" Thiers told USA TODAY.\n\nThe AAD's and the Spanish General Council of Podiatrists Colleges' registries are part of the medical community's ongoing effort to understand COVID-19 and its symptoms.\n\nThe Hospitalist, the Society of Hospital Medicine's official news magazine, interviewed Dr. Randy Jacobs, an assistant clinical professor of dermatology at University of California, Riverside.\n\nHe described a 67-year-old COVID-19 patient whose first symptoms resembled the common cold. A week later, the patient developed a rash on his inner-thigh and began urinating blood. Though both conditions went away within 24 hours, the patient later tested positive.\n\nThe rash, called a transient livedo reticularis, was blocking the blood vessels in the patient's kidney, causing him to urinate blood, Jacobs told USA TODAY.\n\n\"With 'COVID,' you see this rash and some of the patients notice it comes and goes,\" he said.\n\nJacobs told Health.com that the rash is usually autoimmune related and that he observed it in three of his patients who were diagnosed with COVID-19.\n\nHealth.com reported that a small, observational study of 88 patients in Italy showed that about 20% developed some sort of skin condition that may be related to COVID-19. The findings were documented in the Journal of the European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology.\n\nJacobs' findings will soon be published in the Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology, Health.com reports.\n\nThe World Health Organization or the Centers for Disease Control have yet to recognize these foot sores as a symptom of COVID-19. Both organizations continue to warn the public of symptoms including fever, dry cough, difficulty breathing or shortness of breath, chills, muscle aches, headache, sore throat, or loss of taste and smell.\n\nThe Spanish General Council of Official Podiatrist Colleges addressed the lack of evidence surrounding the cause of these sores in its April 9 statement.\n\n\"Obviously, due to the short time elapsed, scientific evidence cannot be discussed yet,\" the council said, stressing the importance of the symptom despite the lack of research. \"The Council of Podiatrists urges its Colleges and its members to be very vigilant because this may be a sign of COVID-19 detection that can help to avoid the spread.\"\n\nLautenbach suggested the sores could be caused by the body's response to the coronavirus in the form of localized foot inflammation and clotted blood vessels.\n\n\"The short answer is, nobody knows,\" Lautenbach said.\n\nJacobs told USA TODAY that he suspects the sores may be attributable to something other than the coronavirus, though a biopsy would be needed to determine the cause.\n\n\"Chilblains -- where the toes turn dark due to lack of blood supply, can happen,\" he offered as a possible cause of the sores. \"Shingles can be activated by any kind of illness. You can break out with what looks like chicken pox.\"\n\nJacobs, Ebbing and Oz all agree that the presence of these sores indicates \"a pretty good chance\" that a patient may be diagnosed with COVID-19.\n\nThe claim that foot sores may be an early symptom of COVID-19, particularly on for young patients cannot be rated as true or false at this time because more research is needed. Multiple reports -- as well as a published study -- relay that COVID-19 patients are developing sores and lesions. It is possible it foot sores are caused by the coronavirus, but there is not yet enough evidence. Sores also could be attributed to a preexisting condition or coincidental. Regardless, doctors agree that the medical community should be aware of foot sores as a possible symptom when working to minimize the spread of COVID-19.",

    "Fact check: Kroger asked workers to return COVID-19 pay, then flipped": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "The claim: Kroger asked employees to return an overpayment of $461.60\n\nKroger employees allege the company overpaid $461.60 to some associates, then requested that workers return the funds.\n\n\"As you may be aware, you were overpaid your Emergency Pay in the gross amount of $461.60 during the time frame of March 1, 2020, to current. Please see options for repayment below,\" a letter posted on Facebook reads.\n\nThe letter asks employees to return the overpaid amount in one, three or five different installments that would be taken out of their upcoming paychecks.\n\nThe letter informed employees that failure to repay could result in collection efforts, and it requested that they sign the letter to acknowledge the overpayment.\n\nMore: More than 150K Instacart workers threaten national strike over coronavirus hazard concerns\n\n\"Payment will be deducted from the paycheck issued following our receipt of your signed authorization,\" the letter says in bold.\n\nThe letter was real. But after fury erupted on social media, the company altered its plan.\n\nKroger acknowledged overpaying \"a small number of associates\" but would not say how many employees received the extra pay or at which location they worked. These employees were associates paid to stay home because they had COVID-19 symptoms or tested positive for the virus.\n\n\"We've instructed our payroll department to directly inform the small number of associates affected by the recent overpayments of Emergency Leave of Absence pay that we will not seek repayment,\" a Kroger spokeswoman told the Cincinnati Enquirer on Tuesday.\n\nKroger officials acknowledged the incident as \"an unfortunate payroll accounting error\" and reassured that they would no longer seek repayment.\n\nKroger to dairy farmers: We'll buy your milk and give it to food banks\n\nThe incident comes amid rising tension with Kroger's union, United Food and Commercial Workers, over the status of hazard pay.\n\nKroger praised its employees as \"heroes\" for risking exposure to serve customers during the COVID-19 pandemic. UFCW International estimates that at least 65 employees died at Kroger and other retailers, and at least 9,810 employees have been infected or exposed.\n\nKroger said it will give \"thank you\" pay to its employees through mid-June. The announcement came days after saying it would end the extra \"hero\" hazard pay to employees who continued working though the coronavirus outbreak.\n\nThe thank you pay is a one-time $400 payment for qualified full-time associates and $200 for qualified part-time associates, Kroger said. The previous plan to halt the bonus \"hero\" hazard play drew criticism from UFCW.\n\nWe rate the claim that Kroger overpaid its employees and asked workers to repay the emergency pay as TRUE. It is true that Kroger overpaid some workers and demanded repayment, but the company changed its course of action. Kroger officials confirmed to the USA TODAY Network that the company will no longer seek repayment and that employees can keep the Emergency Leave of Absence pay.\n\nThank you for supporting our journalism.

    "Georgia's coronavirus test: Would you risk your life to go bowling?": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "You're laughing at Georgia, again, aren't you? It happens a lot. I know my uncle in Colorado got a kick out of Gov. Brian Kemp's announcement last week that the state would start to reopen businesses previously closed by COVID-19, starting with bowling alleys, gyms, tattoo parlors and salons. Give me a foot massage or give me death? Welcome to Georgia!\n\n\"Dying for cute toes\" would be a hilarious state motto if the situation here weren't also so serious. With 1,000 deaths and more than 24,000 confirmed cases as of Monday night , Georgia has not been the hardest hit state in the country. But we haven't avoided our own tragedies, either. Dougherty County in rural Georgia has been one of the country's most severe hot spots, with hospitals overwhelmed after two family funerals spawned hundreds more cases and deaths there.\n\nAnd those are just the cases we know about. A shortage of supplies in Georgia restricted testing until the week of April 13 to just front-line workers, the medically fragile, and people in long-term care facilities. Georgia still ranks 36th in the nation for the number of tests completed per capita, leaving leaders and the public with no way to know whether the spread of the virus is getting better, worse, or staying the same since the governor issued the state's shelter-in-place order in March.\n\nThat's why it came as a shock to many, including mayors of Georgia's largest cities, when Kemp said the state would begin a phased reopening, starting last Friday with the businesses he closed in March, including (yes) barbers, gyms and nail salons, with restaurants allowed to open for dine-in service starting Monday of this week.\n\nHotline: Share your coronavirus story\n\nThat decision drew rebukes across the political spectrum -- from President Donald Trump, who made it clear that he was unhappy with Kemp, to Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms, who urged Atlantans to continue to stay home despite what the governor said.\n\nThe immediate result of having no consensus of leadership has been a dangerous lack of consensus on what to do next. Is it safe to run on a treadmill, but not shop for groceries? Should you get a haircut, but not a car wash? How can anyone get \"socially distant\" hair color? Nobody really knows.\n\nThat confusion also meant that on Friday, after the state reopened, many businesses stayed closed, especially in Atlanta. At Midtown Bowl, one of the city's iconic institutions, the doors were locked behind a sign that read, \"We'll roll again soon.\" Of the 10 nail salons I drove past, one was open for walk-ins, one by appointment only, and the rest still dark with signs they'd be back when it was safe for customers. Typically bustling business districts were so quiet that pedestrians stood in the drive-true lines at Starbucks to get their morning coffee.\n\nCoronavirus crisis: What America can learn from other nations in the war on COVID-19\n\nBut just an hour north it was a different story. The parking lot at the Tractor Supply outside of Rome, Georgia, was filled with pick-up trucks and bustling with shoppers. At the Tropical Nail Salon, customers sat shoulder-to-shoulder on a couch waiting for the next available manicure or pedicure. Three others sat so close under a nail dryer that they could share a magazine. The women weren't six inches apart, let alone the six feet that Kemp prescribed in his list of safety measures businesses should observe to keep customers and employees safe.\n\nAll of the employees wore masks, as the governor's executive order prescribed, but none of the customers did. With dozens of suggested and required criteria for reopening, but no real enforcement mechanism to make sure it's happening, what's \"safe\" in Georgia is being left up to shop owners who financially have to get back to work, but have no medical training on how to do it in a pandemic.\n\nAt the beginning of April, after Kemp announced the state's shelter in place order, I pitched a column titled, \"America, we're not as dumb as we look.\" The governor was being ridiculed for saying he had only just learned that coronavirus could spread before its symptoms appeared. In fairness to Kemp, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had released a new report the day before that clearly confirmed asymptomatic spread, which many had long suspected.\n\nThe data that Kemp relied on then is still true today. We still don't know who is spreading this terrible virus, how many cases we really have, nor what will happen as the state reopens in earnest. I hate to say it, Georgia, but on this one, we're exactly as dumb as we look.\n\nBy Buzz Aldrin: My post-Apollo 11 quarantine lessons apply to coronavirus\n\nI don't think the governor is dumb. Far from it. To see him working up close is to see a man who clearly cares about this state and its people. But that's why this decision, at this time, makes so little sense.\n\nIt's possible that history will show Kemp is making the right decision. Being the first state to reopen could save businesses from closing and keep people in jobs who desperately need them. But it's also possible that reopening the state will spark a new spread, that people who don't know they carry the virus will unknowingly spread it to others, and that people could die as a result.\n\nWe just don't know, and that's a scary place to be living, working, and raising a family. I've got my box of at-home hair color ready to go until we know for sure.",

    "Grand Princess cruisers waited weeks for coronavirus test results": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "Teresa Duncan Johnson and her husband, John, were quarantined for five days last month at an Air Force base in Georgia just 20 miles from the headquarters of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nBoth of them showed symptoms of the coronavirus before they got off the Grand Princess cruise ship. But more than a month later, neither of them has been able to get a test.\n\n\"It blows my mind. The CDC is in Atlanta,\" Johnson told USA TODAY by phone from her home in Augusta, Georgia. \"That doesn't make any sense to me.\"\n\nAthletes, celebrities and lawmakers have been able to get tested for the coronavirus. But Johnson, who was on a cruise ship that became a hot spot for coronavirus, said the only thing she got from federal officials managing the quarantine was false hope.\n\n\"The people who should be tested first are the people you were putting behind fences, with guards,\" Johnson said.\n\nVice President Mike Pence, who leads the White House Coronavirus Task Force said on March 9, the day that the Grand Princess docked in Oakland, California, with about 2,500 passengers, that they would be tested. More than 1,000 crew members were also on board, about half of which disembarked in Oakland along with the passengers. The remaining crew members were quarantined on board.\n\n\"All the passengers will be tested, isolated as appropriate, quarantined as appropriate,\" he said at a media briefing at the White House.\n\nGrand Princess passengers had been confined in their rooms since March 5, a day after Carnival Corp., the parent company of Princess Cruises, had been notified that a passenger from the ship's previous sailing had died of the coronavirus.\n\nThe 71-year-old California man had been on the Grand Princess' Feb. 11-21 voyage from San Francisco to Mexico. According to the CDC, 68 passengers aboard that sailing stayed on for the ship's next sailing, to Hawaii.\n\nUpon the ship's arrival in Oakland, 19 crew members and two passengers had tested positive. Hundreds of passengers from the Grand Princess were subsequently quarantined at military bases in California, Texas and Georgia.\n\nThe Department of Health and Human Services, under which the CDC falls, did not respond to questions about how many Grand Princess passengers had been tested for the coronavirus. At least 103 passengers have tested positive and two have died.\n\nHHS said in late March that of the 1,103 passengers from the Grand Princess who elected to be tested, 103 tested positive, 699 tested negative, and the remaining results were pending.\n\nNeither Princess Cruises nor the CDC responded to questions about the testing. The California Department of Public Health referred questions about testing to HHS.\n\nThe Grand Princess outbreak was one of the key factors in the decision by the CDC to issue a no-sail order for cruise ships on March 14. The CDC has since extended the order.\n\nUSA TODAY investigation: White House task force quietly softened cruise ship no-sail restrictions after months of industry deference\n\nOlder people and those with underlying conditions are at the greatest risk from the coronavirus, according to the CDC. The median age of passengers on the Grand Princess on its most recent sailing was 66, according to the CDC, and the ship had 1,200 passengers over age 70.\n\nRobin Clawson, of Santa Cruz, California, who handles marketing for a solar panel manufacturer, was frustrated by the lack of information about the Grand Princess. Clawson's parents were on the ship. So she started a private Facebook group for passengers and their families.\n\n\"I found that a lot of people on the ship wanted in,\" she told USA TODAY.\n\nThe situation became more dramatic for Clawson when her father, who's 79, tested positive for the coronavirus and was briefly hospitalized. He's since recovered.\n\n\"He's doing great now,\" Clawson said. \"We're all celebrating life now, on Zoom. I haven't been able to see him yet.\"\n\nBut did Clawson's mom have it? She never showed symptoms, and she wasn't tested.\n\n\"They were sharing a bed for 20 days and drinking out of the same wine glass,\" Clawson said.\n\nOther Grand Princess passengers have felt frustrated by the delay in getting test results, which in some cases have taken more than three weeks.\n\nCruise ships and coronavirus: If you sailed on these ships, you may have been exposed to COVID-19\n\nCarolyn Wyler, a retired nurse in Sacramento, California, and her husband, Ken Welton, received tests on March 22, a week into their quarantine at Travis Air Force Base, about 50 miles from the Port of Oakland, where the ship docked.\n\nWyler had wanted to get a test earlier, she said, because the couple was around her husband's brother and his wife every day on the cruise. They tested positive and went to the hospital with minor symptoms.\n\nWyler and Welton were allowed to go home the day after the test, and Wyler said the results didn't come back for 22 days.\n\n\"We were both negative. We were happy to hear that,\" she said, adding, \"We were really irritated that it took three weeks.\"\n\nSherri Pe'a, a small business owner in Denver, also tested negative. It would have taken her more than three weeks to find out if she hadn't called the doctor at Marine Corps Air Station Miramar in southern California, where a group of passengers were quarantined. In the call about a week after her test, the doctor gave Pe'a her results over the phone.\n\n\"I just got the letter last week,\" Pe'a said.\n\nPe'a said she thought she might be positive. She had spent a considerable amount of time on the ship with two passengers who did test positive. After leaving the ship, she was packed into a bus and then a plane with other passengers who were likely positive.\n\n\"I'm lucky,\" she said.\n\nJohnson thought she and her husband would be tested on the ship. Then she thought it might happen when they disembarked in Oakland. And then perhaps when they arrived at Dobbins Air Force base in their home state for quarantine. The test never happened.\n\nThey left Dobbins for their home in Augusta on March 15. Tests began at the base the following day.\n\nJohnson said on the ship, she developed a deep, dry cough and an elevated temperature. Her husband, who is diabetic and a cancer survivor, lost his sense of smell and taste. All of those are symptoms of the coronavirus.\n\nJohnson was even flagged by a health care worker when she and her husband disembarked because she had reported her mild fever to the ship's medical staff.\n\nStill, no test.\n\n\"Did we have it?\" she asked. \"I thought I'd at least be tested. Pence said everybody would be tested.\"",

    "Her 5-year-old was dying. She was quarantined. A race against time.": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "The world was shutting down, and Kendall Whitaker couldn't see her dying 5-year-old.\n\nEaston Whitaker weighs around 35 pounds and will never be healthy enough to go to kindergarten. But Kendall is a paramedic who can't do her job from home.\n\nEaston's heart is failing. When he was in the womb, a doctor noticed an issue on a scan and sent Kendall to a specialist. The specialist sat down when she walked in the exam room -- a bad sign, Kendall knew.\n\n\"I'm about to hit you with a truck,\" the doctor said. Easton's heart was so damaged it couldn't keep him alive.\n\nAs soon as he was born, a breathing tube was snaked down his throat. Kendall didn't get to see her son's face for four months.\n\nHe was placed on a transplant list and got his new heart two months later, but his body has been attacking the unfamiliar organ ever since. Easton isn't eligible for another transplant. So when he went pale and limp in late February, the doctors gave him a pacemaker. There was nothing more to do.\n\nEaston was referred to at-home hospice care. No one knew how long his borrowed heart would last.\n\nBut Kendall works in one of the busiest ERs in Jacksonville, Florida, where more and more patients started showing up with symptoms of the novel coronavirus. She'd already taken more than a month off of work to sleep on a pullout bed in Easton's hospital room. She was running out of money to pay the bills, but she couldn't risk infecting her son with anything she brought home.\n\n\"The guilt that I would carry if I brought that home to him -- I don't think I would ever make it through that,\" she said.\n\nSo she had to make a decision.\n\nEven though she loves her job, sometimes she wishes she didn't know so much about medicine so she could have the kind of big, bright hope she sees on the faces of other parents of critically ill children.\n\nThe patients she runs into at work who have symptoms like Easton's are usually elderly. She sees them go into cardiac arrest, watches paramedics break their ribs performing CPR and tries not to think about the heart thumping weakly in Easton's chest.\n\nIn late March, Kendall explained to Easton and his 7-year-old brother Elijah that she works with some very, very sick people, and if she brought any of the bad germs home then Easton might have to go back to the hospital.\n\n\"But I don't like the hospital!\" he reminded her.\n\nShe had to go back to work or she wouldn't be able to feed them. So Kendall sent the boys away.\n\nEaston and Elijah made the seven-hour road trip north to McCaysville, Georgia, with their grandmother.\n\nWhen they left, Kendall knew she was losing time. She missed that thing Easton does where he rubs his eyes with the backs of his hands while he sleeps. She felt like she was under the ocean.\n\nEaston doesn't like to show that he's sick. He takes 15 different medicines, all liquid, all via syringe, twice a day without protest. He once complained of a bellyache and ended up on a breathing tube in less than a day. So knowing that he was tired and not eating much, even before he left for Georgia, Kendall was terrified.\n\nOne of her co-workers wanted to raise money so she could take time off work. At first, she rejected the offer.\n\n\"I'm so used to being like the mom, the helper, the paramedic,\" she said. \"I do the helping, not the other way around.\"\n\nBut when she finally accepted his offer to start a GoFundMe, she was amazed. In a week, Kendall had more than $20,000 - enough to cover her bills for at least six months.\n\nShe left work and self-isolated with her cat, Rue, for 14 days. She had to be sure she wasn't carrying the virus that she knew Easton wouldn't see the other side of.\n\nEvery morning she woke up and wondered if that tickle was a sore throat or if she had a headache or the sniffles. She wondered whether she was developing allergies or there was dust in the air. She cleaned like a madwoman.\n\nShe bought the boys matching robot jammies and Toy Story toys since Easton's best friends are Buzz and Woody. She was excited but nervous -- it's hard to focus on the here and now when you don't know how long it will last.\n\nAfter more than two weeks of hiding from the world, Kendall's mom packed the boys back into the car and headed down to Jacksonville. On April 20, they knocked on her front door with tiny fists and ran inside.\n\n\"Mommy!\" Easton yelled.\n\nShe hugged them so hard she lifted them off their feet. After the duo ran off to find the cat, they all played Hot Wheels in the hallway for what seemed like hours. Their first few days were spent making pizzas, reading Harry Potter before bed and covering the sidewalk in chalk. Kendall called it bliss.\n\nBut Saturday, five days after their reunion, Easton started having a hard time breathing and ended up in the hospital with pneumonia.\n\nDays before, his biggest worry was whether the rain would wash away his chalk house. Don't worry, Kendall reminded him. You can draw a new one tomorrow.\n\nEaston died Tuesday morning after spending his last week at home. Kendall was with him.",

    "Household items back in stock: Where to buy hand sanitizer, wipes, toilet paper and more": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "-- Recommendations are independently chosen by Reviewed's editors. Purchases you make through our links may earn us a commission.\n\nAs most of the country remains under stay-at-home orders due to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, people are continuing to stock up on cleaning and household essentials per recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). And, as a result, those essentials are selling out at many online retailers.\n\nFrom hand sanitizer to toilet paper to thermometers, these products can help you and those you live with feel prepared for quarantine or if anyone gets sick. But they are becoming hard to find online, which can be especially stressful when you're trying to shop without leaving the house.\n\nWe've rounded up 10 of the most hard-to-find household products to have during the coronavirus outbreak and where to get them while you still can. There may be shipping delays because of increased demand, but we'll be including the products most likely to get to you the fastest. We'll also continue to update this list as supplies dwindle, so be sure to check back often.\n\nNeed help finding products? Sign up for our weekly newsletter. It's free and you can unsubscribe at any time.\n\nHand sanitizers from Purell and GermX are flying off the shelves right now, but you should be picky because the truth is, they're not all the same. Some contain an alcohol substitute known as benzalkonium chloride, which isn't as effective if you're trying to stop the spread of germs. Instead, you want to look for a hand sanitizer that has at least 60% alcohol content, according to the CDC.\n\nBut these items are selling out fast, so we definitely suggest you grab them as soon as possible. Or, you could just make your own, especially since the World Health Organization (WHO) just put together this do-it-yourself guide to creating your own sanitizer. A word of caution though -- their step-by-step instructions do require 96% ethyl alcohol.\n\nAccording to the CDC, one of the best things you can do right now to prevent the spread of coronavirus is to wash your hands frequently. That means scrubbing them after you use the bathroom, ride public transportation, blow your nose, cough, or sneeze, as well as before you eat. The American Red Cross also recommends that you wash your hands for at least 20 seconds in order to effectively clean them. While antibacterial soap is crucial, regular hand-washing is a crucial way to stop germs from spreading.\n\nDuring natural disasters and other emergencies, toilet paper always seems to be the first thing to go out of stock. The thought of running out of wipes to do your business when you can't leave the house is absolutely horrifying. While we ranked the Charmin Ultra Soft as the No. 1 toilet paper for your No. 2, in times like these, you're better off taking what your can get -- even if it's one-ply. Here are all the places you can still order toilet paper.\n\nIn most instances, paper towels can seem wasteful. While they're definitely a popular household purchase -- and we've even rounded up a list of the best paper towels you can buy right now -- they're not eco-friendly and they're expensive, which can make them seem like a luxury.\n\nBut the fact that paper towels are disposable could actually make them beneficial to have, particularly in homes where there's already someone impacted by coronavirus. The CDC recommends paper towel usage for cleaning and disinfecting homes, which makes them good to have around -- just in case.\n\nDish soap is another household item, you're going to want to have on hand. The CDC recommends that those who are affected by the coronavirus not share dishes, drinking glasses, cups or utensils. After these dishes have been used, they should be washed thoroughly with soap and water. (FYI, when we tested the best dish soap, we washed more than 125 plates, glasses, bowls and spoons, and found that Dawn Ultra was the clear winner. Not only does it cut through grease, but it's a great disinfectant as well.)\n\nA thermometer is essential for knowing whether or not you have a fever, which is one of the main symptoms of the coronavirus, according to the CDC. With many people attempting to grab a thermometer that they're missing from their medicine drawer, there are very slim pickings in-store and online right now. Thankfully, you can still find a few online -- though they may take a few days to ship.\n\nDisinfectant spray can help clear surfaces of harmful bacteria and potentially guard against the spread of coronavirus. The CDC recommends sticking to household cleaners with at least 70% alcohol, and most EPA-registered disinfectants should be effective for regular use. If you haven't already grabbed a bottle or two we'd suggest you hurry and snag one fast, as it's still hard to find.\n\nIf you're stuck at home for an extended period of time, you absolutely don't want to run out of diapers -- it could be a mess, both literally and figuratively. As you're trying to plan ahead, you may even want to buy a few extra boxes worth of diapers. Every baby is different though, and some diaper brands may work better than others, so we recommend you grab your favorite brand (whichever it may be) while you can.\n\nAlthough the major symptoms of coronavirus include a dry cough, fever, and shortness of breath, according to the CDC, it's always a good idea to have an extra box of tissues lying around. You could wind up with a runny nose due to allergies or get the cold or flu. After testing nine different boxes (and blowing many noses), we found that Puffs Ultra Soft are the best tissues and won't irritate your nose. You can stock up on these or other brands at the stores below.\n\nThe U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) released a list of disinfectants that are safe for American households to use right now to protect against the coronavirus. One of the top disinfectants on the list? Clorox Disinfecting Wipes. Made to kill up to 99.9% of surface bacteria and viruses, these wipes are easy to use, safe on most surfaces, and great to have around the house when you can find them, with manufacturer's hoping to have more in stock by this summer.\n\nThese aren't the only things selling out, non-essential items like fitness products, board games, and more are going quickly too. We'll be covering the inventory of these high-demand items, too:\n\nThe product experts at Reviewed have all your shopping needs covered.

    "How coronavirus can inspire a new era of economic innovation": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "As strange as it may sound, we need to plan now for a dynamic post-pandemic world.\n\nThe unique circumstances of the crisis have unleashed a wave of innovation and prompted unprecedented levels of regulatory relief as we deal with both a health and an economic crisis.\n\nHundreds, if not thousands, of rules and regulations at the federal and state levels have been lifted or relaxed during the pandemic.\n\nAt the same time, American workers -- from employees in large companies to gig hustlers -- are adapting and innovating in new ways and at new speeds. Our \"new normal\" in the future should incorporate lessons learned from this period.\n\nCongress could help by creating an independent commission to study how laws and regulations inhibited or facilitated innovation and adaptation during the crisis. Dynamism means much more than \"light touch\" regulatory agencies. It is also about encouraging a culture of creative experimentation at all levels of the economy.\n\nThe innovation we are seeing during the crisis, from accelerated drug approvals to small-scale personal protective equipment production, should help guide our regulatory reform efforts in the future.\n\nThe national commission should include state representatives among its members, or encourage parallel state commissions, because many limits to dynamism exist at the state level. Previous ideas for regulatory commissions, both in the United States and abroad, could serve as a model for Congress.\n\nInitially, the commission could concentrate on four factors that have been revolutionized by innovation during the pandemic:\n\n\u25baSpeed. COVID-19 has forced many companies to discard protocols to adapt to our new reality. The most obvious example is in pharmaceutical development. It hasn't been perfect, but drug companies and regulators are learning to share information more effectively and undo requirements that slow progress.\n\nShare your coronavirus story: Contact USA TODAY Opinion's hotline. We may publish your comments.\n\nThe commission could look at how new information and supercomputing systems -- together with simpler, more standardized clinical trials -- could lower costs and speed up drug development.\n\nMore generally, during the pandemic, companies have been reinventing processes and systems practically overnight, from supply chain management in food delivery to sporting goods purchases and 3D printing. A commission should study the manner in which the regulatory environment interacted with such innovation, whether positively or negatively.\n\n\u25baDistance. The process for removing barriers to physical distance will accelerate after the crisis. One obvious example is telemedicine. There is no need to go to the doctor's office unless medically necessary; yet state licensing and referral laws complicate telehealth and should be reworked.\n\nDistance learning has now become the norm by the sheer force of school closures, and parents and employers understandably want to see kids back in school as soon as possible. But new opportunities for remote learning models should emerge from this experience, and state requirements should adapt to them.\n\nOther distance-reducing technologies range from increasing the use of drones to deliver products to expanded broadband access to rural areas, all of which have implications for regulatory frameworks.\n\n\u25baHealth. New ways of detecting and dealing with health threats are set to proliferate because of the coronavirus. Innovation on this front is already exploding. From reusable protective masks, to health apps that detect symptoms and deliver medical advice, to detection kits that produce immediate results for multiple viruses, the pandemic has prompted a wave of innovation that will improve our quality of life.\n\nWe may even have robots in our offices and homes one day that can kill viruses and bacteria without using chemicals, and technology that can \"smell\" whether viruses are in a room in the first place.\n\n\u25baBusiness. We should pay special attention to reforms that promote greater adaptability and flexibility, especially among smaller businesses and sole proprietors. The pandemic has prompted a lot of adaptive repurposing in a number of sectors, from local distillers producing hand sanitizer to electronics firms producing protective masks.\n\nOur rules should encourage maximum adaptability and flexibility, such as with 3D printing that has allowed small and large companies to fill in gaps in the supply chain. Fintech, the integration of technology into financial services, has grown considerably during the pandemic and made commercial activity easier for small businesses and gig workers.\n\nRules that inhibit adaptability, such as limits on what health care workers and hospitals can do to meet needs, should be up for review.\n\nWe need dynamism to get us through the crisis, and we will need it as we rebuild our economy afterward. Thinking now about how that should look is incredibly important.",

    "Huffington, Harvard dean: End mental health stigma for front-line doctors": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "The tragic death of Dr. Lorna M. Breen -- who was the medical director of the emergency department of New York-Presbyterian Allen Hospital -- underscores yet another, perhaps lesser known public health crisis brutally unfolding before us.\n\nBreen's upper Manhattan medical center had been hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic. In a conversation with her father, she described the \"onslaught\" of patients arriving day in and day out -- some of whom didn't even make it out of the ambulance alive. The toll of treating patient after patient in severe acute respiratory distress, on top of a lack of personal protective equipment, testing and the pure psychic trauma of watching this pandemic unfold, ultimately proved too much for Breen. On April 26, she died by suicide.\n\nEven under normal circumstances, health care providers suffer from burnout at an alarming rate. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, 78% of physicians surveyed in 2018 said they had experienced some symptoms of burnout. It's a condition that tends to manifest in three ways: First comes emotional exhaustion -- constantly feeling mentally and physically depleted, and unable to recharge while off-the-clock. Second is depersonalization -- developing a negative or cynical outlook toward the work. Third is a reduced sense of personal accomplishment -- feeling incompetent or ineffective at the job. These manifestations can lead to a range of outcomes, from medical errors to suicide.\n\nNow, these same health care providers are being asked to shoulder once-in-a-lifetime burdens. Every day for the past two months, just like Breen, they have faced a staggering volume of severe cases and deaths, along with the risk of getting themselves and their loved ones sick.\n\nAnd with no end to this pandemic in sight, these continued burdens are not sustainable for anyone's well-being. If we do not begin to seriously support the mental, physical and emotional health of our frontline workers, we will certainly suffer more tragedies.\n\nGratefully, there are options. We know a lot about how we can care for the people who care for us. And now is the time to turn this knowledge into action.\n\nVOICES: Children will be OK after COVID-19, just as I was after the Gulf War\n\n\u25baFirst, hospitals and health care organizations must recognize burnout and make addressing it an organizational priority. That means adequately staffing emergency rooms and ICUs so individual workers are able to take much-needed breaks. It also means providing overall wellness training that emphasizes nutrition, exercise and stress management so that employees are better equipped to handle the strain of working in an intensive hospital setting. And it means removing barriers to better patient treatment, including unnecessary documentation and other administrative tasks that pull doctors away from actually being doctors.\n\n\u25baSecond, front-line health care workers must be supported in prioritizing their own well-being. The fact is, they cannot care for others unless they carve out time and space to care for themselves. In addition to regular breaks and healthy meals, small things like breathing exercises, stretching and practicing gratitude and mindfulness can help combat mental and emotional fatigue on and off duty. These steps will go a long way toward making health workers more resilient and effective in the face of this crisis. All major health organizations should also appoint an executive-level chief wellness officer to prioritize the physical and mental well-being of its staff.\n\n\u25baMost important, we must remove any stigma around seeking treatment for mental health. Health care providers need to feel comfortable asking for help or any additional resources within their hospitals, and facilities must be proactive in offering more mental health resources. Additionally, no health care worker should fear retaliation or punishment for seeking mental health help. Removing any such stigma is critical to the quality care we all receive.\n\nVOICES: Muslim hearts ache as coronavirus keeps us apart during Ramadan\n\nBreen's father said that \"she tried to do her job, and it killed her.\" We must not let this moment -- nor Breen's sacrifice and that of every other front-line worker who struggles with grief, loss, stress or anxiety -- define our health care system.\n\nWhen the history of this pandemic is written, health care workers -- from hospice and home-care staff to physician assistants and EMTs -- will be remembered for meeting this moment with courage and compassion. We owe it to these heroes to show up for them the way they've shown up for us, through this crisis and beyond.",

    "I got tested for coronavirus and was surprised at my emotional reaction": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "I guess it was the former reporter in me. Los Angeles County announced April 29 that every resident -- symptomatic or not -- could now get a free coronavirus test. I had no suspicion I had it, but I had been watching the most important event of our era and my life unfold in horrible, vivid color seven days a week for months from afar. I wanted to inch closer. And I had been hearing for weeks how testing is key to our recovery.\n\nL.A. County has borne the brunt of California's COVID-19 ordeal, with more than 33,000 cases and over 1,600 deaths reported as of Tuesday night. Mothers, fathers, brothers, sisters. We've all seen the grief. It's gut wrenching. Thousands are experiencing that firsthand.\n\nBut not everyone is. Many of us are having a different, much more mundane experience. Many of us are just sitting, isolated, watching cable. I wanted to see something with my own eyes. To thank a health care worker, maybe. And I could actually have the virus and be asymptomatic. I haven't seen my 92-year-old stepmother since this began, but as things begin to loosen up, I've begun to want to see Mary Lou. Obviously, if I have it, I won't. And I'd need to wait until I was no longer contagious.\n\nAlso, it could help in a broader way.\n\nIn announcing the expanded testing, L.A. Mayor Eric Garcetti said it is essential to getting the city back up and running. And I wouldn't be taking a test away from those who needed it more. \"Priority for the same or next-day testing is still given to people with symptoms,\" the city announced, adding that testing is also prioritized for medical professionals and other front-line workers who interact with the public.\n\n\"Because this disease can be a silent killer, we have carefully built the capacity to get more people tested,\" Garcetti said. \"No one should have to wait, wonder, or risk infecting others. Don't leave it to chance. Schedule a test.\"\n\n(The city actually had a surplus of tests -- even while some areas across the country are experiencing shortages -- because it had made procurement a priority, according to the mayor's office, which is hoping to be reimbursed for testing costs by the Federal Emergency Management Agency.)\n\nSo yes, I wanted to do it.\n\nI quickly made my reservation and watched the brief video: It would be a simple mouth swab self-administered from the comfort of my own car. No discomfort, no walking into a doctor's office. I could do that. I was ready.\n\nWhat I wasn't prepared for: an emotional reaction. I was moved. Was it seeing the gowned and masked front-liners in real life? The selfless nurses, techs and volunteers I had seen or heard of over and over, some of them crying, some of them sick, some of them with us no more? Or was it the sense of unity? Scores of Angelenos in one of the most populous counties in the country were doing it with me. (L.A. tested 10,000 in one day.) Surely many of those in the cars in line with me were worried they were sick. For them, this wasn't altruism or anything else. But I had a sense that others were doing it to help, too, or to make it real.\n\nCoronavirus: Protesters should demand coronavirus safety and a reopened economy. We can have both.\n\nAt any rate, it was far easier than I had imagined. I was expecting a one-hour ordeal -- or even two. Nope. Probably 20 minutes from start to finish.\n\nI pulled into the sprawling Veteran Affairs grounds, and the snaking began. Signs said \"KEEP WINDOWS ROLLED ALL THE WAY UP.\" All right ... this was serious. And safe. I felt safe.\n\nMy first point of contact was a young man holding a sign reminding me to watch the instructional video. Check. Then a sign told me to ready my reservation number and ID. Check. Another sign reminded me to keep my windows closed.\n\nAs I neared the check-in area, I could see that the driver of the car ahead of me had written his reservation number on a piece of paper and held it up to his closed window to help the check-in worker. I did the same and got a big thank you for my Boy Scoutedness from the man who also gave me my test kit. Using a 3-foot pole with grabbers on the end of it, he maintained his social distance to deliver the goods through my slightly opened window: a little plastic bag bearing the scary biohazard symbol and containing a surprisingly tiny swab -- more like an overgrown toothpick than a Q-tip -- and the little vial to place it in when done.\n\nAs I advanced further, I got a little nervous. Yes, I had watched the video, but it had been a few days and I didn't want to screw this up. Would someone help me? Indeed, she would. My windows still closed tight, another angel in a yellow gown, face mask and plastic face shield and gloves, who I could barely hear, began a pantomime: She motioned for me to cough into my elbow (this brings up lung fluid), then open the bag with the goods and extract the smaller bag with the swab. Now, go forth and swab. A little instruction pamphlet also helped: insides of both cheeks, tongue, gums, roof of mouth. After a moment or two, the angel returned and instructed me to place the swab in the vial and place the vial in the bigger scary bag. Done.\n\nI had brought a garden rose to give to one of the workers, but of course, she couldn't take it. I held it up to the window, we shared our regrets, and she put her hands in prayer position and did a little bow of thanks. I got the feels.\n\nI drove ahead a little more, and another grabber-pole worker extracted my bag. I was done. I was stunned. So quick. Anticlimactic.\n\nOf course, I had to instantly call a friend and share. He happens to be a doctor and couldn't believe I had taken the test. He would never have done it. Too many false positives, he said.\n\nOh well, guess there's that. Not worried. Guess I could get tested again.\n\nAnother friend raised the specter of like, CIA surveillance. I'd be part of a Big Brother database. Well, there is that, too, I suppose, though nobody has asked me to enter my results into my cellphone yet, a la South Korea. And hey, they've done a pretty good job of squelching this thing (although they had a new cluster of infections last weekend).\n\nSo, I thought, I'll just stay away from Edward Snowden's Twitter feed for now, wait patiently for my results and think positive -- or rather, negative -- thoughts.\n\nCoronavirus: People need people, but it's risky to resume social activities so soon\n\nI'm glad I did it. I was impressed with how smoothly it went. Felt a little city pride there. And other friends have plied me for details. Sure, I'd rather have had an antibody test. I'd love to be immune, part of the Newly Prestigious Herd, although nobody knows how long immunity might last. Effing germ. But it has been so odd to experience a momentous albeit horrible event wreaking havoc worldwide -- and yet somehow feel removed from it, toilet paper travails, mounting financial challenges and existential dread notwithstanding.\n\nI feel a little bit less remote now. Maybe I've done my tiny part to help fill in the overall picture of the thing. And I had a chance to thank one of those angels, even if I had to take home that rose.\n\nAs it turns out, my test results were negative. Still not going to visit stepmom, though. L.A. is beginning to ease its stay-at-home orders. But I'm going to wait a little longer. At least a little.",

    "In CA: A call to donate stimulus checks to support undocumented families who won't get them": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "Happy Friday! Filling in for Arlene Martinez, I'm Rebecca Plevin, immigration reporter for The Desert Sun in Palm Springs. Today, I've got the news you need to know from around the Golden State, with a special focus on California's immigrant community.\n\nBut first, more than 95,000 nurses at 139 hospitals in 13 states were slated to take part in protests today, on International Workers' Day, to demand better protections during the coronavirus pandemic, Nicole Hayden reports for The Desert Sun. The holiday comes this year as the state records more than 50,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and more than 2,000 deaths as a result of the virus.\n\n\"Nurses signed up to care for their patients. They did not sign up to sacrifice their lives on the front lines of the COVID-19 pandemic,\" NNU Executive Director Bonnie Castillo said in a press release. \"On this day that celebrates the labor movement and working people, union nurses are standing up to demand the protections they need now!\"\n\nStay safe and informed with news and resources from across the USA TODAY Network and beyond: Sign up to receive In California in your inbox. While you're at it, sign up to get Climate Point, a weekly newsletter that digs into everything climate, energy and the environment.\n\nWould you donate your $1,200 stimulus check to undocumented immigrants who aren't eligible to receive the federal assistance?\n\nUndocumented people -- who comprise an estimated one in 10 California workers -- are ineligible for the stimulus funding or unemployment insurance. Now, with millions of Californians laid off or working fewer hours as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, many undocumented people and their families are struggling and have no safety net.\n\nThe leaders of 805 Undocufund, a collective effort among community organizations in Ventura and Santa Barbara counties that provides disaster relief to undocumented people and families, are calling on people who haven't been financially impacted by the crisis to donate their federal stimulus checks, reports Erin Rode for the Ventura County Star.\n\n\"We're thinking of it in terms of equity and sharing the dollars that people receive from the federal government, because it's about supporting undocumented families when they're not receiving any other type of support,\" said Eder Gaona-Macedo, executive director of Future Leaders of America.\n\nSo far, the fund has distributed about $300,000 to 300 families in Ventura and Santa Barbara counties, prioritizing the 65% of applicants who were completely laid off. The fund mimics stimulus payments by providing around $1,200 per family.\n\nIn the Coachella Valley, meanwhile, a group of young people have launched a GoFundMe campaign to provide food baskets and food gift cards to farmworkers. As of Friday, the fund had raised nearly $9,800.\n\nMore than 500 of the approximately 30,000 immigrants detained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement have tested positive for COVID-19. As of Friday afternoon, 522 of 1,073 detainees tested -- about 49% of those tested -- had confirmed cases of the virus, according to ICE. Of those, 522 positive cases, 105 are at Otay Mesa Detention Center in San Diego.\n\nAs of Friday morning, however, there were no confirmed cases of the virus at the Adelanto ICE Processing Center in the Mojave Desert, one of the county's largest immigration detention centers. But as I reported today for The Desert Sun, a court filing reveals that very few detainees there have been tested for the virus.\n\nA total of six of the 1,295 people held at the 1,940-bed facility had been tested as of last Thursday, according to an ICE official. He said the testing protocol at Adelanto follows guidance issued by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\n\"You can't have confirmed cases if you don't test people,\" said Minju Cho, an attorney for the ACLU of Southern California. \"There may well be an outbreak at the facility and we would not even know about it, because the testing to identify such an outbreak is not being done.\"\n\nSouth of the border, meanwhile, families in Mexicali and Juarez are struggling as the coronavirus pandemic has caused a global economic shutdown, sending oil prices and the value of the Mexican peso crashing, report Omar Ornelas of The Desert Sun and Lauren Villagran of the El Paso Times.\n\nThat means families across the Mexican borderland -- hundreds of thousands of whom have been furloughed, laid off or surviving on sharply reduced wages -- are stuck with a currency whose purchasing power is evaporating.\n\n\"With what I used to spend on groceries, it's nowhere near enough now,\" Josefina Ochoa said outside of a Mexicali supermarket. \"You have to be careful. If you bought ham before, now you buy bologna.\"\n\nSpeaking of the pandemic making waves across the border: The coronavirus is making it harder for L.A. restaurants to serve essential Oaxacan dishes like tlayudas, moles and chapulines, Patricia Esc\u00e1rcega reports for the L.A. Times.\n\nBefore the coronavirus hit California, Esc\u00e1rcega writes, Ivan Vasquez, the owner of a Oaxacan restaurant, was spending about $2,525 on Oaxacan ingredients and delivery fees every week. But with lunch and dinner orders down dramatically, Vasquez is now spending less than half what he used to on Oaxacan ingredients.\n\n\"This is affecting a whole chain of people working with us,\" he said.\n\nArlene asked Ventura County Star reporter Wendy Leung to share about some of the hundreds of stories hard-working journalists there have written since the coronavirus began. The Star, like newsrooms across the USA TODAY Network, has been working tirelessly to bring readers critical updates and dispatches from the front lines.\n\nIt costs money to do that, and our company, mirroring the industry, has seen sharp declines in revenue. Please consider subscribing to your local media outlet so we can keep our vital work going, during the coronavirus and long after it's passed.\n\nWithout any further adieu, here's Wendy:\n\n\"In Ventura County, The Star knew its team would be writing about coronavirus for the long haul in late February. A traveler who had just come from Hubei, China, would stay in a quarantine site at Naval Base Ventura County. He was not a coronavirus patient and showed no symptoms but the story alarmed some readers.\n\nOn March 10, reporter Cheri Carlson helped organize a meeting to coordinate coronavirus coverage. A question we wanted to ask: Are local groups canceling events such as the St. Patrick's Day parade? The answer was no.\n\nThree days later everyone in the newsroom was packing up, preparing to work from home.\n\nAt that time, the stories we were writing became obsolete the next day. Sometimes news would change hours after publication. A county superintendent said in an interview that a school might close if one of its students or teachers tested positive for the virus but it would be limited to that school, not an entire district. Two days later, the superintendent announced that all schools of the county's 20 districts would shutter.\n\nOur team of reporters and photographers went straight to work telling the story of a virus that was shutting down the economy faster than we could type. We wrote about a survivor who described pain she had never felt before and we wrote about a man who died alone with family on the other side of a glass window.\n\nWe wrote about the farmworkers who are working through the pandemic and the efforts to provide them with hazard pay and extended sick leave. We also looked through existing video footage we had during more crowded times and returned to shoot new footage showing the stunning contrast of a county on lockdown. We even showed our readers where to buy toilet paper. Hint: Not at a supermarket.\n\nIf there is a silver lining to all this -- and we're always looking for one these days -- it's that an empty newsroom has finally allowed our landlord to tent the building for termites. We don't know what the world will look like when working from home ends but we know at least there won't be termites.\"",

        "body": "Medical volunteers administer COVID-19 exams in Mecca during a free test location organized by Coachella Valley Volunteers in Medicine on April 29, 2020.\n\nFilling in for the lovely Arlene Martinez, I'm Nicole Hayden, health reporter with The Desert Sun in Palm Springs. Today, I've got the news you need to know from around the Golden State, and, of course, a conversation about the intersection of health and poverty amid the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nBut first, Gov. Gavin Newsom on Wednesday said that during the next two months low-income families will receive $365 per child for food to make up for the loss of free or reduced-price lunches that would normally be provided by schools. Newsom said about $1.4 billion in federal funds will be provided to 3.8 million California families.\n\n\"We are going to do our best to get [the money] in people's pockets because we deeply recognize people's food insecurity, not just their economic insecurity,\" Newsom said during his daily press briefing.\n\nStay safe and informed with news and resources from across the USA TODAY Network and beyond: Sign up for In California today (it's free!).\n\nIn idyllic Palm Springs, the town is sleepy and the streets are empty. In a city known for chic hotels and expensive cocktails, many have the privilege of isolating comfortably in their homes. But that relaxing pandemic life does not extend through the whole Coachella Valley.\n\nIn the eastern Coachella Valley -- home to the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival -- daily life is still buzzing. Traffic is jammed, parking lots are full and people still stop in to get their daily gas station coffee or drive-thru Starbucks. It's not because people are ignoring the stay-at-home order. It's because the far edge of the valley is home to essential workers including agricultural workers, manufacturers and packing plant workers.\n\nOne congressman wants targeted COVID-19 testing in the eastern Coachella Valley because of the increased risk of spread in the community, especially since these under-served communities often have higher rates of underlying health conditions, like asthma, that can exasperate coronavirus symptoms.\n\nWhat is happening in the far Coachella Valley is similar to what is occurring in farm-working communities across the state.\n\nIn Monterey County, nearly 25% of the county's positive COVID-19 cases are agricultural workers.\n\n\"Ag workers are uniquely vulnerable to this virus because of the close proximity they often work and live,\" said California Assemblymember Robert Rivas, a Democrat representing the Salinas and Pajaro Valleys in an April interview. \"Farmworkers can't often take the necessary steps to protect themselves.\"\n\nFear among the undocumented community, which is comprised of many farmworkers, could also be contributing to spread because individuals have expressed concern that getting tested could lead to deportation or loss of a chance at a green card.\n\nAdvocacy organizations are working to correct spread of misinformation and even provide some tough love:\n\n\"If you have any symptoms, it's important for you to get diagnosed and get treatment,\" Luz Gallegos, community programs director for TODEC, said she tells callers on the other end of the line. \"If you're not alive, you're never going to get a green card.\"\n\nAside from increased risk to exposure on large farms, the pandemic has also impacted the finances of smaller farms. One father-and-son duo in Southern California reported only selling half of the produce they normally sell at this time of year.\n\n\"Before the coronavirus, we sold everything,\" Javier said in a raspy, gentle voice. \"And now it's slower and slower. Now we're selling about half.\"\n\nNewsom on Tuesday discussed a path to reopening the state, though he didn't say when. That hasn't stopped people from planning, discussing and dreaming about what life will look like when the curtain lifts.\n\nIn the Bay Area, officials discussed how the changes to daily life post-pandemic will impact seniors. Officials say the changes will be most challenging for seniors and others who are most at-risk for developing serious symptoms and complications from the virus.\n\nThe San Francisco Chronicle reported that California is home to 5.3 million people who are 65 years or older, an age group that makes up eight out of 10 coronavirus-related deaths in the US, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\n\"It is going to be a new way of life,\" said Dr. Nima Afshar, who specializes in emergency and internal medicine at the San Francisco VA Medical Center. \"It takes a minor risk, like high blood pressure, to make them more vulnerable to coronavirus.\"\n\nDisneyland in California is likely to not open for months under the state's orders, but when it does, the experience will be quite different than how people remember it.\n\nDuring phase 1 of its reopening, the park could operate at half capacity. In phase 2, at 75% capacity.\n\nThis lower capacity could mean shorter wait time for rides (that could be a perk)!\n\nAdditionally, employees would wear face masks, when standing in line people would have to stand 6 feet apart, staff would have their temperatures checked prior to their shifts, hand sanitizer would be placed at all ticketing entries, turnstiles and at each entry and exit for rides, and railings and surfaces would be wiped down regularly.\n\nGovernment researchers reported Wednesday that remdesivir, an antiviral medication, was shown to help patients with advanced COVID-19 symptoms recover more quickly than a placebo treatment.\n\nThe Los Angeles Times reported that the early results, emerging from a large clinical trial sponsored by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, has positioned the drug to be a standard medication for hospitalized patients moving forward.\n\nThe study showed that patients who received the antiviral recovered 31% faster than those who received a placebo.\n\nPOLITICO reported that National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases director Anthony Fauci cautioned that the drug was not a complete \"knockout\" in the study, which was the first randomized clinical trial to deliver results on a potential coronavirus drug.\n\nHowever, what he did say the trial was promising because \"it has proven is that a drug can block this virus.\"\n\nThanks for reading and don't forget to subscribe to In California if you haven't already.\n\nI will leave you with a peek into the favorite part of my pandemic days: cooking!\n\nThe San Francisco Chronicle caught up with Bay Area chefs to find out what recipes they are cooking during at home while isolating.\n\nThis past week it has soared above 100 degrees in Palm Springs, which has inspired me to bookmark some favorite New York Times Cooking recipes like this pulled barbecue sandwich or this light olive oil cake.",

        "body": "It wasn't meant to be a taunt, but my son Asher couldn't stand it whenever I took note of the milestones he reached during his passage through college. \"Congratulations, you've completed one-eighth of your undergraduate career,\" I told him at winter break of his freshman year in 2016.\n\nIt was the start of a regular series of cringes.\n\nThe youngest of three, Asher was a late bloomer, the one who never went on a sleepover or tolerated being alone or far from his creature comforts. It was thus a surprise he chose to attend Emory University, 800 miles away in Atlanta, unlike his older brother and sister, both of whom stayed much closer to home.\n\nAnd he savored college more than either sibling -- group study sessions, fraternity bonding, campus hang-outs and bars, the well-appointed gym and library, traveling to Mardi Gras, and the independence to check in on his terms.\n\nNo wonder that by the time he finished sophomore year and I said, \"Guess what?\" his response was, \"Dad, don't.\"\n\nI was marveling at his progress, whereas he wanted no reminder that the candle had burned half-way down.\n\nWhen he came home for his last spring break in early March, I stopped myself from announcing he'd hit 87.5%, sensing that school might not resume as the coronavirus began to spread nationally. Sure enough, Emory shut down and he'd have to spend the final, glorious 12.5% of his senior semester sheltering with his parents -- no year-end parties, hugs or kegs, no graduation or closure on this momentous chapter of his life. We were his campus now.\n\nAsher didn't exactly blame my wife Sarah and me for the pandemic, though you might have thought it from the iciness he displayed at our presence, preferring to self-isolate in his room or whiz by us as if we were carriers. He took meals in solitary like a prisoner, and it was hard to know if he was doing any actual work from the sound of his PlayStation on the other side of the door.\n\nWhen I dared to ask one evening whether he could smell his coffee -- a not-so-subtle reference to a suspected Covid-19 symptom -- he blew up and so did I. The candle had become a trigger fuse.\n\nShare your coronavirus story: Contact USA TODAY Opinion's hotline. We may publish your comments.\n\nBut after a week or so of Groundhog Day repetition, and reports from his friends that they were all stuck in the same loop, the resentment started to fade and he let us back into his world, giving us a passing glimpse of his college experience.\n\n\"What's that tune?\" I asked one weekday afternoon finding him in the kitchen playing his guitar. He gently shook his head and pointed to his laptop -- he was taking a remote biology class, and strumming along, feet propped up. Seemed unorthodox, but then there I was in my own home detention on client conference calls while doing push-ups and planks.\n\nOver the following weeks, we saw an Asher we never knew before. He made a fresh pesto sauce and rolled his own pappardelle, and baked a raspberry olive oil cake, deftly handling a whisk. He assembled a desk, and the chair to go with it. And cooked a porterhouse steak. He taught himself \"Let It Be\" on the piano. After a while, he Facetimed with his girlfriend in Connecticut while we were in the same room.\n\nHe also kept virtual office hours as a teaching assistant for a class in human physiology -- you could hear the strong rapport he had with his underclass students. He let me review a paper he wrote on plant-based meat substitutes, with impressive charts and graphs. And he spent long stretches counting individual snail parasites on slides for an advanced epidemiology lab. \"More detritus is a better food source and leads to higher cercaria larval output,\" he explained, which I understood to mean he knew what he was doing.\n\nAsher hasn't exactly been the perfect housemate. He leaves his hard seltzer cans and oat milk cartons on the counter for Sarah and me to put away. And he hijacks several rooms at once for his workouts. Don't bother asking him to walk the dog or empty a wastebasket -- and never expect a response when he's scrolling through his phone.\n\nBut \"Tiger King\" was sure a lot more riveting with him groaning beside us in our darkened living room. And on days when the weather was mild, he and I snuck to our town's shuttered ballfields to shag fly balls like we did when he was in high school.\n\nWith graduation approaching, Emory sent a notice that a Commencement Task Force was in place to help seniors \"celebrate the culmination of your academic journey\" with a variety of virtual festivities that would have to stand in for the physical ceremony the virus derailed.\n\n\"While these in-person moments will have to wait for another day, we are eager to join your family and friends in celebrating the extraordinary accomplishments of your class,\" the letter said, noting the launch of an interactive website whereby graduates could upload \"messages, photos, and videos celebrating...your induction as our newest alumni class.\"\n\nFaculty and family were invited to participate in this group embrace under the rules of social distancing. It took away a little of the sting from the fact that Asher's college narrative -- like that of millions of graduates nationwide -- was concluding with a disappointing fade-out.\n\nYet, he found a way to write his own ending. I peeked into his room the other night -- he was sipping a glass of malted Scotch and Zooming a birthday party for a friend in Atlanta. The screen was filled with scruffy faces and Asher was yelping and cursing and shouting \"dude!\" as if he were in the middle of a real bash at his apartment and not a curated digital version.\n\nThe next day he whooped again -- after being offered a gap-year clinical research job in a pediatric hospital on Long Island while he applies to medical school. We still have a few weeks to go before the official end of the college line, but I'd have to say he was at 100%.\n\nAnd starting at zero for the next chapter -- not that I plan on telling him.",

    "Jerry Seinfeld on which 'Seinfeld' character would do best in pandemic": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "How would our favorite characters weather a global pandemic?\n\nIt's a hypothetical that TV heavyweights Tina Fey (\"30 Rock\"), Norman Lear (\"All in the Family\") and David Mandel (\"Veep\") ingeniously answered in a Vulture interview last month, and NBC's \"Parks and Recreation\" heartwarmingly brought to life last week, in a special benefit episode that reunited Leslie Knope (Amy Poehler) and other beloved characters.\n\nJerry Seinfeld was posed the same question during a conference call with journalists Monday to promote his Netflix comedy special \"23 Hours to Kill,\" streaming Tuesday. The \"Seinfeld\" star was asked which of the sardonic foursome - Jerry, Elaine (Julia Louis-Dreyfus), George (Jason Alexander) or Kramer (Michael Richards) - he'd be most curious to see handle a quarantine.\n\nMore: 'Seinfeld' will move to Netflix after the streamer loses its 'Friends' and 'Office' buddies\n\n\"I think George would be the most interesting, trying to deal with the social distancing,\" Seinfeld says. \"I feel like the others would really like it and really enjoy the lack of social difficulties that they always have.\"\n\nSadly, fans won't see what that might look like anytime soon: Seinfeld says he hasn't spoken to his \"Seinfeld\" co-stars or co-creator Larry David about reuniting for a coronavirus-themed episode in the vein of \"Parks and Recreation.\"\n\n\"I didn't see that and I haven't had any conversations about it (with them),\" Seinfeld says. But \"that sounds like a lot of work.\"\n\n\"23 Hours to Kill\" was taped at New York's Beacon Theatre this past year, and is Seinfeld's first original standup special in 22 years. (\"Jerry Before Seinfeld,\" streamed on Netflix in 2017, featured early material that jumpstarted his career.) Throughout the hourlong set, Seinfeld runs through mostly family-friendly jokes about texting, Pop-Tarts and marriage, and even jumps out of a helicopter into the Hudson River, in an elaborate opening segment nodding to the special's spy-movie title.\n\nWith many coronavirus experts predicting that live events such as concerts, theater and sports won't return until next year, Seinfeld, 66, is unsure when he'll get back in front of an audience. But he wants to wait until restrictions on large gatherings are lifted completely, whenever that may be.\n\n\"If you're going into a theater and it's only one quarter full and everybody's got 10 seats between them, I don't know if that's worth doing for me,\" Seinfeld says. \"I'm going to wait until everyone does feel comfortable gathering so that you can relax and have a good time. I'm happy to wait - I don't want to compromise the experience. ... When you go see a comedian that you love and you laugh, it's a great release. And I think people are going to want and need it very much when the time comes. But I want to wait 'til we can really do it.\"\n\nMore: Jerry Seinfeld on new season of 'Comedians in Cars,' whether he'd invite Trump on his show\n\nBut when that time does come, Seinfeld has little interest in writing and performing new material that addresses our current moment. Although he does have one coronavirus-related joke in mind.\n\n\"I was asking a comedian friend of mine the other day, (\"Saturday Night Live\" alum) Colin Quinn, and he said people are going to be sick of it by the time we get into those venues and (they're) not going to want to hear about it,\" Seinfeld says. \"I mean, a great joke is a great joke if you have a great joke about the virus. What I've been saying about it is, if I was another virus, I would be intensely jealous of this virus coming up with this 'two weeks of no symptoms' idea. It's like the most brilliant bit that a virus ever thought of: that we can spread without them knowing that we're in there. So, you know, the virus has got some very clever stuff.\"",

        "authors": [],
        "body": "\"60 Minutes\" correspondent Lesley Stahl says she's feeling better after a battle with COVID-19 that left her hospitalized for a week.\n\n\"One of the rules of journalism is 'Don't become part of the story,'\" Stahl said at the end of Sunday's broadcast. \"But instead of covering the pandemic, I was one of the more than one million Americans who did become part of it.\"\n\nThe veteran journalist, 78, said she was \"really scared\" as she spent two weeks in bed with pneumonia before going to the hospital.\n\nOnce there, she said, \"I found an overworked, nearly overwhelmed staff; every one of them kind, sympathetic, gentle and caring from the moment I arrived until the moment days later when I was wheeled out through a gauntlet of cheering medical workers.\"\n\nStahl said she wasn't the only staffer at the CBS show to test positive for the novel coronavirus, but that it hit everyone differently. \"One COVID-positive '60 Minutes' co-worker had almost no symptoms, while others had almost every symptom you can imagine. Each case is different,\" she said.\n\nCoronavirus live updates: DHS says China hid outbreak's severity; Donald Trump revises US estimates; British PM Boris Johnson speaks out\n\nAnd Stahl is not the only television journalist to test positive for the virus. CNN's Chris Cuomo and Brooke Baldwin both have talked about their illnesses. Cuomo continued to conduct his prime-time show from his basement as he recovered. ABC's George Stephanopoulos had it, too, but reported only mild symptoms.\n\nIn her closing Sunday, Stahl paid tribute to medical staff and the care she received: \"They were fulfilling a mission, answering the call. Thanks to them, like so many other patients, I am well now. Tonight, we all owe them our gratitude, our admiration - and in some cases, our lives.\"\n\nMore than 1.15 million people in the United States have tested positive for COVID-19 as of Sunday night; 67,674 have died, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University.",

    "MLB discussing plan to start season in late June, playing in home stadiums with realigned league": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "Then again, maybe it just might work.\n\nMajor League Baseball officials have become cautiously optimistic this week that the season will start in late June, and no later than July 2, playing at least 100 regular-season games, according to three executives with knowledge of the talks. They requested anonymity because the plan is still under consideration.\n\nAnd not only would baseball be played, but it would be played in their own major-league ballparks, albeit with no fans.\n\nMLB is considering a three-division, 10-team plan in which teams play only within their division - a concept gaining support among owners and executives. It would abolish the traditional American and National Leagues, and realign the divisions based on geography.\n\nThe plan, pending approval of medical experts and providing that COVID-19 testing is available to the public, would eliminate the need for players to be in isolation and allow them to still play at their home ballparks while severely reducing travel.\n\nThe divisions would keep many of the natural rivals together, while playing one another before an expanded playoff format.\n\nHere's a look at the possible realignment structure:\n\nEAST\n\nNew York Yankees and Mets, Boston Red Sox, Washington Nationals, Baltimore Orioles, Philadelphia Phillies, Pittsburgh Pirates, Toronto Blue Jays, Tampa Bay Rays, Miami Marlins\n\nWEST\n\nLos Angeles Dodgers and Angels, San Francisco Giants, Oakland Athletics, San Diego Padres, Arizona Diamondbacks, Colorado Rockies, Texas Rangers, Houston Astros, Seattle Mariners\n\nCENTRAL\n\nChicago Cubs and Chicago White Sox, Milwaukee Brewers, St. Louis Cardinals, Kansas City Royals, Cincinnati Reds, Cleveland Indians, Minnesota Twins, Atlanta Braves, Detroit Tigers\n\nIt's too early to expound on the details, the officials cautioned, with new ideas floated each week.\n\nIt's also not known whether teams would have to open the season in Arizona, Florida and Texas for several weeks before everyone could return to their home stadiums. Yet, they could squeeze in 100 to 110 games, and perhaps even have several thousand fans in attendance before or during the playoffs.\n\nEARLY IDEA:MLB considers radical move for 2020 season\n\nREFUNDS:MLB paves way for teams to refund COVID-19 postponements\n\n\"It's all coming together,'' one of the officials said. \"I'm very optimistic.\"\n\nOne of the additional benefits to playing in major-league cities is it would alleviate a possible split among players who are opposed to playing the entire season in Arizona/Florida/Texas. Several high-profile players, including the Angels' Mike Trout and the Dodgers' Clayton Kershaw expressed strong resistance to playing the season away from their families.\n\nMLB and union officials have yet to engage in formal discussions about the financial ramifications of playing without fans, with three owners telling USA TODAY Sports three weeks ago that they would refuse to play unless the players were willing to take a pay cut. Four other team officials insist they would require financial relief from the players.\n\nYet, there is now optimism among executives that they could settle their differences in negotiations on a sliding scale depending on the loss of revenue from gate receipts, parking and concessions. Teams also would have to revise their revenue-sharing plan.\n\nThe most encouraging signs, the officials said, is that testing is becoming more available, more states are re-opening, and more politicians such as New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo and Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot saying teams could play in their own ballparks this summer.\n\nMLB teams likely will still return to their own spring-training facilities in Arizona and Florida when they resume workouts. Players are expected to be given a week to return to spring training sites, and have 18 to 21 days before the start of the season.\n\nVeteran agent Scott Boras proposed that players report to spring training in May, beginning with the pitchers and catchers. Players would be isolated from the population for three to four weeks, grouping them according to whether they ever tested positive with no symptoms, were hospitalized, have recovered with antibodies or tested negative.\n\n\"We have strong young athletes,'' Boras said, \"and we can ready them. They want to create a return to normalcy and certainly our national pastime is a sign of that.''\n\nMLB officials are hoping it won't be necessary to quarantine players, and normalcy will prevail once the regular season commences, but the schedule and playoff format promises to be dramatically different.\n\n\"This is going to be a season,'' one of the executives said, \"like we've never seen.\n\n\"But that's fine. It's at least a season.''\n\nFollow Nightengale on Twitter: @Bnightengale\n\nMLB's $200 million contractsFullscreen",

        "authors": [],
        "body": "Mobile: Traffic accidents are killing fewer people as they stay home more and drive less during the pandemic. Highway deaths in April dropped 58% from March and 42% from a year earlier, according to statistics from the Alabama Law Enforcement Agency. State troopers also investigated 43% fewer traffic accidents in April than in March. Troopers in Mobile and Baldwin worked only one fatal crash in April. \"It's pretty unusual for around here. That kind of stood out,\" Lt. Joe Piggott, a state trooper spokesman, told WALA-TV. The Alabama Department of Transportation reports traffic volume over a nearly three-week period in April was down by about 46% compared with 2019. One consequence of less congestion may be a tendency for drivers who are on the roads to drive faster. \"It seems like the speeds are increasing on the highways,\" Piggott said. \"We've clocked quite a few at triple digits.\"\n\nJuneau: Dentists say their business may be hurt by a state mandate requiring patients to have a negative test result for the coronavirus within 48 hours of an elective procedure. The testing requirements cover non-emergency procedures generating aerosols, floating airborne particles that can carry the virus and are produced through the use of many dental tools, Alaska Public Media reports. Republican Gov. Mike Dunleavy and state health officials said elective health care procedures could restart in a phased approach, but they point to federal guidelines saying dentists are at high risk of virus exposure. Dr. David Nielson, president of the Alaska Board of Dental Examiners, told state Chief Medical Officer Dr. Anne Zink there is a challenge for patients to obtain test results within 48 hours of a dental appointment. \"We do believe that waiting for the availability of testing to ramp up to the levels that would be necessary will jeopardize the oral health of the public,\" he said.\n\nPhoenix: Restaurants in the state can reopen next week amid a downward trend in coronavirus cases and other measurements laid out by federal officials, Gov. Doug Ducey announced Monday. Ducey said restaurants can open next Monday, and salons and barbershops can open this Friday. The businesses will need enhanced sanitation and social distancing to open their doors. Ducey is also considering allowing some food establishments that are licensed as bars to open as well. The decisions came less than a week after the Republican governor extended his stay-home order until May 15. The order remains in place, although closed retail businesses were allowed to start curbside sales Monday and can resume full in-store sales Friday. The governor has been hammered by some Republican lawmakers, who were angered at the extended closure order because the economy has tanked.\n\nLittle Rock: Movie theaters, bowling alleys, arenas and other large venues will be allowed to reopen but with new limits to curb the spread of the coronavirus, Gov. Asa Hutchinson said Monday. The Republican governor continued rolling back the state's restrictions on businesses as gyms began to reopen with similar social distancing rules. He also issued recommendations to churches and other places of worship, which had not been closed in the state, on how to safely resume in-person services. Hutchinson said large outdoor venues will be allowed to reopen Monday, while indoor ones can open May 18. The venues will face similar restrictions, including limiting audiences to 50 or fewer people and requiring at least 6 feet of distance except for family groups. The recommendations for churches include eliminating the use of items touched by multiple people such as offering plates, no classes for youth or child care, and no physical contact.\n\nSacramento: With more local governments moving ahead with their own plans for reopening, Gov. Gavin Newsom announced Monday that the state will begin gradually allowing clothing stores, florists, bookstores and sporting goods shops to open their doors after a nearly seven-week coronavirus shutdown. Newsom said the threat of the virus spreading had leveled off to a point where certain retail businesses could again serve customers starting as early as Friday, but with curbside pickups and other restrictions. Requirements for operation won't be released until Thursday, and Newsom warned that signs the virus has started spreading rapidly might force him to reimpose tighter restrictions. \"I know this can sound confusing,\" Newsom said at one point, as he sought to explain various requirements in the state's evolving plan to emerge from the crisis. \"Let's stay the course; let's stay together.\"\n\nDenver: Offices in the state were allowed to reopen Monday with half the usual staff, and Denver's mayor will let his stay-at-home order expire as the outbreak of the coronavirus eases in Colorado. Mayor Michael Hancock's order is set to expire at the end of Friday. Gov. Jared Polis said Monday that fewer people were being hospitalized with the virus, and he referenced Star Wars multiple times to remind people to wear face masks and to practice social distancing while out. \"May the Fourth be with you,\" the governor said, using a catchphrase widely shared on May 4, the unofficial holiday celebrating the Star Wars movies. Polis showed graphics of a Darth Vader helmet and a 6-foot-long light saber to hammer home his point on safety precautions. \"Darth Vader would be very safe right now despite his preexisting respiratory condition,\" Polis cracked.\n\nHartford: The state agriculture commissioner is considering buying food in bulk to provide to organizations that feed needy people, which have seen huge upticks in demand coupled with challenges in getting supplies, he said Monday. Having the state or another entity do so on behalf of charitable food banks and pantries might help make more food available, said Commissioner Bryan Hurlburt, whose agency was recently tasked with overseeing food insecurity issues amid the COVID-19 pandemic. \"Each organization is trying to outbid the other for additional food, and that can't be the solution,\" Hurlburt said at a virtual roundtable with U.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat, and the organization End Hunger CT. Hurlburt said his agency has already reached agreements with state colleges and universities to use their refrigerators to store bulk purchases of food and is looking to work with other entities.\n\nDover: The state will now allow independent contractors and people who work for themselves to file for unemployment. The Delaware State News reports that the benefits are available as of Monday. Such workers normally are ineligible for jobless benefits. But a federal stimulus measure has temporarily opened unemployment benefits to them because of the coronavirus pandemic. People in Delaware who are eligible will receive $600 per week from the federal government. Benefits from the state range from $133 to $400 a week. The $600 federal benefit expires July 25. More than 75,000 Delaware residents have filed for unemployment since the state's first coronavirus case was reported.\n\nWashington: With more than 700,000 residents, the nation's capital has more people than Vermont and Wyoming, WUSA-TV reports. But the question of statehood for D.C. is something President Donald Trump believes will never happen. In a New York Post interview, Trump said Republicans aren't \"stupid\" enough to add guaranteed Democratic seats in Congress. While nearly 86% of district voters in 2016 endorsed statehood, D.C. residents vote heavily for Democratic Party candidates. Trump only received 4.09% of the district's vote for president in 2016. Trump said he believes the real reason Democrats want to make D.C. a state has nothing to do with representation for its residents but is simply so the party can gain congressional votes.\n\nDaytona Beach: Officials issued about 900 verbal social distancing warnings to people during the first weekend Volusia County's beaches were largely reopened for almost all activities. \"For the most part, beachgoers spaced out and kept groups small,\" Ray Manchester, Volusia County Beach Safety director, said Monday. While the beautiful weather drew crowds to the beaches, most people complied with the spacing rules, Manchester said. He said the heaviest crowds were near large, off-beach parking lots and hotels that have reopened. In addition to warnings, lifeguards made about 100 water rescues over the weekend. The warnings don't necessarily mean citations or fines for breaking the rules. By and large, the verbal warnings are issued by megaphone to remind people to space out a little more. \"When I say we issued warnings,\" Manchester said, \"what that means is we provided information and education to keep people safe and healthy.\"\n\nAtlanta: The Georgia State Board of Education is allocating $411 million in federal aid to help pay for COVID-19-related issues to the state's school districts and independent charter schools. The board voted Monday to allocate 90% of the state's total of $457 million in K-12 aid from the federal CARES Act based on districts' proportion of students in poverty, as required by the federal law. The state Department of Education will later approve the release of funds after districts submit spending plans. The schools can spend the money on distance learning devices and internet services, supplemental learning efforts, school-provided meals, facility cleaning, equipment, counseling or offsetting potential revenue losses to avoid furloughs. State Superintendent Richard Woods said the state will retain $46 million for future needs.\n\nHonolulu: The University of Hawaii said Monday that it plans to resume in-person instruction at its 10 campuses around the state during the fall 2020 semester. To prevent the coronavirus from spreading, the university plans to reconfigure some classrooms, laboratories and study areas to allow people to stay at least 6 feet apart. University of Hawaii President David Lassner told a news briefing that some classes would adopt a hybrid instruction format. Lectures would be given online, but then students would meet in person in smaller groups. The university switched to online instruction midway through the spring 2020 semester as coronavirus numbers grew in Hawaii. The school said it was also preparing for the possibility it may have to return to all-online courses at one or more of its campuses if there's a significant outbreak of COVID-19.\n\nBoise: Before the surge of coronavirus-related joblessness hit, the state estimated it had enough money to cover nearly 16 months' worth of unemployment benefits. That's far better than many states, but Idaho's unemployment trust could still fall short, depending on how long the pandemic lasts. \"It's almost twice as solvent as it was in the Great Recession, so we think it's very healthy, and it will sustain this one,\" said Salvador Vazquez, Idaho Department of Labor's market information director. \"The other question is how long is this going to last, and, you know, nobody has an answer to that.\" Idaho calculates its unemployment trust solvency rate based on the most expensive three years in the past 20. The last peak was during the Great Recession: In the first week of March 2009, nearly 4,000 new unemployment claims were filed, and nearly 47,000 people were already receiving unemployment benefits. That amount was dwarfed last month.\n\nChicago: The legal sale of marijuana during the state's first full month of lockdown due to the coronavirus surpassed sales in two previous months, officials announced Monday. The Illinois Department of Financial and Professional Regulation reports April adult-use cannabis sales totaled more than $37.2 million. A little over $7.5 million of sales at the state's 50 recreational marijuana dispensaries were to out-of-state residents. When Gov. J.B. Pritzker issued his stay-at-home order to battle spread of the coronavirus March 20, he allowed medical and adult-use cannabis dispensaries to remain open as essential businesses. However, operators adapted to the new social situation by implementing online ordering systems, curbside pickup and social distancing in stores. The pandemic has forced Illinois to delay awarding licenses for 75 new recreational cannabis dispensaries.\n\nIndianapolis: Shoppers trickled into some large shopping malls Monday as they opened for the first time in more than a month under a new order from the governor easing many restrictions imposed to slow the coronavirus' spread. Republican Gov. Eric Holcomb defended his decision announced Friday allowing more manufacturers and retailers to open their doors in most of the state, with the allowing of nearly all activities to resume July 4. Democratic gubernatorial candidate Dr. Woody Myers, a former state health commissioner, called the steps premature, with the state still not providing enough COVID-19 infection testing. Holcomb said he believed it was important to give residents a long-term look at the state's reopening plan. He said the establishing stages for reopening businesses and activities in stages will depend on Indiana's number of coronavirus illnesses not suddenly jumping and putting pressure on the hospital system.\n\nIowa City: Nearly 1,400 workers at three Tyson Foods pork processing plants have tested positive for the coronavirus, the state reported Tuesday, as deaths surged to a new daily high. The Iowa Department of Public Health revealed that the state's largest outbreak to date has been at the Tyson plant in Perry, in central Iowa. There, 730 workers were confirmed to have the virus, a stunning 58% of those tested, the department said. The Tyson plant in Waterloo has had 444 workers test positive, and its Columbus Junction plant has had 221 confirmed infections, the department said. The department said 258 workers at a National Beef plant in Tama tested positive, as did another 131 employees of a Newton wind turbine blade manufacturer. The department's deputy director, Sarah Reisetter, said state officials determined that releasing the locations and scope of those five workplace outbreaks was in the public interest.\n\nLawrence: The hospital in the city is furloughing more than 220 employees because it is struggling financially after temporarily halting elective surgeries and treatments amid the coronavirus outbreak. Lawrence Memorial Hospital said Monday in announcing the furloughs that it has experienced revenue declines of more than $1 million per week since the pandemic began, the Lawrence Journal-World reports. Confirmed coronavirus cases in Kansas rose by 4.3% on Monday, up 215 to 5,245 total, though the actual number is thought to be higher because of limited testing and because people can be infected without showing symptoms. Reported COVID-19-related deaths increased by two. Meanwhile, the Kansas Department of Corrections reported that a third inmate died in a coronavirus outbreak at the state prison in Lansing, near Kansas City. The prison is the state's hardest hit, with 380 inmates and 88 employees testing positive. Another seven staff and five inmates are infected at six other correctional facilities.\n\nLouisville: A federal judge has ruled that Gov. Andy Beshear's restriction on travel amid the coronavirus pandemic is unconstitutional. But U.S. District Judge William O. Bertelsman sided with the governor on his ban of mass gatherings in a ruling issued Monday. A trio of plaintiffs who attended a church service in Louisville had filed suit challenging the two bans. The plaintiffs argued the mass gathering ban unfairly singles out religious gatherings. \"To the contrary, the plain text of the challenged order categorically bans all 'mass gatherings' as a means of preventing the spread of a life-threatening virus,\" Bertelsman wrote in the ruling. The judge said Beshear's ban on travel \"does not pass constitutional muster.\" Bertelsman said, for example, it would prohibit a Kentuckian from visiting a relative in Ohio. Beshear said at his daily briefing Monday night that he was aware of the ruling and was willing to amend the travel restrictions.\n\nNew Orleans: Nearly every woman in a prison dormitory has tested positive for COVID-19, and two-thirds of them showed no symptoms, state figures show. The women at the Elayn Hunt Correctional Center in St. Gabriel are housed in a dormitory for some of the inmates moved out of the Louisiana Correctional Women's Institute after floods in 2016, Department of Corrections spokesman Ken Pastorick said last week. He said 155 women without symptoms were tested after 39 became ill with the disease caused by the novel coronavirus. As of Monday, 192 inmates had tested positive, including 66 who had symptoms, according to Department of Correction statistics. The unit has about 195 inmates, though the number fluctuates, Pastorick said Monday. The chart showed 41 dormitory staffers diagnosed with COVID-19 but did not indicate total staffing.\n\nBethel: A restaurant owner said he's ready for Round 2 of flouting Democratic Gov. Janet Mills' executive orders over the coronavirus. Rick Savage said he was reopening his Sunday River Brewing Co. on Tuesday in defiance of the governor's orders, and he continued to criticize Mills for not acting fast enough to reopen the state's economy. \"They don't understand. They think they can take their time and figure things out. Businesses aren't going to last,\" he said. Savage opened his restaurant for dine-in customers Friday and then closed over the weekend. He said he's reopening after determining that his beer-making license wouldn't be imperiled. The state already revoked his restaurant and liquor licenses, but he has said he'll pay the fines.\n\nOcean City: The state's most popular beach destination is set to reopen its shore this weekend, and a city official has said \"day-trippers\" won't be turned away, even though out-of-town visitors would be violating the state's stay-at-home order. Ocean City's mayor and City Council decided Monday to allow beaches and the boardwalk to open Saturday after being closed for more than a month to protect against the spread of the coronavirus, news outlets report. City Council Secretary Mary Knight said the reopening would give people more opportunities to get outside, and she suggested visitors from out of town could enjoy the resort town's beaches, in addition to local residents. \"If they want to come down and spend the day at the beach and walk the boardwalk, there's no problem with that,\" The Baltimore Sun quoted Knight as saying. \"It's Mother's Day this weekend; it might be nice to take your mom somewhere.\"\n\nQuincy: A second Walmart store in the state temporarily closed after an employee died of COVID-19 and several others tested positive for the coronavirus that causes the disease, authorities said. The Walmart in Quincy closed Monday and will remain shuttered until further notice, Mayor Thomas Koch said on the city's YouTube page. Nine workers, including the woman who died, tested positive, he said. \"There are no words to express the loss of our associate, and we are mourning alongside their family,\" Walmart said in a statement. The store will undergo a cleaning, and all employees will be tested, Quincy Health Commissioner Ruth Jones said. Walmart said employee temperature checks will continue at the Quincy store once it reopens. Employees will also be provided with face masks and gloves. A Worcester Walmart was shut down last week after dozens of employees tested positive. That store is expected to reopen this week.\n\nDetroit: A hospital under scrutiny for its treatment of the dead and dying during the coronavirus pandemic has been found in compliance of rules related to staffing and infection control, a state agency said. A spokesman for Michigan's Department of Licensing and Regulatory Affairs said in an email Monday to The Detroit News that that no citations were issued against Sinai-Grace in northwest Detroit. The state began looking into Sinai-Grace after the newspaper reported April 9 that people hospitalized with COVID-19 were dying in its hallways and that nurses were searching for body bags and places to put the deceased. CNN later released photos that appeared to show bodies in vacant hospital rooms at Sinai-Grace and in refrigerated trucks in its parking lot. In early April, emergency room nurses protested what they called dangerous working conditions at the hospital, leading to the swift spread of the virus and a staffing crisis, the Detroit Free Press reported.\n\nMinneapolis: The COVID-19 pandemic has erased the state's budget cushion, Minnesota Management and Budget reported Tuesday. The agency said it now projects a nearly $2.43 billion deficit for the current two-year budget period, which runs through mid-2021. That's almost a $4 billion plunge from a February forecast that projected a $1.5 billion surplus. The projected deficit is slightly larger than the state's budget reserve of nearly $2.34 billion, which the state can tap to cover the hole in the budget. Budget officials have been warning for the past few weeks that the pandemic would upend its budget projections, and they finally quantified the damage Tuesday. The agency said the economic shock of the pandemic has sharply cut tax revenues by $3.6 billion, while emergency measures have pushed projected spending $391 million higher.\n\nJackson: Gov. Tate Reeves said Monday that he will ease some of the restrictions he imposed on restaurants and outdoor gatherings to slow the spread of the coronavirus, and the new rules will take effect Thursday. \"The threat is not gone. ... We all want to move on, but we must stay vigilant,\" said Reeves, a Republican. Restaurants will be allowed to open their indoor dining rooms and outdoor seating areas, with each at no more than 50% capacity and with no more than six customers per table. Servers must wear masks, and customers entering restaurants will be asked if they have shown any signs of the virus or have been exposed to anyone who has it. For more than a month, restaurants have been restricted to takeout or delivery. Outdoor gatherings will be limited to 20 or fewer people, up from the current restriction of 10 or fewer. Reeves said the change could help some youth sports teams get back to practice.\n\nJefferson City: Gov. Mike Parson has a simple reason for not wearing a face mask during a visit to a southwestern Missouri thrift store. \"I chose not to,\" Parson said tersely Monday in response to a reporter's question. Parson's stay-at-home order ended Sunday, and businesses reopened across most of Missouri a day later, except in St. Louis, St. Louis County and Kansas City. The Republican governor spent the morning visiting several businesses in southwestern Missouri. Among them was a thrift shop in Joplin operated by the Disabled American Veterans. A photo posted on Parson's Twitter account shows him bare-faced but surrounded by mask-wearing veterans. \"I think it's up to the individual,\" Parson said in response to a question during his afternoon news conference. \"I don't think its government's role to mandate who wears a mask and who doesn't.\"\n\nGreat Falls: After nine years of steady job growth, COVID-19 plunged the state into its worst recession since World War II in just a few weeks, with a new economic forecast estimating the 2020 job loss at more than 51,000. \"The world has changed,\" said Patrick Barkey, director of the University of Montana's Bureau of Business and Economic Research. \"The economy is at a completely different place than we thought it would be.\" In a preliminary analysis of the economic impacts of COVID-19 in Montana, BBER predicts that Montana's economy will suffer an employment drop of more than 51,000 jobs, a 7.3% decline, in 2020; that personal income in 2020 will be $3.9 billion lower than a December projection, down 7.1%; and that stronger economic growth in the fourth quarter of 2020 and in 2021 and 2022 could close the gap and bring economic activity back within a medium-term growth projection made before the crisis.\n\nOmaha: Two meat processing plants in the state have announced temporary closures in the wake of a surge in coronavirus cases among meatpacking plant workers. A Tyson Foods pork plant in Madison and a Cargill beef plant in Schuyler announced Monday that they would temporarily shut down production to deep-clean the plants, the Omaha World-Herald reports. Tyson said it will await the results of workers who had been tested for COVID-19 last weekend before deciding when it will reopen. The closures follow that last week of Tyson's beef processing plant in Dakota City - its largest in the U.S. - that sidelined some 4,300 workers. The plant had been scheduled to restart production Tuesday, but Tyson postponed the reopening to await results of COVID-19 tests for its workers. The plant closures will affect more than 3,000 workers and will likely slow the ability of producers to get hogs and cattle to slaughter, officials said.\n\nLas Vegas: When casinos eventually reopen, customer numbers will be cut in half, nightclubs will remain closed, convention groups will be limited, and gamblers will have to keep safe distances apart, according to new rules from state gambling regulators. \"Plans should ... address how licensees will disinfect cards and chips,\" the Nevada Gaming Control Board guidelines said. Table games should be limited to three players for blackjack, six for craps, four for roulette and four for poker. Chairs could be removed from every second slot machine. Casino supervisors and managers have to prevent patrons from congregating in groups around tables. \"We're definitely going to require a lot of our licensees. They understand they need to get it right,\" board Chairwoman Sandra Douglass Morgan said Monday.\n\nConcord: Towns and cities are getting $40 million for costs associated with the coronavirus pandemic, and first responders are getting a temporary boost in pay, Gov. Chris Sununu said Monday. New Hampshire's towns and cities have seen expenses such as overtime pay for police and welfare costs soar during the pandemic. The new grants can be used for those kinds of expenses, as well as costs associated with cleaning municipal buildings and moving services online. Full-time firefighters, emergency medical technicians, corrections officers and police will be eligible for an extra $300 per week, while part-time first responders will get $150 for the next eight weeks. Some Democrats had been calling for municipal aid and hazard pay for first responders for more than a month.\n\nTrenton: Former Gov. Chris Christie, saying that \"there are going to be deaths no matter what,\" called for leaders to allow people to get back to work before we \"destroy the American way of life\" by shutting down during the coronavirus pandemic. Speaking on The Daily DC Podcast hosted by CNN's Dana Bash on Monday, Christie said, \"What we are doing now I just don't think can be sustained as a country.\" The Republican former governor said people claiming a choice must be made between money and lives are offering a \"false choice.\" Christie also said the medical community might keep us \"locked in our houses for another year\" until there is a vaccine. He said it's not time to have concerts or full stadiums for sporting events, and \"temperature checks will be a way of life.\" Also, we need to continue to \"keep our more vulnerable folks inside.\" Christie said if he were still governor of New Jersey, \"I would be reopening.\"\n\nLas Cruces: Former Gov. Bill Richardson has recruited two Hollywood actors to help raise money for areas of Dona Ana County that were already struggling before the pandemic. Richardson's philanthropic foundation is partnering with the Las Cruces Sun-News to promote a relief fund. Richardson said he reached out to Edward James Olmos and Danny Trejo to see if they would join. The fund has already amassed $40,000. Olmos (\"Battlestar Galactica\") and Trejo (\"Desperado,\" \"Spy Kids\") said they have fond memories of filming in that part of the state. The colonias are unincorporated, low-income areas in Dona Ana County along the U.S.-Mexico border. The communities there often lack adequate housing and potable water, but the issues have been exacerbated by the pandemic. The Community Action Agency of Southern New Mexico will process applications for those looking for assistance.\n\nAlbany: The state has reported more than 1,700 previously undisclosed deaths at nursing homes and adult care facilities amid scrutiny over how New York has protected vulnerable residents during the coronavirus pandemic. At least 4,813 people have died from COVID-19 in the state's nursing homes since March 1, according to a tally released late Monday that, for the first time, included people believed to have been killed by the virus before their diagnoses could be confirmed by a lab test. Exactly how many nursing home residents have died remains uncertain despite the state's latest disclosure. The list released by Gov. Andrew Cuomo's administration did not include nursing home residents who were transferred to hospitals before dying. With the inclusion of the additional deaths, the state now lists 22 nursing homes, largely in New York City and on Long Island, as having at least 40 deaths. And 62 nursing homes have reported between 20 and 39 deaths.\n\nGastonia: The chairman of the board of a health care system has resigned after reports about his social media posts, including one in which he called stay-at-home orders \"tyranny.\" CaroMont Health board of directors chairman Donnie Loftis resigned Monday after eight years, The Charlotte Observer reports. On his personal Facebook page, Loftis showed support for anti-abortion protesters who violated the stay-at-home order. Gaston County issued a stay-at-home order March 26. Loftis appeared to support the county order at first, but in April he shared a picture of a pie chart that read: \"What I worry about. COVID-19: 0.5, Loss of my rights: 99.5. You should be worried also.\" CaroMont previously said board members' personal opinions and beliefs \"are not statements made on the behalf of CaroMont Health nor an indication of the health system's position on any topic, situation or circumstance.\"\n\nFargo: Health officials say a lack of testing supplies for COVID-19 forced a cancellation of mass screenings Monday in the city, which is North Dakota's largest metropolitan area and the state's biggest coronavirus hot spot. Fargo Cass Public Health said on its Facebook page that the event planned at the Fargodome was canceled due to a shortage of supplies at the state Department of Health's microbiology lab. A spokesman for Gov. Doug Burgum said the cancellation was the result of a \"supply chain issue,\" and state health officials were investigating the cause. The mass screenings were set for Sunday and Monday afternoons at the Fargodome and were reserved for the close contacts of people who have tested positive for COVID-19 and for essential workers. The county health agency said \"the goal of 500 tests\" was reached Sunday.\n\nColumbus: Gov. Mike DeWine announced Tuesday that he's cutting $775 million from the state budget in the next two months because of plummeting revenue due to the pandemic. The spending reductions are necessary now to avoid worse cuts down the road and will affect every state agency except the prisons department, the Republican governor said. The state had been running $200 million ahead in revenue estimates in February, DeWine said. He said he's not tapping Ohio's $2.7 billion rainy day fund until the new fiscal year beginning in July. The budget can be balanced now with cuts, and the rainy day money will be needed later this year and next, he said. \"This rain is not a passing spring shower,\" DeWine said. The budget slashing includes $355 million for schools and $110 million for higher education, plus $210 million from the state Medicaid program, which provides health care for poor children and families.\n\nGuymon: At least 116 employees at a pork processing plant have tested positive for coronavirus, Seaboard Foods spokesman David Eahart said in a statement Monday. The plant in Guymon has about 2,700 employees who are advised to stay home if sick, provided face masks and hand-sanitizing stations, and encouraged to maintain social distancing, Eahart said. Texas County, where Guymon is located about 235 miles northwest of Oklahoma City, has 236 confirmed virus cases and two deaths, according to the state Health Department. Eahart said about 30% of the plant's employees do not live in Texas County. Health Department spokeswoman Donelle Harder said all cases and deaths would be attributed to an infected person's county or state of residence. Guymon is about 15 miles north of Texas and about 20 miles south of Kansas. The Seaboard plant has not closed.\n\nAstoria: A seafood processor has shut down after 13 workers tested positive for the new coronavirus. The outbreak at Bornstein Seafoods tripled the number of cases in Clatsop County after three weeks during which no new cases had emerged, The Astorian reports. Tests on five more people who show symptoms of the illness are pending. The newspaper reports the Lower Columbia Hispanic Council filed a complaint with the state Occupational Safety and Health Administration on April 13 - before the outbreak - on behalf of plant workers. The complaint cited a lack of personal protective equipment and a lack of social distancing inside the plants. Bornstein Seafoods employs more than 150 people between two plants at the Port of Astoria. An OSHA spokesperson confirmed a complaint is open but declined to comment on whether OSHA has inspected the plant.\n\nPhiladelphia: A new initiative is bringing works by local artists to some downtown businesses temporarily shuttered in an effort to stem the spread of the coronavirus pandemic, officials said. The Center City District and Mural Arts Philadelphia said two dozen works by 11 artists were selected for installation over the boarded-up windows of nine locations ranging from small retailers to large restaurants. Protective plywood boards installed by business owners at 56 downtown locations have drawn graffiti, and crews have been painting the boards black to stem the problem. As part of the Storefront Artwork Initiative, works of art were printed on 6-by-6-foot panels of parachute cloth and applied with acrylic gel adhesive to the boards. District president and CEO Paul Levy said it's intended to \"temporarily brighten the physical environment, engage local artists and send the message that through creativity and innovation we will prevail.\" He said it's important to ensure that Center City \"remains ready to welcome back workers, students and shoppers as this crisis ends.\"\n\nProvidence: Almost everyone in an indoor or outdoor public place will be required to wear a face mask starting Friday to help prevent the spread of the coronavirus, Gov. Gina Raimondo announced Tuesday. The Democratic governor said at her daily news conference that she intends to sign an executive order requiring masks, with exceptions for small children, the developmentally disabled and people with certain medical conditions. She said she wants people to think of masks like they do a wallet, car keys or phone - \"Don't leave home without it.\" Even people who go out alone for a walk, run or bike ride should carry a mask with them to put on if they come into contact with other people, she said. Penalties for violating the order are still being worked out, Raimondo said.\n\nColumbia: As Gov. Henry McMaster continues to gather data and opinions on reopening society during the coronavirus, the state's peak of cases and deaths has been pushed further into the future, with predictions of hundreds more people dying. The new prediction is for more than 1,100 deaths by early August from COVID-19. Less than two weeks ago, state health officials predicted fewer than 700 deaths by early August, according to the Department of Health and Environmental Control. The latest epidemiological estimates reflect that virus and infection rates have not dropped significantly, so with more people circulating, more people will fall ill. The predictions released Monday also indicate the increase in cases reported each week is near a peak and should start to fall around the middle of May. McMaster, a Republican, acknowledged the desire of businesses to get back to making money and people to get out of their homes. During his introductory remarks Tuesday at his Accelerate SC committee, he said he's balancing those wishes with a need to stop the virus from spreading rapidly again. \"I get letters from ladies that are dying to go to the beauty parlor. Of course, we don't want them to die when they go to the beauty parlor,\" McMaster said.\n\nSioux Falls: Gov. Kristi Noem said Monday that the state's budget is expected to take a big hit from the economic shock of the coronavirus pandemic. Noem said South Dakota's general fund revenues for March are down $18.1 million. While not all of that is related to COVID-19, the Republican governor said the brunt of the economic impact will be felt in April. She said those figures will be available at the beginning of June. Meanwhile, state health officials on Tuesday reported three deaths from COVID-19, along with 53 new confirmed cases. All three deaths were in Minnehaha County, which has seen most of the infections in the state. A total of 2,721 cases of coronavirus have been confirmed, but the actual number of infections is thought to be far higher than the number of confirmed because many people have not been tested, and people can be infected without feeling sick.\n\nMemphis: The mayor of the state's largest county issued rules Monday for the reopening of barbershops and hair salons after saying Gov. Bill Lee only offered guidelines but not strict COVID-19-related safety requirements for the reopening of \"close-contact\" businesses. During an online news conference Monday, Shelby County Mayor Lee Harris worried that confusion caused by mixed messaging from different jurisdictions could lead to the more rapid spread of the new coronavirus. Last week, Lee said close-contact businesses such as salons and barbershops can open Wednesday in 89 of 95 Tennessee counties. That did not include Shelby County, which, like the other excluded counties, has its own health department and can make its own public health directives related to the coronavirus response. However, barbershops and hair salons in some of the county's suburban cities said they were going to reopen anyway, causing confusion.\n\nAmarillo: A surge of coronavirus cases in the Texas Panhandle, a crucial region for the nation's beef supply, has federal officials sending help to the city to try to control rising numbers of infections over the past week, the mayor said Monday. The Amarillo area is responsible for 25% of the nation's fed beef supply, Mayor Ginger Nelson said, as the community joins others in the Midwest where the virus has sickened hundreds of meatpacking workers and threatens to disrupt the nation's supply of pork and beef. In Texas, more than 240 cases are linked to a JBS USA plant in Moore County, according to Lara Anton, a spokeswoman for the Texas Department of State Health Services. Republican Gov. Greg Abbott has previously singled out the county as an area of concern. Confirmed cases in neighboring Potter County have doubled over the past week to more than 800, and at least nine people have died. President Donald Trump has ordered meat plants to remain open.\n\nSt. George: Intermountain Healthcare is accepting donations of homemade cloth face coverings for visitors and non-front-line caregivers at hospitals and clinics throughout the state. According to a press release, Intermountain Healthcare has set up 28 collection bins throughout Utah. After donation, the face coverings will be collected, sanitized and shipped to where they're needed most. In St. George, donations are being accepted at the Dixie Regional Medical Center and at the Sunset Clinic. In Cedar City, donations are being accepted at the Cedar City Hospital. These drop-off donations are different from ProjectProtect, a partnership among Intermountain Healthcare, University of Utah Health and The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints to produce medical-grade masks that can be used by frontline caregivers.\n\nShelburne: For the first time in its 73-year history, the Shelburne Museum is not going to open for the summer season, as a result of the coronavirus outbreak. Museum Director Thomas Denenberg told WCAX-TV it's too hard to invite the public into the museum spaces and maintain social distancing. \"So, unfortunately, we will be closed for the foreseeable future,\" Denenberg said. The Shelburne Museum was founded by Electra Havemeyer Webb, the daughter of art collectors, in 1947. She not only acquired 19th-century folk art, quilts and decoys but also moved historic buildings from Vermont and New York - a one-room schoolhouse, homes, a round barn, a covered bridge and a steamship - to the site to house her collections. The museum's online resources will remain available for schools and the community.\n\nLocust Hill: A rural food pantry has seen its membership spike in the weeks since the coronavirus pandemic began walloping the economy. Fifty new families have joined the pantry's list of about 800 members, pantry chair Dave Cryer said last week. The food pantry in Locust Hill, on the Chesapeake Bay's western shore, is operated by Hands Across Middlesex Interfaith Outreach. Middlesex is a county of about 10,000 people, although the pantry serves surrounding counties as well. \"We've had more new people applying than we have in the last two years,\" said Cryer, the organization's vice president. He said the organization is blessed with an overwhelming number of volunteers and donations. It receives as much as 60,000 pounds of food each month. \"We're so blessed with the support we have here,\" Cryer said. \"We probably have two volunteers for every one that we need.\"\n\nSeattle: More than 100 state parks, trails and boating sites across the state reopened Tuesday as some coronavirus restrictions were eased. Parks that open will be limited to daytime use, and the number of parking spaces will be reduced at some urban parks to discourage crowding. But authorities say all ocean beach parks and parks along the Columbia River Gorge on the Washington-Oregon border will remain closed to reduce impacts on rural communities and prevent crowds. The parks have been closed more than a month and are being reopened under the first phase of Gov. Jay Inslee's plan to ease rules imposed to prevent the spread of the virus. Beaches and campgrounds would reopen under the second phase of the plan, although large gatherings would still be banned. State officials plan to wait at least three weeks between each phase to see how the changes affect infection rates.\n\nCharleston: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention told state officials that respirator masks distributed to 50,000 first responders might be counterfeit, but officials decided to leave them in use, according to a report. After the warning, the state's top public safety official issued a report to first responders that said the masks are \"authentic,\" the Charleston Gazette-Mail reports. \"These masks are genuine products from Shanghai Dasheng Health Products Manufacture Co. Ltd. (Dasheng) and not counterfeit,\" Department of Military Affairs and Public Safety Secretary Jeff Sandy said in a memo. A model of the mask with ear loops was \"being misrepresented as\" approved by the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health, the CDC said. Masks with ear loops instead of head bands often don't have the proper fit to provide sufficient protection, according to the health agencies. Half of the 100,000 respirators West Virginia purchased had ear loops.\n\nMadison: Conservative justices who control the state Supreme Court raised doubts Tuesday about whether Democratic Gov. Tony Evers' stay-at-home order is legal, asserting that the Legislature never intended to give the executive branch so much power. Justice Rebecca Bradley suggested during oral arguments about the order that state Department of Health Services Secretary Andrea Palm's decision to extend the mandate without legislative input amounts to tyranny. She also questioned whether Palm might next herd people into social distancing camps akin to World War II Japanese internment camps. \"There is a constitutional problem with the Legislature giving away this much power to an unelected Cabinet secretary,\" Bradley said. \"The people never consented to a single individual having that much power.\"\n\nCheyenne: Plans for in-person high school graduation ceremonies are tentatively back on in the state's biggest city. The school district in Cheyenne has switched to distance learning for the remainder of the school year and was considering alternatives to traditional graduation ceremonies due to the coronavirus. Now, each of the city's four high schools could have graduation ceremonies June 12 and 13 at Frontier Park Arena, where the Cheyenne Frontier Days rodeo is held each July. \"It will be very similar to the ceremonies we've had in the past. We probably will not have nearly as many people,\" Superintendent Boyd Brown told the school board Monday. Frontier Days organizers are meanwhile looking at the ceremonies as a trial run ahead of their event, Brown said. Health officials say the 19,000-seat arena could accommodate about 5,000 people while following social-distancing regulations, Brown said.",

        "body": "DETROIT - It's hard enough trying to keep Michigan safe in the wake of COVID-19, the worst pandemic in 100 years.\n\nNow add in what's being called a 500-year event, according to Gov. Gretchen Whitmer -- the massive flooding in Midland County.\n\n\"I feel like I've said this a lot over the last 10 weeks, but this is an event unlike anything we've seen before and we've got to continue to all work together to observe best practices, do our part to help one another, and to wear our masks and continue to try to social distance,\" Whitmer said at a Wednesday news conference.\n\nWhitmer jokingly admonished a few members in the audience who weren't standing at least 6 feet apart, but the moment underscored a genuine challenge -- how to handle a natural disaster in the middle of a health pandemic that already has claimed 5,000 lives in Michigan.\n\nThe record flooding caused by heavy rain and the failure of two dams has displaced up to 10,000 residents, who are sheltering with friends, family and local evacuation sites.\n\nFirst responders are working within the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines while helping evacuees to safety. But concessions are also being made, as some of the social distancing recommendations are difficult to abide by when thousands of people are relocating to a handful of shelters. The CDC currently discourages gatherings of more than 10 people.\n\n\"It's absolutely a challenge,\" Midland County Public Health Director Fred Yanoski told the Free Press, part of the USA TODAY Network, in a phone interview. \"Our message with normal COVID response is to discourage public gatherings and whatnot. And in this particular situation, it is unavoidable as we've had to move several thousand people into a handful of sheltering facilities. It is a challenge.\"\n\nThe American Red Cross has set up eight shelters in the Midland area for those with nowhere to go. Individuals are being screened for symptoms prior to entering the shelters, and masks and face coverings are being provided to those within the shelters.\n\nIn addition, shelter beds are being kept 6 feet apart from each other, and enhanced cleaning and disinfecting practices are being used.\n\nIndividuals displaying COVID-19 symptoms are not being allowed within the shelters, and Midland officials are working with the Red Cross to find alternate accommodations for those who may have the virus. In a news release, the organization announced it provided more than 65 overnight hotel stays for residents who had to leave their homes.\n\n\"It is not a perfect world, but we are not allowing symptomatic people into the shelter and we will, on an individual basis, make arrangements for those individuals,\" Yanoski said. \"Those who might be COVID-positive are taken care of separately and accommodated because local public health is currently monitoring all those individuals that are tested positive for COVID as well as close personal contacts. So we are making alternate arrangements to place them prior to them even coming to the shelter if they let us know.\"\n\nYanoski said the challenges will persist for days. The flooding created by the failure of the Edenville Dam may leave downtown Midland under 9 feet of water by Wednesday night, and families are still evacuating and figuring out accommodations.\n\n\"Some individuals in shelters are not normally those who would go to a shelter,\" Yanoski said. \"We have some special needs folks and some that might've been in an assisted living facility. We're trying to incorporate some additional staff to meet the needs of some of our special populations. ... It's certainly a challenge moving forward.\"\n\nOfficials are also evaluating the environmental impact of the flooding. On Wednesday, Dow, which has a chemical plant in Midland, announced that it found floodwaters \"commingling with on-site containment ponds,\" but that it posed no threat to residents or the environment.\n\nYanoski said while the situation is challenging, the community is up to the task.\n\n\"Our community is well-versed in flood response as it is not an uncommon occurrence,\" said Yanoski, adding that while the situation is challenging, they are up to the task.",

        "authors": [],
        "body": "Record mid-Michigan flooding following days of storms and the failure of two dams forced the evacuation of thousands, who are staying with friends, family and at local shelters.\n\nWhat the National Weather Service called \"catastrophic dam failures\" at the Edenville and Sanford dams forced the evacuation of about 10,000 and caused massive flooding, which the governor said could put Midland under 9 feet of water.\n\nMidland officials warned Wednesday that while the area knows how to deal with flooding, the recent deluge caused by rain and the failure of two dams is unlike anything the community has experienced before -- and it is not over.\n\nThe National Weather Service said communities farther downstream were bracing for flooding in the coming days. No injuries or fatalities related to the flooding have been reported, Midland spokeswoman Selina Tisdale said.\n\nThe National Weather Service in Detroit said on Twitter that a flood warning remained in effect Wednesday night along the entire Tittabawassee River in Midland County. The Tittabawassee River hit a historic high Wednesday morning, rising above its previous record in 1986, and reaching 34.6 feet. Major flood stage is 28 feet.\n\nStill, the community did get a small reprieve: Floodwaters that were expected to peak at 38 feet, crested at about 4 p.m. Wednesday closer to 35-feet levels.\n\nRushing waters took out trees, roadways, homes, businesses, the library, the sewer system, electricity -- and part of the city of Midland.\n\nIt also stopped raining -- for now. Here's what you need to know about the flooding.\n\nPresident Donald Trump will visit a Ford Motor plant in Ypsilanti, Michigan, that makes ventilators Thursday. In a letter to Trump, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer is requesting federal aid to respond to catastrophic flooding in Midland County.\n\nWhitmer sent a letter to Trump on Wednesday. They also spoke by phone that day, with Trump telling reporters that federal assistance was already on its way to the area.\n\nThe governor asked for help removing debris and erecting mobile bridges for emergency response vehicles to access in flooded areas and for equipment to aid residents, emergency medical personnel from the National Guard, and technical assistance and sandbags from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.\n\n\"Over the past two days, a major rainfall event in mid-Michigan led to the failure of two dams and severe flooding in affected areas,\" Whitmer said. \"Thousands of people were forced to evacuate as water surged into their streets, homes, and businesses in the county of Midland.\"\n\nThe deluge of rain led the Edenville and Sanford dams to fail, which Whitmer said were a known problem. She added the state would be looking into the issue, promising to hold people accountable.\n\nOne moment on Tuesday: Wixom Lake was flooding. The water level was rising. Houses along the shore were filling with water. And people were scrambling trying to evacuate.\n\nHours later: All the water was gone. It's like somebody pulled a plug and all the water ran out of a bathtub.\n\nAfter the Edenville Dam broke, almost all the water in Wixom Lake flowed into Sanford Lake. Now, Wixom Lake looks like a giant beach with a small river running through it.\n\n\"I've never seen anything like this,\" said Eric O'Dell, 36, of Coleman.\n\nHe stood on the M-30 bridge, which cuts the lake into two parts. But the bridge was demolished.\n\n\"Amazing,\" O'Dell said.\n\nResidents returned to their homes and cottages on Wednesday and found water damage, boats that looked like they had been tossed aside by a giant and other boats were missing.\n\nThe residents stood on the shore and looked out at a giant barren moonscape, where there was once a lake.\n\n\"I grew up on this lake -- I was here every weekend,\" O'Dell said. \"There is skiing, tubing. And pontoon alley is one of the biggest areas. There will be hundreds and hundreds of boats there, on the main weekends.\"\n\nIt's a fun-loving community. But now, the lakefront property is gone. And it's just a giant beach.\n\nFirst responders are working within the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines while helping evacuees to safety. But concessions are also being made, as some of the social distancing recommendations are difficult to abide by when thousands of people are relocating to a handful of shelters. The CDC currently discourages gatherings of more than 10 people.\n\n\"It's absolutely a challenge,\" Midland County Public Health Director Fred Yanoski told the Detroit Free Press, part of the USA TODAY Network, in a phone interview. \"Our message with normal COVID response is to discourage public gatherings and whatnot.

While the situation is challenging,Yanoski said the community is up to the task.\n\n\"Our community is well-versed in flood response as it is not an uncommon occurrence,\" said Yanoski.\n\nWaters from the deluge in Midland County mixed with containment ponds at the vast Dow chemical plant in Midland, although the situation did not pose harm to people or the environment, the company said Wednesday.\n\nDow announced that floodwaters began \"commingling with on-site containment ponds\" at the Midland plant at about 10 a.m. Wednesday. The company and the U.S. Coast Guard activated emergency plans.\n\nBy the afternoon, company officials said the floodwaters were mixing with an on-site pond used for stormwater and groundwater remediation, no chemicals appeared to have been released.\n\nThe Tittabawassee River in Midland entered major flood stage Tuesday morning when the river reached 28.25 feet at 10:15 a.m., according to the National Weather Service. By afternoon, the Tittabawassee and the Rifle River hit major flood stage.\n\nThe Edenville Dam on the Tittabawassee River, which is owned by Boyce Hydro, failed Tuesday evening, and the National Weather Service warned to expect flooding.\n\nWater then went downstream to Sanford Lake, spilling over Sanford Dam. It was unclear how bad the damage was to Sanford Dam and whether it had breached or had just overflowed.",

        "authors": [],
        "body": "Would Jim Harbaugh be in favor of playing college football in front of an empty stadium?\n\nThe answer is easily yes, if the alternative is no football at all.\n\nHarbaugh appeared on ESPN's morning show \"Get Up\" on Wednesday and was asked numerous questions about how he and Michigan football have handled the coronavirus outbreak that halted all college athletics.\n\nHarbaugh remains hopeful that a season will be played -- and says the Wolverines continue to prepare for all possible scenarios.\n\n\"You can definitely test both teams, you can test the officials and everybody,\" Harbaugh said. \"Can you test 100,000 fans coming into a stadium? Probably not. Without a vaccine, you probably couldn't do that. So to answer your question, heck yeah I'd be comfortable coaching a game without any fans.\n\n\"If the choice were play in front of no fans or not play, then I would choose to play in front of no fans. And I think probably every guy I've talked to on our team, that's the way they feel about it.\"\n\nHarbaugh has not had any in-person contact with his team since mid-March, when the pandemic forced the Big Ten and NCAA to suspend all sporting activities. That canceled Michigan's spring practices roughly a week before they were to begin and forced the staff to adapt, both with their current team and on the recruiting trail, where a dead period with no in-person recruiting has been instituted and extended through at least June 30.\n\nHarbaugh says the Wolverines stay in contact through virtual workouts, virtual meetings and by phone.\n\n\"That's how we've been doing it,\" he said. \"We'll see. Hopefully we can get the guys back together and get them working out as soon as the gyms open up, you feel like you can get them back into the facility at least on a voluntary basis. I sure do miss them, I can tell you that.\"\n\nSome of the questions he has fielded from his players: \"When can they come back? When can they start training? Are we going to play?\"\n\n\"Those are the big ones right off the bat,\" Harbaugh said. \"Hopefully we'll get some better news as the summer goes on here. As far as the season, everybody's prepared like there's going to be one, not even thinking in the way that there wouldn't. Getting ourselves ready, getting prepared.\"\n\nEven if football does return, Harbaugh acknowledges that things will look very different.\n\n\"I think there's definitely questions about that, is there going to be testing and what kind of protocols are going to be in place?\" Harbaugh said. \"That's to be explained what it'll be. It'll be a different -- new normal, what everybody says. You've got social distancing, you're working out in smaller groups. That's kind of the approach. (The players are) concerned about it, and so are the parents. We're talking to them, not every day, but at least two, three times a week.\"\n\nIf teams and football personnel (such as officials and trainers) are able to be tested and remain healthy, Harbaugh appears to believe that football could return.\n\n\"That's a good question -- how prepared are you?\" Harbaugh said. \"You're going through a lot of different scenarios, and learning more all the time, too. People with the practices of staying safe and can you get an entire team together, coaches, players, trainers, strength staff, et cetera, that can not have symptoms or not test positive and then play football?\n\n\"Can you have a game where both sides, both teams are tested, coaches, officials, trainers, everybody involved, and if you don't test positive, you don't have it, can you still play the game? I think that's the question that's on everybody's mind. And thinking that you could do that. That you could do that. We'll see.\"",

        "authors": [],
        "body": "MILWAUKEE - Lona Towsley had beaten cervical cancer at the age of 19, then uterine cancer at 28. She never doubted she would survive. For 23 years, she's been cancer-free.\n\nBut on April 19, the day the doctor said she would need to be placed on a ventilator, the 53-year-old mother of two felt worn out from fighting COVID-19. She didn't think she could fight anymore.\n\nThe survival figures for COVID-19 patients on ventilators inspire little hope. A study in China found that 86% of those who required mechanical ventilation died. A larger British study of 165 patients reported a death rate of 66% for those needing advanced respiratory support.\n\nAs she lay there at UW Health University Hospital in Madison, Lona could feel her lungs filling with fluid.\n\n\"It's like slowly being strangled,\" she said.\n\nNurse Britney Kershner suggested that before they hooked her to the ventilator, she might want to have a FaceTime talk with her husband, Lee.\n\nThe talk was brief. Lee, a man who seldom weeps, broke down. They both did.\n\nGathering his composure, Lee told his wife of 23 years that he loved her and was praying for her. He urged her again and again to stay strong.\n\n\"I'll try,\" she said.\n\nLona told her husband she loved him, too. Then a spasm of coughing jolted her body, bringing the talk to an end.\n\nThe face of the COVID-19 pandemic in the U.S. has been largely urban.\n\nThink of the images. Overwhelmed hospitals in New York, Newark, Boston. Exhausted doctors and nurses risking their lives to help patients gasping for breath. The frightened sick, sequestered in rooms only entered by staff in full-body protective gear; visitors barred.\n\nAnd outside the hospitals, empty cities, walled-off in response to one of the most infectious viruses in modern medicine. A single COVID-19 patient spreads the disease to a median of 5.7 people, making it twice as contagious as the 1918 Spanish flu, according to a report in the journal Emerging Infectious Diseases.\n\nBut the pandemic is sweeping through rural America, too, small towns where the sickest patients must be transferred from local hospitals to distant, larger ones. While many hospitals have not experienced frantic scenes like those in New York, COVID-19 has challenged them like nothing before it.\n\nLona Towsley and her husband live in Avoca, a village of 640 an hour's drive west of Madison. Her two children by a previous marriage are both grown and live in Illinois.\n\nLona works 25 minutes away in Richland Center at a place called VARC Inc., which hires people of varying abilities to fill assembly and packaging contracts.\n\nIn early April, one of VARC's clients, a man in his mid-40s, tested positive for COVID-19 and subsequently died.\n\n\"We found out about him,\" Lona said, \"and the next day I started coming down with symptoms.\"\n\nIt was April 7.\n\nAlthough the staff at the Madison hospital had time to prepare, no one knew quite what they were preparing for.\n\nFounded six years after the 1918 Spanish flu, UW Health University Hospital reported its first positive case of the new coronavirus pandemic on Feb. 5. The patient was well enough to be sent home to stay in isolation.\n\nWeeks passed without the expected surge of new patients. UW Health established two special units for people hospitalized with COVID-19, but no patients arrived. Staff waited.\n\n\"None of us have done this before,\" said Ann Sheehy, a doctor there for 15 of her 46 years. \"We had to create new processes.\"\n\nSheehy helped build a large backup team of doctors and other clinic staff who don't normally practice in the hospital but are certified to do so. They were offered special training and the chance to shadow hospital staff in preparation for COVID-19 duty.\n\nThe UW Health nurses, who see patients more often than anyone else, readied themselves for what was to come.\n\n\"You are the one, minute to minute, seeing the changes no one else sees,\" said Sara Schoen, a 34-year-old nurse manager who has worked at the hospital for 12 years.\n\nNurses also provide care that goes beyond medicine, something essential when patients and families cannot visit.\n\n\"The patient care, that human connection -- you get to have that with someone when they are at their most vulnerable,\" Schoen said.\n\nCOVID-19 would also test environmental services workers, among the most invisible of the invisible in a large hospital. Their work -- disinfecting the building -- would be more important than ever.\n\nThe SARS-CoV-2 virus -- which causes coronavirus -- can survive for up to 72 hours on plastic, though the amount of virus will decline sharply during that period. The comparable figure for stainless steel is 48 hours, for cardboard 24 hours, and for air, three hours.\n\nThe staff, known as EVS techs, disinfect everything in the building: patient rooms, operating areas, the ER, hallways, elevators. At the Madison hospital, that's a total of 1.7 million square feet.\n\n\"I knew what I was signing up for. I knew the kinds of things I would be around,\" said Jeffrey Kaethner, a 31-year-old EVS tech.\n\nStephanie Childs, a 34-year-old day shift supervisor, repeated a saying she often tells the techs whom she oversees: \"The doctors make sure they get rid of the infection. We make sure it's not going to come back.\"\n\nAfter that first positive test for COVID-19 in early February, six weeks passed.\n\nNot until March 23 would staff be called upon to treat an infected patient sick enough to be hospitalized.\n\nWithin eight days, the total hospitalized with the disease went from 1 to 21.\n\nThe first day, Lona thought her symptoms were just allergies acting up in the spring weather. Two days later, when she returned from work, she had a fever and no appetite.\n\nThat night she suffered chills. Her husband piled on the blankets.\n\n\"I still couldn't stop shaking,\" she said. \"It was like if you go out in the winter without a coat and you shake. It was like that, but I couldn't stop I was so cold.\"\n\nShe didn't wake up until noon the next day, April 9. After calling the hospital in Richland Center, she was told to come for a drive-through COVID-19 test. She gave a nasal swab and had her pulse and blood pressure taken around 3:30 that afternoon.\n\nTwo hours later, her family doctor called. She had COVID-19. Given her medical history -- the cancer treatments, a thyroid condition and her years as a smoker -- Lona was told to return to the hospital the next day. She drove herself.\n\nShe was not struggling to breathe at this point, but doctors determined the oxygen levels in her blood were low. She had never been a worrier. She thought she'd be in the hospital a couple of days, then leave and go into isolation at home.\n\nHer stay at Richland Hospital lasted from April 10 to 16.\n\n\"Each day I was getting worse,\" she said. \"I was starting to feel short of breath. My chest was tight. My ribs were hurting from the strain of breathing.\"\n\nThe hospital staff kept turning up her oxygen level. One of her doctors called a colleague at UW Health and learned that Lona might be a good candidate for a study examining the use of plasma from recovered COVID-19 patients.\n\nOn April 16, an ambulance carried her on the bumpy ride from Richland Center to the UW hospital more than an hour away.\n\nOn the day Lona arrived at UW Health, the cumulative number of hospitalized COVID-19 patients had grown to 45.\n\nThe university was helping the hospital staff to deal with equipment shortages. The School of Engineering was making face shields on 3-D printers. The UW School of Pharmacy was making hand-sanitizer.\n\nCOVID-19 was already testing the nurses. Patient doors in the coronavirus units had to remain closed most of the time. Nurses couldn't poke their heads in to say \"Hi.\"\n\nChristina Brahos, a 24-year-old nurse, who began working at the hospital at the end of October, felt the isolation of the patients and found herself tempted to enter rooms more often.\n\nBut even when she was able to enter rooms, it felt harder to connect with patients while wearing the mask and other protective equipment.\n\nUnder it all, she said, \"the patients are basically seeing a set of eyes.\"\n\nIn their faces, Christina saw mostly fear. As much as possible she tried to keep conversations with the COVID-19 patients \"normal\". There were times, though, when she felt helpless.\n\n\"I've come into a patient's room and they're having a coughing fit,\" she said, \"and there isn't anything I can do.\"\n\nThe barriers were similar for the EVS workers, who pride themselves on being the people who enter patients' rooms, but never poke or prod them.\n\nJeffrey Kaethner made it a point to talk with his patients even when he was in full protective gear, even when the patients could not talk to him.\n\nOne day, he was cleaning the room of one male patient who was fitted with a breathing tube and could not speak. He watched the patient write on his board, then hold it up so that Jeffrey could read the words.\n\n\"Thank you for doing this.\"\n\nThe doctors were also at a disadvantage against the virus.\n\n\"Usually when we are taking care of patients we have several treatment options,\" Ann Sheehy explained. \"With COVID-19, the standard of care is supportive care, giving the patient oxygen and allowing the body time to heal. I think we're all just hungry for things that we know will work.\"\n\nBy mid-April, the hospital had joined the nationwide effort to use plasma from recovered COVID-19 patients to help those still sick with the disease. Evidence supporting the use of plasma was promising but largely anecdotal.\n\nTwo very small studies in China showed good results, but UW and dozens of other universities and hospitals were now using the treatment under the U.S. government's expanded use policy. They were also launching clinical trials.\n\nOn April 16, Lona agreed to allow her doctors to treat her with survivor plasma. For the first few days she could see the nurses at the UW hospital peeking in at her through the window on the closed door. At times, doctors and nurses entered.\n\n\"I kind of know what a cat or dog feels like in a pet store,\" she said. \"Everybody is smiling and nice, but you can't touch them or talk to them.\"\n\nStill, she could hear, and she remembered what Kershner, her nurse, kept telling her: \"You're doing it. Come on. You're going to kick this.\"\n\nShe remembers nothing of the 50 hours she was hooked up to the ventilator; it is lost time. Right before the procedure she remembers thinking, \"I should have a will.\"\n\nThe same day Lona went on the ventilator she received the infusion of plasma.\n\nHer eyes opened on April 21 and the first thing she saw was Kershner smiling down at her as she took her vital signs.\n\nLona was no longer on the ventilator. Her throat felt sore, but it was much easier to breathe. Her body did not ache as much as it had.\n\n\"I've made it,\" she remembers thinking.\n\nAt home, her husband, Lee, had spent the last two weeks thinking about his wife, running through the \"What ifs?\" and praying -- something that was not his custom.\n\n\"She had to get through it,\" he said. \"I didn't want to be without her.\"\n\nThe nurses hadn't told him that Lona would be coming off the ventilator. They wanted it to be a surprise. And it was.\n\nWhen he saw her during their next FaceTime chat he felt enormous relief and joy.\n\nLona remained in the intensive care unit for a few more days, then moved to a regular room. On April 28, doctors allowed her to go home. They gave her an oxygen tank to help until her lungs regained their strength.\n\nLee picked her up in the couple's 2014 Ford Escape. On the way home, she felt a sudden craving and Lee made a detour. They went to the drive-thru window at Culver's and she ordered a mint malt.\n\nLee feared that he might get the virus at his maintenance job and pass it back to his wife, so for several days they both wore masks and she stayed in their master bedroom.\n\n\"Last night was the first night we slept together in that bed in a month,\" Lee said on May 8.\n\nLona has signed up to donate her plasma and urged other COVID-19 survivors to do the same.",

    "Mom with coronavirus delivers twins as husband faced death": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "Jennifer Laubach was battling COVID-19 symptoms the day her water broke. So was her husband, who raced upstairs to pack his wife's hospital bag, worried as she wasn't due for another eight weeks.\n\nBut when he returned with the bag, the virus took over.\n\nAndre Laubach was overcome by a violent cough, gasped for air and couldn't speak, so his wife headed to the hospital with him in the passenger seat. But while driving through their Clarkston neighborhood, they got a call from their doctor: The dad's coronavirus test results were in. He tested positive. He couldn't go to the hospital.\n\nSo Jennifer Laubach turned the car around.\n\n\"When I dropped him back off at home, I was worried that I might not see him again,\" Jennifer Laubach recalled. \"I was afraid he was going to die in his sleep, and he was all by himself.\"\n\nAs her husband got out of the car, she said, \"I love you.\"\n\nThe Laubachs are among 37,000 Michiganders who have been infected by the novel coronavirus that to date has afflicted more than 934,000 Americans and killed more than 53,000. More than 3,000 have died in our state.\n\nTheir story, though, is one of survival. Andre Laubach, a 36-year-old attorney, overcame the virus that took over his lungs and caused him to miss out on the birth of his twin sons, Mitchell and Maksim, who were born eight weeks early on April 3. Mitchell weighed 3 pounds, his brother 4.\n\nNeither baby has the virus.\n\nOn Saturday, after three weeks of being cared for by nurses and doctors, baby Mitchell finally came home. His brother Maksim, who is still fighting some lung issues, is due home in about three to five days.\n\nThe Laubachs are now sharing their story, they said, to clear up any misconceptions about how serious COVID-19 is. The virus caused the mom to go into early labor, they said, and nearly cost the father his life.\n\n\"I want everyone to know that they need to take this virus seriously,\" said Jennifer Laubach, 36, a controller for a construction firm who gets frustrated by social media comments that claim COVID-19 isn't a big deal. \"I'm like 'Oh my God. If you only knew. It's not just a cold.' \"\n\nAfter his wife drove off for the hospital, Andre Laubach slowly made his way back to the house and laid down. His mind raced.\n\n\"I thought, 'I know I'm going to miss the birth of my children. But I'm on the brink of death,' \" recalled Andre Laubach, who has asthma and struggled to breathe, gasping between vicious coughing fits.\n\nHe had been sick for nine days by then, battling a cough, fatigue and dizziness. His wife also had a nasty cough, along with shortness of breath and diarrhea. Neither had a fever, though they suspected coronavirus. His wife called their doctor on a Sunday night for prescriptions to get tested.\n\nThe following day he turned 36 years old.\n\nMore: These are the 6 new possible symptoms of the coronavirus the CDC added to its list\n\nMore: Federal coronavirus strategy lurches as plans to help states change, then change again\n\n\"I was sick and resting and she said, 'Happy Birthday, I got you a Coronavirus test,' \" he recalled.\n\nThe next morning, the couple got tested. By nightfall, they were in ER. Andre Laubach had been coughing for nearly two hours and couldn't breathe. At McLaren Hospital, however, his oxygen levels were high and he had no fever. So they sent him home with asthma treatments.\n\nMore coughing fits followed, so badly that he vomited. One night he coughed for five hours straight and thought he tore his abdominal muscles. At about 7 a.m. he finally fell asleep.\n\nJennifer Laubach remained calm. She sat down to compose herself while her husband called Troy Beaumont Hospital, told them they were on their way, and that they might have COVID-19.\n\nHe then raced upstairs and packed his wife's hospital bag. But by the time he got back downstairs, he hit a wall. The coughing took over again.\n\n\"I got a violent cough. I was seeing stars,\" he said. \"I sat down in a chair and couldn't talk. Jen said, 'You ready to go? Can you drive?' I knew it was a no, but I couldn't tell her that. It was my responsibility to drive my wife to the hospital when she was in labor.\"\n\nBut his wife saw through him.\n\n\"It was really heartbreaking. He looked at me. He couldn't talk,\" she recalled. \"That look told me everything. It said, 'I want to go but physically I can't because I can't breathe. I can't talk.' \"\n\nAfter his wife arrived at the hospital, she called her husband and told him to call 911.\n\nAn ambulance arrived at the house. EMT workers checked his oxygen levels and said they were good.\n\n\"They said, 'you're not the best candidate for a bed, that there are other people that need a bed more than you.' \" the husband recalled. \"So they left.\"\n\nThat night, Andre Laubach left his front door unlocked, worried he might not be able to get to the door.\n\n\"It was the virus, me, God and the cats. When the ambulance left, I had so much to live for at that point,\" he recalled, thinking of his twins that were on the way.\n\nBut he was scared.\n\n\"I'm alone, with no doctors. My wife is at the hospital. It's you versus the virus,\" he recalled thinking to himself. \"There were a couple of times it was touch and go. It was scary. ... I knew that I was one push away from where it could take me out.\"\n\nBut he made it through the night.\n\nIt was a half hour drive to Beaumont Hospital in Troy. When Jennifer Laubach arrived, there was a lot of confusion.\n\n\"They didn't know what to do with me,\" she said, noting the hospital knew that her husband was COVID-19 positive and presumed her to be positive, too.\n\nJennifer Laubach's first test came back negative (her second test after giving birth came back positive) though the hospital was aware of her symptoms: coughing, shortness of breath and chills. So, upon arrival at the hospital, she sat in a wheelchair in the ER for a half hour while the staff looked for a room for her.\n\nThere was concern over her infecting other pregnant moms or newborns. So they looked for a special room. A nurse and doctor eventually examined her and told her that she hadn't dilated yet.\n\nAfter her exam, she was taken to a negative pressure room designated for COVID-19 patients. The doctors had hoped to keep her from going into labor for another two weeks.\n\n\"I prayed to God that night, 'Please let me live through this,' \" the mom recalled, noting she was worried about her husband at home.\n\nShe also thought about how difficult it was getting pregnant in the first place. She and her husband struggled. She had a low egg count and wound up getting fertility shots -- it worked. She produced two eggs that were successfully fertilized in a Petri dish and then placed back in her body, and the twins would grow. They were their miracle babies. She had to get through this, she thought. And so did her husband.\n\nAt 5 a.m. the following morning, she had her first contraction.\n\n\"We are having babies,\" she texted her husband.\n\nAlthough she labored alone, she recalled the kind hospital staff encouraging her, and a nurse named Onn who held her hand as she grimaced in pain.\n\n\"She was my angel, my rock star,\" she recalled of Onn.\n\nAlmost five hours after her first contraction, the twins arrived.\n\nMitchell was born at 9:41 a.m. Maksim at 9:51.\n\nJennifer didn't get to hold the babies, who were whisked away by nurses to be cleaned and to avoid any contamination.\n\n\"They held them up from me across the room. They were cute. I remember thinking how tiny they looked,\" she said.\n\nShe then texted a photo of the babies to her husband.\n\n\"It was both incredible and surreal,\" Andre Laubach recalled. \"It was great to see them and know that they're OK. ... They seemed healthy and Jen was in a good spirits at the same time.\"\n\nAndre Laubach said he still felt awful about missing their births. But he was very sick, and still had a ways to go to recover. So the photo of the babies meant everything.\n\n\"It gave me a reason to fight,\" he said. \"I see those pictures and I think, 'I better get through this. 'I've got things to take care of now.' \"\n\nThe Laubachs would go three weeks before they got to meet their boys, who also couldn't come home right away because they were born prematurely and needed extra care. On Thursday, after being cleared by infectious disease doctors at Beaumont, the couple finally went to the hospital and held their sons.\n\nThey also took a quick course at the hospital in caring for preemies as they would soon be bringing the boys home. The delay in bringing them home gave them plenty of time to set up the nursery, which wasn't ready yet as the twins weren't due until May 11, the day of their scheduled C-section.\n\nThe couple also had to cancel their baby shower because of the virus, though their friends and family had mailed all the gifts.\n\n\"Andre relied on wanting to see his kids, to feed his kids, that's what got him through,\" his wife recalled. \"For us to be reunited as a family.\"\n\nOn Saturday, they drove away from Beaumont Hospital, with baby Mitchell in the back. His brother could be home by the end of the week.\n\nAndre Laubach credits much of this to his wife.\n\n\"Jen drove a half an hour after her water broke, after thinking I was dying, diagnosed with coronavirus and then delivered two babies with no support\" he said. \"She's tough.\"\n\nThe experience also taught him a valuable lesson.\n\n\"Don't take the moments that you have with the people you love for granted,\" he said. \"You just gotta cherish every day that you have.\"",

    "NFL draft: Joe Burrow pick the last chance for Bengals in Cincinnati": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "CINCINNATI -- A little after 8 p.m on Thursday night, a new Bengals era will commence with the calling of Joe Burrow's name. Zac Taylor won't label it a new anything. To him, it's simply the continuation of the massive rebuild he started last year.\n\nIt's not, though.\n\nIt's the latest fresh start for a franchise that has had more than a few. It's also the last fresh start. The final beginning for the Cincinnati Bengals. If they screw this one up, their next one will be in another town.\n\nJoe Burrow probably doesn't know that the Bengals stadium lease is up in 2026. Definitely, he doesn't care. It's not his concern that his performance for the next four years - the length of a rookie contract in the NFL - likely will determine if the city keeps its NFL team.\n\nBurrow could save the franchise or help it pack. Lease discussions will start in 2024. That gives the Burrow Bengals four seasons to figure things out. Burrow will get a mulligan his rookie year. After that, things need to change, radically and quickly. Or the moving vans will idle outside Paul Brown Stadium.\n\nNFLPA DIRECTOR:Flexibility, innovation needed as NFL prepares for draft, offseason amid COVID-19 pandemic\n\nNFL DRAFT: Five big-name players could fall out of first round\n\nUPDATED MOCK DRAFT: Final first-round projection includes a few surprises\n\nIf the Bengals stay on the 6-10/7-9 hamster wheel, well, maybe San Diego will still need a team. Burrow is that significant. There's a reason I started calling him Saint Joe last December.\n\nBurrow offers the Bengals their last, best chance to get it right. If he is as good as most \"experts\" believe, he is the foundational reason for the franchise to change what it is. Its philosophies, its arrogance, its stubbornness, its identity. Everything. Carson Palmer, the last player with Burrow's heft, couldn't do it. That's why he left here.\n\nSigning a fistful of free agents was a welcome change, but ingrained organizational inertia isn't cured in one offseason. Bengalization has been a career-long malady. Its biggest symptom is a pervasive OK-ness with being OK.\n\nAre you good with the Bengals wanting to be \"competitive\"? That's what Duke Brown, er, Mike Tobin, er, Duke Tobin said the goal was, during a recent Zoom moment with the media.\n\n\"So that's always been our focus, taking advantage of every opportunity we get and putting together the best team possible,\" he said, \"because we believe that's what our fans want moreso than any one name, a team that's gonna be competitive. And ultimately if we give them that, I think they'll be happy.\"\n\nDo you think Bob Kraft stands in front of his Patriots each spring and asks them to be competitive in the coming year?\n\nThe Steelers fall out of bed and compete. Mostly, so do the Ravens.\n\nIt's the bare minimum.\n\nThe NFL rigs itself so all teams can be competitive. Competitive is 7-9/8-8/9-7. It's in the far left of the photo, grinning, happy to be there. It's a neither here nor there state of being. Enough to keep fans engaged, not enough to get them expecting much. Which is a very good way to describe how the Bengals do business.\n\nI understand what Tobin is trying to say. But fans don't want a team that is competitive. They want a team that wins championships. Just once, wouldn't you like someone at PBS to say, \"Anyone can be competitive in the NFL. We want to be great. For the first time in our history, we are going to dare to be something beyond OK. We intend to reward your loyalty the way we reward the loyalty of all the people in this building.\n\n\"For all the years of asking you to hang in there with us. For the tap water we sold you when the bottled water ran out. For the ways we have tested your patience, for how we have unintentionally caused you to rethink the possibilities of Sundays in the fall. . .\n\n\"For unwittingly convincing some of you of the value of lowered expectations, and defining for you the difference between wanting to win and needing it.\n\n\"For all that, our new goal is to be great. Which has nothing to do with being competitive. Nothing at all.\"\n\nThe only person who can move that mountain is Joseph Lee Burrow. He'll be a Bengal by 8:15 p.m. Thursday night, when the clock starts ticking on the last new beginning for professional football in Cincinnati.",

    "NFL stadiums face monumental task when football returns: Easing fear": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "The schedule is out. Hype and anticipation are flowing. While the number of cases and deaths related to the COVID-19 pandemic mount, the NFL has boldly declared it intends to roll on with the games with fans in the stands.\n\nIf it's safe, of course.\n\nWhat might that look like for fans eager to attend NFL games this fall? Staged arrivals with social distancing. No-contact entry with e-tickets. Cashless concessions. Ordering hot dogs from Section 123 using a smartphone. Concourses, railings, counter tops, seats, restrooms and then some, treated with virus-proof chemicals.\n\nAt least those are some of the possibilities. One thing is certain: A \"new normal\" is coming to NFL venues, just as it is barreling into society at large as virtually every state in the nation is in the process of re-opening.\n\n\"There are so many unknowns out there,\" Steve Cannon, CEO of AMB Group, parent company for the Atlanta Falcons and Mercedes-Benz Stadium, told USA TODAY Sports. \"We're trying to plan against this dynamic, shifting landscape. That said, fan psychology is probably the most important thing we know. You're not going to get fans in your building unless they feel they can be safe there, that they can gather in a safe manner. Some of those things we can control, some of those things we can't control.\"\n\nIt's still unclear whether fans will be allowed into Mercedes-Benz Stadium for the Falcons' scheduled season opener Sept. 13 against the Seattle Seahawks, or for two preseason games in August. The NFL's contingencies could include staging games without fans, with limited fans or perhaps pushing back the start of its season. The science and recommendations from medical experts, in addition to governmental mandates, will influence whether the NFL must adjust.\n\nIn the meantime, Cannon, like others running league, team and stadium operations for various entities in all sports, weighs the logistics in addition to the psychology that will be in play for the day fans ultimately return to the venues.\n\nMaybe not. In a world where face masks and social distancing are established measures to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus, the notion of being comfortable gathering in a stadium packed with, say, 70,000 spectators is daunting.\n\nA recent Seton Hall Sports Poll revealed that 61% of respondents who identified themselves as sports fans (and 72% of all respondents) indicated they would not attend a sports event until a COVID-19 vaccine is available. The poll was conducted in mid-April; the NFL is undoubtedly banking on societal progress in curtailing the pandemic over the next three months (which could be stretching hope, albeit after Major League Baseball attempts to return) before its preseason is slated to begin.\n\n\"Your gut is that if they open the building, people are going to show up,\" Rick Gentile, the former CBS Sports executive producer who directs Seton Hall's sports polls, told USA TODAY Sports. \"They're going to be so desperate to see a ballgame. But 61% of sports fans said they wouldn't. To me, that was the most telling question that we asked.\"\n\nSPORTS, DELIVERED: Get the latest sports news sent right to your inbox. Sign up here.\n\nCannon knows all about the trepidation. Given a philosophy that starts at the top with team owner Arthur Blank, there probably isn't a franchise in the NFL that better connects with its consumers than the Falcons. It's hardly surprising that for each of the past three years, Mercedes-Benz Stadium ranked No. 1 among NFL venues for safety and security, according to an annual survey of NFL fans based on stadium experiences.\n\nNow comes a new challenge for an operation on the cutting edge among NFL peers to move the needle on that reputation.\n\n\"The definition of safety and security is now completely different,\" Cannon said. \"Security and safety in the old world was, 'Did I get through the magnetometers and the security check? Do I feel safe or threatened inside your environment?' That was more physical safety. Now, it's a different definition of safety because of COVID-19 and this invisible thing that can be on any surface, carried by any individual.\"\n\nThe Falcons and Mercedes-Benz Stadium are far from finalizing plans, Cannon cautioned. \"The last nine weeks have taught me that if you don't like things now, wait 15 minutes and they'll change,\" he said. But they are well into considering various options.\n\nOne vendor has proposed infrared cameras for gate entrances, which could mass-screen people to identify high fevers. That's hardly an end-all solution. \"We know there are a lot of people who run around without symptoms,\" Cannon said.\n\nIt's a given, though, that the days of opening gates two hours before kickoff with a mob scene are over. That process will begin earlier -- without the mob scene. Cannon said they are considering designating specific gates for fans to enter that would depend on the location of their seats. More shocking could be an appointed time window for fans to enter -- which is even more intriguing, considering the late-arriving crowds that are a Falcons tradition.\n\n\"In the same way that airlines do group one, two, three, four, five, six, we're going to create order,\" Cannon said. \"In the old days, everybody flocks in front of the security entry and you get all kinds of congregating. We're going to have to solve that, and some of that could mean a staged entry.\"\n\nCannon expects changes at stadiums will be reminiscent of how airline travel changed after 9/11, which ushered in an elaborate security process -- and much consternation.\n\n\"Out of necessity,\" Cannon said, \"people will accept certain inconveniences that in the old world would have been inconceivable.\"\n\nSince 2017, the Falcons have utilized e-tickets, with patrons scanning a QR code for entry. Soon, this will likely be a league-wide standard. Last year, Mercedes-Benz Stadium went cashless for concession sales. The pandemic will only boost that concept. When the Falcons conducted an e-seminar a week ago, presenting their \"cashless\" experience, the team said 131 professional teams and 40 college teams participated.\n\nThe technology is also in the works that would allow fans to use smartphones to order concessions.

    "Navy recommends reinstatement of fired carrier captain Brett Crozier": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "WASHINGTON - The top Navy officer has recommended the reinstatement of the aircraft carrier captain fired for sending a fraught email to commanders pleading for faster action to protect his crew from a coronavirus outbreak, officials familiar with the investigation said Friday.\n\nAdm. Mike Gilday recommended that Navy Capt. Brett Crozier be returned to his ship, said the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the results of an investigation that have not yet been made public.\n\nIf approved, his recommendation would end a drama that has rocked the Navy leadership, sent thousands of USS Theodore Roosevelt crew members ashore in Guam for quarantine and impacted the fleet across the Pacific, a region critical to America's national security interests.\n\nGilday met with Gen. Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, on Tuesday and with Defense Secretary Mark Esper on Friday morning to lay out his recommendations. An official says Esper has asked for a delay in any public announcement while he considers the recommendation.\n\nEarlier in the day, Esper's chief spokesman Jonathan Hoffman had suggested that Esper was going into the matter with an open mind, and said \"he is generally inclined to support Navy leadership in their decision.\"\n\nThe extraordinary episode has captivated a public already overwhelmed by the pandemic. And it has played out as the military copes with the coronavirus by reducing training, scaling back recruiting and halting troop movements even as it deploys tens of thousands of National Guard and other troops to help civilian agencies deal with virus outbreaks across the country.\n\nCrozier was abruptly removed earlier this month by acting Navy Secretary Thomas Modly, who resigned days later. His return to the ship would reunite him with crew members so upset about his firing that many crowded together on the deck and applauded and chanted his name as he strode off the ship.\n\nAs of Friday, 856 sailors on the USS Theodore Roosevelt have tested positive for the virus and four are hospitalized. One sailor, who was from Arkansas, has died, and more than 4,200 of the ship's nearly 5,000 crew members have been moved onto the island for quarantine.\n\nAs that outbreak continues, a second Navy ship at sea is now also reporting a growing number of infections. Navy officials said at least 18 crew members on the USS Kidd naval destroyer have tested positive, and one sailor has been evacuated to the U.S. The Kidd, with its crew of 350, is off the Pacific coast of Central America, where it has been operating as part of a U.S. counter-drug mission.\n\nClearing the aircraft carrier and its crew of the virus has proved to be difficult and complicated. Sailors who test negative after time in quarantine are suddenly showing symptoms a day or two later. The virus' bewildering behavior, which is challenging the broader international medical community, is making it harder to determine when the carrier might be able to return either to duty or head home.\n\nGilday's recommendations were first reported by The New York Times.\n\nCrozier was fired April 2 by Modly after sending an email to several naval officers warning about the growing virus outbreak and asking for permission to isolate the bulk of his crew members on shore. It was an extraordinary move that would take the carrier out of duty in an effort to save lives.\n\n\"We are not at war. Sailors do not need to die. If we do not act now, we are failing to properly take care of our most trusted asset, our sailors,\" Crozier said in the memo.\n\nModly complained that Crozier \"demonstrated extremely poor judgment\" in the middle of a crisis, saying the captain copied too many people on the memo, which quickly went public. Modly also asserted that Crozier had improperly allowed sensitive information about the ship's condition to become public.\n\nA few days later, Modly flew out to the ship and delivered a profanity-laced condemnation of Crozier over the loudspeaker to the crew. Crozier, he said, may have been \"too naive or too stupid\" to be commanding officer of the ship.\n\nJust hours after his comments were widely reported, Modly apologized. But the next day, in the face of widespread criticism, he resigned. Esper initially defended Modly's firing of Crozier, saying he made a \"very tough decision.\" But other military leaders, including Gilday, internally opposed the firing, saying an investigation should be conducted first.\n\nModly's trip to the carrier cost him Esper's support. Esper first demanded Modly apologize and a day later accepted his resignation.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has expressed seemingly contradictory views on the matter,. He initially blasted Crozier, calling his memo \"terrible.\" But a short time later he softened his take, saying he didn't want to destroy someone who may just have \"had a bad day.\"",

        "authors": [],
        "body": "WILMINGTON, DE - New Castle County government is dipping into local sewers for new estimates of how prevalent COVID-19 is in Delaware's most populous county.\n\nLast week, county officials sent a sample of raw sewage from the Wilmington Wastewater Treatment plant on 12th Street to a Massachusetts Institute of Technology startup. There, they compared the prevalence of genetic fragments from the virus in fecal matter against local population data and sewage flow rates - all in an effort to estimate how many people may have the virus.\n\nThe company's analysis estimated that 15,200 people - three percent of the population north of the Chesapeake & Delaware Canal - had the virus as of April 14. That number is approximately 15 times the laboratory confirmed cases in the county as of the sample date.\n\nIn Delaware: Unemployment claims during coronavirus state of emergency surpass 70,000\n\nAs of Thursday, New Castle County has 1,389 laboratory confirmed cases. There are 3,300 statewide and 92 people have died from the virus.\n\nBut the gulf between laboratory-confirmed tests and the sewage estimate is not entirely unexpected.\n\nIt's likely the number of people that have tested positive is far fewer than those who have actually had, and could have spread, the virus.\n\nLaboratory tests are limited. So nobody knows how many people may have been a carrier, but had mild symptoms and were never were tested. Looking at the presence of the virus in local sewers could provide estimates to that.\n\n\"This is a new technology,\" said New Castle County Executive Matt Meyer, whose administration partnered with the testing company. \"Though it is an estimate, it is helpful to us.\"\n\nMeyer said the intent is to conduct further tests to compare to the April 14 sample.\n\nSuch information could help reveal hotspots around the county where officials can direct more testing of people who are not showing symptoms, Meyer said.\n\nThat information could also be a tool for officials trying to gauge how many new cases and hospitalizations Delaware will continue to face and, somewhere down the line, when to ease restrictions on public life.\n\nWhile the high estimate prevalence of the virus may strike alarm at first glance, Meyer said it could also be a measure of how close the county is to reaching \"herd immunity,\" a point where most residents are immune to the virus, slowing its spread.\n\nThat's usually reached through a vaccine, which does not currently exist. And the science is unclear now whether those exposed become entirely immune and how long they will remain immune. Some reports have indicated some people may become reinfected.\n\nMeyer said it could be another tool in making decisions in an uncertain future, but will not by itself lead to any \"grand decisions.\"\n\nThe study was conducted by a Massachusetts Institute of Technology startup Biobot Analytics. Since March 23, the startup has gathered samples from more than 100 treatment facilities in about two dozen states.\n\nThe county's results are similar than those in Los Angeles County, California where 4 percent of the population were estimated to have been exposed.\n\nThe results also track with a series of preliminary tests in the county that determines whether or not someone had the virus by measuring antibodies in their blood, said New Castle County Public Works Stormwater and Environmental Program Manager Mike Harris.",

    "Not everyone will want to take a coronavirus test. We need incentives.": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "The consensus among public health experts is that safely emerging from lockdown will require testing millions of Americans every week for the virus that causes COVID-19 and isolating those who test positive. To make that a reality, we need sufficient testing capabilities, but we also need people to actually take the tests and stay home if they're positive.\n\nThe $25 billion that Congress has just allocated for testing could go a long way toward giving the nation the additional capacity this will require. We should now turn some of our attention toward compliance -- peoples' willingness to be tested and, if necessary, go into quarantine. Compliance could turn out to be the biggest bottleneck to our success if we don't get the incentives right.\n\nIt will be easy to persuade those suffering from the symptoms of COVID-19 to take a test. The bigger challenge will be to persuade those of us who are feeling healthy. The science is clear. To bottle up the virus, we have to isolate the asymptomatic spreaders. To identify these hidden infections, we will have to test virtually all Americans regularly. Where the virus is active, we might need to test people every week or even every day.\n\nMaking testing free and easily accessible is a good first step, but even then, compliance is likely to be low. Can we really expect a person who feels healthy to voluntarily go to a doctor's office or pharmacy to be tested every week, likely waiting in line with people who have COVID symptoms, especially if he or she has tested negative on every other occasion?\n\nThe spreading of a disease from one person to others is a classic case of what economists call a \"negative externality.\" When someone is contagious, they impose costs on other people around them -- costs that most people do not take fully into account when making choices that might expose others.\n\nWar on coronavirus: Recruit army of contact tracers to guard against a counterattack\n\nFortunately, this is one problem economists know how to solve. Any society can \"internalize the externality\" by imposing penalties or offering rewards to make what's best for the individual line up with what is best for society as a whole. By our rough calculations, someone who is infected with COVID-19 and who is not in quarantine imposes costs on everyone else of at least $2,000 per week (and probably much more) after accounting for the medical costs, the suffering and the possible deaths of those they infect. To succeed, a \"test and isolate\" strategy for controlling the virus must make sure that these costs influence each person's decision about whether to get tested. The crucial thing to remember when we are trying to build consensus for a policy is that carrots can be as effective as sticks.\n\nOne way to create a strong incentive to get tested would be to set up a COVID lottery (\"Pandemillions!?\") that gives away large prizes every week to random test participants. On Sunday mornings, states would notify the individuals selected for testing that week, probably using algorithms that assess the likelihood of infection. Those people would then have until the end of the week to get tested. A completed test would convert into a \"ticket\" in the lottery, with winners announced every Saturday night.\n\nBecause the benefits of widespread testing would be so large, we could afford to fund a very lucrative prize pool. If we gave away $200 million per week, the annual cost of the lottery would only be over $10 billion, or roughly 0.5% of the cost of the recently passed CARES Act.\n\nHotline: Share your coronavirus story\n\nMillions of dollars in prize money might not be enough to persuade some Americans to get tested, especially those who know they can't afford to stay home from work if they have no symptoms but test positive. To address this issue, we would recommend a second incentive for anyone who tests positive for COVID-19 and is thus required to self-quarantine.\n\nIn addition to whatever stimulus payments Congress approves, we should add a $2,000 weekly payment (a \"COVID dividend!?\") for every American adult who is compelled to stay home. If our modeling is correct and we have to quarantine up to 20 million people this year, the cost of this program will approach $80 billion -- a lot of money, to be sure, but quite modest compared to the total costs we will experience with this pandemic.\n\nDying for cute toes? I hate to say it, Georgia, but on this one, we're as dumb as we look.\n\nStrong incentives create strong responses. It's possible that our COVID dividend would lure some people, especially those running out of money and options, to purposely infect themselves. We suspect that this would happen only rarely, limited to a small subset of healthy young people who are at low risk for complications. Nonetheless, it does mean that some Americans might take on extra risks and suffer the consequences.\n\nNonetheless, it is pure fantasy to believe that the amount of testing required will happen absent strong incentives. Now is the time to be putting those incentives into place.",

        "body": "SALEM, Ore. - Tony Villasenor had a persistent cough, flu-like symptoms and shortness of breath.\n\nIn his early 60s, with underlying medical conditions, he was seen by healthcare providers in the emergency rooms of two local hospitals and a clinic.\n\nBut each time, even as he got progressively worse, he was denied a COVID-19 test, told either he wasn't sick enough or tests weren't available.\n\nDoctors suspected he had coronavirus, and X-rays confirmed he had pneumonia.\n\nBut still, he was not tested.\n\nVillasenor, his wife Pressy, and their adult children were astounded he was denied four times - until it was almost too late.\n\nTony was struggling to breathe when his wife called an ambulance to their home in Salem, Oregon, on April 2. He went into cardiac arrest while paramedics were there. They did CPR and revived him, then transported him to Salem Hospital, where his heart stopped again and he had to be revived.\n\nHe was admitted that morning and placed on a ventilator.\n\nHe tested positive for COVID-19 nearly three weeks after first seeking testing.\n\nIf a 61-year-old man with a history of diabetes and heart disease, presenting with a cough, shortness of breath, flu-like symptoms and active pneumonia couldn't meet criteria, who could?\n\nOr was this simply a rare case of someone falling through the testing cracks, multiple times, in the chaos of the surging pandemic?\n\nOfficials with the medical facilities involved responded to questions about testing protocol but could not speak specifically about this case because of HIPAA privacy rules.\n\n\"I can totally understand the frustration of this person and their family,\" Dr. Tom Jeanne of Oregon Health Authority told the Salem Statesman Journal, part of the USA TODAY Network. \"Being undiagnosed is frustrating, to have it take a while, and not get tested right away.\n\n\"I have not heard a lot of stories of that kind of situation happening. That may have happened more earlier on in the epidemic when testing was in short supply and the guidance and all the information everybody had, including Oregon Health Authority, was changing rapidly.\"\n\nPreviously: Coronavirus testing in the U.S. was limited for months because of low Medicare payments\n\nTeacher Appreciation Week: They wanted respect. It only took a coronavirus pandemic and worldwide economic collapse.\n\nTony Villasenor, \"Papa Tony\" to family, came from humble beginnings and has worked hard all his life.\n\nHe grew up in a small village in the Philippines, walking hours to get to his job in the city. He and his wife, who've been married 39 years, emigrated to the United States in 1989 and worked in the fields in California.\n\nHe eventually found work in the food industry, and she became a certified nursing assistant.\n\nThey moved to Salem in 2006.\n\nTheir children describe him as someone with a great sense of humor who enjoys karaoke and loves to cook.\n\nThey said he's a quiet man who doesn't like drama, which makes them wonder how he'd feel about them sharing his medical information and talking about his ordeal.\n\nHe had just been moved from intensive care when they first reached out to the Salem Statesman Journal.\n\n\"We just want to make some kind of impact,\" son Lyndon Villasenor said, \"where if it's someone else's loved one, they would be able to get the test, and they wouldn't be turned away like my dad was.\n\n\"I don't want anyone to be sentenced to die at home when they could be helped at a hospital. The hospital is not where you turn people away. It's a place for healing.\"\n\nHis father was at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19 because he's diabetic and has atrial fibrillation, or an irregular heartbeat. He's had multiple cardiac arrests and double by-pass surgery.\n\nAll but one of the 101-plus Oregon residents who have died had an underlying medical condition at the time of their death and nearly 60 percent had heart disease, according to state health officials.\n\nWidespread testing wasn't available in Oregon when Villasenor first sought care in mid-March, and it still isn't.\n\nOregon Health Authority (OHA) recently announced revised guidelines for COVID-19 testing to prioritize at-risk groups and front-line workers. But that was after Oregon was declared by the White House coronavirus task force to be among four states with the lowest testing capacity in the United States.\n\nOHA's guidelines, though, are just that. Testing is at the discretion of a provider, whether that be at a hospital, emergency department or clinic.\n\n\"That's really been the case from the beginning,\" said Dr. Jeanne, deputy health officer and deputy state epidemiologist for OHA.\n\nAs for the guidelines: \"They can take it or leave it,\" Jeanne said. \"They don't have to let us know or advise us or get approval to test.\"\n\nIn Villasenor's case, at least three different medical facilities - one twice - determined the coronavirus test either wasn't needed or wasn't available.\n\nIt's plausible the places he visited weren't capable of testing at that time. Lack of equipment and bureaucratic hurdles have curbed the testing process along the way.\n\nEven now, a month later, Jeanne said the No. 1 barrier has been the supply chain for testing supplies, especially for smaller hospitals and clinics. There's a shortage of reagents, for example, the chemicals used to analyze specimens.\n\n\"They've got machines, staff and capability,\" Jeanne said. \"But they don't have enough actual test supplies to run tests.\"\n\nFact check: Obama administration did not send $3.7 million to Wuhan lab\n\nThe list of people OHA recommends for COVID-19 testing includes healthcare workers and first responders, residents and staff in a care facility or group living setting, essential frontline workers who have contact with large numbers, people 60 and older, and people with underlying medical conditions.\n\nTony Villasenor checked most of those boxes.\n\nHe's a cook at the Oregon State Hospital in Salem, where he's worked since 2008. He's 61 and has underlying medical conditions. And, he had COVID-19 symptoms.\n\nWhat we don't know is whether he told any of the providers that he worked in food services at the state hospital, which feasibly could or should have moved him to the front of the line, although the guidelines were far more restrictive.\n\nTony was diagnosed with pneumonia in February but continued to work until the later parts of the month.\n\nThe first time he sought care for what he believed could be the coronavirus was March 13 in the emergency department at Legacy Silverton Medical Center. He had an unresolved cough and a fever. The emergency room sent him home and told him to self-quarantine.\n\nWithin a few days, after feeling worse with flu-like symptoms, he returned to the same ER. Again, he was sent home and told to self-quarantine.\n\nLegacy Silverton Medical Center had access to COVID-19 testing at the time, according to a spokesman. But he said that in mid-March, the state required patients have a severe lower respiratory infection and be admitted to a hospital to be eligible for testing.\n\nVillasenor's symptoms continued to worsen with shortness of breath and on March 29, his wife rushed him to the ER, this time in Salem. He was suspected of having COVID-19 - it's noted on paperwork shared by his family - and an X-ray confirmed he had pneumonia.\n\nBut he still wasn't considered sick enough.\n\nHe was sent home with antibiotics and told to continue to quarantine.\n\nBy that time, Salem Health had designated three of its clinics as testing sites. Due to a shortage of testing collection kits, the Salem Hospital emergency department still is not testing for COVID-19, according to a hospital spokesman.\n\nVillasenor's condition continued to decline. He and his family became worried and scared.\n\nThey managed to get him an appointment at Salem Health Medical Clinic, a designated testing sites.\n\nAgain, the provider suspected COVID-19 but wouldn't or couldn't test him.\n\nHe was sent home once again, told to continue antibiotics and quarantine.\n\n\"My husband needed treatment,\" his wife said. \"I was so devastated.\"\n\nDuring all this time, his family said he did not leave the house other than to see those medical providers.\n\nStudy: Low-income and younger workers bear brunt of coronavirus-related layoffs\n\nWatching his health deteriorate and witnessing the testing roadblocks were frustrating for his wife and two oldest children, who all work in the healthcare field.\n\n\"It just astounds me that a person has to be dying,\" said son Lyndon Villasenor, who works at an emergency psychiatric facility in Portland.\n\nTony's wife, Pressy, is a Mental Health Therapist 1 at the state hospital. She's worked there since 2007. His daughter, Fritzie Ortiz, is a nurse who works in case management in the Portland area.\n\nThe coronavirus attacked Tony Villasenor's lungs, kidneys and liver. He was on a ventilator and in a coma for 2\u00bd weeks. Doctors didn't think he'd survive.\n\nAdding to the family's trauma was the fact that they couldn't be with him because of strict visitor restrictions. They butted heads with staff while discussing what an end-of-life visit would look like.\n\nIt was an emotional time, and they felt the staff was dismissive and had no empathy. It came to a head when a charge nurse hung up the phone on Fritzie.\n\n\"I argued with the nurse. It was awful,\" Fritzie said. \"So many words were exchanged that day.\"\n\nBy the time they had clarity from the hospital over end-of-life visiting protocol, her father's condition had improved.\n\nHer brother Lyndon reached out to social media groups for support, where he learned of others around the world whose family members died because the system failed. He was comforted to know they weren't alone.\n\nMore: Coronavirus takes steam out of home buying season but sales, prices should rebound\n\nTony Villasenor was lucky. He survived a severe case of COVID-19, but his family wonders whether they all could have been spared the anguish if only he had been tested sooner.\n\n\"He had everything against him,\" daughter Fritzie said. \"It's a miracle, honestly. The doctors said he had a miraculous recovery.\"\n\nHis condition continues to improve, although he has a long road to recovery ahead. COVID-19 left him practically bedridden, and he remains on dialysis, which he may need for life.\n\nHe's been working with physical and speech therapists and can now sit up and talk. His wife is thankful to be able to see and hear him via FaceTime.\n\n\"He's still very weak, but he's so happy,\" Pressy said. \"I told him God gave him a second life, and he cried.\"\n\nPressy tested positive for coronavirus, too, but had only mild symptoms - a cough and occasional fever.\n\nHer daughter suggested she go to an urgent care clinic to get retested.\n\nPressy drove there Tuesday and received results the next day.\n\nShe tested negative for the coronavirus and hopes to return to work soon.\n\nFollow Capi Lynn on Twitter: @CapiLynn\n\nMore: Tennessee funeral home offers drive-thru viewing amid coronavirus lockdowns",

    "Patients in Florida had symptoms of COVID-19 as early as January": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "The novel coronavirus infected as many as 171 people in Florida as long as two months before officials announced it had come to the state, a Palm Beach Post analysis of state records shows.\n\nPatients reported symptoms of the deadly virus as early as Jan. 1, when the disease was thought to be limited to China, Department of Health records reveal. The records don't say if patients reported those symptoms to the state until months later or if local offices of the health department actively investigated the illnesses at the time or a combination of both.\n\nThe state pulled the records off its website late Monday without explanation.\n\nFlorida did not announce its first two presumed coronavirus cases until March 1. At the time, cases were not considered confirmed until reviewed by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nThe CDC confirmed those first two cases, in Manatee and Hillsborough counties, on March 2. The state now has recorded more than 36,000 cases of the deadly virus.\n\nBut at the time of the first two cases, 171 people across 40 counties who would later test positive for COVID-19 were suffering from the disease, state records show. Three of those patients were in Palm Beach County, which officially didn't record its first two coronavirus cases until March 13. The county now has more than 3,300 cases.\n\nUntil Monday evening, when the state confirmed a coronavirus case, it publicly posted data on each case, without identifying the patient. The publicly shared data included a date that represented one of two things: when the patient first started feeling symptoms or when the patient received a positive test result.\n\nIt is not clear from the data how the state treated the patients or even when they found out about their symptoms. No state officials could be reached for comment late Monday.\n\nThe entire dataset disappeared from the state website Monday evening only to return after 7:30 p.m. without the column showing the date relating to symptoms.\n\nAn analysis of the state data, which has been downloaded and retained by The Post since the state started posting it in March, found these diverse early cases:\n\n-- A 4-year-old Duval County girl started feeling symptoms or had her first positive test on Jan. 1. The state did not officially record her case until April 8.\n\n-- An 84-year-old Palm Beach County man who had not traveled, but was hospitalized, had symptoms or a positive result on Feb. 5. But his case was not added to Florida's coronavirus tally until April 3.\n\n-- A 48-year-old Palm Beach County woman whose symptoms or positive test results were reported Feb. 6. Her case was counted on Saturday.\n\n-- A 74-year-old Palm Beach County woman with symptoms or a positive result on Feb. 23, whose case was recorded by the state on April 4. She reported no out-of-state travel and she came into contact with someone carrying the virus.\n\n-- A 65-year-old man in Broward County who had traveled to the Cayman Islands listed symptoms or a positive test on Jan. 4 but his case was not recorded until March 7.\n\n-- A 30-year-old Broward County man, whose symptoms or first positive result came on Feb. 25, died. His case was added March 15.\n\n-- A 65-year-old man in Sarasota County who had traveled to California and came into contact with an infected person reported symptoms or had a positive result on Feb. 23. State health officials added his case April 6.\n\nAmong the 171 patients were 105 women and 66 men. They ranged in age from 4 to 91.\n\nEven though the disease was thought confined to China before January, most of the early patients hadn't traveled: 103 reported no travel while just 52 said they had.\n\nNone reported traveling to China.\n\nOnly six were not Florida residents. Their symptoms or positive results started appearing in mid- to late February.",

    "Pepcid to treat COVID-19? The theory is trending online but unproven": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "The over-the-counter antacid Pepcid is trending online and it's not because we all have collective heartburn over the coronavirus epidemic.\n\nNews leaked earlier this week that a health network in New York City was testing high intravenous doses of famotidine in COVID-19 patients, based on something an American infectious disease doctor working in China had reported.\n\nThere is so far no data supporting the theory, but that hasn't stopped it from taking on a life of its own online.\n\n\"Unfortunately, there's sometimes all this buzz up front because of some test tube findings or something along those lines, but it doesn't end up bearing out in patients,\" said Jim Lewis, clinical supervisor for infectious disease in the department of pharmacy services at Oregon Health & Science University in Portland, Oregon.\n\nCoronavirus is 'shaining a bright light' on the ills of poverty: What now?\n\n\"We can't reiterate strong enough to absolutely not take this drug without talking to your health care provider first,\" he said.\n\nFamotidine, sold as Pepcid, is used to treat excess stomach acid by blocking H2 receptors on the surface of the stomach cells that release acid.\n\nThe idea came from something Michael Callahan, an infectious disease doctor at Massachusetts General Hospital, saw when he was working in the Chinese city of Wuhan just as the coronavirus epidemic began to take off there.\n\nDoctors noticed many of the people surviving COVID-19 tended to be poorer, he told a reporter with the journal Science in an article published in its news section Sunday. They noticed that many of the survivors had chronic heartburn and took famotidine rather than omeprazole, sold in the United States as Prilosec, which is much more expensive.\n\nThe Chinese doctors looked at more than 6,000 patients and found a slightly higher number of those taking famotidine recovered than those who didn't take the medicine. The number wasn't high enough to be statistically significant, meaning it could just as easily be attributed to chance.\n\nTo find out if it was meaningful, Callahan contacted Kevin Tracey at Northwell Health in New York City. Partly funded by the U.S. Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, a double-blind randomized study was launched on April 14, according to Science.\n\n'Our moon shot': The world needs a coronavirus vaccine ASAP. Despite drugmakers billion-dollar bets, one might not be available for years.\n\nTheir working theory is that famotidine might bind to a protein that helps the SARS-CoV-2 virus reproduce.\n\nLewis noted that the targeting mechanism could be similar to some HIV medications which have also been tried on COVID-19 but unfortunately were not effective.\n\nThe patients in the study are being given an IV-dose of famotidine nine times more than the dose people take for heartburn. Famotidine can cause heart problems in people with decreased kidney function so they were excluded from the study.\n\nBecause so many patients at Northwell Health were also being treated with hydroxychloroquine, an anti-inflammatory drug that also has not been proven to be an effective treatment for COVID-19, they were only able to test a combination of the two drugs.\n\nIt was not a controlled study, meaning one group of patients receives a drug and a similar group does not. That makes it very difficult to know if the patients would have gotten better without the drug.\n\nWhen will a second wave of coronavirus hit in US? What what will it look like?\n\nInstead, the researchers plan to compare the patients getting the drugs with patients treated earlier in the outbreak. Northwell's Tracey told Science, \"Is it good science? No. It's the real world.\"\n\nDoctors caution that most COVID-19 patients recover despite there being no approved treatments.\n\nCurrently, death rates for COVID-19 patients hospitalized with serious symptoms appear to be between 5 and 10%, so the majority of patients will get better on their own, said Adarsh Bhimraj, an infectious diseases physician at Cleveland Clinic.\n\nIt's too easy for clinicians to presume if a patient gets better \"it's because of the medication we gave them, and if they don't get better we presume it's because of the disease,\" Bhimraj said.\n\nThe lack of data makes it impossible to know if famotidine has any actual effect on COVID-19 patients. As scientists like to say, \"Correlation is not causation.\" That means that just because two things tend to happen together, one does not cause the other.\n\nIt could be that the Chinese peasants got better in higher numbers because they're more physically fit or they drank less (or more) alcohol or they spent more time out of doors and therefore had higher levels of Vitamin D from sunlight. Or it could be that famotidine does in fact help treat COVID-19.\n\nUntil scientifically valid data from a well-designed clinical study is available, it is impossible to know.\n\nJohn Scott, chair of the department of pharmacology at the University of Washington School of Medicine said he had no idea why or how this particular H2 blocker is supposed to work against COVID-19, but the researchers appear to be applying the proper scientific principals.\n\n\"The fact that the authors acknowledge that the results are not yet statistically significant suggests that they are taking a rational and empirical approach to their analyses,\" he said.",

    "Remdesivir: What we know about the potential coronavirus treatment": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "A drug being developed to treat COVID-19, the disease caused by new coronavirus, is reportedly showing some promise but there's no guarantee initial reports will lead to a commercially available treatment.\n\nExperts have been racing to find a treatment for the illness that's killed more than 60,000 Americans and sickened more than 1 million. The experimental drug remdesivir has emerged as the first possible scientifically proven treatment.\n\nEarly data from a global study released Wednesday found patients given remdesivir recovered faster and may be less likely to die. However, another study published the same day in the British medical journal The Lancet found no clinical benefits to the drug.\n\nHere's what we know about the drug:\n\nRemdesivir, pronounced rem-dees-ih-veer, is an experimental antiviral drug from the American biotech firm Gilead Sciences. It was originally tested as a treatment for Ebola and other coronaviruses including SARS and is now being tested as a possible COVID-19 treatment.\n\nThe drug impairs the ability of the virus to replicate, according to John Scott, chair of the department of pharmacology at the University of Washington School of Medicine.\n\n\"You're decreasing the degree of infection so the immune system can fight. It's like taking fuel away from the fire,\" he said.\n\nDr. Aneesh Mehta, lead investigator for the portion of the remdesivir trial at Emory University in Atlanta, stressed the drug and other antivirals are not \"silver bullets\" that immediately get rid of an infection and the damage doesn't just \"all go away\" when the virus is gone.\n\nRemdesivir has not been approved anywhere for any use, according to Gilead, but is being given to patients in six clinical trials to determine if it is an effective and safe treatment for coronavirus.\n\nOutside of clinical trials, Gilead also has implemented programs that provide emergency treatment access for children and pregnant women with severe symptoms of COVID-19 and is trying to expand emergency access beyond these two groups.\n\nEarly results released Wednesday from the global study conducted by the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases found patients who received remdesivir had a 31% faster recovery time than those who received a placebo.\n\nWhile not a \"knock out,\" NIAID director Dr. Anthony Fauci said at an Oval Office meeting Wednesday the study results were \"a very important proof of concept.\"\n\nStudy: Remdesivir appears to speed recovery times in hospitalized COVID-19 patients\n\nThe NIAID study involved 1,063 hospitalized COVID-19 patients whose lungs were affected. A subset of about half those patients who got remdisivir had a median recovery time of 11 days while patients who got a placebo had a median recovery time of 15 days. Recovery was defined as being well enough to be discharged from the hospital or able to return to normal levels of activity.\n\nThe patients given remdesivir also had a lower mortality rate - 8% of them died compared with 11.6% of the placebo group. But researchers said we don't have enough data to know if that number is statistically significant.\n\nA randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial at 10 hospitals in Wuhan, China, found no statistically significant difference in how quickly patients improved, according to the study published in The Lancet.\n\nThough a higher number of patients receiving remdesivir showed a faster time to clinical improvement the numbers weren't enough to be more than chance.\n\nThe race to stop COVID-19: Remdesivir shows some promise but there's still no proven treatment\n\nLast week, early data from a Chinese study was prematurely posted then removed from a World Health Organization website. It did not appear to show any difference in outcomes between patients who got the drug and patients who didn't.\n\nAnother study not yet been peer-reviewed found patients on a 10-day remdesivir treatment plan and a five-day treatment plan showed \"similar improvement.\" Gilead said.\n\nA study published April 10 in the New England Journal of Medicine found the majority of people who got the drug improved, but there was no control group.\n\nThis month, medical news site STAT reported early and incomplete results from a remdesivir study being conducted in Chicago. The University of Chicago issued a statement saying that \"drawing any conclusions at this point is premature and scientifically unsound.\"\n\nWhat is remdesivir?Gilead Sciences drug reportedly shows promise treating coronavirus\n\nRemdesivir is one of several drugs touted recently as possible coronavirus treatments.\n\nHydroxychloroquine, convalescent plasma and immuno-modulators like tocilizumab have been given to patients with COVID-19 in clinical trials, but remdesivir is the only treatment that has been shown to have even a potential effect on the disease.",

    "Reports: Capitol physician lacks enough tests for all senators": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "WASHINGTON - The Capitol's attending physician said Thursday there aren't enough tests to preemptively test Senators for the coronavirus as they return to work on Monday.\n\nAccording to multiple reports, Dr. Brian Monahan, in a call with top Republican officials, stated he only had enough tests to test Senators and staffers with symptoms of COVID-19, and not enough supply a test to an asymptomatic senator.\n\nHe also reportedly said he didn't have access to the \"quick tests\" the White House has been using. When President Donald Trump took this test himself earlier this month, he said he got the result, a negative, within 15 minutes.\n\n'Someone's life could depend on it': Two congressmen donate plasma after COVID-19 recovery\n\nAccording to Axios, Monahan said, \"My test result can take between two and seven business days to resolve.\"\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., has repeatedly said Senators can return to the Capitol safely. When he announced the Senate would be returning May 4, he said, \"We will modify routines in ways that are smart and safe, but we will honor our constitutional duty to the American people and conduct critical business in person.\"\n\nMany Senate Democrats have disagreed, and aired their concerns about reconvening amid the pandemic. They also expressed frustration about returning if the Senate does not take up coronavirus relief legislation. McConnell has said he is focusing on confirming executive and judicial nominees.\n\nFeinstein urges McConnell not to reconvene Senate: 'No way to do this without increased risk'\n\nSen. Diane Feinstein, D-Calif., who is the oldest sitting US senator at age 86, wrote a letter to McConnell, listing Capitol staff who have tested positive for COVID-19.\n\n\"Clearly the coronavirus is present at the Capitol,\" she wrote, reiterating that coming back \"sends the wrong message to the American people, most of whom are being asked or directed to stay at home.\"\n\nSen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., wrote in a statement: \"It is shameful that Mitch McConnell is calling the U.S. Senate back to DC to vote on confirmation of his unqualified judge and nominees unrelated to the COVID-19 pandemic.\"\n\nHouse Democrats deciding not to return to the nations capital next week after consulting with Monahan.\n\nIn announcing the extension, House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md., cited increasing coronavirus case numbers in the Washington, D.C., area.\n\nMore: Haircut? Sure. Flying? Maybe not. As states reopen, Americans more comfortable with small steps, survey shows\n\nOf concern is the amount of high-risk individuals in the Senate. The average age is 63.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has advised people older than 60 to avoid large crowds and to stay home as much as possible. A March 18 report from the CDC noted that 31% of cases, 45% of hospitalizations, 53% of ICU admissions and 80% of deaths associated with COVID-19 involve seniors.\n\nAccording to reports of the conference call, Senators will be asked to wear masks at all times, unless giving a speech. They, and their staffers, will also be encouraged to follow strict social distancing at meetings, in session, and at lunches.\n\nPolitico first reported details of the conference call.",

    "Require masks to stop coronavirus spread: Health leaders to governors": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "Getting acceptance for public health actions has historically been difficult. For example, during the 1910 Manchurian Plague, Dr. Wu Lien Teh realized the microbe spread by air and that a simple cotton mask could reduce transmission. But many doctors didn't believe him.\n\nA prominent French doctor mocked Wu and his mask advice. He visited the sick without wearing a mask to prove his point, and died several days later. The plague was indeed contagious and transmitted through the air. The tide turned. For years later, masks were widely used to fight respiratory infections worldwide. But with few respiratory pandemics in the Western world, the lessons were gradually forgotten. Now we need to relearn them.\n\nWe are two of over 100 signatories -- including a Nobel laureate virologist, the editors in chief of Nature and The Lancet, and many of the world's leading medical and scientific experts from universities such as Harvard, MIT, Stanford and the University of Texas -- of an open letter being sent to all U.S. governors that asks them to \"require cloth masks to be worn in all public places, such as stores, transportation systems, and public buildings.\"\n\nLast week, a group convened by the Royal Society, chaired by Nobel laureate Venki Ramakrishnan, published an evidence paper recommending the use of face masks in the United Kingdom.\n\nEven with such strong messages from so many of the world's top experts, some may still have doubts. Some of this confusion is understandable. Until recently, there has been confusing messaging from many top public health authorities.\n\nMany scientific papers, including one by the authors, have been published recently supporting the efficacy of face coverings for \"source control\" -- that is, stopping an infected person from passing on infection to others. Simple cloth masks appear to stop over 90% of the droplets that transmit the virus. This is crucial, because research suggests that nearly half of infections are spread by people who don't even show any symptoms, and thus they probably don't know they're ill. They can go out and inadvertently spread the virus.\n\nCloth masks provide some protection to the wearer. But the primary role of mask wearing is to protect others. It stops people from infecting others. It also reduces the viral load if an infection does occur, which likely cuts the risk of a severe illness or death. But to be truly effective, they need to be worn by almost everyone. Recent modeling suggests that we need at least 80% of the population wearing masks to stop the spread of the virus.\n\nTo make that happen, just \"urging\" their use is not enough. We can see this in recent survey results showing that in majority of states that do not require masks, fewer than half the population are using them.\n\nWhen Republican Gov. Larry Hogan announced a mask requirement in Maryland, he noted that some say this \"infringes on their rights.\" But \"it's about protecting your neighbors,\" he explained. \"People might not know that they're carriers of the virus and ... they could infect other people.\"\n\nWe have many laws that primarily protect others, such as laws barring drunken driving and placing limits where people can smoke in public. If it is reasonable to protect people from secondhand smoke and drunken drivers, it is surely reasonable to protect them from a virus that has already killed nearly 84,000 Americans.\n\nToday, the importance of wearing masks is greater than ever. Many regions are easing some of the early restrictions, and there is a debate about the timing of such moves. However, that's a false dichotomy.\n\nThe economy cannot rebound until people feel safe, and people will not feel safe until the outbreak is under control. In a recent CBS News poll, less than a third of people said that they'd feel comfortable going to a bar or restaurant even if restrictions were lifted, and only 15% felt comfortable getting on an airplane. Mobility data shows people are choosing to avoid going out if they can help it regardless of the \"open\" or \"closed\" status of a state.\n\nThe focus has to remain on confronting this epidemic through a variety measures, including social distancing whenever possible, mass testing, contact tracing, isolation and, yes, crucially wearing face coverings -- especially indoors in public places. If there is another major outbreak, confidence will plummet even further.\n\nOur research shows there are no countries that have had near universal mask use since early in the pandemic that have over 1,000 known COVID-19 deaths. If masks led to worse outcomes, we would see it in some of the over 90 countries that now require masks.\n\nInstead, we see that Hong Kong, which has widespread mask use, has had only four confirmed deaths related to the coronavirus. Health authorities there credit mask use as a major contributor to this outcome.\n\nIn the United States, we should not accept the horrific death rates we're seeing in many parts of the country. The science is clear. To save American lives and jobs, we need to fully deploy this powerful tool as widely as possible.",

    "San Antonio's Jefferson High boys soccer team wins Healthy Sport Index": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "SAN ANTONIO - In the small Mexican town where Ever Mejia grew up, many kids quit school by their early teens to help their families work the fields.\n\nMejia had bigger dreams - he wanted to attend an American university. But when he immigrated here in 2017, his odds weren't good. He could barely speak English when he and his family moved into one of this city's poorest neighborhoods.\n\nBut after enrolling in a nonprofit leadership program during his sophomore year at Jefferson High School, his fate turned. The lessons he learned through the Urban Soccer Leadership Academy (USLA), which provides mentorship and financial assistance to low-income players across San Antonio, have helped Mejia - and more than a dozen of his teammates on Jefferson's boys soccer team - navigate the path to college.\n\nThree years ago, when USLA first started working with local students, 16% of Jefferson's boys soccer players were accepted to college, but none attended. This year, 100% of the school's players are expected to attend.\n\nThe program has helped Mejia's teammates, some of whom came from even more difficult backgrounds than him. One grew up in a Honduran orphanage. Another spent time in an immigration camp in Florida. A Congo-born player fled his homeland along with eight siblings, among the thousands of people displaced by that country's civil war.\n\nIn San Antonio - which has the highest poverty rate in the nation among the 25 largest metropolitan areas - the challenges have not subsided. Only half of the team's 18 players have two parents in the home. One player, who's 18, is helping to raise a young niece and nephew after his sister recently died.\n\nMany of Jefferson's players live largely independent lives, as their parents toil at low-income jobs that barely feed their families. Their pain has been compounded in recent weeks as many of their parents have lost their jobs at restaurants, cleaning businesses and other companies as a result of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nJefferson was once considered one of the nation's premier public high schools. Its alumni include two Nobel Prize winners, a Grammy Award-winning artist, and multiple NFL players, including Tommy Nobis, a former Pro Bowler and top pick in the NFL draft.\n\nBut 10 years ago, the school received an \"academically unacceptable\" rating from the state of Texas, as its graduation rate had plummeted. One of the school's few bright spots was its powerhouse boys soccer program. Between 2009 and 2018, the team won four district championships. In 2014, it advanced to the fourth round of the state playoffs, the school's best showing ever.\n\nDespite their on-field success, few Jefferson players were moving on to the collegiate ranks. In fact, many weren't even finishing high school, as they had to start working full time to help support their families.\n\nEd Garza, a former mayor of San Antonio and Jefferson alum, wanted to change that pattern. Garza, the founder of USLA, approached his alma mater about a partnership.\n\nOver the past six years, dozens of Jefferson players have participated in his program, contributing to a sharp improvement in the team's post-secondary success. In one recent graduating class, four of seven seniors went on to play college soccer, while all but one enrolled in college classes.\n\nAs winner of the Healthy Sport Index Contest for boys soccer, Jefferson serves as a leading example for other high schools to achieve positive outcomes in the three areas of health considered in the nationwide search by the Aspen Institute Sports & Society Program in partnership with Hospital for Special Surgery. Jefferson works to engage a large number of students (85) in physical activity, especially important when serving Hispanic youth, who have among the highest rates of obesity in the nation. The team's playing style, with controlled passing, minimizes injuries. But the program stands out most by attending to the psychosocial needs of its students, who face many challenges to educational and personal advancement.\n\nTeam budget: $13,900 (includes $12,550 in combined salaries for three coaches). Urban Soccer Leadership Academy does not provide direct financial support.\n\nRoster size: 85 players (freshman, junior varsity and varsity combined), making soccer one of the largest sports at the school, with about the same number of participants as football.\n\nHistory: Between 2009 and 2018, Jefferson won four district championships. In 2014, it advanced to the fourth round of the state playoffs, the school's best showing ever. Jefferson had a 20-4 record in 2019-20.\n\nIndeed, the program has helped transform the way Jefferson players think about their lives, says Nick Torres, who has coached the team since 2011. Several times a month, USLA's volunteer mentors speak with his team, providing tutoring and college-prep services, helping them create \"vision\" and \"purpose\" statements and inspiring them to align their daily actions with what they want for themselves and their families.\n\n\"These are strong-willed kids with a strong sense of family,\" Torres says. \"This program has challenged them to put that strong will to use for them and their families.\"\n\nFinancial issues aren't the only challenges the team faces. Drug abuse is common in inner-city San Antonio, and the threat of deportation hangs over many families. (Last year the father of one Jefferson player was deported).\n\nMany Jefferson players are English learners, immigrants or first-generation students. Besides classroom help, they need advice navigating the path to citizenship, which Garza's program helps to provide.\n\nJust as importantly, players need assurance that their school is a safe environment, Torres says. Twice this season, while practicing with their USLA team, players heard gunshots during practice and had to run off the field. Torres and Garza have worked with local law enforcement and health agencies to administer emergency-preparedness training for the team, including how to apply tourniquets.\n\n\"You hope the boys never have to use something like that, but we want them to be prepared,\" Torres says. \"It gives them some peace of mind.\"\n\nGarza, 51, grew up a few blocks from Jefferson High, an ornately designed white-stone campus built in 1932, which some say resembles a Spanish estate. He still lives on the same street, three houses down from where he was raised.\n\nAfter serving two terms as San Antonio's mayor and another two terms on city council, he turned his attention to the local school system and was elected to the San Antonio Independent School District in 2009.\n\nAround campus, he is a ubiquitous figure, overseeing team leadership training, providing individual tutoring and academic advice - even driving some kids home from practice.\n\nGarza and a group of volunteers started USLA in 2014, inspired to help inner-city kids have a safe place to play after school and in the summer. Once he hooks them with soccer, he invites them to education and leadership-training sessions that are open to all students, no matter if they play the sport.\n\nUSLA serves more than 1,000 kids a year, with an annual budget of about $280,000. A year after starting the program, Garza created a USLA club team for elite high school players. His goal was to support those who couldn't afford to play competitively outside of their high schools. (Most travel teams cost $2,000 or more a year per player. For scholarship players, USLA subsidizes all but the uniform.)\n\nUSLA now fields three boys and two girls high school-age club teams, drawing from 32 San Antonio-area high schools (14 of Jefferson's 18 varsity boys players participated this season). Garza also runs a summer rec league for 450 kids. To make it inclusive, he charges just $15 for three months of play.\n\nMore: How yoga benefits one high school boys basketball team\n\nGarza finances his program with government grants and financial assistance from local businesses and nonprofits. He thinks other community leaders could build similar programs by establishing clear, measurable educational objectives and tracking data to demonstrate the value of their programs, then working with community partners to fill students' social and academic gaps with in-kind support.\n\nTorres says it would take someone special to pull it off. \"I love what he does,\" Torres says of Garza. \"But to make another USLA - I don't know who has the heart.\"\n\nJose Segura, an 18-year-old Jefferson senior, joined the program after moving here eight years ago from Guanajuanto, Mexico. Before trying out for the USLA team, he had no formal training in the sport. He grew up playing the game by kicking a basketball around a concrete playground with friends. (No one could afford a soccer ball, he says).\n\nSince joining the academy, his game has flourished. He is a two-year captain on Jefferson's team and one of the district's leading scorers. In 2018, he was selected to the state's Olympic Development Program.\n\nSegura's parents moved here to give him and his sister more educational opportunities; neither of them made it past third grade. Next month, Jose will be the first in his family to graduate high school. He expects to finish in the top 100 of his class, with a 3.3 GPA.\n\nThe leadership program has taught him to prioritize his studies and manage his time better. \"It's taught me to do things directly,\" he says. \"If you wait, you'll be late.\"\n\nJefferson High School is the Aspen Institute's Healthy Sport Index award winner for high school boys soccer. The Healthy Sport Index, developed in partnership with Hospital for Special Surgery (HSS), helps the public make informed decisions about sport activities that meet the needs of youth. The Aspen Institute is searching for additional exemplary and innovative high school teams from many sports. The national search seeks teams that embrace best practices and innovate new ways to encourage physical activity, minimize injury risk and support athletes' emotional, social and mental well-being. High school teams may be nominated here.\n\n***************************************************\n\nOver the past decade, Jefferson has overcome many of its academic challenges, adding a prestigious International Baccalaureate program and improving its overall graduation rate to over 90%, up from 63% about a decade ago.\n\nMejia, who moved here from Guam\u00fachil, Mexico, a two-day drive from San Antonio, is enrolled in Jefferson's IB program. Before joining USLA, he says he didn't have a plan for getting into or paying for college. \"I was just doing what I had to do,\" he says. \"It wasn't a focused goal.\"\n\nOnce he learned about the college admissions process during USLA's \"college chats,\" he changed his ways - but it hasn't been all roses. An English learner, he has struggled to keep up with the IB curriculum. There were many times he wanted to quit - but his mother wouldn't let him.\n\nMore: How one high school wrestling team dramatically increased participation by putting kids first\n\nA single parent, she works at two restaurants to care for her family, but she doesn't allow her son to work more than one day a week. He helps build swimming pools on Saturdays, but only after his schoolwork is done.\n\n\"Es primera la educaci\u00f3n siempre,\" Gina Mejia says. (\"Education is always first.\")\n\nMejia says his mom is \"muy duro\" (\"very tough\") on him - but the persistence has paid off. At the start of this semester, he was ranked among the top 35 students in the senior class, with a 3.75 GPA. That helped qualify him for a full scholarship to the University of Texas at San Antonio.\n\nMejia wants to use his education to improve his family's plight. Twice a year he visits his mother's family farm in Guam\u00fachil, where they grow beans, wheat, tomatoes and other vegetables. In college, he plans to study mechanical engineering, with hopes of designing a machine to protect the family farm against flooding.\n\n\"I know I can do something to help my family,\" he says.\n\nNot all Jefferson players are such good students. Last year, two of its players were among the 26 Jefferson students who failed to pass the state academic assessments required for graduation.\n\nIt was the job of Yareli Melendez, a district-wide instructional specialist, to work with those players. Despite their academic limitations, she was impressed with their work ethic. One of the players broke his arm but still showed up for tutoring.\n\n\"He just never used it as an excuse,\" Melendez says.\n\nAfter failing the test four times, both players passed on their fifth attempt - and both enrolled in community college the next fall.\n\nJefferson also employs a full-time family and community engagement specialist, Rebecca Zertuche, who works all hours answering parents' questions and attending to students' needs.\n\nA few years ago, she got a call from Garza in the middle of the night about a player who had just run away from home. She and her husband have fostered Jefferson players for years, including one three-year stretch when they had three extra teenagers in their house. (Their son, Andres, played on the freshman and JV teams this year.)\n\nTorres, who teaches physical education, gets as many opportunities as anyone to influence these students.\n\n\"We get after 'em daily,\" he says. \"We turn into mom and dad.\"\n\nFive days a week during the school year, Torres works with each of the school's 85 soccer players on the school's freshman, JV and varsity teams. Jefferson has different freshman and JV coaches, but Torres has every player in the soccer class they are all enrolled in.\n\nIn that class, players spend most of their time in the weight room or on the field doing high-repetition, low-weight lifting exercises and speed and agility training to build muscular endurance and avoid repetitive-stress injuries. In addition, Torres encourages his players to run track, play tennis and participate in other sports to give their muscles a break from soccer.\n\nAt 35, Torres is close enough in age to identify with the challenges his players are dealing with. Off the field, he hams it up with students, sharing memes on a group text chain and joking with players who hang out in his office.\n\nThe boys have nicknames for many players - from Mbapp\u00e9 (Josue Salazar, who resembles the star French player) to Gerber (Mejia, who looks like the Gerber baby). They call Torres \"vasuca\" (bazooka) for how hard he shoots the ball.\n\nTorres says he treats all of his players like they're his own kids - which also calls for tough love. Last year, he disciplined a star player who was caught with drugs. The school has a three-strikes policy, but Torres told him if he found him with drugs again, he would kick him off the team.\n\nWhen the player used drugs again, Torres cut him. \"If my kid was caught with drugs, your a-- is mine,\" he says. \"I couldn't make an exception.\"\n\nOn an early March afternoon, Torres put his team through a light workout ahead of a big game the next day against a district rival.\n\nJefferson plays a possession, flow-inspired passing game. \"When at their best,\" Garza says, \"they execute possession passing and ball-on-the-ground attacks like a machine.\"\n\nTorres placed four cones on one half of the field, representing a space slightly larger than the penalty area, and encouraged his players to practice one-touch passes.\n\n\"Can we close the space?\" he says. \"Make the field small.\n\n\"Tomorrow, all we're looking to do is hit the target man's feet,\" he adds. \"I want you on the run, rather than chasing through the air.\"\n\nThat strategy, which reduces the need to head the ball, has helped Jefferson limit concussions, one of the most common - and concerning - injuries in the sport. Torres also avoids practicing headers to help reduce head injuries.\n\nStill, the team has had about three players per year over the past few years suffer concussions, says Charles Young, the school's full-time head athletic trainer. He says that's down from previous years, when heading was more prevalent.\n\nWhenever a player is concussed, Young requires them to sit out at least six days - one more than the state requires. Sometimes, players end up sitting much longer. This year, a head injury Salazar suffered kept him out of competition for multiple weeks.\n\nSome kids hide their injuries because they don't want to go to the doctor over concerns that the bills will be too high, Young says. Others have a different fear, he says: \"They're afraid their parents will get deported.\"\n\nOther innovative health ideas by Healthy Sport Index Contest boys soccer finalists:\n\nBelleville High School (Belleville, Wisconsin): Coach Robert Gentilli finds that many high school boys are reluctant to admit they suffer from depression. So, Gentilli openly encourages players to speak up, and he says about 10 to 15 typically do each season. Gentilli says parents or teammates often identify players who are having problems, and he flags them for a school counselor. He also encourages players to talk about their problems within the team if they are comfortable doing so. \"It's an awesome experience to see these kids find each other and really rely on each other,\" Gentilli says.\n\nKlein High School (Klein, Texas): Coach John Lawhon's team heavily relies on short, quick passes to keep possession and control the game. This also has a valuable health benefit. By keeping the ball on the ground instead of frequently playing it through the air, soccer players can minimize injuries, such as to the head or lower body after jumping in the air. Many studies have confirmed that heading the ball may cause minor head injuries, which negatively exert their effects over time. The mildest level is a concussion. In a complicated concussion, the symptoms last longer and can present long-lasting cognitive disorders.\n\n***********************************************************\n\nThe next day, Jefferson's players traveled across town to play the top-ranked team in the district. It was a game pitting one of the city's poorest schools (Jefferson) against one of its wealthiest (Alamo Heights) - a fact not lost on the players.\n\nBefore the game, Fernando Osorio, a captain and one of Jefferson's best players, gathered his teammates on the sideline.\n\n\"Look at the field they got,\" Osorio says, pointing to the immaculate turf. \"Look at the field we got,\" he says, referring to the bumpy dustbowl where his team practices.\n\nOsorio and his brother spent their elementary school years living in an orphanage in Honduras, working 10 or more hours a day. When he moved to this country, in 2014, he could hardly speak English. His classmates mocked his accent and called him a \"wetback,\" he says. He got in a lot of fights.\n\nBefore his eighth-grade year, Osorio taught himself to speak English by listening to songs and pushing himself to be uncomfortable speaking the language.\n\nWhen he was first asked about his \"vision\" and \"purpose\" in life in a USLA session, he dismissed the questions as silly. \"I thought, 'This isn't going to help me - I just want to play soccer,'\" he says. \"I had to be humbled.\"\n\nThat happened after he and his mother had a falling out, and he ran away from home. \"I was very hard-headed,\" Osorio says. \"There are things you don't understand sometimes, and you take it out on other people. I had a lack of forgiveness toward my family because they abandoned me.\"\n\nOsorio eventually returned home, thanks in part to a Christian family that took him in. He says they \"led me into God's path.\" He has since reconciled with his mom and \"opened his heart\" to Garza and Torres. He calls them the \"dads I didn't have.\"\n\nGarza put him in touch with a pro bono lawyer who is helping him establish asylum. Torres has put him on the radar of college coaches he knows. But Osorio's improved play has helped do that on its own.\n\nLast year, he made the state and regional Olympic Development teams, with a chance to try out for the national team. This spring, before coronavirus interrupted his team's season, he had 23 goals and seven assists, helping his team to a 20-4 record.\n\nThe pandemic has thrown a new wrinkle into the lives of Jefferson soccer players. The school, which shut down in March, needed about a month to get laptops and Wi-Fi hotspots for all students, allowing classes to restart. The school has sent out lunches to the students who are on free or reduced lunch, delivering the meals on school buses.\n\nThe Jefferson soccer players and coaches stay in touch by text messages, but they have largely gone their separate ways. Some players started jobs or increased their work hours to help their families pay bills.\n\nOne of their final games together was that match in early March against Alamo Heights. Down 6-3, Jefferson clawed back to within a goal with three minutes to play. Jefferson had a shot on goal within the 18-yard line with less than 10 seconds left but narrowly missed. They lost 6-5.\n\nAfter the game, Torres gathered his players and credited their effort, telling them they had nothing to be ashamed of.\n\n\"For all you've gone through,\" he tells them, \"you are the tougher kid.\"",

We talked to his family every day, and we feel like they are our family, too,\" Mincey said.\n\nPulmonologist Dr. Tufik Assad said seeing Whalum leave the hospital was \"an amazing feeling\" because, as far as COVID-19 cases go, he was \"the worst of the worst.\"\n\n\"It's hard to describe,\" Assad said.\n\n\"Isaiah was part of the first wave of cases in this pandemic. It's impacted so many, and you get invested in people's lives emotionally and there's nothing that can take away from that connection.\"\n\nScruggs, who also contracted COVID-19 but had relatively mild symptoms, hugged each nurse and doctor before she pulled off to finally take Whalum home.\n\n\"It's so exciting. It's been a long road traveled with a lot of tears. I'm thankful,\" she said. \"The nurses and doctors are so amazing. They called me every day to check on my symptoms and to give me updates. They took care of us.\"\n\nWhalum said the experience has been a journey.\n\n\"My family and friends and God got me through,\" he said. \"I can't wait to get back to my life.\"\n\nHe also offered advice to the public: \"Do what people tell you to do.

        "body": "NASHVILLE, Tenn. - Beginning this week, Tennessee residents can head to their local county health departments to get a free mask.\n\nWhile they're there, the state hopes even more people will decide to take a free coronavirus test, as well.\n\nGov. Bill Lee's COVID-19 Unified Command team announced Tuesday that 300,000 cloth face masks are being distributed to health departments in all 95 counties, the first batch of the state's pledged effort to secure 5 million free masks for residents.\n\nThe Tennessee Department of Health has since waived requirements that individuals display symptoms in order to receive a free coronavirus test.\n\nThe state has entered an agreement with Renfro Corp., a North Carolina-based international sock distributor, to \"make cloth face masks available to as many Tennesseans as possible,\" according to a statement from the governor's office.\n\nLee's office did not immediately respond to a request for cost information on the free mask distribution.\n\nRenfro Corp. is expected to continue making masks for the state beyond this first wave of production.\n\nBased on population, each of the state's county and municipal health departments will receive at least 1,000 masks this week.\n\nNASA says don't come: Florida sheriff encourages people to come see historic SpaceX launch in-person\n\nStuart McWhorter, director of the governor's coronavirus Unified Command, said previously that the state would be working with Amazon on distributing masks to residents.\n\nGillum Ferguson, the governor's spokesman, said Tuesday that no additional information on the Amazon plan was available.\n\nIn a statement, Renfro president and CEO Stan Jewell said the sock company realized in March its \"design and manufacturing expertise could be used to provide millions of face masks to communities to help reduce the spread of COVID19.\"\n\nLee on Tuesday also announced that Tennessee dentists can resume non-emergency procedures, such as cleanings, on Wednesday.\n\nThat's the same day Lee had already declared salons, nail spas, massage and other close-contact businesses can resume operations in 89 of the state's 95 counties.\n\nOn Friday, Lee announced at his Tuesday briefing, small-group recreational businesses such as bowling alleys and mini golf courses can also open their doors again.\n\nRestaurants, retail stores and gyms across the state, with the exception of Tennessee's largest counties, were given the green light to resume operations last week at 50% capacity.\n\nAreas like Nashville, Memphis and Knoxville are in counties that have been instructed to determine their own timeline for reopening businesses.\n\nFollow reporter Natalie Allison on Twitter at @natalie_allison.\n\n'All night, my eyes are open': After mass job losses, Americans forced to choose: Pay bills or buy food?\n\nPremature reopening: Dallas salon owner who reopened in defiance of Texas' coronavirus restrictions sentenced to 7 days in jail",

    "Testing varies widely in different long-term care facilities across nation": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "Mary Lanham's assisted living complex in Florida tested all residents for COVID-19 -- once in March and again in April -- even though no one showed symptoms.\n\nThe preventive measure put her daughter's mind at ease, since testing can detect the invisible enemy before it sickens, kills and spreads.\n\n\"We're all struggling with this virus right now,\" said Paula Lanham Hahn, whose 80-year-old mom lives at Dayspring Senior Living in Hilliard, a town near the Georgia border. \"I'm sure families would feel a lot better if the residents were being tested everywhere.\"\n\nBut they're not.\n\nAt a nursing home across town, residents were tested for the coronavirus only after cases broke out. At another nearby facility, residents haven't been tested.\n\nOn Monday, the White House recommended all nursing home residents and staff members be tested over the next two weeks. Testing thus far, though, has been arbitrary.\n\nAs the coronavirus has raced through long-term care centers and killed thousands of America's most vulnerable seniors, testing has varied widely across facilities, even within the same states and communities.\n\nThere's still no federal mandate to test, although President Donald Trump said he'd consider one. Rules about testing, and public reporting of results, differ from state to state and by type of facility. Shortages of test kits linger, and there's no uniform standard on which entity should do the testing or how often.\n\nAdvocates for seniors say all of this is unacceptable. It leaves families fearing for their loved ones' lives.\n\n\"We really need to be testing all the residents and staff in these facilities. They are petri dishes,\" said Brian Lee, who leads the Families for Better Care advocacy group in Austin, Texas. \"The bodies are still piling up. These are our parents and grandparents. They're not a disposable generation.\"\n\nAt least 27,700 residents and workers at long-term care facilities have died from the coronavirus, according to a New York Times database.\n\nYet until May 3, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention didn't place long-term care residents, even those with symptoms of COVID-19, into the highest priority group for testing. Hospitalized patients and health care workers with symptoms came first.\n\nIt wasn't until April 19 that the federal government began requiring nursing homes to report cases of COVID-19 to the CDC, plus notify residents and families about them. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services has said it expects to post the information weekly by the end of May. But that rule doesn't apply to assisted living facilities, because they don't face federal oversight.\n\nA Kaiser Family Foundation analysis said it's unclear how comparable the nursing home data will be across states. Researchers pointed to wide variation among the 39 states that have reported data. (KHN is an editorially independent program of the foundation.)\n\n\"Together, transparency and testing are the solution. They go hand in hand,\" Lee said. \"But there's no consistent policy approach.\"\n\nDouglas Adkins, executive director of the 32-bed Dayspring, said he wasn't going to wait for directions from Florida health officials to test residents who developed fevers or started coughing. He wanted to find asymptomatic infections.\n\n\"You've got to get ahead of this,\" he said. \"I'm hunting the virus instead of letting it hunt us.\"\n\nAdkins hired a South Florida company to test residents on March 10 and April 21, with residents' insurance paying for the $65 tests. All of those were negative. He plans ongoing testing of residents and also requires all new workers to be tested before starting employment.\n\nA 10-minute drive away, a few cases of COVID-19 had already arisen at Life Care Center of Hilliard by the time residents there got tested. Les Hester, interim executive director at the nursing home, said in an emailed statement that health department workers in Nassau County helped with the tests.\n\nNine came back positive, five among residents and four among employees. Lester wrote that they had put more than 50 residents in isolation to reduce the chance of an outbreak. He called residents \"our highest priority.\"\n\nAbout a half-hour away in Jacksonville, administrators at the River Garden Hebrew Home for the Aged have been unable to get tests for residents of the 180-bed skilled nursing facility.\n\nMarty Goetz, CEO of River Garden Senior Services, which runs the home, said he would consider buying tests on the open market, but he'd need help differentiating among the various types of tests, finding them and giving them to such a large number of residents. \"It's like the wild, wild West out there,\" he said.\n\nIn the meantime, he has put in place infection-control measures such as locking down the campus, requiring staff members to wear masks and not admitting new residents who haven't been tested for COVID-19.\n\nIdeally, Goetz said, he wants the state health department to test residents at the facility. He wrote to state officials in mid-April pleading his case.\n\n\"Many of us have been waiting patiently to hear that Public Health will be testing 100% of the nursing home and [assisted living facility] residents and staff, because that will be the only way to get ahead of the virus,\" he wrote to state officials. \"To date, all we have accomplished is chasing where the virus has been, not where it is headed.\"\n\nRonald Nessler, an environmental specialist with the Florida Department of Health said the state deploys \"rapid emergency support teams\" to facilities with COVID-positive patients. Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis last month directed the Florida National Guard to help ramp up this testing. And Florida's Agency for Health Care Administration issued an emergency rule on Sunday requiring nursing homes and assisted living facilities to allow state health officials inside for infection control, including required COVID-19 testing of staff.\n\nBut Goetz said not testing across the board before cases have been found is \"a little like sending the fire department after the house has burned down.\"\n\nAs deaths mount across the nation, the American Health Care Association, which represents more than 14,000 nursing homes, assisted living communities and other long-term care facilities, said it supports the White House recommendation on testing.\n\n\"What we need now is for state government leaders to help provide immediate and priority access to testing,\" Mark Parkinson, president and CEO of the association, said in a statement Monday. \"While universal testing in nursing homes is a good first step, it's essential that testing, with rapid results, be widely available in forthcoming weeks. Testing will need to be repeated regularly.\"\n\nDr. David Gifford, the association's chief medical officer, said long-term care providers have been at the mercy of the CDC guidance, the availability of the kits, the doctors who order them and the labs that process them. \"For months, we have been begging for priority and searching for labs or hospitals to perform tests for our residents and staff.\"\n\nGifford said some facilities have taken it upon themselves to test, but that creates a financial burden for already stretched thin facilities. \"Many nursing homes and assisted living providers are small, mom-and-pop operations in rural communities,\" he said.\n\nPrivate labs often don't bill Medicare directly, he said, requiring providers to pay upfront for tests that can cost up to $400 each. His group is asking the federal government to create a $10 billion emergency relief fund to help pay for expedited testing and additional staffing.\n\nLee, of Families for Better Care, suggested that nursing home fines collected by federal officials in cases of abuse and neglect could pay for rapid testing machines costing about $4,500 each. Perhaps, he said, these could be shared with assisted living facilities, or nursing homes could become testing hubs.\n\nMeanwhile, family members and advocates continue pushing for regular, universal testing and uniform reporting of results. Some states are starting to do this. Maryland, for example, recently began requiring all nursing home residents and staffers to be tested. The state lists the names of facilities with cases online, along with case and death counts.\n\nIn Texas, Republican Gov. Greg Abbott on Monday directed state agencies to test all residents and staff in nursing homes there. But the state doesn't disclose the names of facilities with cases.\n\nCissy Sanders, whose 70-year-old mother lives at Riverside Nursing and Rehabilitation Center in Austin, said she pressed local and state officials to test after hearing of cases in the facility. A week later, a state representative told her Austin's health department would test all staff members. Since then, she learned her mother was also tested. The result was negative.\n\nBrooke Ladner, senior vice president of business development for center owner Regency Integrated Health Services, declined to answer questions from KHN about the testing or say whether the virus was detected, citing privacy laws.\n\nWithout more testing and transparency, Sanders worries that her mom and other seniors are still in danger.\n\n\"It shouldn't be like this,\" Sanders said. \"These facilities are the equivalent of the twin towers. They are ground zero.\"",

While more retailers have started producing and selling hand sanitizer, individuals keep trying to get their hands on this essential item. While the CDC says that washing your hands for at least 20 seconds is the most effective way to protect yourself against COVID-19, using hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol when you're out running essential errands is still an effective way to eliminate germs. If you are low in stock, you can still find some hand sanitizer on the market.\n\nWhere you can buy hand sanitizer online\n\nMother's Day was earlier this month (May 10, in case you forgot), and while many of us were unable to spend the day with our moms due to social distancing measures, you better believe we still sent them flowers. 1-800-Flowers was the most popular flower delivery service that our readers used, and after testing the service, we found that we like the bouquets delivered by local florists better than the gift boxes available. While Mother's Day is long gone, you can still send a bouquet of flowers to brighten someone's day -- or your own!\n\nShop bouquets at 1-800-Flowers\n\nIf you've been on any sort of social media, you've noticed that pretty much everyone has been baking bread. But if you've wanted to join in and make a fluffy loaf of your own, there's one issue: active dry yeast is sold out pretty much everywhere in stores. Thankfully, we found a few options online, though most are in bulk. Need a bread recipe? Our cooking writer also showed us how to make artisan bread in just two hours.\n\nWhere you can still find active dry yeast online\n\nSome of us have been using our newfound free time to better ourselves with a new skill. And what better way to learn one than a lesson from your favorite celebrity? That's why MasterClass has been so popular lately. It's the only place you can learn to cook from Gordon Ramsay or take an acting class with Steve Martin without spending hundreds of dollars on a private lesson. After trying the service, we found the classes we took to be more inspirational than practical, but still completely worth it.\n\nGet an annual Masterclass subscription for $180\n\nCleaning wipes are really hard to find right now. After hours of digging, you still might not come up with anything (we know the struggle). But thankfully, disinfectant spray is more readily available and is an essential product for cleaning surfaces that may have been in contact with the coronavirus. We've been keeping an updated list of every retailer who still has both cleaning wipes and spray in stock.\n\nWhere you can still buy cleaning wipes online\n\nSimilar to cleaning essentials, toilet paper is a pretty much essential product that people are still after. While we've seen an increase in stock lately, it's still hard to find online. We've been updating our list of places to buy toilet paper online, so you won't have to scour the internet for some.\n\nWhere you can still buy toilet paper online\n\nMonth after month, we see can openers as one of the most popular items people are buying -- and with good reason. It's one of those products that you don't really think about until you actually need it, and with an initial stock-piling of canned goods for quarantine, our readers really needed one. The EZ-DUZ-IT Deluxe is the best can opener we've ever tested, so naturally, it was what people gravitate towards. We love that it's intuitive to use (not all can openers are), durable, and affordable, making it worth it to add to your kitchen drawer.\n\nGet the EZ-DUZ-IT Deluxe Can Opener at Bed Bath and Beyond for $11.99\n\nMany of us have been cooking at home more, which has reminded us of one thing: how tedious slicing vegetables is. But a mandoline will help you cut thin, even slices of fruits, veggies, and cheese, so making everything from ratatouille to salad becomes much more efficient. This one from KitchenAid is our favorite mandoline because it expertly sliced every food we threw at it and it has a safety guard to protect your precious digits. Our readers were clearly done with chopping, and have been snagging one for themselves lately.\n\nGet the KitchenAid Adjustable Hand-Held V-Blade Mandoline Slicer at Rue La La for $14.99\n\nCooking is just so much better (and easier) when you're doing it on some of the best cookware. One major brand that comes to mind is All-Clad, though it tends to be on the pricier side. That's why our readers love the All-Clad VIP Factory Seconds Sale because they can get this iconic cookware for up to 80% off. There's one catch, though: these items are \"factory seconds,\" which means they may have small dings or scratches, but it shouldn't impact the performance. Even better, there's currently a sale happening now.\n\nShop the All-Clad Factory Seconds VIP sale\n\nAlthough takeout is still an option, we all have some more time to actually cook our meals when we're quarantined. But many of us might be bored of our tried and true favorites. Getting a meal kit delivered will definitely mix up your weekly dinners, and can be ideal for those of us who are trying to avoid going to public spaces or are struggling to get a grocery delivery. We named Home Chef our favorite meal kit delivery service for its high-quality ingredients, easy-to-follow recipes, and exciting flavors, which is probably why our readers have been trying it lately.\n\nTry a Home Chef meal kit\n\nAs we spend more time at home, we're also trekking more dirt around the house -- or we're just noticing all of it for the first time. Vacuuming every single day is both annoying and tedious, which is why our readers have gravitated towards getting a robot vacuum cleaner. They keep things spic and span in between deep cleans, and the Eufy 11S is our favorite affordable one for its great suction and price range.\n\nGet the Eufy RoboVac 11S Robot Vacuum at Newegg for $159.99\n\nWhile grocery shopping or handling packages, some of us might want to wear disposable gloves to avoid coming into contact with the coronavirus. Many of our readers are taking this extra precaution by purchasing some for themselves. While the Venom Steel Rip Resistant Industrial Nitrile Gloves are the best disposable gloves we've ever tested, you're best getting whatever is currently available. We've been rounding up retailers who still have disposable gloves in stock.\n\nWhere you can still buy disposable gloves online\n\nMovie night is pretty much every night these days, and you can't properly watch a movie without popcorn, right? And if you want the best popcorn, avoid that bagged stuff and opt for our favorite popcorn maker, which has been a big seller recently. It works right in your microwave and will produce some of the best-tasting and evenly-popped kernels you've ever had.\n\nGet the Cuisinart Pop and Serve at Bed, Bath and Beyond for $12.99\n\nOur bedrooms have become our place for sleeping, for working, for watching Netflix, and for attempting FaceTime dates, so we want them to be as comfortable as possible. That's why many of our readers have been upgrading to Brooklinen sheets, which happen to be the best ones we've ever tested. After trying them, our tester became obsessed with how soft they were and literally did not want to leave her bed, which is everything you can ask for in bed sheets.\n\nGet the Brooklinen Luxe Core Sheet Set at Brooklinen for $149\n\nWhile graduations have unfortunately been canceled all across the nation due to the coronavirus pandemic, that doesn't mean we shouldn't be celebrating this major accomplishment. Families are still sending out graduation announcement cards via Shutterfly, which is also our favorite online photo printing service. We love how crisp the images were printed, making it an excellent choice for cards or other announcements.\n\nShop for cards and more at Shutterfly\n\nWayfair always seems to be running sales, but this month they ran an extra special one that gave back to COVID-19 relief. So not only did our readers score great prices on furniture to spruce up their homes, but 10% of those sales went to Feeding America. The Save Big, Give Back Sale is no longer running, but you can still get up to 65% off top-rated interior items with the Indoor Refresh Sale happening now.\n\nShop the Indoor Refresh Sale at Wayfair\n\nA fever is one of the major symptoms of the coronavirus, according to the CDC. For those of us who realized they didn't own a thermometer that meant finally getting one to check our temperatures. Initially, they were out of stock in-stores and online, but thankfully we've managed to find a few top-rated ones for sale like this quick read one.\n\nGet the Safety 1st 2-in-1 Quick Read Thermometer at Bed Bath and Beyond for $9.99\n\nAlthough some retailers are selling their own cloth face coverings, many of our readers we're interested in making their own. That's why they purchased everything from quality cotton fabric to elastic bands to even a sewing machine, so they could work more efficiently.\n\nWhere you can buy materials to make your own mask\n\nOne way our readers decided to curb their stay-at-home boredom? Getting a Nintendo Switch. With the release of Animal Crossing New Horizons, pretty much everyone has been trying to get one. Though they're pretty much sold out everywhere, you can still find the Nintendo Switch Lite in-stock, which is only a handheld device that is ideal for solo play -- like Animal Crossing.\n\nWhere you can still buy Nintendo Switches and Switch Lites\n\nThe product experts at Reviewed have all your shopping needs covered.

    "The US now has 1 million confirmed cases of the coronavirus": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "And despite warnings from national health leaders that the country could face a second wave of the virus in late 2020, states and cities are drafting or implementing plans to get people out of their homes and back into mainstream life.\n\nIt's all happened in about three months. That's when the country's first case was confirmed, and much of what we know about the virus is still subject to study and debate.\n\nThere are now six new symptoms the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention caution could be signs of the coronavirus: Chills, repeated shaking with chills, muscle pain, headache, sore throat and a loss of taste or smell.\n\nShortness of breath was tweaked to \"shortness of breath or difficulty breathing\" by the CDC, which recommends seeking \"medical attention immediately\" for trouble breathing, persistent pain or pressure on chest, bluish lips or face, or a new confusion or inability to awaken.\n\nThe daily spike in new cases had slowed in recent weeks, but April 24 saw a new daily high for the U.S. with 36,200 new cases reported.\n\nAccording to Johns Hopkins University data, 5.6 million people of the estimated 328 million people in the country have been tested for the virus. Still, testing is not as widely available as President Donald Trump says and many governors say they're running low on testing equipment.\n\nThe lack of testing \"is probably the No. 1 problem in America, and has been from the beginning of this crisis,\" said Maryland's Republican Gov. Larry Hogan, the chairman of the National Governors Association.\n\nThe number of cases would be substantially higher if testing was more readily available and steady increases are to be expected as testing expands further.\n\nDr. Tom Ingelsby, director of the Center for Health Security of the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, said numbers represented on the Hopkins dashboard don't accurately portray the total amount of cases and deaths in the U.S.\n\n\"We know at this point that there has been a very, very important undercounting of total cases,\" he said.\n\nHe said the lack of testing mild and moderate cases is the main driver of this misrepresentation, as hospitals only tests patients who are in need of critical care. Ingelsby also doesn't doubt that there's an undercounting of deaths as well, although probably less so.\n\nThe first phase of testing has been about determining who has COVID-19. The next will be about who had it. Instead of looking for the virus itself, the second phase will look for signs in our blood that we developed antibodies to fight the virus.\n\nHowever, antibodies for the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 look very similar to other coronavirus antibodies that cause illnesses, such as the common cold.\n\nTests could mistakenly identify antibodies as being for the coronavirus that causes COVID-19, producing a false positive, said Dr. Raed Dweik, chairman of the Respiratory Institute at the Cleveland Clinic. As antibody testing develops further, the accuracy should improve.\n\nThe implementation of widespread antibody testing will face similar challenges as testing for the virus, and Dweik said it will take more time to develop a test that can accurately detect the right antibodies.\n\nMeanwhile, states big and small are evaluating when they can restart their economies after weeks in lockdown necessitated by the coronavirus, and they're taking different approaches.\n\nIn Texas, Gov. Greg Abbott said Monday he will let his stay-at-home order expire Thursday as the state begins a phased reopening that will permit malls, restaurants and movie theaters to operate starting Friday, with occupancy limitations.\n\nIn Ohio, Gov. Mike DeWine announced a partial reopening beginning Friday, with some openings delayed until May 12. Dental offices and veterinarian clinics are allowed to open Friday. General offices, distribution centers, manufacturers and construction companies can open May 4. Retail stores, consumer and service businesses will have to wait until May 12.\n\nMasks will be required for workers and shoppers.\n\n\"No masks, no work, no service, no exception,\" DeWine said.\n\nHowever, New Jersey is not ready to take those stepsGov. Phil Murphy said Monday. The state ranks second to New York for the most coronavirus cases and deaths in the country, and Murphy suggested a phased reopening may not take place until Memorial Day weekend. He did not commit to a timeline.",

    "Treehouse isolation, python masks: News from around our 50 states": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "Birmingham: The state's Alcoholic Beverage Control Board reported a 10% increase in sales last month, and medical professionals say the spike in demand may signal struggles with mental health. The ABC Board made over $6 million more in sales in March 2020, compared to last March, WBMA-TV reports. The sales boost is being attributed to the new coronavirus, which has led to social distancing measures and stay-at-home orders. \"When you can't go out with your buddies, or you can't have your friends in for a nice meal and an alcoholic beverage, then you tend to want to keep something out of that scenario normal, and that is the sale of alcohol,\" said Dean Argo of the ABC Board. But measures in place to help prevent the spread of the virus could exacerbate mental health conditions that lead to some people consuming more alcohol, the television station reports.\n\nAnchorage: Protesters have demanded that the mayor shut down a homeless camp they say is contributing to crime and threatening public health during the coronavirus pandemic. A group of 25 demonstrators gathered Friday across from the camp included people who live, work or own businesses nearby, The Anchorage Daily News reports. The group called for Municipality of Anchorage Democratic Mayor Ethan Berkowitz to close the camp as part of the enforcement of a statewide order to remain in place to slow the spread of the COVID-19 virus. People camping outside are a \"difficult population\" to deal with, but police are stepping up patrols, and Berkowitz said he is listening to the recommendations of frustrated residents. \"We are doing what we can to reduce the number of people who are engaged in conduct that is criminal, and if there is a crime, that has been reported to (Anchorage Police Department),\" he said.\n\nPhoenix: With the state considering reopening its economy May 1, health experts said Arizona isn't yet doing enough COVID-19 testing or collecting good enough data to responsibly lift stay-at-home orders. Arizona had done 51,000 tests through Saturday, a fraction of the COVID-19 tests needed to judge how widespread the outbreak is in a state this size. Measured in tests per million residents, the state was in the bottom 10 nationwide last week. And data the state provides is widely seen as inadequate. The state is missing demographic data about positive cases and deaths, its location data mixes hospitals with private residences, and the state won't provide data about cases and deaths on Indian reservations or in nursing homes. \"It just isn't going to work unless you have crystal clear data,\" said William Haseltine, an infectious disease expert and president of the global health think tank ACCESS Health International.\n\nLittle Rock: The first death of a health care worker in the state is among two additional deaths in Arkansas due to COVID-19, state officials said Sunday. Gov. Asa Hutchinson also said nearly 2,000 inmates will be considered for early release in response to questions about possible compassionate release of people in state prisons. The death of a worker at Jefferson Regional Medical Center in Pine Bluff is one of two that bring to 40 the number who have died in the state due to COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus, according to state Health Secretary Dr. Nathaniel Smith. The number of coronavirus cases rose by 42 to at least 1,781. Hutchinson said 348 inmates at the state's maximum-security unit have tested positive for the virus, an increase of 118 from Saturday. The governor said he's asked the state parole board to review 1,990 nonviolent, non-sex-offender inmates statewide who are due for release within six months for possible early release.\n\nLos Angeles: The state reported its first prison inmate death from COVID-19 on Sunday as it steps up efforts to prevent outbreaks among vulnerable populations, including people living in nursing homes, on the streets or in homeless shelters. The inmate died at a hospital after contracting the coronavirus at the California Institution for Men in San Bernardino County, the state Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation said in a statement. Statewide, 115 inmates and 89 corrections employees have tested positive for the coronavirus, corrections officials said. In recent days, California released for the first time details about nursing homes facing outbreaks as the numbers of COVID-19 cases and deaths across the state continue to rise. The information released by the Department of Public Health showed nearly 260 skilled nursing facilities with more than 3,000 total positive cases among patients and staff.\n\nDenver: Thousands of people staged a peaceful protest outside the Capitol on Sunday against the state's stay-at-home order and its closure of thousands of nonessential businesses as ways to fight the spread of the coronavirus. Horn-honking motorists lined up for several blocks on an avenue leading to the Capitol building, then circled it as pedestrians, some not wearing masks, congregated closely outside the building. Many waved American flags and held signs that read \"End the Virus, Not the Economy\" and \"We need stability to stay healthy,\" The Denver Post reports. Other signs expressed support for President Donald Trump, who has called for a rapid economic reopening, and against Gov. Jared Polis, whose orders shuttered thousands of nonessential businesses. Police officers wearing masks and gloves kept tabs on the protest.\n\nHartford: Two consecutive days of reductions in the number of people hospitalized with COVID-19 in the state are a promising sign in its fight against the outbreak, Gov. Ned Lamont said Monday. But Lamont, a Democrat, said people will need to keep up social distancing and noted infections are still accelerating in the greater Hartford area. \"We are starting to flatten the curve,\" Lamont said in an interview with WNPR. Statewide, more than 17,000 residents have tested positive for the virus, and 1,127 have died. The highest numbers have been reported in Fairfield County, on the New York state line. Lamont said widespread testing for the virus will be a key to easing some of the social distancing. He said he would like to set up more rapid testing centers like one in New Haven that he visited over the weekend. \"There's some nice smiles when the vast majority found out that they were not infected,\" he said. \"But overall I think about 15% did find they were infected, and that is troubling.\"\n\nHarbeson: Coronavirus cases have hit every corner of the state, including southern Delaware's chicken processing plants, which employ more than 6,000 people and offer contract work for hundreds of local farmers. While industry officials last month touted safety measures, those who work there offered a different picture of what they're seeing behind closed doors, citing a lack of social distancing. \"We're not giving people chicken,\" one employee said, on condition of anonymity. \"We're infecting more people.\" Nelson Hill, vice president and assistant to the president at the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union Local 27, said that \"there's a big fear with regard to those non-union plants. ... You're at-will. You can be terminated for any lawful reason that the company sees fit. So there's a natural fear that folks will lose their position if they were to speak out.\"\n\nWashington: The number of bad air quality days has plunged in the metro D.C. area since the start of March, WUSA-TV reports, citing data from the Metropolitan Washington Council of Governments. The drop in bad air quality days likely comes in response to shelter-at-home orders linked to the coronavirus pandemic. Through April 18, COG data shows there has been only one \"yellow,\" or moderate, air quality day in metro D.C. The sole moderate air quality day since March 1 came March 19. In the same period in 2019, the district recorded 10 moderate air quality days in March and seven moderate air quality days April 1 through April 18. Car and truck pollutants, such as particulate matter and ozone, are major contributors to poor air quality, which raises the risk of respiratory ailments like asthma, bronchitis, and lung cancer.\n\nDania Beach: As people across America make coronavirus masks with everything from T-shirts and pillowcases to vacuum cleaner bags, one Sunshine State resident is using python skin. Brian Wood, owner of All American Gator Products in Dania Beach, is crafting decorative mask coverings from the skin of the Burmese python, the infamous invasive species wreaking havoc on the native wildlife of the Everglades. \"People are going to have to cover their faces, and unfortunately the situation may last longer than we imagined,\" said Wood, owner of All American Gator Products in Dania Beach. \"Some people want to make a fashion statement even during this pandemic, so I want to give them options.\" The python skin itself doesn't provide protection, but his mask design allows for a filter or a lining to be inserted and removed. The python masks will be made with holes framed by black, silver or gold metal rings, which will add a hint of luxury to the items, he said.\n\nAtlanta: The governor announced plans Monday to restart the state's economy before the end of the week, saying many businesses that closed to mitigate the spread of the coronavirus could reopen as early as Friday. Georgia's timetable, one of the most aggressive in the nation, would allow gyms, hair salons, bowling alleys and tattoo parlors to reopen as long as owners follow strict social distancing and hygiene requirements. Elective medical procedures would also resume. Bars, live performance venues and amusement parks will remain closed. But by Monday, movie theaters may resume selling tickets, and restaurants limited to takeout orders could return to limited dine-in service. Such a swift reopening runs counter to the advice of many experts, including Dr. Anthony Fauci, the government's top authority on infectious diseases, who warned again Monday that resuming business too soon risked a fresh spike in infections.\n\nHonolulu: Transient vacation rental units are proving difficult for officials to regulate during the coronavirus pandemic as they serve as shelter for many of the state's visitors. Many of the 2,970 visitors who arrived in Hawaii during the 23 days prior to Sunday are believed to have stayed in transient vacation rentals, The Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports. Transient rentals are defined as \"a room, apartment, house, condominium, beach house, hotel room, suite, or similar living accommodation\" rented for less than 180 consecutive days, according to the state Department of Taxation. Democratic Gov. David Ige issued 14-day mandatory self-quarantine orders for passengers arriving on trans-Pacific and interisland flights to slow the spread of COVID-19. The Hawaii Tourism Authority, the Hawaii Visitors and Convention Bureau plan to add extra verification steps to confirm information from arriving passengers, authority President and CEO Chris Tatum said.\n\nBoise: St. Luke's Health System says it's significantly increasing its testing capacity for the coronavirus by using its own labs starting Monday. Hospital officials said they hope facilities in Boise, Twin Falls, Ketchum, Meridian, Nampa and McCall can start using their own labs that could boost testing capacity past 1,700 per day by May. But that depends on getting particular testing supplies that have been in high demand. St. Luke's also said drive-up screening tents for the coronavirus would be operating from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. seven days a week in Boise, Meridian and Twin Falls starting Monday. The screening tents had been operating to 6 p.m., but officials said volume is greater in the morning. Idaho has at least 1,668 virus cases and 44 deaths, according to a Johns Hopkins University tally Monday.\n\nRockford: Five northern Illinois mayors have asked Gov. J.B. Pritzker for the authority to reopen businesses next month, urging local control over restrictions and \"common sense modifications\" to a statewide stay-at-home order during the coronavirus pandemic. Pritzker has said he's continually evaluating an extension of the order, which expires April 30. The Winnebago County leaders - of communities ranging in population from roughly 1,300 to 23,000 people - said in a letter to Pritzker that thousands of employees, including in the restaurant, fitness and salon industries, are being unnecessarily harmed because they're not considered essential workers, according to the Rockford Register Star. The leaders are from Loves Park, Machesney Park, South Beloit, Cherry Valley and Durand. However, the mayor of Rockford, the county's largest city, disagreed with the effort, saying it's not the time to reverse course.\n\nWest Lafayette: Purdue University students who operate a small community farm are raising crops for local food banks to help feed students and local residents alike during the coronavirus pandemic. The Purdue Student Farm usually sells its produce to Purdue food services, which serves those vegetables at the university's dining service. But the student farm found itself without customers after on-campus classes were canceled and most students returned home amid the pandemic. \"We didn't want to stop producing the food because we know there would be a need in the community,\" said Steve Hallett, a horticulture and landscape architecture professor and adviser to the student farm. Chris Adair, who manages the students who work at the farm, said they're currently harvesting spinach and bagging it for donation to the Food Finders Food Bank, which serves residents in the area, and Purdue's own food bank.\n\nIowa City: A beef processing plant that was idled after the coronavirus outbreak resumed production Monday, one day after the state said 177 workers there have tested positive. The Iowa Premium plant in Tama, owned by National Beef, had suspended production after the company confirmed multiple workers had the virus. On Sunday, the office of Gov. Kim Reynolds said 177 out of more than 500 National Beef workers tested were positive for coronavirus. A woman who answered the phone at the plant confirmed that production resumed Monday. The company closed the plant for what it called a regularly scheduled cleaning two weeks ago. The governor's office also said Sunday that another 84 employees of Tyson Foods had tested positive. Tyson said its Waterloo pork plant remained open Monday, defying calls from local officials to suspend production. Its Columbus Junction plant remained closed, and its Perry plant was idled for a one-day cleaning.\n\nMission: The state has received more personal protective equipment and supplies to expand COVID-19 testing in communities with meat processing plants. Gov. Laura Kelly announced Monday that the federal supplies will go to Finney, Ford and Seward counties in southwest Kansas and Lyon County in the east-central part of the state. As of Sunday, 247 people in those counties were infected with the coronavirus out of 1,849 statewide. Cargill, Tyson Fresh Meats and National Beef have said employees at their processing plants tested positive. Kansas Department of Health and Environment is working with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to track clusters connected to the processing plants. Controlling the outbreaks is crucial: Plants in southwest Kansas account for 25% to 30% of beef processing in the country.\n\nLouisville: The state's public schools will remain closed for the rest of the school year, capping off an unprecedented academic year. Students should continue their education at home through distance learning plans, Gov. Andy Beshear told superintendents Monday afternoon. \"It's been recommended Kentucky schools do not return to in-person classes for the rest of 2019-20 year,\" the Kentucky Department of Education tweeted. State education officials will work with school districts to finish distance learning by the end of May, although many districts may finish earlier. The elongated closure means teachers will not get to say goodbye to their students in person. Graduating seniors likely won't get to experience end-of-year celebrations before heading off to the next stop. But weeks of distance learning are taking a toll on educators and parents, many of whom are being asked to act in multiple roles as kitchens and living rooms become makeshift classrooms.\n\nNew Orleans: A 69-year-old prisoner at the Louisiana State Penitentiary is the first state prisoner known to have died after being diagnosed with COVID-19, state corrections officials announced Monday. Corrections officials did not identify the prisoner, who was serving a life sentence for first-degree murder. They said he had an underlying health condition and had been hospitalized since April 15 before dying Saturday. Last week, the corrections department said an employee at the prison died with the disease. The coronavirus death toll in Louisiana was 1,328 as of midday Monday. Louisiana has started the process for temporarily furloughing up to 1,200 inmates, in a bid to decrease the virus's potential spread in the close confines of prison facilities. The ACLU of Louisiana has called the process a start but far less than what is needed to reduce the prison population and protect public health.\n\nPortland: About 200 people rallied in the capital Monday demanding the state open back up, despite officials' insistence on a cautious approach in order to prevent another coronavirus outbreak. Similar rallies have elsewhere in the country, with participants including gun-rights activists, opponents of stay-at-home orders and supporters of Republican President Donald Trump. Maine's event was organized by Republican state Rep. Chris Johansen, of Aroostook County, who urged participants to maintain social distance, wear masks and abstain from openly carrying guns. He also used social media to call on demonstrators to \"fill up your gas tanks and get ready to rumble\" in Augusta. Many directed their ire at Democratic Gov. Janet Mills, who placed the state under a stay-at-home order starting March 31. Mills defended the order while acknowledging closures have been hard on people and businesses.\n\nBaltimore: Doctors in the state say they're worried that fewer people with symptoms of a stroke or heart attack are showing up at emergency rooms. The Baltimore Sun reports doctors believe some people have chosen to avoid the emergency room because of the coronavirus pandemic. Such behavior could put possible heart attack and stroke victims at even greater risk. Doctors say some people may be concerned they'll contract the virus by visiting the hospital. Or there may be confusion over stay-at-home orders. Providers in Maryland say avoiding the hospital increases the chance of serious health complications for stroke and heart attack victims. Recoveries are often tied to how fast people are treated. Dr. Mark Vesely, a cardiologist at the University of Maryland Medical Center in Baltimore, said people will fare better if doctors can get to them more quickly.\n\nBoston: Two more field hospitals set up to deal with a surge of COVID-19 patients opened in the state Monday. The hospitals at Joint Base Cape Cod in Bourne and at the University of Massachusetts Lowell's Recreation Center can each handle about 100 patients who are not in critical condition but are not well enough to be sent home. Cape Cod Healthcare is managing and staffing the Cape Cod hospital, while Lowell General Hospital is managing the UMass site. Field hospitals have also opened at the DCU Center in Worcester and the Boston Convention and Exhibition Center. A fifth is expected to open at UMass Dartmouth in about a week. Massachusetts is in the middle of a surge of patients, Gov. Charlie Baker has said. The state now has more than 38,000 cases and has reported more than 1,700 deaths, including 146 on Sunday, according to the state Public Health Department.\n\nLansing: The governor said Sunday that she was eager to loosen businesses restrictions while also avoiding new flare-ups of the coronavirus illness that has killed nearly 2,400 people in the state. Gov. Gretchen Whitmer said a lack of virus testing supplies is delaying such steps but maintained that most residents support her actions despite a protest drawing thousands of people to the Michigan Capitol last week. \"Not going to the gas station to fill up your boat, so that you can go tooling around, is a sacrifice, but it is one that is worth it, because who among us wouldn't rather forgo jet-skiing or boating right now if it's going to save your grandparents or your neighbor's life?\" Whitmer said on CNN's \"State of the Union.\" Whitmer has faced pressure from protesters who don't like her orders to keep people at home and businesses closed because of the outbreak.\n\nSt. Cloud: The coronavirus pandemic has limited the mobility of independent older adults in Central Minnesota, so they're showing up online for yoga classes and lectures and tapping into meal programs at much higher rates than before the COVID-19 outbreak. \"Older adults are really resilient,\" said Laura Hood, aging services director for the city of St. Cloud. \"They've been through wars. They've supported communities. They've built communities.\" And the community programs that serve seniors adjusted quickly to do so after Gov. Tim Walz's stay-at-home order and other precautions meant to limit spread of the virus. Staff at the Whitney Senior Center have been able to connect with 70% of members electronically, Hood said. And those who are not available online get phone calls. Every week, the center emails a newsletter with resources, including links to live, interactive exercise classes and lectures. Staff provide some technical support and schedule programs that allow for group engagement, include exercise and covering other topics such as container gardens and mindfulness.\n\nJackson: The chief of the Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians says he has tested positive for COVID-19, and he is urging people to follow the advice of health professionals to try to slow the spread of the highly contagious new coronavirus. Chief Cyrus Ben said in a video posted to the tribe's Facebook page Saturday that he had not experienced any symptoms. He said he is quarantined with his family and continuing to work remotely. \"It only takes one person who has been exposed to the virus to go out in public and expose everyone that they could come in contact with,\" Ben said. \"That includes their families, their friends. And that is why we say take precaution, be vigilant.\" The Choctaws have 11,000 members in 10 of Mississippi's 82 counties. The tribe's Pearl River Resort in central Mississippi's Neshoba County has two casinos and hotels. The resort is closed indefinitely because of the pandemic.\n\nKansas City: A growing national movement against stay-at-home orders designed to slow the spread of the coronavirus arrived in the Show-Me State this week. Protests were planned Monday in Kansas City and Tuesday in Jefferson City. A flyer advertising the Kansas City protest encouraged people to \"flood the streets of downtown Kansas City and demand that businesses be allowed to open up, people allowed to work, and lives returned to normal.\" The protesters contend the stay-at-home orders are unnecessary and are seriously damaging the economy. Government and health officials argue orders asking people to stay home except for essential business and to maintain social distancing are necessary to reduce the spread of the coronavirus. Kansas City Mayor Quenton Lucas announced last week that he was extending the city's stay-at-home order until May 15. Gov. Mike Parson said the state plans to take steps to begin reopening its economy May 4.\n\nHelena: For the first time since the state lab started running tests for coronavirus, the health department reported no positive COVID-19 tests among the 153 tests that were performed Sunday. Toole County, in north-central Montana, reported its fifth COVID-19 death Monday, raising the state's total to 11. The latest victim was a woman in her 80s who was not identified. All 29 of the cases in Toole County, population about 4,800 residents, have been traced to close contact rather than community transmission, said Blair Tomsheck, director of the Toole County Health Department. Nearly all are tied to an assisted living facility and to the hospital in the city of Shelby, officials have said. Montana has reported 433 cases of COVID-19, with just over 11,000 tests performed. Nineteen people were still hospitalized out of 57 who required hospital treatment.\n\nOmaha: The state's primary election next month could see strong turnout if most people who requested ballots by mail return them in time. Secretary of State Bob Evnen told the Omaha World-Herald that 340,000 Nebraskans had requested mail-in ballots as of Friday. Another 50,000 voters who live in rural counties where voting by mail is the only option will also receive mail-in ballots. That total of 390,000 ballots is approaching Nebraska's highest-turnout primary in 1972, when 413,015 people voted. Nebraska voters can request mail-in ballots from their county election officials until May 1. Those ballots must be returned before 8 p.m. May 12, which is election day. Officials said more than 72,000 Nebraskans have already voted. State officials still plan to open the polls May 12 for anyone who wants to vote in person. Election workers will be provided protective gear, including masks and gloves.\n\nLas Vegas: The agency promoting tourism in the city is quickly redoing its budget, with coronavirus casino closures and business shutdowns projected to result in a two-thirds cut in hotel room tax funding for the fiscal year starting July 1. Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority chief executive Steve Hill said authority room tax revenue is expected to drop from $300 million to between $100 million and $120 million for the upcoming fiscal year, the Las Vegas Sun reports. At Hill's request, the tourism agency board last week agreed to delay until next month consideration of a new budget. \"Fiscal year 2021 was set to be an exceptionally strong year,\" Hill said. \"We were set to set records in a number of different ways.\" Now, he said, \"fiscal year 2021 is going to be a difficult year.\" He said the authority was likely to lose another $60 million in income due to postponements and cancellations of conventions, meetings and trade shows at the Las Vegas Convention Center and other locations.\n\nConcord: A judge is considering whether Republican Gov. Chris Sununu can spend the state's $1.25 billion in coronavirus relief aid without legislative approval. The Democratic leaders of the New Hampshire House and Senate and its joint fiscal committee sued the governor last week to halt the new Governor's Office for Emergency Relief and Recovery. Hillsborough County Superior Court Judge David Anderson held a hearing on their request Monday, saying he will issue a ruling as quickly as possible. Representing the governor's office, Solicitor General Dan Will pointed to a 2002 law granting the governor authority to take immediate action during a statewide crisis. Democrats argue that the governor's general powers under the law Sununu cites do not override a more specific law that says during an emergency, \"the governor may, with the advice and consent of the fiscal committee, authorize such expenditures, by any department or agency, as may be necessary.\"\n\nTrenton: The state's COVID-19 outbreak is stabilizing, with the number of patients leaving hospitals outpacing those being admitted, Gov. Phil Murphy said Monday. Despite the stabilization, 177 more people died since Sunday's update, bringing the death toll to 4,377, Murphy said. There are nearly 89,000 people with the coronavirus, he said. There's growing evidence that social distancing is helping contain the virus, according to the governor. It now takes three weeks for the number of cases to double in northern New Jersey, up from just three days over the past few weeks. For the first time, the number of people discharged from the hospital - 583 - outpaced newly admitted COVID-19 patients, which stood at about 460. Benchmarks to reopen the state's economy will be coming in a number of days, the governor said. Murphy is allying with neighboring states to coordinate restarting the economy. More testing will be needed, among other things, he said.\n\nGallup: A high school is reopening its gym as a 60-bed alternative care facility to help hospitals treat an increasing number of coronavirus patients, a federal engineering agency said. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers was expected to turn over the keys to Miyamura High School to local and state health officials Monday, about two weeks after construction began, the Gallup Independent reports. Vinyl flooring and rubber pads were fixed to the gym floor, swamp coolers were placed on the roof to provide cool air, and two large exhaust ducts were installed to provide proper ventilation, said Lt. Col. Robin Scott, deputy commander of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers-Albuquerque District. The gym now features 60 patient pods separated by medical curtains, which each include one electrical outlet, an ethernet jack, lighting and oxygen, Project Manager Amanda Velasquez said. Laundry sinks are positioned throughout the gym as hand-washing stations.\n\nNew York: The city won't allow public events in June, including three of the city's major annual celebrations: the National Puerto Rican Day Parade, the Celebrate Israel parade and the Pride parade on its 50th anniversary. Mayor Bill de Blasio announced Monday that the events would be canceled or at least postponed, saying it was a painful but necessary step as the city continues to fight the coronavirus. \"They will be back, and we will find the right way to do it,\" he said, allowing that it's not yet clear whether it will be realistic to reschedule the events this year. The Pride parade began in 1970 as a way to commemorate the Stonewall rebellion the year before, when a police raid at the Stonewall Inn bar sparked a resistance by gay men, bisexuals, lesbians and transgender people and led to the development of more extensive and militant LGBTQ activist groups than the U.S. had seen before. The Puerto Rico and Israel parades are also touchstones in a city that has the largest Jewish population outside Israel and the biggest Puerto Rican community off the island.\n\nIndian Trail: A miniature donkey named Mambo is getting some online love in the state, where a farm is getting in on the idea of having animals spice up tedious virtual meetings during the coronavirus pandemic. Peace N Peas Farm will rent Mambo, the 8-year-old miniature donkey, and his friends to crash company conference calls, The Charlotte Observer reports. This camera-crowding donkey is \"like a pesky little brother\" that \"doesn't let anyone relax too long,\" said Francie Dunlap, Mambo's owner. Companies can choose other farm animals they want to invite as guests on their video calls. According to the farm animals' meeting registration website, they include three horses, Heiren, Zeus and Eddie, along with some chickens and ducks. \"I think it would get some laughs,\" Dunlap said. Customers can reserve 10 minutes with the animals for $50, and Dunlap said co-workers can also choose a virtual meeting name for the farm animal. Since she created the website Saturday, Dunlap said she has also gotten requests from teachers who want the animals to crash their virtual classrooms.\n\nBismarck: The state's largest manufacturer, Doosan Bobcat, resumed operations Monday after a two-week shutdown amid the coronavirus pandemic, putting some 2,300 people back to work. Doosan Bobcat restarted operations at plants in Gwinner, Bismarck and Wahpeton after making several changes aimed at protecting workers. The company said it is not aware of any workers who have tested positive for the virus. The equipment manufacturer says it increased cleaning and disinfecting at its facilities, implemented social distancing, and limited visitors while encouraging people to work remotely when possible. \"The No. 1 goal is the safety of our employees,\" company spokeswoman Stacey Breuer said. The company's restart came as the state is wrestling with an outbreak in Grand Forks that has shut down LM Power, a wind turbine manufacturing plant, that as of Monday had grown to 128 employees or associated people.\n\nColumbus: Inmates make up nearly 1 in 4 of the state's coronavirus cases following a spike in identified infections as universal testing takes place inside three state prisons. Figures released Sunday show 1,828 positive tests at Marion Correctional Facility in north-central Ohio, out of about 2,500 total inmates, according to the Department of Rehabilitation and Correction. In addition, 109 employees at Marion have tested positive, out of a total of about 350 workers. One Marion prison guard died earlier this month. Systemwide, 2,400 inmates have tested positive, and six have died, including five at Pickaway Correctional Facility in central Ohio, where 384 inmates have tested positive out of a population of about 2,000. Even the head of the prison guards' union, Christopher Mabe, is in self-quarantine after his wife, a guard at Lorain Correctional Institution, tested positive.\n\nTulsa: The term \"artist in residence\" has taken on new meaning as the populace confronts the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic. \"It's probably safe to say that every artist these days is an artist in residence since they are having to stay at home just like everyone else,\" Lauren Rogers, communications specialist at Gilcrease Museum, told the Tulsa World. During a discussion about how the temporarily shuttered Gilcrease might still find ways to connect with audiences, staff came up with a plan. The first call for artists to contribute to the \"#ArtistsinQuarantine\" project went out March 20, and so far, more than 50 artists have responded. Gilcrease staff members selected certain images that it features regularly on its various social media platforms, including Facebook, Instagram and Twitter. Rogers said artists wishing to submit their work for the \"#ArtistsinQuarantine\" project may do so on any of the museum's social media sites using the hashtag.\n\nSalem: Taproot Lounge & Cafe and its second location, TAO (Taproot Annex One), are both closed until further notice, but the staff is far from idle. Taproot owner Christopher \"Toph\" Holland and his longtime friend Brian Sullivan are mobilizing out-of-work restaurant employees and community volunteers to sew face masks. \"We had a bunch of employees with nothing to do,\" Holland said, \"so if we can't serve (at the restaurant), we'll keep serving by doing something else.\" The project came about when the Centers for Disease Control updated recommendations, instructing individuals to wear face masks in public places. The City of Salem asked for the public's help sewing masks to be donated to local nonprofit organizations. In response, Sullivan and Holland reached out to friends, asking to borrow sewing machines and soliciting donations of fabric and notions.\n\nHarrisburg: The state will ease some restrictions on building construction and vehicle sales, Gov. Tom Wolf announced Monday as hundreds of protesters defied a ban on mass gatherings to stage an anti-shutdown rally at the Capitol. Wolf announced a first, tentative step toward reopening the state's economy after weeks of social distancing to combat the new virus, which has killed more than 1,200 Pennsylvania residents and sickened more than 33,000. Wolf said he was signing online-notary legislation that would pave the way for online vehicle sales. And limited building construction work may resume May 8, he said. \"We are taking small steps toward regaining a degree of normalcy in Pennsylvania,\" Wolf said. As he spoke, protesters gathered outside the state Capitol to demand that Wolf reopen the state's virus-battered economy.\n\nProvidence: The Rhode Island COVID-19 Response Fund has distributed another $2.1 million to nonprofits across the state to help people struggling to pay for groceries, rent, utilities or health care during the coronavirus pandemic. The fund, established last month by the Rhode Island Foundation and United Way of Rhode Island, has now distributed about $6.7 million. Children's Friend, the Jonnycake Center of Peace Dale, the Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Community Center, Progreso Latino and Thundermist Health Center are among the organizations that received grants ranging from $10,000 to $75,000 in the latest round of funding announced Monday. The need continues to grow, foundation President Neil Steinberg said. \"The need is beyond even what we expected,\" he said in a statement.\n\nColumbia: Retail stores and public beach access points that had been closed to halt the spread of the coronavirus will be allowed to reopen this week, The Post and Courier reports. Republican Gov. Henry McMaster was issuing an order Monday to allow for the reopenings to take place Tuesday, the governor's chief of staff, Trey Walker, told the newspaper. The order will apply to numerous nonessential stores, including department stores, flea markets, florists, bookstores and music shops. Grocery stores, pharmacies, home improvement stores and medical facilities have been allowed to stay open during the pandemic. Occupancy in each store will be limited to five customers per 1,000 square feet of retail space or 20% occupancy, whichever is less, the newspaper reports. Local governments will still be allowed to make their own rules about waterway access. Sullivan's Island, Isle of Palms and Folly Beach are among those that have banned access to nonresidents.\n\nSioux Falls: Sanford Health says a critically ill patient has received a transfusion of plasma from a recovered coronavirus patient, the first use of the therapy by the health care provider. Sanford's treatment is part of a national clinical trial to test the effect of blood plasma in treating COVID-19. The use of plasma is for hospitalized patients with severe cases of coronavirus. The plasma may lessen severity or shorten the length of the illness caused by the virus. \"This is another step forward in our efforts to find effective treatments for this virus,\" said Dr. Allison Suttle, chief medical officer for Sanford Health. \"It's still early, but we are optimistic that the disease-fighting antibodies found in plasma could potentially slow the progression of the disease in our sickest patients.\" Because the therapy is still considered experimental, the plasma is being administered under a program led by Mayo Clinic.\n\nCarthage: A truckload of medical masks and protective surgical gowns was destroyed when a tractor-trailer caught fire on a highway, news outlets report. First responders told WKRN-TV at the scene in Smith County on Saturday that N95 masks and special hospital gowns were among the items ruined. Shortages of these masks, which filter out 95% of all airborne particles, have created high demand among medical workers on the front lines of the coronavirus pandemic. It was unclear where the shipment was headed. Photos posted by news outlets on social media showed the frame of the charred vehicle smoking, with dozens of cardboard boxes strewn along the road reportedly carrying the masks. Green bundles that appeared to be surgical gowns were pictured laying in the wreckage. The fire started in a rear wheel and spread, officials told news outlets. The driver was not seriously injured, authorities said.\n\nCorpus Christi: Many health care workers are taking precautions to protect their families from exposure to COVID-19, but one emergency room doctor is talking self-isolation to another level. Jason Barnes, 39, is a physician at Christus Spohn Hospital Beeville and Christus Spohn Hospital South. He couldn't risk exposing his wife, Jenna, and sons, Stiles and Bentley, to the coronavirus, so he packed his things and made his kids' backyard treehouse a temporary home. Working in the emergency room, Barnes has treated patients who came in for problems, such as a hurt leg, only to find out they were infected with coronavirus. Barnes has now spent nearly three weeks in the cabin treehouse. \"Luckily the WiFi reaches the treehouse, so I have my laptop and my own little command center here,\" he said. His living situation is similar to camping. He started with a bucket as a toilet but now has a camping toilet with biodegradable bags.\n\nSalt Lake City: A day before a large weekend rally that drew hundreds of people to protest the city's stay-at-home order, a man was arrested who police say threatened a \"civil war\" if Mayor Erin Mendenhall did not \"open up the city,\" according to charging documents. Marlin Richard Baer was arrested Friday on suspicion of making a terrorist threat and electronic communication harassment after he made the phone call to Mendenhall's office demanding that she cancel the stay-at-home order she invoked March 29, police said. He was arrested before he could attend a rally Saturday at city hall that he referenced in his call that drew about 1,000 demonstrators. Baer mentioned the rally in his call and said if things didn't change, a \"civil war\" would be coming, and police wouldn't stop him, the charging document alleges. Baer also commented on Facebook that people should bring guns to the rally.\n\nMontpelier: More than 8,300 checks for $1,200 were being sent Monday to people whose unemployment claims were delayed due to a variety of administrative issues, according to the Vermont Department of Labor. The checks were prepared over the weekend after officials were unable to resolve stringent federal requirements that kept those individuals from receiving regular unemployment payments. \"Given the overwhelming demand on the system, being able to provide timely claims processing while meeting all federal standards became virtually impossible,\" interim Labor Commissioner Michael Harrington said in a news release issued late Sunday. \"Ultimately, we needed to put people over process and get people their benefits.\" The checks provide two weeks of federal benefits approved to help people affected by COVID-19-related layoffs. The department says the checks likely do not provide the full amount owed but serve as an initial installment.\n\nFalls Church: For the third straight day, health authorities are reporting a drop in the state's number of new coronavirus cases. Numbers released Monday by the Virginia Department of Health show 453 new coronavirus cases reported in the prior 24 hours, bringing the total to 8,990. The death toll increased from 277 to 300. The drop in new cases marks the first time since the virus arrived in Virginia that the state has reported three consecutive days of declines, according to data kept by the Virginia Public Access Project. Northam and federal officials have indicated they want to see a 14-day trend of declining cases before phasing in an end to the restrictions on businesses that Northam imposed in a series of executive orders to fight the spread of the virus. Also Monday, the Virginia Department of Corrections said it is stepping up coronavirus testing at state prisons. The state health department was sending staff into prisons Monday to facilitate the increased testing.\n\nSeattle: Boeing this week is restarting production of commercial airplanes in the Seattle area, putting about 27,000 people back to work after operations were halted because of the coronavirus. The aerospace giant says it is taking extra precautions and has instituted comprehensive procedures at all of its sites to fight the spread of COVID-19. The new virus-slowing measures will include the use of face masks and other protective equipment, hand-washing sites, staggered shift times and employee wellness checks. Employees for the 737, 747, 767 and 777 airplanes were to return as early as Monday, with most returning to work by Tuesday, officials said. Employees for the 787 program will return next Thursday and Friday. Boeing's shutdown went into effect March 25 after workers tested positive for the virus and a longtime inspector for the company died.\n\nHuntington: An annual fundraiser at Marshall University to help feed needy families has moved online. Marshall says its art school is teaming up with a pottery studio for the Empty Bowls alternative event. The school said in a news release that the Pottery Place of Huntington has more than 500 bowls and T-shirts listed on its website. The bowls were made by Marshall ceramics students, but some were not finished before the school and the fundraiser were shut down by the coronavirus pandemic. The bowls and T-shirts cost $15 apiece. Purchased items can be picked up at the store. Proceeds will go to the Facing Hunger Foodbank, which serves 17 counties in West Virginia, eastern Kentucky and southeastern Ohio. Last year's fundraiser raised a record $18,000. Pottery Place owner Jessica Stone, a 2004 Marshall graduate, was part of a group of ceramics students who launched Empty Bowls 17 years ago.\n\nMadison: The Tavern League of Wisconsin is calling on Gov. Tony Evers to allow bars and restaurants to reopen May 1, more than three weeks ahead of the end of the current stay-at-home order that has forced the closure of most nonessential businesses. The lobbying group argued in a statement late Sunday that bars, restaurants and supper clubs could reopen by implementing a variety of safety measures to protect against the spread of COVID-19. Those steps include requiring all employees to wear masks and gloves; not allowing anyone to be closer than 6 feet from one another; spacing all tables at least 6 feet apart; not allowing more than six people to sit at any one table; and reducing the number of people allowed inside by 50%. The group also said it would eliminate paper menus, all table condiments and salad bars in order to reopen early. There will have to be a decrease in positive coronavirus cases over 14 days before the state can start a phased reopening of nonessential businesses, Evers said Monday when releasing new criteria for when the state will begin to reopen.\n\nJackson: Since early March, the county's top health official has been begging the state to support his restrictions to curb the spread of coronavirus in Teton County. Emails obtained by the Jackson Hole News & Guide through the Wyoming Public Records Act show a back-and-forth that became heated as Teton District Health Officer Dr. Travis Riddell pushed state officials to allow him to enact a stay-at-home order. Riddell initially sought the state's blessing for an order narrowly tailored to just the most vulnerable people - seniors and those with underlying medical conditions. But Senior Assistant Attorney General Jackson Engels fought back. Jackson Hole, he wrote, was not as unique as Riddell's order suggested. While stating \"support\" for county-level orders, Gov. Mark Gordon has avoided imposing a statewide stay-at-home order, leaving Wyoming as one of eight states without such a decree.",

        "authors": [],
        "body": "DES MOINES, Iowa -- If life were fair, Kyle Brown and Pamela Dennen deserved more time together.\n\nThe couple from Marshalltown, a city of about 28,000 residents, had spent years overcoming personal obstacles and the physical distance between them, Dennen told the Des Moines Register. They celebrated three years of marriage in February.\n\nAbout two months later, in mid-April, Brown worked his final shift as a maintenance technician at TPI Composites in Newton. Brown, 54, died 12 days later, on April 29, at a Des Moines hospital from COVID-19 complications.\n\nDuring those 12 days, Brown and Dennen made five trips to healthcare providers, Dennen said. It took two visits to secure a test for the novel coronavirus.\n\nBrown's symptoms then worsened to the point where he couldn't speak. The couple made three drives to emergency rooms in Marshalltown and Newton. Twice, he was sent back home with Dennen, even after nurses over the phone told her he needed treatment.\n\n\"It's hard not to wonder if he had been taken seriously earlier, if they had intervened sooner, could his lungs have responded better?\" Dennen asked. \"Could he maybe have been spared? I mean, nobody will ever know that.\"\n\nOn the fifth trip, which was either April 23 or 24 -- the two days ran together, Dennen said -- UnityPoint Health in Marshalltown admitted Brown after his blood-oxygen levels dipped severely. At the end of the weekend, an air ambulance took him to Iowa Methodist Medical Center in Des Moines.\n\nBack in Marshalltown, Dennen started to experience symptoms of her own. Dry coughs frequently interrupted her interview with the Register on Friday. She's been left quarantined in her home, unable to grieve with friends and family, lest they get sick.\n\n\"I haven't had a single hug, which is a really strange thing,\" she said. \"It's just really hard to have this loss and be sick and be quarantined all at the same time. I mean, it's a nightmare.\"\n\nBrown and Dennen's relationship was bumpy early on, but not because they didn't love each other.\n\nThey met on eharmony, an online dating site. She lived in Chicago then and admits she ignored Brown at first because he lived in a different state. But, she said, he had eyes that \"were just so kind.\"\n\nEmails eventually turned into phone calls and in-person visits. Brown was honest about spending most of his adult life trapped in drug addiction, which eventually put him in prison. He told Dennen how he found his faith as he walked through the prison yard one day.\n\n\"He got saved, and he was instantly delivered of all his addictions,\" Dennen said. \"He never had one withdrawal symptom.\"\n\nTPI hired him once he got out, and he returned to living in Marshalltown. His work schedule gave him three-day weekends every other week, so he and Dennen switched off who would visit whom for five years, she said.\n\nThey married a year before moving in together. Dennen suffered from severe back problems that put her in a wheelchair temporarily. They were already engaged, but they wed early so Dennen could get on Brown's health insurance plan. She was again mobile after two years of intense physical therapy.\n\nAfter her youngest daughter moved out of their Chicago home, she joined Brown in Marshalltown in 2018. Three weeks later, a tornado ripped through the city. It did about $80,000 worth of damage to their home, but Dennen said it was later fixed, and the house is better than it was when she moved in.\n\n\"We were both living our dream, so to speak,\" Dennen said. \"We both have been through a lot of heartbreak and heartache and just really tragic times, and we were both really healing to each other.\"\n\nDean Lawthers, Brown's friend since high school, lives on the same street as the couple. The two friends helped each other with house and yard work. Weeks ago, Brown told Lawthers that with his job, house and Dennen, he felt like he'd won the lottery.\n\n\"I told him he had, and he deserved it,\" Lawthers said.\n\nBrown worked his last shift at TPI on April 17. He felt a burning in his chest and was coughing. By the evening, he had a fever and severe body aches, Dennen said.\n\nHe tried to get a test the next day, but a UnityPoint urgent care facility in Marshalltown denied him, he wrote on Facebook, because he was under 65 and not an employee at a meatpacking plant. His social media post drew more than 200 comments and 1,000 shares.\n\nThe same day, he was able to secure a test at the MercyOne Medical Center in Newton, where other TPI employees had gone.\n\nUnityPoint spokeswoman Laura Rainey said the health care provider follows testing guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Iowa Department of Public Health.\n\nAccording to IDPH protocols as of April 17, the State Hygienic Laboratory would accept tests from patients if they were hospitalized with respiratory symptoms or a fever; over 60 with symptoms and a chronic medical condition; any person with symptoms who lives in a congregate setting; or an essential worker with symptoms. Health care providers could, however, test a patient through a national laboratory without IDPH approval.\n\nDennen said her husband had worried about catching the virus at work. On April 13, the Newton Daily News reported that two TPI employees had tested positive for the virus. TPI temporarily halted production at its Newton facility, which employs more than 1,000 workers, on April 24 after 28 employees tested positive.\n\n\"He had been exposed to many different people at TPI who ended up testing positive,\" Dennen said.\n\nOn Saturday, TPI announced that after testing nearly all of its Newton employees on April 25, 20% of the tests, or roughly 200 people, came back positive for COVID-19. The wind blade manufacturer said it also deep-cleaned its plant.\n\nThe company supplied surgical masks to its workers and their families to prevent community spread, TPI said, and secured hotel rooms for employees who tested negative so they could isolate.\n\nBy April 20, two days after Brown got his test, his condition had worsened. He couldn't talk without coughing, so Dennen called the UnityPoint hospital in Marshalltown.\n\nShe said a nurse she spoke to told her Brown's symptoms warranted a 911 call. Dennen said no, she could bring him in. They arrived at the emergency room, where Brown went inside while Dennen waited in the car. She assumed he'd be admitted, but he came out three hours later.\n\nHis blood-oxygen level was measured at 95, considered too high to be admitted, Dennen said. They went back home, and he started to feel worse. He lost his appetite, and sitting up in bed triggered fatigue and coughing attacks.\n\n\"I can't describe the sounds he would make,\" Dennen said. \"They were awful. They were the most awful thing to listen to, but doctors must've heard it because he couldn't do anything without making those sounds.\"\n\nTwo days later, a nurse in Newton called with Brown's test results. She heard Brown coughing in the background and, like the Marshalltown nurse, urged Dennen to bring him to the hospital, even offering to send an ambulance.\n\nBut when he went to the MercyOne hospital in Newton, it was the same story. Doctors saw Brown as Dennen waited in the car outside. He texted her that they were discharging him, and she reached a doctor on the phone. The doctor told her his blood-oxygen level was still above 90 and his cough was dry, part of the reasoning to send him back home.\n\n\"I just hung up on him because I was so angry,\" Dennen said.\n\nGregg Lagan, a spokesman for MercyOne, confirmed that doctors saw Brown on April 22, but he declined to offer more information, citing the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act.\n\nBrown was so tired after the trip to Newton that it took about 30 minutes to summon enough energy to get back into bed at home. His cousin dropped off a pulse oximeter so Dennen could keep track of his oxygen levels at home.\n\nThe reading soon dropped below 90, eventually to 86. It was time for the third trip to the ER.\n\n\"He just almost started to cry,\" Dennen said. \"He's like, 'They won't help me. They won't do anything for me.'\"\n\nWhen they arrived again at the UnityPoint ER in Marshalltown, Dennen stayed by her husband's side, insisting to the staff that they take him in. She wasn't taking no for an answer this time, and the hospital admitted him.\n\nLagan and Rainey both said their hospitals are following patient screening guidelines from the CDC and IDPH.\n\n\"The decision to monitor a patient in the inpatient or outpatient setting should be made on a case-by-case basis,\" the CDC wrote on its website. \"This decision will depend on the clinical presentation, requirement for supportive care, potential risk factors for severe disease, and the ability of the patient to self-isolate at home.\"\n\nBecause of HIPAA, Rainey said she couldn't confirm or deny that Brown was a UnityPoint patient.\n\n\"Our thoughts and prayers go out to all the individuals and families dealing with this illness,\" Rainey said in a statement. \"That's why it's extremely important to help stop the spread of the disease by washing your hands, wearing a mask and social distancing.\"\n\nBrown died around 3 a.m. on Wednesday after he was taken to Des Moines. He had been sedated and put on a ventilator. Dennen was still in Marshalltown, sicker than she's ever been.\n\nShe's so far not having trouble breathing, so she plans to ride it out. Friends have told her to go to a hospital, but after her experience with her husband, she figures she also won't be admitted.\n\nDennen told the Marshalltown Times-Republican that state guidelines for patients could be the culprit.\n\n\"It was a very, very frustrating string of events,\" she said.\n\nLawthers said he understands the hospitals have protocols, but he said it \"boggled his mind\" that it took so long for Brown to be admitted.\n\n\"I don't understand why they wouldn't make an exception and take him in,\" he said.\n\nA memorial or remembrance service will have to wait. Even though she's alone, Dennen said her church family at Restore Church in Marshalltown is keeping an eye on her and her symptoms.\n\nDennen said if she does get sicker, there's a plan to get her to the hospital -- in a different city.",

    "Uber's new policy: Riders and drivers are required to wear face masks": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "Uber is adopting several safety measures starting May 18 to prevent the spread of COVID-19 among drivers and riders.\n\nDrivers and riders will have to confirm they are wearing a mask or cover before every ride, the company said. The new guidelines are in effect through the end of June.\n\nAdditional guidelines include reducing the maximum suggested number of passengers for an UberX ride from 4 to 3.\n\nDelivery people and drivers will be asked to confirm through a new checklist, which requires drivers to verify they are wearing a mask by asking them to take a selfie. Once verified, riders receive a notification through the app.\n\nRiders will also have to confirm they are wearing some type of cover on their face, as well as sanitized their hands. Uber is making riders use a similar checklist to verify they are taking these precautions.\n\nCoronavirus impact: State budget hits are trickling in and it's not pretty\n\nQuarantine fashion: Wardrobes include more pajamas, fewer bras and pants\n\nBesides confirming they will abide to the face cover guidelines, riders must also agree to sit in the back seat and open windows for ventilation.\n\n\"As countries reopen, Uber is focused on safety and proceeding with caution,\" said Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi in a statement. \"Today, we continue to ask riders to stay home if they can, while shipping safety supplies to drivers who are providing essential trips.\"\n\nRiders and drivers are now allowed to cancel trips without penalty if they don't feel safe, including if the passenger or driver isn't wearing a face cover. Users can also report the issue to Uber via the app. This goes hand-in-hand with Uber's new feedback options, which now includes having no face cover or mask. Drivers and riders who repeatedly violate mask policies risk losing access to Uber.\n\nOther ride sharing companies have taken similar measures amid the pandemic. Lyft also announced that users must submit a \"Personal Health Certification,\" which requires every rider, and driver, to self-certify that they will wear a face mask, or covering, and they will not ride or drive with Lyft if they have COVID-19, think they have it or have related symptoms.\n\nUber is still operating in the United States, Canada, India, most of Europe and Latin America. The company said it will reassess the policy at the end of June based on local public health needs.",

    "Unlimited free testing, Canyon roaming: News from around our 50 states": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "Montgomery: The state's death toll from the coronavirus neared 500 on Saturday. The Alabama Department of Public Health reported there have been more than 11,500 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the state and at least 485 deaths. That's 12 more deaths than were reported Friday. Three counties - Mobile, Jefferson and Montgomery - accounted for 41% of all case growth in the last day. Meanwhile, the annual Memorial Day celebration at Veterans Memorial Park in Tuscaloosa has been canceled. PARA and the Veterans Memorial Park Association said there are plans to hold a joint Memorial Day/Veteran's Day celebration in November. And in Auburn, city officials are working on a phased plan to reopen all city facilities by June 1. The move comes a few days after Opelika city officials announced they will open all city buildings Monday, under new guidelines to limit exposure to the coronavirus.\n\nJuneau: A state lawmaker on Friday defended asking whether stickers that individuals may be asked to wear as part of a Capitol coronavirus screening process will be \"available as a yellow Star of David.\" Republican Rep. Ben Carpenter of Nikiski said he was serious in making the comment in an email chain with other legislators. He was responding to proposed protocols aimed at guarding against the virus as lawmakers prepared to reconvene Monday. The protocols suggest stickers be worn to confirm someone at the Capitol had been screened. \"The point is, tying it to the Star of David shows, who amongst the human population has lost their liberties more than the Jewish people?\" he said in an interview. \"And if there were more people standing up for the loss of liberties prior to World War II, maybe we wouldn't have had the Holocaust.\" Rep. Grier Hopkins, a Fairbanks Democrat, responded by calling the remark \"disgusting. Keep your Holocaust jokes to yourself.\"\n\nGrand Canyon National Park: Tourists appeared ready to roam Grand Canyon National Park again after it partially reopened Friday, despite objections from Navajo officials and others that it could hurt efforts to control the coronavirus. By 7:30 a.m., more than two dozen people were enjoying viewpoints along the South Rim. Among them were friends Jack Covington from Texas and Judy Smith from Tucson. They had planned their trip to the Grand Canyon a year ago since Covington had never seen it. They changed their plans and were visiting other places in northern Arizona when they found out the park would be open. \"We figured we'd go for an adventure, and we got lucky,\" Smith said. The Grand Canyon had been closed since April 1, one of the last big national parks to shut down completely to visitors. At the time, health officials in Coconino County said keeping the park open put employees, residents and tourists at risk.\n\nLittle Rock: A state program that was created to process unemployment applications for self-employed individuals or gig economy workers appears to have been illegally accessed and has been shut down, officials announced Saturday. Gov. Asa Hutchinson said he learned Friday evening that an applicant for the program is believed to have somehow accessed the system, prompting an investigation of a possible data breach. The probe will determine if any personal data from applicants was obtained. If any individuals had their data compromised, they will be notified, and steps will be taken to address the situation, including possible credit monitoring, Hutchinson said. An outside IT expert was brought in to review the system. \"We want to make sure that the system is in good shape before it goes back online,\" the governor said.\n\nLos Angeles: With ample coronavirus tests and not enough sick people seeking them, the mayor recently did something on a scale no other major U.S. city had done: allow anyone with or without symptoms to be tested as often as they want. A website to book a test was quickly swamped by residents in the nation's second-largest city and the surrounding county who couldn't get tested under more stringent guidelines and were concerned they were infected or could be asymptomatic carriers unwittingly exposing others. But despite overbooking to compensate for a third of the people who didn't show up, the city still has thousands of tests that aren't being used each week, according to figures provided to the Associated Press by the mayor's office. \"Wasted tests at a time when we still have insufficient testing is really unfortunate,\" said Dr. Eric Topol, head of the Scripps Research Translational Institute, a San Diego-based medical research partnership. \"I applaud what they're doing. The more people tested the better.\"\n\nDenver: Gov. Jared Polis says he expects to see many K-12 public schools open this fall in his state and elsewhere despite the coronavirus threat, though \"it's not going to look like any other school year.\" Polis told \"Fox News Sunday\" that Colorado schools will likely run in a \"hybrid\" fashion that limits social interactions in hallways and during lunchtime and has up to 20% of kids continue with online classes at home if that's their parents' preference. The Democratic governor said schools also may close periodically when \"there's an inevitable outbreak.\" President Donald Trump has urged K-12 schools to reopen, but Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's top infectious disease expert, told Congress last week that it may be reckless to rush kids back before doctors have a better sense of the dangers.\n\nHartford: A federal judge is set to hear arguments this week in a lawsuit that attempts to force the state to take new measures to protect prison inmates from the coronavirus. U.S. District Court Judge Janet Bond Arterton will hold the hearing by video conference next Friday. The ACLU of Connecticut is asking the court to order emergency actions that could include releasing more inmates to protect them from the pandemic. Dan Barrett, the ACLU of Connecticut's legal director, said the organization is upset that many inmates, including some who are most at-risk for catching the virus, are still being housed in dormitories where social distancing is impossible. On Friday the Osborn Correctional Institution in Somers, which houses inmates in both dormitories and cells, was locked down after 105 asymptomatic inmates tested positive for the coronavirus.\n\nDover: A man is suing Democratic Gov. John Carney in federal court over restrictions he has imposed on access to the state's beaches and his ban on short-term rentals. Patrick J. Murray argues in a complaint filed Friday that the restrictions imposed by Carney because of the coronavirus deprive him of his liberty and his property in violation of the Constitution. Murray is seeking restraining orders prohibiting Carney from restricting access to beaches in any way other than requiring face coverings and from continuing a blanket ban on short-term rentals and commercial lodging. Murray is being represented in the case by his wife, Georgetown attorney Julianne Murray. He swore in an affidavit that he will suffer irreparable injury if he is unable to rent the couple's Dewey Beach condominium starting Memorial Day weekend because the rental income from the summer pays the mortgage for the year.\n\nWashington: Metro and Metrobus riders will soon be required to wear masks or other face coverings in an effort to help prevent the spread of coronavirus. The Washington Post reports the requirement begins Monday. Metro General Manager Paul J. Wiedefeld said that bus and train operators had asked for the requirement. Customer surveys found that riders supported the idea as well. Wiedefeld said the mask policy will not be enforced with any criminal sanctions. But he said the agency is trying to determine if it has enough masks to provide to passengers if there are disputes over the policy. He said he hopes riders take responsibility and consider the health of others. Amalgamated Transit Union Local 689, which represents most of Metro's workers, tweeted: \"This is necessary to keep transit workers and riders safe!\"\n\nSt. Petersburg: Guests flocked to a theme park shopping district, a casino fired up its slot machines, and businesses prepared for serving customers Sunday. In Orlando, it was the first weekend since Universal CityWalk reopened Thursday. The Orlando Sentinel reports visitors entered wearing obligatory face masks, having their temperatures taken by workers as stickers marked the 6-foot space required between guests. The spinning Universal Studios globe at the far end of CityWalk was a typical selfie spot as guests flocked to take photos, many removing their masks to flash their smiles. On Friday, Gov. Ron DeSantis announced a \"full Phase 1\" reopening of the economy, which include gyms, starting Monday. Universal Studios and Islands of Adventure remain closed along with other central Florida theme parks as state officials and business leaders continue to evaluate before deciding when to reopen.\n\nAtlanta: Officials reported Friday that the state has surpassed 300,000 coronavirus tests, though that still represents a small fraction of Georgia's overall population. The state health department had received just under 301,900 test results as of Friday afternoon. Of those, roughly 36,700 were positive for the virus. The state's death toll from the virus was just over 1,550. Gov. Brian Kemp said the state was \"moving the needle on testing\" everyday. Georgia went from 200,000 reported tests to 300,000 in a matter of ten days, according to Kemp. But the latest testing figure still represents less than 3% of the state's population. And an Associated Press analysis found Georgia was among 41 states that are falling short of the COVID-19 testing levels that public health experts say are necessary to safely ease lockdowns and avoid another deadly wave of outbreaks.\n\nHonolulu: Lawmakers plan to set aside more than half of the money the state received in federal coronavirus relief money to bolster the state's unemployment insurance fund. The House Finance Committee on Friday approved legislation sending $635 million, out of $1.25 billion allocated by the U.S. Congress to Hawaii, to the state's rainy day fund for this purpose. The bill next goes to the House floor for a vote. Committee Chairwoman Rep. Sylvia Luke said this money is needed because the surge in joblessness during the coronavirus pandemic has severely depleted the unemployment insurance fund. It held $550 million before the pandemic hit, but the state has already distributed $200 million of that as claims have jumped, she said. At the current rate, the money will be depleted by the end of next month.\n\nBoise: The state is holding an entirely mail-in primary for the first time as it works to slow the spread of the coronavirus pandemic. Ballots must be requested by Tuesday and returned by 8 p.m. June 2 to local county elections offices, with results announced that evening. The Idaho secretary of state's office said 320,000 ballots have been requested and mailed out, with about 100,000 returned in what could be a record turnout. \"It's looking like equal or better than the presidential primary\" in March, said Secretary of State Chief Deputy Chad Houck. Democratic voters will see one high-profile name on their ballot: Former 2018 Democratic gubernatorial nominee Paulette Jordan of Plummer is running against former congressional candidate Jim Vandermaas, a retired law enforcement worker from Eagle, for a chance to challenge GOP Sen. Jim Risch in November.\n\nChicago: State officials announced Friday that people working essential jobs can get tested for the coronavirus regardless of whether they show symptoms of COVID-19. Gov. J.B. Pritzker said the state has been able to conduct at least 11,000 tests daily since April 24. He said that total has nearly doubled in recent days, allowing tests for anyone with symptoms or working an essential job under the statewide stay-at-home order, including first responders and those working in nursing homes, grocery stores, restaurants, correctional facilities and child care centers. Anyone exposed to a confirmed COVID-19 patient also can get tested, state officials said. \"Testing, testing, testing,\" Pritzker said. \"That's what every epidemiologist, every immunologist, every responsible business owner and everyone who cares about safely opening up our economy says we must do to successfully maintain a high standard of protection.\"\n\nIndianapolis: Forty-six more residents have died from coronavirus illnesses, putting the state's pandemic death toll from confirmed or presumed cases of COVID-19 above 1,700, health officials said Saturday. Meanwhile, there was a line of vehicles as long as 3 miles as people drove up to get boxes of meat, fruit and vegetables at the state fairgrounds. \"It was worth the wait, honestly. It's been very helpful for my family,\" said Lyneca Sims, 37, who was put out of work when many retailers were required to shut down. \"It's really nice that they're offering the fresh fruits instead of the canned.\" Officials say people with symptoms of COVID-19 or who need a test to return to work after being exposed to the virus can be tested at state-run sites. The state also is encouraging those without symptoms but considered high-risk because of their age or health conditions to get tested.\n\nIowa City: University of Iowa researchers warned that the coronavirus would continue spreading through the state even before Gov. Kim Reynolds reopened restaurants and churches, a move they said would exacerbate the problem, documents released Friday show. The researchers, including some of the state's top epidemiologists and infectious disease experts, also warned that hundreds more residents would likely die through the end of May even if widespread business closures remained in effect. Reynolds has downplayed the importance of such models and continued her push to reopen the economy, despite surging numbers of deaths last week. Restaurants, gyms, barbershops and salons reopened Friday in 22 counties, including the state's largest metropolitan areas, where they had been closed for two months. Reynolds also warned that not reopening the state would have a \"social cost,\" including high unemployment, rising domestic abuse and food insecurity.\n\nMission: Data on COVID-19 infections that had been trending downward, leading Kansas to begin reopening its economy, is beginning to fluctuate and flatten, Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly said Friday. \"It demonstrates that the disease is still spreading in our communities,\" Kelly said one day after slowing the reopening of the state's economy by ordering bars and bowling alleys to remain closed at least through the end of the month. She said she hoped to stick with the state's reopening plan as much as possible. \"But,\" she added, \"I have always said that until a COVID-19 vaccine is developed, manufactured and widely distributed, our future remains subject to the whims of this virus.\" Some of the state's biggest problems have been in meatpacking facilities, with 1,791 cases and four deaths, and in prisons, with 917 cases and five deaths, said Dr. Lee Norman, the top administrator at the state health department.\n\nFrankfort: State parks will start reopening soon as Kentucky continues to ease restrictions amid the coronavirus outbreak, Gov. Andy Beshear said Friday. The parks will reopen June 1 in an effort to revive tourism revenue, Beshear said at his daily briefing. People can make park reservations starting Tuesday, he said. Visitors will be expected to follow social distancing and health guidelines, he said. Reopening to the public will be state resort parks, recreational parks, lodges and cabins beginning June 1, he said. State resort parks designated to house some coronavirus patients won't reopen to the public June 1, Beshear said. Those are Lake Cumberland, Lake Barkley, Blue Licks Battlefield and Buckhorn Lake.\n\nNew Orleans: After weeks of shuttered businesses and houses of worship, the city took its first steps Saturday to loosen restrictions in place for two months to slow the spread of the coronavirus. The rest of the state took that step Friday with many businesses and houses of worship allowed to reopen at 25% capacity. New Orleans is slightly more restrictive. Restaurants and certain other businesses such as nail salons are also required to take reservations. The city has also imposed caps designed to keep houses of worship and movie theaters at fewer than 100 people. Casinos, video poker, live entertainment and bars are still closed. Kirk Estopinal, one of the owners of Cane & Table in the French Quarter, opened Saturday afternoon after the two-month forced hiatus. To reduce contact as much as possible, guests can order their food when they make a reservation online, they're asked to wear masks when they come, and the staff will do the same.\n\nAugusta: The state Department of Education secured internet access and devices for all of the more than 20,000 students who needed them to continue their learning from home, Gov. Janet Mills and Education Commissioner Pender Makin announced Friday. The effort was launched to help students who didn't have the tools to participate in online learning after the suspension of classroom-based instruction because of the pandemic. \"It is our responsibility to ensure that Maine's teachers, and all students, have the tools they need to stay connected during these unprecedented times,\" Mills said in a statement. It was a combined effort of the Department of Education, Department of Administrative and Financial Services, ConnectME, and business and philanthropic entities. Makin said the pandemic drew attention to \"extreme inequities\" during the educational disruption. \"The emergency provision of connectivity to all students allows for educational continuity,\" she said.\n\nBaltimore: State residents wanting to get married may now apply for marriage licenses by email, regular mail or at a drop-off as courthouses remain closed due to the coronavirus pandemic. The one-page applications, which require couples to provide personal information such as Social Security numbers and any past marriages, are mandatory for couples to have their marriages recognized by the state, The Baltimore Sun reports. That information must be sworn under oath either before the clerk, by video conferencing or by an affidavit included with the application. Applications submitted by email should not include Social Security numbers. Applicants will later have to provide Social Security numbers by phone or video conference. Before the pandemic, couples were required to fill out applications in person.\n\nBoston: Gov. Charlie Baker is urging companies to let as many employees as possible work from home to help limit the spread of the coronavirus, even after the state begins to restart the economy. About half of executive branch state employees who work under the governor's office have been working remotely, Baker said Friday during a press conference. He said he's extending that for the foreseeable future. Companies that call workers back into the office will have to demonstrate they can maintain social distancing in the workplace. \"You need to respect the virus,\" Baker said. Several large companies including Raytheon, Blue Cross Blue Shield, Takeda and Wayfair have successfully allowed many of their employees to work from home, the Republican governor said. He is set to unveil a plan Monday to reopen some businesses in the state.\n\nLansing: Nasal swabs, not wheel alignments, will be performed at a former Sears auto repair shop in the city. Sparrow Health System is opening a drive-thru coronavirus testing site in the vehicle bays. Sears closed earlier this year at Frandor Mall. \"This is just a godsend,\" Sparrow chief executive James Dover said. Starting Monday, people can drive up and be tested for the coronavirus or tested to see if they were already infected and have antibodies. No one needs to leave a vehicle, and health staff are protected from the weather. Sparrow can also take other routine blood samples. A doctor's order isn't necessary but would make the process faster, Dover said. People can provide insurance information or pay immediately. Antibody testing is $50, and the nasal swab is $70. Sparrow's lab can run between 1,200 and 1,600 tests a day, said lab director Jon Baker.\n\nMinneapolis: The state took further steps Friday to turn the dial on easing its restrictions meant to slow the coronavirus pandemic and to honor the victims of COVID-19. The state's infectious disease director, Kris Ehresmann, told reporters in the department's daily briefing that it's important with the state's stay-at-home order expiring Monday and some businesses reopening to continue to follow social distancing guidelines. \"We want you to enjoy the weather, we want you to look forward to Monday, but we want you to stay 6 feet apart, wear a cloth mask when you're outside of your home, and don't gather in groups any larger than 10,\" she said. Gov. Tim Walz ordered that flags at state and federal buildings in Minnesota to be flown at half-staff from sunrise to sunset Tuesday and on the 19th of every month through 2020 \"to remember, mourn, and honor lives lost due to COVID-19.\" He encouraged individuals, businesses and other organizations to join in.\n\nOcean Springs: Federal agents seized more than 280,000 masks from a pharmaceutical company last month under a law prohibiting the hoarding of in-demand equipment needed by health workers on the front lines of the coronavirus pandemic, according to a recently unsealed search warrant. FBI agents raided Gulf Coast Pharmaceuticals Plus LLC in Ocean Springs on April 17 and confiscated the supply of more than 6,500 N95 respirator masks, as well as thousands of lab coats, face shields, gloves and more, The Sun Herald reports, citing the warrant unsealed in U.S. District Court. The company is owned by developer Kenneth Ritchey. His attorney, Erich Nichols, said that they are working with the government in the investigation and that Ritchey has donated \"hundreds, if not thousands, of PPE\" to two local health systems.\n\nSt. Louis: City officials are handing out at least 75,000 masks as the region prepares to relax stay-at-home orders. Over two days, city officials say they handed out 42,000 masks to more than 30 senior living facilities, including nursing homes, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports. Each employee and resident of the senior centers will receive five masks, Mayor Lyda Krewson said during a briefing Friday. The city also has distributed 15,000 masks to the city Housing Authority for its residents and 18,000 to the city's Human Services Department, which is giving them to the people it serves. That includes recipients of its home-delivered meal program for the elderly.\n\nGreat Falls: U.S. Rep. Greg Gianforte, R-Mont., voted against the $3 trillion COVID-19 package passed Friday by the House, saying it was \"careless\" and a liberal wish-list. The bill, which would cost more than the four previous COVID-19 bills combined, has little chance of becoming law as written but will likely spark difficult negotiations with the White House and Senate Republicans. Any product would probably be the last major COVID-19 response bill before November's presidential and congressional elections. The proposal would bring almost $1 trillion for state and local governments, another round of $1,200 direct payments to individuals, and help for the unemployed, renters and homeowners, college debt holders and the struggling Postal Service, the Associated Press reported. \"Montana businesses, desperate to reopen, shouldn't have to compete with expansive unemployment benefits that run through next spring,\" Gianforte said.\n\nOmaha: The state will require long-term care centers to develop formal plans outlining how they'll keep the coronavirus from spreading among the vulnerable residents who live in those facilities, Gov. Pete Ricketts said Friday. Facilities such as nursing homes and assisted living centers will have to submit plans to state regulators explaining how they intend to identify ill people and deal with visitors for the rest of the year. They'll also have to discuss their disinfection protocols. The announcement comes as state officials scramble to keep the virus from spreading among long-term care facilities, whose residents are generally older and have underlying health problems. Long-term care residents are among the hardest-hit population groups in Nebraska, accounting for at least 75 of the state's 113 coronavirus deaths. At least 82 long-term care facilities have reported coronavirus cases in Nebraska, including 35 with cases among residents.\n\nLas Vegas: The city has announced that downtown restaurants and businesses operating under the first two phases of state reopening orders are allowed to extend operations to the sidewalk during regular business hours. Outdoor dining and sidewalk sales are now permitted. But each business must continue implementing social distancing measures by keeping tables, chairs and other furniture 6 feet from pedestrian paths, the Las Vegas Review-Journal reports. Nonessential businesses stopped operations in March after Democratic Gov. Steve Sisolak implemented a stay-at-home order and required essential businesses to follow additional guidelines to prevent the spread of COVID-19. The city added its own restrictions, including limits on the size of the public sidewalk frontage, maintaining access to fire hydrants, building entrances and exits, and sanitation.\n\nConcord: Lawmakers say they're returning for legislative sessions in June but meeting outside their respective chambers at the Statehouse - the first time since the Civil War. Instead of meeting at Representatives Hall, the 400-member House will meet at the Whittemore Center at the University of New Hampshire in Durham on June 11. The arena is home to the UNH Wildcats Hockey and is used for other large events. \"We need a place that is large enough to allow us to socially distance while not being so large as to create its own logistical problems,\" Speaker of the House Stephen Shurtleff said in an announcement Friday. He said each member will have a temperature check prior to entering the arena. Also, per UNH guidelines, each member will be given an N95 respirator mask. Members will have to wear them inside, Shurtleff said. The 24-member Senate will meet in Representatives Hall. Lawmakers are working on a date.\n\nTrenton: Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy's administration is citing a 2005 emergency powers law enacted after Hurricane Katrina to block some information about the state's response to the COVID-19 outbreak. Under New Jersey's open records law, the Associated Press sought reports that Murphy required under a March executive order calling for hospitals and nursing homes to disclose their capacity and supplies during the outbreak. The AP also sought records on any commandeered medical supplies authorized under another order. Both requests were denied citing the 2005 Emergency Health Powers Act, which says reports and other records made during an emergency are not considered public. Other news organizations have been denied on the same grounds, including the USA TODAY Network. The state denied the network records showing how the state worked with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, as well as on how it managed protective gear.\n\nSanta Fe: The loosening of some restrictions imposed on nonessential businesses by the governor two months ago to slow the spread of the coronavirus outbreak took effect Saturday, along with a new edict that people wear masks in public under most circumstances. The loosening of restrictions applied to most of the state but not in the northwest region, where McKinley and San Juan counties are located along with Cibola County. Under the new guidelines, retailers and many services along with houses of worship could reopen at limited capacity. Also, in a new move to combat the spread, Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham ordered that face masks be worn in public, but with exceptions that included eating, drinking and exercising. Wearing masks is needed to help produce \"a safe environment,\" but police will not ticket people not wearing some sort of face covering, she said Friday.\n\nNew York: People who flouted coronavirus restrictions for a weekend night on the town got the mayor's wrath Sunday. Mayor Bill de Blasio admonished people seen crowding outside bars, many with drinks in hand but no masks on their faces, for putting lives in danger. Officials may go so far as to shut down establishments that are violating social distancing rules, de Blasio said, asking residents to call 311, the city's non-emergency hotline, if they see this type of crowding. Bars and restaurants in the city have been restricted to takeout and delivery service since mid-March, when coronavirus cases started to soar, but some in Manhattan were allowing people to dine and drink inside Saturday. Meanwhile, after a rash of violent social distancing arrests involving people of color, the city eased up on social distancing enforcement this week by no longer having police officers break up small groups of people or confront citizens about failing to wear a mask.\n\nGreenville: A federal judge on Saturday sided with conservative Christian leaders and blocked the enforcement of restrictions that Gov. Roy Cooper ordered affecting indoor religious services during the coronavirus pandemic. The order from Judge James C. Dever III came days after two Baptist churches, a minister and a Christian revival group filed a federal lawsuit seeking to immediately block enforcement of rules covering religious services within the Democratic governor's executive orders. Dever agreed with the plaintiffs, who argued that the limits violate their rights to worship freely and treat churches differently from retailers and other secular activities. Dever said he does not doubt that Cooper \"is acting in good faith\" to try to stop the spread of the coronavirus, but the restrictions applied to one group and not another do little to help the goal and burden religious freedom.\n\nFargo: While a task force of state and local officials wrestles with high COVID-19 numbers in the Fargo area, one shuttered business in the city is set to reopen Monday: a medical marijuana dispensary. The facility in North Dakota's largest city closed down in early April when its operators cited slow sales and regulatory delays due to the coronavirus. It was the first of eight dispensaries in the state to open after voters approved medical marijuana in November 2016. The dispensary formerly known as The Botanist has new owners and a new name, Pure Dakota Health. Meanwhile, the effort to test targeted areas in the Fargo and Moorhead, Minnesota, metropolitan area bumped the coronavirus numbers to new daily highs in Saturday's report, North Dakota health officials said.\n\nColumbus: Recent law school graduates will have the ability to temporarily practice law in the state under the supervision of an experienced attorney while they wait to take the bar exam, the state's highest court has decided. The Ohio Supreme Court's announcement Thursday came on the heels of its decision to postpone the bar exam originally scheduled for July until Sept. 9-10, due to risks surrounding the new coronavirus. Recent law graduates can apply to use the supervised practice option beginning June 15. The attorney or attorneys who supervise them must be in good standing and have practiced for at least three years. Chief Justice Maureen O'Connor said in a statement that delaying graduates' ability to practice law would create significant financial hardship for many. She said providing flexibility also acknowledges the need for lawyers in certain critical areas during the pandemic.\n\nOklahoma City: The state reopened bars Friday and allowed weddings, funerals and organized sports to resume under the next phase of Gov. Kevin Stitt's statewide reopening plan. Stitt said last week that data supports moving forward, including a continuing decline in hospitalizations for COVID-19 and a steady decline in the percentage of positive tests since the state started to reopen April 24. \"I want Oklahoma to be the first state in the nation to get its wings back and serve as an example,\" Stitt said. Phase two of the governor's reopening plan still calls for employers to close common areas, enforce social distancing, and wear protective equipment such as masks and gloves when interacting with the public. Not all employers were following the state guidelines. At the Capitol on Friday, members of the House and Senate met in large groups, frequently shook hands and violated social distancing guidelines. Most did not wear masks.\n\nPacific City: Two motel owners in the city are suing Tillamook County, saying coronavirus restrictions that stopped their businesses from fully operating in the past two months violate their constitutional rights. The motels contend the county's March 22 resolution halting most overnight lodging violates Fifth Amendment protections against the \"taking of property without just compensation,\" as well as their due process rights, The Oregonian/OregonLive reports. The county lacked authority to issue the restrictions and adopted them in an \"illogical and irrational\" manner, the lawsuit says. The resolution called for closing all transient lodging - hotels, motels, bed-and-breakfasts and short-term rentals including condos - \"to all visitors who are not providing essential services or are here for commercial reasons such as construction, trucking, etc.\"\n\nHarrisburg: State health officials are being \"misinformed\" about the availability of personal protective equipment inside hospitals, one of the state's largest nurses' unions alleges in a letter that says hospitals have \"resorted to severe rationing\" even as they resume elective surgeries. The 8,500-member Pennsylvania Association of Staff Nurses and Allied Professionals said in a letter to the state health secretary, Dr. Rachel Levine, that working conditions inside hospitals remain unsafe because of lax COVID-19 guidance issued by the Health Department and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. \"Pennsylvania health care professionals are scared, exhausted, starting to get sick, and some are dying,\" wrote Mark Warshaw, the union's co-executive director. \"The CDC and DOH guidance have given hospitals an excuse and enabled them to ignore basic protections and safety standards for health care workers, and we are the ones suffering.\"\n\nCentral Falls: The American Civil Liberties Union filed a class-action lawsuit Friday seeking the release of dozens of detainees at a federal lockup where it says the virus is spreading \"uncontrollably.\" The number of detainees who have tested positive for the virus has more than doubled in recent days at the Wyatt Detention Center in Central Falls from 15 to 38, the civil rights group's Rhode Island chapter said. Ten staff members have also tested positive. The lockup can hold as many as 770 inmates, but it's not clear how many are currently held there. Detainees include those in the custody of the U.S. Marshals Service and Immigration and Customs Enforcement. The ACLU argues in its suit filed in federal court in Providence that it's not possible for detainees to follow social distancing guidelines because they're in cells that measure 5 feet by 9 feet.\n\nColumbia: With the reopening of close-contact businesses imminent, the governor urged the state's residents to patronize local businesses shuttered for weeks during the coronavirus outbreak, albeit with appropriate safety precautions. \"Be safe, but go,\" Gov. Henry McMaster said Friday. \"Our economy is not made to be shut down.\" But the governor went on to note, \"This virus is still here. It is still highly contagious.\" McMaster spoke with reporters during a break in Friday's meeting of a component of his committee tasked with making recommendations for reopening the state following shutdowns during the outbreak. Monday marks the date on which businesses like hair salons and fitness centers can reopen across South Carolina, where more than 486,000 unemployment claims have been filed in the past two months.\n\nSioux Falls: State health officials reported 28 new confirmed cases of COVID-19 on Sunday but no new deaths tied to the coronavirus. Health officials said 3,135 of the state's 3,987 coronavirus cases have been reported in Minnehaha County, which is South Dakota's most populous county and the location of a large outbreak at a pork processing plant. Health officials said the number of deaths tied to the coronavirus remained at 44 on Sunday. The number of hospitalized patients was 77 on Sunday, up two from the previous day. A total of 312 cases have required hospitalization. Health officials have warned the the actual number of infections is higher because many people may not display symptoms or have not sought testing for mild symptoms.\n\nNashville: Restaurants and retail stores throughout the majority of the state will no longer need to limit capacity starting late this week. In addition, large attractions, including racetracks, amusement parks, waterparks, theaters, museums and auditoriums, will be allowed to reopen starting Friday, provided they practice appropriate social distancing to combat the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Such changes will be allowed in 89 of Tennessee's 95 counties, with the remainder - Davidson, Shelby, Knox, Hamilton, Madison and Sullivan - following their own reopening plans. Gov. Bill Lee, along with the state's Economic Recovery Group, made the announcement Friday, saying that \"Tennesseans have worked incredibly hard to do their part and help slow the spread of COVID-19 so that our state can begin to reopen.\" Despite the new guidance for large attractions, Lee said restrictions on social gatherings of 10 or more people will remain in place.\n\nHouston: More than 3,000 nursing home residents in Texas have tested positive for the coronavirus, according to data released by the state Friday. The 3,000 positive tests represent about 4% of the estimated number of Texans living in nursing homes, the Houston Chronicle reports. By comparison, about 0.15% of Texas residents have tested positive for the virus that causes COVID-19. Republican Gov. Greg Abbott on Monday ordered coronavirus testing for all Texas nursing home residents and staff after the White House urged governors to do so as deaths mount nationwide. While nursing home residents in Texas make up about 6% of the state's positive cases, they account for about 38% of the state's deaths related to COVID-19, the newspaper reports.\n\nKaysville: A Republican mayor will allow a country music concert protest event later this month, defying newly loosened health rules aimed at slowing the coronavirus pandemic. Kaysville Mayor Katie Witt acknowledged the May 30 event would violate current state directives but told the Salt Lake Tribune: \"I believe I need to support people's First Amendment rights.\" She is also running for Congress, and her opponents questioned whether her approval of the show by well-known singer Nashville-based Collin Raye was politically motivated and could prove risky for public health. The event is sponsored by Utah Business Revival, which has also backed other protests calling on the state to lift restrictions aimed at halting the spread of the virus. Republican Gov. Gary Herbert relaxed many of those restrictions and allowed businesses to reopen across much of the state Saturday outside of some hot spots.\n\nMarshfield: Gov. Phil Scott relaxed his order for Vermonters to stay home and announced Friday that lodging and campgrounds may open May 22 if they abide by safety guidelines and cleaning requirements while also limiting the number of people allowed in. At the same time, the Republican governor extended a state of emergency until June 15 to continue to fight the spread - albeit at one of the slowest rates in the country - of the coronavirus pandemic in Vermont. \"Because of the success we've had, we're now asking Vermonters to be smart and stay safe,\" he said at a news briefing, adding that \"staying close to home and limiting the number of people you're in contact with is still really important.\" People over age 65 or with chronic conditions should still remain at home as much as possible, he said. The order encourages face masks in public but doesn't require them, Scott said. Municipalities may implement stricter requirements, he said. Vermont has the lowest average three-day growth rate of coronavirus cases in the country, officials said.\n\nVirginia Beach: Warm weather drew crowds to the Virginia Beach oceanfront even though the beach is considered closed under the state's stay-at-home directives. Families ordered snow cones, bought hermit crabs and cramped gift shops while bikers pedaled on the boardwalk Saturday, the Virginian-Pilot reports. Tents, umbrellas and beach blankets were set up near the water. Under Gov. Ralph Northam's first phase of a gradual reopening plan, retail stores are reopening with limited capacity, but indoor gyms remain closed, beaches are still off-limits, and restaurants cannot provide indoor dine-in service. The newspaper reports the beach was not jammed, and groups maintained their distance. Many people on the boardwalk wore masks. Kayla Thomas, serving scones at an oceanfront concession stand, said the crowds looked like those she might see at the beginning of summer. \"I'm just shocked by the amount of people,\" Thomas said.\n\nSeattle: Two people in the state who recall being sick in December have since had blood tests showing they developed antibodies for the coronavirus, but health officials aren't counting them in their official case counts. The positive serology tests can't determine whether the people had the coronavirus in December, weeks before the disease was officially detected in the United States. They may have been exposed after the first recorded case. One of the people had lunch with a hospital nurse in Kirkland, for example, site of a large outbreak in a nursing home. \"They are being considered 'probable,' \" Heather Thomas, a Snohomish Health District spokeswoman, told The Seattle Times. If any Washington cases predated the first known case, there were probably very few that didn't multiply, Dr. Jared Roach, a senior research scientist at the Institute for Systems Biology, a Seattle-based biomedical research firm, told the newspaper.\n\nCharleston: Gov. Jim Justice stressed Friday that medical experts are leading his plan to lift coronavirus restrictions, days after he widened his strategy at the request of business owners. The Republican governor has expanded the most aggressive stage of his reopening plan to allow the reopening of gyms and tanning salons next week after he said the businesses bombarded his office with calls. Still, he said it's \"way out in left field\" to suggest he is making decisions based on political pressure. \"That noise or that pressure is not going to influence a decision in any way, no possibility,\" he said. The governor has timed several reopenings around Memorial Day weekend. Gyms can open Monday. On Thursday, tanning salons, restaurants at half-capacity, big box stores and all-terrain vehicle rental businesses can reopen. Campgrounds can open for in-state residents Thursday, as can the Hatfield-McCoy trails, whitewater rafting and zipline businesses. The Greenbrier, a private resort Justice owns, is also set to reopen Friday.\n\nMadison: Local health officials across the state began rescinding their stay-at-home orders Friday after attorneys warned the mandates could be vulnerable to legal challenges after the state Supreme Court wiped out Gov. Tony Evers' statewide order. The Wisconsin Counties Association posted a message on its website after the court ruled Wednesday saying it's unclear whether local orders mimicking the statewide mandate would stand up in court. Health officials in Kenosha County withdrew their stay-at-home order Thursday night in light of the WCA warning. Brown and Manitowoc counties as well as the cities of Cudahy and Appleton dropped their orders Friday afternoon. The ruling led bars, restaurants, hair salons and other businesses to open immediately or begin making plans to reopen. Fearing infections might spike as people begin moving around again, about a dozen counties issued their own stay-at-home orders.\n\nJackson: A ski hill that shut down in March due to the coronavirus pandemic plans to reopen starting Memorial Day weekend. Snow King Mountain has developed an operations plan and will open for summer season as scheduled May 23, officials at the ski hill in Jackson announced Thursday. The announcement came as Wyoming prepared to ease up on public health measures. Starting Friday, people could gather in groups as large as 25, up from 10 previously, and dine in at restaurants where servers wear masks and keep tables widely separated. Summer offerings at Snow King will include a scenic lift, mini golf, ropes course and zip lines. The Kings Grill restaurant will open for prepackaged snacks and drinks. Bikes, stand-up paddle boards and kid kayaks will be available for rent, and guided hikes will be available for small groups. Employees in close contact with guests will wear masks and enforce social-distancing guidelines.",

    "Virologist Joseph Fair believes he got coronavirus through his eyes": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "More Americans are using cloth coverings to shield their noses and mouths in an effort to blunt the spread of coronavirus, but eyes -- long believed to be a possible infection route -- usually remain open to the air.\n\nThat's how a high-profile infectious disease expert believes he caught the virus.\n\nVirologist and NBC contributor Joseph Fair says he was likely infected through his eyes while on a crowded airplane flight, Fair told the Today Show. He said he was taking precautions he advises others to take, including wearing a mask.\n\nYet, days later, he began presenting symptoms of COVID-19 and soon needed to be hospitalized.\n\n\"You can still get this virus through your eyes ... it's the best guess I have of probably how I got it,\" Fair said. He also said he expects he will soon be discharged.\n\nExperts told USA TODAY Thursday that, while the story underscores a risk that people should take seriously during a pandemic, it isn't one that should prompt panic.\n\nThe surface of your eye is a prime target for the virus, said Dr. Thomas Steinemann, a spokesperson for the American Academy of Ophthalmology. The organization has warned for weeks that you can be infected through your eyes and has published a list of tips to help prevent that from happening.\n\nFact check: Early studies show pink eye could be related to COVID-19 but in few cases\n\nWatch: Coronavirus hand-washing technique as performance art\n\nContracting the virus through your eye can happen multiple ways. Perhaps most well publicized: If your hand has been contaminated with the virus, you can spread the virus by touching your face and eyes. But Steinemann said it's also possible for airborne virus particles to infect your eye simply by coming in contact with it.\n\nThe good news: In most situations, there are easy ways to protect yourself.\n\n\"For crying out loud, don't rub your eyes,\" Steinemann said.\n\nSocial distancing -- staying 6 feet or more away from other people -- helps reduce the risk that airborne virus particles will come in contact with your eyes.\n\nAnd a combination of hand washing and not touching your face will help prevent you from accidentally contaminating your eyes.\n\nThe case that Fair describes is a risky situation where social distancing was impossible, Dr. Jason Brinton, a ophthalmologist and and founder of St. Louis based Brinton Vision, told USA TODAY.\n\nMasks and other precautions are not entirely effective, and air gaps in masks have particularly been shown to be a gateway to infection, Brinton said. So while it's possible Fair caught the infection through his eye, it's not the only explanation.\n\nWhile the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has recommendations for eye protection in settings where workers may be at risk of exposure, the agency has not recommended the widespread use of protective eyewear.\n\nNeither Brinton and Steinemann felt that the average person should feel the need to wear goggles, unless they are entering a particularly high-risk environment, such as close contact with a person who has tested positive for COVID-19.",

    "What is Kawasaki disease? Is it linked with coronavirus?": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "Symptoms of a rare inflammatory condition have been identified in at least 15 children in New York City hospitals, alarming pediatricians across the country and raising concerns about a possible link to the coronavirus.\n\nThe patients exhibited symptoms typically seen in Kawasaki disease or toxic shock syndrome, including a persistent fever, according to the city's health department.\n\nThe children were between 2 and 15 years old and were identified between April 29 and May 3. While all the patients had a fever, more than half of them reported a rash, abdominal pain, vomiting or diarrhea.\n\nIn an alert issued to doctors, the NYC health department said less than half of the patients exhibited respiratory symptoms. Four of the cases tested positive for COVID-19, while 11 tested negative.\n\nNo deaths have been reported, but many of the patients required blood pressure support and five of them required mechanical ventilation, the city's health department said.\n\nBoth Kawasaki disease and COVID-19 are illusive conditions that doctors are still studying. Some experts doubt there's a link between the two while others don't believe the mysterious symptoms belong to Kawasaki at all.\n\n\"Kawasaki disease is one of the great mysteries in pediatrics,\" said Dr. Frank Esper, a physician at the Cleveland Clinic's Center for Pediatric Infectious Diseases. \"It's something we've been dealing with for decades.\"\n\nSymptoms include a fever of at least 101 degrees that lasts for five days or more, a rash and swollen glands in the neck, according to Britain's National Health Service. Esper says that it predominately affects children between the ages of 2 and 6, tends to run during \"mini-epidemics,\" and is more likely to happen in the winter than the summer.\n\nWhile doctors know how to treat Kawasaki disease, they still don't know what causes it or why some people get it. Esper says \"a cemetery of different reports\" have hypothesized the disease is caused by viruses while others say people may be genetically predisposed.\n\n\"Kawasaki disease is the boogeyman to pediatricians,\" he said. \"It's extremely difficult to diagnose. Even with the most astute clinicians, we have a hard time figuring out who has it and who doesn't.\"\n\nEsper says the main indicator of the disease can be found in the heart. Coronary artery aneurysm, or a dilation of the coronary arteries, is what distinguishes Kawasaki from any other inflammatory disease.\n\nThe condition was first reported by doctors in Britain, Italy and Spain in late April. Britain's Paediatric Intensive Care Society issued an alert noting there had been an increase in the number of children with \"a multi-system inflammatory state requiring intensive care\" across the country.\n\nThe group said there was \"growing concern\" that either a COVID-19 related syndrome was emerging in children or that a different, unidentified disease might be responsible.\n\nSpain's Association of Pediatrics recently made a similar warning, telling doctors that in recent weeks, there had been a number of school-age children suffering from \"an unusual picture of abdominal pain, accompanied by gastrointestinal symptoms\" that could lead within hours to shock, low blood pressure and heart problems.\n\nIn Italy, Dr. Angelo Ravelli of Gaslini Hospital and a member of the Italian Paediatricians' Society, sent a note to 10,000 colleagues raising his concerns. He and his team reported an unusual increase in the number of patients with Kawasaki disease in regions of Italy hit hard by the pandemic, noting some children had COVID-19 or had contacts with confirmed virus cases.\n\nSome possible cases have also been reported in France and Belgium.\n\nExperts say it's too early to tell if the disease can be associated with COVID-19.\n\n\"We've never seen the coronavirus before but we've been dealing with Kawasaki disease for decades,\" Esper said.\n\nHe also said that experts aren't even sure if the mystery disease popping up in parts of Europe and the U.S. can be definitively identified as Kawasaki disease. So far, he hasn't seen any the reports mention coronary artery dilation, which would be a major indication.\n\n\"I will caution that there are many things that look similar to Kawasaki disease,\" Esper said. \"It could be that what they're calling Kawasaki is not Kawasaki but an inflammatory disease caused by the coronavirus.\"\n\nDo you think you have the coronavirus?: Here's what you should do.\n\n'Like a new diagnosis': Cancer families struggle to continue treatment amid coronavirus pandemic\n\nDr. Sunil Sood, a pediatric infectious disease physician at Northwell Health's Southside Hospital and Cohen Children's Medical Center, doesn't believe the condition is Kawasaki.\n\nSood says patients he's treated have been sicker, with inflammatory markers 10 to 100 times higher than average child with Kawasaki disease.\n\nAlthough the New York City Health Department only mentioned 15 cases in their alert, Sood says he's had at least 20 cases between the two hospitals where he works. Only three of his cases tested positive for coronavirus with the regular PCR test, but the rest tested positive for coronavirus antibodies.\n\nHe estimates his patients may have had the virus, even unknowingly, four weeks before developing the inflammatory condition.\n\n\"The immune system can overreact in a delayed timeline many weeks later,\" Sood said. \"We know this from other infectious diseases.\"\n\nHe advises parents and pediatricians to look out for a fever as well as a combination of any of these symptoms: Abdominal pain, confusion, diarrhea, red eyes, rash, swollen hands and feet, difficulty breathing and passing out. Sometimes the abdominal pain can be so severe that it mimics appendicitis.\n\nSood urges parents to bring their children to the hospital if they develop any symptoms because it could lead to further heart complications, even acute heart failure.\n\n\"Initially, I thought it was Kawasaki ... but it's going beyond those symptoms,\" he said. \"Pediatricians and parents should be aware that there's an outbreak of this right now.\"\n\nWhile there's a spike in these cases, Sood says that children are still among the least affected group by the coronavirus. Data from more than 75,000 cases in China showed they comprised 2.4% of all confirmed cases and mostly suffered only mild symptoms.",

    "Where to buy household items: Toilet paper, cleaning wipes, hand sanitizer, and more": {

        "body": "-- Recommendations are independently chosen by Reviewed's editors. Purchases you make through our links may earn us a commission.\n\nAs most of the country remains under stay-at-home orders due to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, people are continuing to stock up on cleaning and household essentials, per recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). And as a result, those essentials are selling out at many online retailers.\n\nFrom hand sanitizer to toilet paper to thermometers, these products can help you and those you live with feel prepared during a self-quarantine or if anyone gets sick. But they are becoming hard to find online, which can be especially stressful when you're trying to shop without leaving the house.\n\nWe've rounded up 10 of the most hard-to-find household products to have during the coronavirus outbreak and where to get them while you still can. There may be shipping delays because of increased demand, but we'll be including the products most likely to get to you the fastest. We'll also continue to update this list as supplies dwindle and restocks, so be sure to check back often.\n\nNeed help finding products?Sign up for our weekly newsletter. It's free and you can unsubscribe at any time.\n\nHand sanitizers from Purell and GermX are flying off the shelves right now, but you should be picky because the truth is, they're not all the same. Some contain an alcohol substitute known as benzalkonium chloride, which isn't as effective if you're trying to stop the spread of germs. Instead, you want to look for a hand sanitizer that has at least 60% alcohol content, according to the CDC.\n\nBut these items are selling out fast (seriously, you may even have to go in-store to grab them), so we definitely suggest you grab them as soon as possible. Or, you could just make your own, especially since the World Health Organization (WHO) just put together this do-it-yourself guide to creating your own sanitizer. Word of caution though -- their step-by-step instructions do require 96% ethyl alcohol.\n\nAccording to the CDC, one of the best things you can do right now to prevent the spread of coronavirus is to wash your hands frequently. That means scrubbing them after you use the bathroom, ride public transportation, blow your nose, cough, or sneeze, as well as before you eat. The American Red Cross also recommends that you wash your hands for at least 20 seconds in order to effectively clean them. While antibacterial soap is crucial, just regular hand-washing is a crucial way to stop germs from spreading.\n\nDuring natural disasters and other emergencies, toilet paper always seems to be the first thing to go out of stock. The thought of running out of wipes to do your business when you can't leave the house is absolutely horrifying. While we ranked the Charmin Ultra Soft as the No. 1 toilet paper for your No. 2, in times like these, you're better off taking what your can get -- even if it's one-ply. Here are all the places you can still order toilet paper from.\n\nIn most instances, paper towels can seem wasteful. While they're definitely a popular household purchase -- and we've even rounded up a list of the best paper towels you can buy right now -- they're not eco-friendly and they're expensive, which can make them seem like a luxury to some households.\n\nBut the fact that paper towels are disposable actually could make them beneficial to have, particularly in homes where there's already someone impacted by coronavirus. The CDC recommends paper towel usage for cleaning and disinfecting homes, which makes them good to have around, just in case.\n\nThe U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) recently released a list of disinfectants that are safe for American households to use right now to protect against the coronavirus. One of the top disinfectants on the list? Clorox Disinfecting Wipes. Made to kill up to 99.9% of surface bacteria and viruses, these wipes are easy to use, safe on most surfaces, and essential to have around the house right now.\n\nEditor's note: There are currently no cleaning wipes available, but we'll update this as soon as they are back in stock.\n\nDish soap is another household item, you're going to want to have around. The CDC recommends that those who are affected by the coronavirus should not share dishes, drinking glasses, cups, or utensils. After these dishes have been used, they should be washed thoroughly with soap and water. When we tested the best dish soap, we washed more than 125 plates, glasses, bowls, and spoons, and found that Dawn Ultra was the clear winner. Not only does it cut through grease, but it's a great disinfectant as well.\n\nA thermometer is essential for knowing whether or not you have a fever, which is one of the main symptoms of the coronavirus, according to the CDC. With many people attempting to grab a thermometer that they're missing from their medicine drawer, there are very slim pickings in-store and online right now. Thankfully, you can still find a few online -- though they may take a few days (or even weeks) to ship.\n\nSimilar to cleaning wipes, disinfectant spray can help clear surfaces of harmful bacteria and potentially guard against the spread of coronavirus. The CDC recommends sticking to household cleaners with at least 70% alcohol, and most EPA-registered disinfectants -- like Lysol Clean & Fresh Multi-Surface Cleaner, for example -- should be effective for regular use. If you haven't already grabbed a bottle or two, you can get this on Amazon right now, but we'd suggest you hurry and snag it fast, as it's selling out everywhere.\n\nIf you're stuck at home for an extended period of time, you absolutely don't want to run out of diapers -- it could be a mess, literally and figuratively. As you're trying to plan ahead, you may want to buy a few extra boxes worth of diapers. Every baby is different though, and some diaper brands may work better than others, so we recommend you grab your brand (whichever it may be) and stockpile them.\n\nAlthough the major symptoms of coronavirus include a dry cough, fever, and shortness of breath, according to the CDC, it's always a good idea to have an extra box of tissues lying around. You could wind up with a runny nose due to allergies or get the cold or flu. After testing nine different boxes (and blowing many noses), we found that Puffs Ultra Soft are the best tissues and won't irritate your nose. You can stock up on these on Amazon right now. Other brands still have tissues in stock, too.\n\nThese aren't the only things selling out, non-essential items like fitness products, board games, and more are going quickly too. We'll be covering the inventory of these high-demand items, too:\n\nThe product experts at Reviewed have all your shopping needs covered.
