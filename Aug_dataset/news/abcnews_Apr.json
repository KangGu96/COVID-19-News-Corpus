        "body": "NEW YORK -- CBS News \"60 Minutes\" correspondent Lesley Stahl said Sunday that she's finally feeling well after a battle with COVID-19 that left her hospitalized for a week.\n\nStahl said she was \"really scared\" after fighting pneumonia caused by the coronavirus for two weeks at home before going to the hospital.\n\n\"One of the rules of journalism is 'don't become part of the story,'\" Stahl said at the end of Sunday's broadcast. \"But instead of covering the pandemic, I was one of the more-than-one-million Americans who did become part of it.\"\n\nStahl, 78, is the dean of correspondents at television's best-known newsmagazine. She joined \"60 Minutes\" in March 1991, and before that was moderator of the Sunday talk show \"Face the Nation\" and a Washington correspondent.\n\nShe landed the first television interview with Donald Trump after he was elected president, and the first with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi when she become speaker -- both in 2007 and again in 2019.\n\nStahl said there was a cluster of \"60 Minutes\" employees with the virus. One \"had almost no symptoms while others had almost every symptom you can imagine,\" she said. \"Each case is different.\"\n\nStahl said she found an overworked and nearly overwhelmed staff when she was hospitalized but paid tribute to their care, and said she was wheeled out through a gauntlet of cheering medical workers when discharged.\n\n\"In the face of so much death, they celebrate their triumphs,\" she said.\n\n60 Minutes declined to name the hospital involved.\n\n\"Thanks to them, like so many other patients, I am well now,\" she said. \"Tonight, we all owe them our gratitude, our admiration and, in some cases, our lives.\"\n\nStahl is arguably the most prominent television journalist to disclose they had the disease. CNN hosts Chris Cuomo and Brooke Baldwin have tested positive, the former continuing his prime-time show while fighting symptoms. ABC \"Good Morning America\" host George Stephanopoulos had it, but like many infected, had only mild symptoms.\n\nThe virus has infected 3.5 million people and killed more than 246,000 worldwide, including more than 66,000 dead in the United States, according to a count by Johns Hopkins University. Experts say the numbers are likely larger.",

    "'A distraction'? Experts warn of limitations of tech for contact tracing": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "The fight against COVID-19 has been marked in part by the development of emerging technologies and leaders eager to embrace them. But as the private sector races to develop a digital system for contact tracing, a key weapon in the battle to rid the virus, experts say the time-honored human approach is still the best.\n\nDozens of foreign governments and some U.S. states are scrambling to find app and software developers to more effectively engage widespread contact tracing in an effort to update the centuries-old practice of identifying past contacts of a person who tested positive for the disease.\n\nOne effort, led by tech giants Apple and Google, will bring \"exposure notification\" to smartphone users worldwide as early as next month for those who opt-in. But some health care industry leaders are skeptical of the practicality and effectiveness of such efforts.\n\nDr. Tom Frieden, a former director of the Centers for Disease Control, went so far as to call digital contact tracing \"something of a distraction.\"\n\n\"Fundamentally, contact tracing is about people helping people,\" said Frieden, now the CEO of the global health initiative Resolve to Save Lives. \"Contact tracing is about building a human bond between someone who wants to help and support patients and their contacts, and society more broadly.\"\n\nFrom the rise of telemedicine to broad-scale efforts in Silicon Valley, innovative approaches to curb the pandemic's spread have largely been met with approval in health care circles. Leaders in medical innovation have lauded the usefulness of wearable fitness apps and smart thermometers in early tracking of the disease.\n\nTraditional contact tracing, which is already underway in several states, is a labor-intensive process that requires \"an army\" of people, Frieden said, to connect with positive cases and re-trace their contacts. Those contacts, once notified, can then self-isolate and, in theory, diminish the likelihood of transmitting the virus.\n\nIn that spirit, public health officials and tech companies are racing to give the old-school ways a digital face lift. From Singapore to Utah, leaders have placed hope in apps designed to identify potential exposures for millions of people worldwide.\n\nExperts, however, said there are limitations to the technological approach -- most critically a population's willingness to use it. And no matter the technology, they said, the backbone of any contact tracing effort will be the people.\n\n\"There is a large camp emerging that is arguing in favor of the traditional, shoe-leather, resource-intensive approach to contract tracing: get a list of a patient's contacts, call those that were potentially exposed and monitor their symptoms,\" said Dr. John Brownstein, the chief innovation officer at Boston Children's Hospital and an ABC News contributor.\n\nDr. Dylan George, a vice president at the non-profit technology venture capitalist firm In-Q-Tel, which invests in tech solutions for the U.S. intelligence community, described the digitized proposals of conducting contact tracing as a way \"to augment humans rather than replace them.\"\n\nSuch a digital contact tracing plan, he said, could help in streamlining some aspects of the process, but warned against buying into any technology solution to contact tracing as \"a silver bullet.\"\n\n\"The Apple and Google approach of having two devices next to each other broadcasting pings and receiving those pings and then listing out those traces may be useful for some cases, but it hasn't been proven,\" George said. \"I don't think [contact tracing apps] are going to be the place where we get the biggest bang for our buck using technology.\"\n\nThe technology in development at Apple and Google will leverage Bluetooth to notify users when they come into close proximity with others who have tested positive for the disease.\n\nProven or not, skepticism from health care technology leaders has done little to slow the dozens of efforts underway to build and enact widespread contact tracing apps. Several countries have already rolled out their own platforms with varying degrees of success.\n\nSingapore's government-approved app, TraceTogether, launched last month. It has since garnered nearly 6 million downloads. In Australia, the COVIDSafe app has managed more than 2 million downloads in less than a week.\n\nSeveral European countries have also endeavored to leverage contact tracing technology. After initially expressing interest in using the platform being developed by Google and Apple, the United Kingdom's National Health Service announced this week it would develop its own, centralized app.\n\nIn South Korea, where contact tracing efforts have been credited for contributing to the rapid descent in coronavirus cases, the government has made a practice of alerting people by text when neighbors test positive.\n\nIn the U.S., a handful of states have led the charge in rolling out contact tracing apps. North and South Dakota have bought into Care19, whose developer, a Microsoft engineer, repurposed another of his apps that was used to track football fans travelling to away games.\n\nLast week, Utah's governor announced plans to release Healthy Together, a \"symptom checking mobile application that helps augment current contact tracing efforts,\" according to a press release. Amelia Prebish, a Utah Department of Health program coordinator, said the app is meant \"to support and enhance ... the existing surveillance system\" - not replace it.\n\nWith so many contact tracing platforms in progress, one critical question remains: Will people actually use them? According to a Washington Post/University of Maryland poll released last week, the majority of Americans will not.\n\n\"Nearly 3 in 5 Americans say they are either unable or unwilling to use the infection-alert system under development by Google and Apple,\" the poll found.\n\nThat figure does not bode well for developers, whose platforms will rely on a \"critical mass\" of users in order to work.\n\n\"If you don't get enough people using a particular app or don't have interoperability among many apps, it's not going to be effective,\" said George, of In-Q-Tel.\n\nResearchers at Oxford suggest that at least 60% of a given population would need to use a contact tracing app in order to stop the disease's spread. For context, the more than 2 million users of Australia's COVIDSafe app represent less than 10% of the population.\n\nOne \"major source of skepticism\" among those interviewed in the Washington Post/University of Maryland poll was concern over privacy and data.\n\nDevelopers appear to recognize those concerns, and have made preemptive efforts to quell them. In a press release announcing their software, Google and Apple called \"user privacy and security central to the design.\" Prebish, the Utah health official, said privacy was the state's \"number one priority.\"\n\nBut advocates and experts agree that any app that tracks movements and interactions is bound to raise eyebrows among users.\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union has already published a \"white paper\" with principles guiding technology-assisted contact tracing. Last month, lawmakers in Congress penned a letter to President Donald Trump warning that \"geolocation data is also extremely sensitive and must not be used for any other purposes.\"\n\nExperts concluded that for all its shortcomings, technology used to support contact tracing is worth pursuing, but cautiously. More importantly, experts said, contact tracing - in whatever form it takes - should represent just one of several steps leaders undertake before rushing Americans back to work.\n\n\"We can't be running from one bright, shiny object to another,\" said Frieden. \"These are all part of a comprehensive approach.\"",

    "'Every parent's nightmare': Boy's death may have virus link": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "NEW YORK -- A 5-year-old boy has died of a rare inflammatory condition possibly linked to COVID-19, the first such death in New York, Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Friday. Also, some New York City parks will see stepped-up policing to stem the spread of the coronavirus, Mayor Bill de Blasio said. And 2,500 members of a \"test and trace corps\" will be in place by early June to combat the virus, the mayor said.\n\nDetails on virus-related developments across New York:\n\nWhile children have been shown, so far, to be far less likely to suffer severe harm from the coronavirus, there is growing concern that a rare complication might be causing some to experience swollen blood vessels and heart problems.\n\nAt least 73 children in New York have been diagnosed with symptoms similar to Kawasaki disease -- a rare inflammatory condition in children -- and toxic shock syndrome.\n\nThe death of a 5-year-old boy Thursday at a New York City hospital is sad news for New Yorkers who believed children were largely unaffected by the coronavirus, Cuomo said.\n\n\"So this is every parent's nightmare, right? That your child may actually be affected by this virus,\" the Democratic governor said. \"But it's something we have to consider seriously now.\"\n\nChildren elsewhere in the U.S. have also been hospitalized with the condition, which was also seen in Europe.\n\nA spokesperson for The Mount Sinai Kravis Children's Hospital, which treated the child, expressed condolences to the family and stressed that the condition has been, thankfully, rare.\n\n\"While it is concerning that children are affected, we must emphasize that based on what we know thus far, it appears to be a very rare condition,\" Mount Sinai spokesperson Jason Kaplan wrote in a statement. \"Mount Sinai and the healthcare community will continue to investigate and study this new variant in hopes of finding a solution to this rare condition.\"\n\nThere is no proof yet that the virus causes the syndrome. At least 3,000 U.S. children are diagnosed with Kawasaki disease each year. It is most common in children younger than 6 and in boys.\n\nSymptoms include prolonged fever, severe abdominal pain and trouble breathing.\n\nPolice officers will start limiting access to three New York City parks whose visitors have become poster children for bad social distancing, and a talking point in debates over whether there's a racial bias in how the rules are being enforced, Mayor Bill de Blasio announced Friday.\n\nUsers of the parks, two on Manhattan piers and one on Brooklyn's East River waterfront, have been shamed on social media after images appeared showing young people, without masks, sprawled on blankets with little regard for rules barring people from getting within 6 feet of anyone else.\n\nTo control overcrowding, de Blasio said, police will start limiting how many people can access the parks at a time and warning people they will be allowed to stay only for a limited amount of time.\n\n\"Why are we doing this? Because it saves lives,\" said de Blasio, a Democrat.\n\nThe program will begin at Pier 45 and Pier 46 in Manhattan's Hudson River Park and Domino Park in Brooklyn.\n\nImages of the crowded parks, all frequented predominantly by white people, have been used to help illustrate a disparity in enforcement of social distancing rules.\n\nSome people have contrasted the relatively hands-off approach police have taken in those parks to the more aggressive enforcement in gatherings of black people -- in addition to the breakup of large public funerals in Brooklyn held by Hasidic Jews.\n\nPolice department data released Friday showed that of the 374 summonses issued through May 5 for violating distancing orders, 52% were given to black people and 30% to Hispanic people.\n\nThe mayor said the racial breakdown is \"an indicator that something's wrong we need to fix.\" He pledged more training and clearer protocols for officers.\n\n\"We do not accept disparity,\" de Blasio said. \"When we see disparity, we're going to address it.\"\n\nGiven the hundreds of thousands of interactions police have had with the public during the pandemic, de Blasio said, the overall summons totals are \"extraordinarily low\" and show a \"huge amount of restraint by the NYPD.\"\n\nThe Brooklyn district attorney's office released data late Thursday showing that of the 40 people arrested for social distancing violations in that borough since mid-March, 35 were black, 4 were Hispanic and just one was white. All cases were dropped.\n\nA \"test and trace corps\" of 2,500 will be in place by early June to identify people who have the virus, isolate them in hotel rooms if needed and determine whom they've had contact with, de Blasio said.\n\nDe Blasio said 7,000 people have already applied to join the effort, which will be coordinated with New York state's contact tracing initiative.\n\nThe mayor promised that \"you're going to see the biggest testing and tracing initiative you've ever seen in this city, in this country before. It's going to be fast, it's going to be intense, it's going to reach deeply into the city, it's going to be lifesaving, unquestionably.\"\n\nThe operation will be headed by Dr. Ted Long, a top official at New York City Health and Hospitals, the city's public hospital system, rather than by the leadership of the city health department, which is usually in charge of public health initiatives.\n\nThe hospital system's leaders are best suited to implement the contact tracing program because of their experience running a network of 11 hospitals, plus clinics around the city, de Blasio said.\n\n\"I am convinced this is the way we'll get it done,\" he said.\n\nApplicants for contact tracing positions will be trained in a Johns Hopkins University program sponsored by former Mayor Mike Bloomberg's Bloomberg Philanthropies, de Blasio said, and tech giant Salesforce will help set up a call center and data management system.",

    "'Express burials' cast doubt on Nicaragua's virus figures": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "MANAGUA, Nicaragua -- Roger Ordo\u00f1ez was hospitalized with breathing problems last week.\n\nWhen his son Enrique came to visit the next morning, the 69-year-old retiree was already being buried by government workers in protective white full-body suits in a cemetery on the outskirts of Chinandega, a city of 133,000 people in northwest Nicaragua.\n\nThe hospital warned the Ordo\u00f1ez family to self-quarantine for two weeks but said their patriarch did not have the novel coronavirus, even though they were shown no test results.\n\nPresident Daniel Ortega's government has stood out for its refusal to impose measures to halt the coronavirus for more than two months since the disease was first diagnosed in Nicaragua. Now, doctors and family members of apparent victims say, the government has gone from denying the disease's presence in the country to actively trying to conceal its spread.\n\n\"I begged the doctor to tell me what happened to him,\" Enrique Ordo\u00f1ez said. \"I needed to know if he was infected. I have an 18-month-old girl, my mother has a variety of ailments and we need to know if it was COVID.\"\n\nThe government says this country of 6.5 million people has seen 16 coronavirus cases and five deaths since its first case was diagnosed. Businesses and government offices remain open and the government has actively promoted sporting events and other mass gatherings.\n\nThe nongovernmental organization Citizen Observatory made up of health workers and activists, said it had identified 1,033 suspected COVID-19 infections in the country through Saturday.\n\nNicaraguan epidemiologist Alvaro Ram\u00edrez, currently living in Ireland, said the number is already far higher and coming days \"will be decisive\" for Nicaragua.\n\nHe calculates that in two weeks Nicaragua could have some 18,000 infections, of which 890 would be serious.\n\nPlainclothes police and government supporters have detained journalists outside a hospital in Managua and in a cemetery in Chinandega in the past week.\n\nBut in Chinandega the pandemic is becoming difficult to hide. White-suited men in pick-up trucks with coffins in the bed have become a more common sight in recent days, residents say. And it seems everyone knows someone who got sick.\n\nA Chinandega doctor, who requested anonymity to avoid retaliation, said she knew four people who had died, including one of her patients, who was buried within two hours of dying.\n\n\"Everyone they consider a suspected patient who has died of atypical pneumonia they send for immediate burial,\" she said.\n\nDiagnoses are made based on symptoms and X-rays of patients' lungs, because tests for the virus are tightly controlled by the Health Ministry and difficult to obtain.\n\nAn informal network of medical colleagues in the city had tallied 25 suspected COVID-19 deaths through Sunday, she said.\n\nOrdo\u00f1ez, an appliance sales executive, said his father suffered from chronic ailments, including hypertension and respiratory problems, but that last week from one day to the next he suddenly struggled to breath. He took him to the hospital Thursday evening and he died that night.\n\n\"The hospital organized everything,\" Ordo\u00f1ez said. He had shown up early Friday morning to ask about his father's condition, but they told him he was already being buried.\n\n\"I tried to identify the grave the best I could, because there are other bodies there,\" he said. \"But we can't raise our voices much. Fear is pervasive in our country.\"\n\nIf something else killed him, then why did the hospital bury him without letting his family be present and why did doctors tell Ordo\u00f1ez to self-quarantine for two weeks, he wondered.\n\nNeighboring Honduras and El Salvador have taken strict measures to try to slow the virus' spread. Honduras has about 2,000 confirmed infections and El Salvador has about 1,000. Costa Rica has more than 800.\n\nA request for comment from Vice President Rosario Murillo, the government's spokeswoman and Ortega's wife, was not answered.\n\nBut it appears the government is beginning to recognize what is coming.\n\nAt the end of April, the Health Ministry called a meeting of all the hospital directors and top-level health officials at ministry offices.\n\n\"They told them this is getting serious, that every hospital needs to prepare,\" said R\u00f3ger Pasquier, president of the Nicaraguan Anesthesiology Association. \"This call is very late. They didn't take isolation measures, they haven't protected health workers, there aren't sufficient beds in any Managua hospital, nor any regional hospital.\"\n\n\"Contrary to what is shared officially, I know through my medical colleagues that we have a great number of people sick in Managua, Masaya, Matagalpa and Chinandega, where there is an outbreak that could be very dangerous,\" Pasquier said.\n\nMany doctors fear speaking publicly, because of government retaliation. Pasquier said he was speaking freely \"because I'm not being political; we just want to save lives in a dramatic moment for the world.\"\n\nA doctor at another hospital for the National Police in Managua said there were 18 patients there with suspected COVID-19 infections. None had been tested, but were diagnosed based on symptoms and lung x-rays, said the doctor who requested anonymity because she was not authorized to speak.\n\nJos\u00e9 Antonio V\u00e1squez, president of the Nicaraguan Medical Unit, an organization of doctors that formed after the protests of April 2018, said the group had identified 42 doctors, nurses and technicians who have suspected infections.\n\nIn Chinandega, fear has deepened in recent days, a combination of more frequent sightings of the white-suited men in pickups and recent deaths of a couple of well-known local figures. The area has sea connections to El Salvador and a corridor for truck cargo with Honduras. Local officials have said nothing.\n\nThe local doctor said it appeared as though from Friday to Monday more than half of the city's formal businesses had closed. Doctors, nurses and technicians at the public hospital have been infected due to a lack of protective equipment and early recognition.\n\n\"If we manage to survive this, it's because God is great,\" the doctor said. \"There's no other explanation.\"\n\n\"There's a lot of nervousness here,\" said university student Pablo Antonio Alvarado, mentioning a couple acquaintances in Chinandega he heard were infected. \"They say we're the epicenter of the pandemic, like Wuhan in China.\"\n\nHe described the white-suited men riding with coffins in pickups as looking like \"astronauts.\" The Chinandega doctor said they were hospital orderlies given the task of quickly disposing of the dead.\n\nOrdo\u00f1ez was left with more questions than answers about his father's death. \"The doctor told me (the virus) was dangerous,\" while also insisting the elder Ordo\u00f1ez didn't have it, he said.\n\n\"I didn't bury him, they buried him,\" Ordo\u00f1ez said. \"And before, they had buried others, at dawn, because beside him there were seven or eight more graves.\"\n\n-- --\n\nAP writer Christopher Sherman in Mexico City contributed to this report.",

    "'It's impossible': NY nursing homes fret about testing order": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "NEW YORK -- As calls grow nationwide for mandatory coronavirus testing in nursing homes, New York facilities are sounding alarms about the state's ambitious new demand to test roughly 185,000 workers twice a week.\n\nAdministrators worry there won't be enough kits for an estimated 370,000 tests a week on workers at nursing homes and other adult care facilities, nearly double the total of tests done statewide now on people in all walks of life. The homes also have questioned who will cover an expense estimated around $100 to $150 per test, though the state suggested Thursday the homes could send workers to free state testing sites.\n\n\"It's the right thing to do, it's a good idea, we support it, but the logistics of it and the cost of it need to get thorough consideration,\" said Neil Heyman, who heads the Southern New York Association of about 60 New York City-area nursing homes. He and the heads of four other nursing home umbrella groups told Gov. Andrew Cuomo in a letter Wednesday that \"there are a myriad of practical problems that will make it impossible to comply.\"\n\nCuomo, a Democrat, says the testing requirement may be \"a pain in the neck,\" but it's necessary.\n\n\"We have to be able to say ... when this is over, that we did everything we could to protect people,\" he said Thursday on WAMC-AM radio.\n\nThe COVID-19 virus causes mild or moderate symptoms for most people. But it has killed over 30,000 people in nursing homes and long-term care facilities nationwide -- including nearly 5,600 in New York, more than in any other state, according to an Associated Press tally.\n\nWest Virginia in late April required testing for all nursing home residents and workers. Other states dispatched the National Guard to help with testing. Some New York homes and their local governments made their own arrangements for blanket testing, sometimes with state help.\n\nBut the state didn't require it until Cuomo issued an order Sunday, amid criticism from residents' relatives, watchdogs and some politicians over his approach to protecting what he has called \"the most vulnerable people in the most vulnerable place.\"\n\nThe next day, the White House recommended, but didn't order, testing for all nursing home residents and staffers in the next two weeks. Several states, including Texas and Pennsylvania, have since taken steps to demand or encourage coronavirus testing in nursing homes.\n\nNew York's order instructs nursing home operators \"to test or make arrangements for testing\" all staffers twice a week -- unlike in West Virginia, for instance, where the state health department and National Guard carried out the testing of 28,000 residents and workers.\n\nNew York homes that don't comply can face thousands of dollars in fines or lose their licenses. Employees who refuse to get tested can be barred from working until they do.\n\nNursing home residents' advocate Richard Mollot applauded New York's order.\n\n\"I do think that there will be challenges to implementation for some at the beginning,\" said Mollot, executive director of the Long Term Community Care Coalition. But he noted that the federal government has provided some relief funds.\n\n\"Nursing homes can and should utilize them to pay for resident care and safety, including any unanticipated expenses that might arise from the need for testing,\" Mollot said.\n\nBut nursing homes fret that the state is setting the bar too high.\n\nThe Society for Post-Acute and Long-Term Care Medicine, which represents more than 50,000 professionals in the field, is \"very concerned,\" executive director Chris Laxton said.\n\nBesides the question of paying for the tests, the requirement \"threatens to make staff shortages, already unsustainable, completely unworkable, and will quickly overwhelm commercial labs,\" Laxton said.\n\nThe state Health Department said Thursday that lab capacity and other issues are still being worked on. Many details will be left to nursing homes and county governments, but the department said it was working to make sure nursing homes have access to free testing at 31 state-run sites.\n\nStill, the head of a group representing about 400 New York nursing homes and assisted living centers said the state National Guard should help provide testing on the facilities' own premises -- and the federal government should help pay for it.\n\n\"Without immediate and urgently needed funding, nursing homes are at a significant disadvantage in responding to this unprecedented health crisis,\" said Stephen Hanse, president of the New York State Health Facilities Association and the New York State Center for Assisted Living.\n\nSome areas were already getting started with the new testing.\n\nOfficials in suburban Rockland County delivered state-provided testing kits Thursday to eight nursing homes.\n\n\"We are doing everything in our power to help protect residents,\" said County Executive Ed Day, a Republican. \"We know how difficult and worrying this situation is.\"\n\nAssociated Press investigative researcher Randy Herschaft and video journalist Joe Frederick in New York and writer Marina Villeneuve in Albany contributed.",

    "'New normals' imagined, tested as virus shutdowns relaxed": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "From outdoor kids' movies for cooped up apartment dwellers in Rio to online shopping and worship around the globe, the coronavirus pandemic has communities adapting to the realities of living with a pandemic while battling to save their economies.\n\nJapan was preparing to end its coronavirus state of emergency for most regions on Thursday, while New Zealand further relaxed its restrictions after deciding its outbreak is under control.\n\nA strong typhoon was roaring toward the eastern Philippines as authorities struggled to evacuate tens of thousands of people safely during a virus lockdown. Governors said social distancing would be nearly impossible for those in emergency shelters, some of which had been turned into quarantine facilities.\n\nIt could be weeks before it's clear whether reopenings will cause a spike in COVID-19 cases. The trajectory of outbreaks vary wildly, with steep increases in cases in some places, decreases in others and infection rates that can shift dramatically from neighborhood to neighborhood.\n\nSo, in many parts of the world, communities and individuals are finding inventive ways to cope with what many view as a \"new normal.\"\n\nApartment dwellers in Rio de Janeiro were getting some much needed entertainment from children's movies projected onto screens set up outside their buildings, similar to a drive-in theater.\n\nCesar Miranda Ribeiro, president of city-owned RioFilme company, said the effort called \"Cinema in the Windows\" is aimed at \"trying to take care of the mental health of the people.\"\n\nChinese looking for some stay-at-home retail therapy have tuned into livestream shopping.\n\nOthers seeking spiritual support and human connections are worshipping remotely via online religious services from the Vatican to village churches, to mosques and temples.\n\n\"People in general, I think, are looking for more meaning and spirituality in the midst of all this,\" said Omar Suleiman, an Islamic leader in Irving, Texas, whose Yaqeen Institute for Islamic Research has been uploading YouTube videos. \"So I think there's just a general increase in religiosity and consumption of religious content.\"\n\nFor most leaders, though, the focus was a far more worldly one: how to get back to business and revive economies reeling from record numbers of job losses and chilling uncertainty.\n\nJapanese Prime Minister Shinzo was due to hold a news conference to explain plans to lift the country's state of emergency in most places ahead of schedule as the number of new cases falls, with the exception of Tokyo and several other high-risk areas.\n\nSo far, Japan, with a population of 126 million, has reported 16,000 confirmed cases of coronavirus and about 680 deaths.\n\nThe U.S. has the largest coronavirus outbreak in the world by far: 1.39 million infections and over 84,000 deaths, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University. Worldwide, the virus has infected more than 4.3 million people and killed some 297,000. Experts say the actual numbers are likely far higher.\n\nA top U.S. immunologist who says he lost his government job because he warned the Trump administration to prepare for the coronavirus pandemic said he was ready to tell Congress that America faces its \"darkest winter in modern history\" unless leaders act decisively to prevent a rebound of the coronavirus.\n\nDr. Rick Bright's testimony due Thursday follows this week's warning by Dr. Anthony Fauci, the government's top infectious disease expert, that rushing to lift store-closing and stay-at-home restrictions could \"turn back the clock,\" seeding more suffering and death and complicating efforts to get the economy rolling again.\n\nBut the pressure is on to staunch job losses after the U.S. unemployment rate soared to 14.7% in April, the highest since the Great Depression.\n\nWith roughly 30 million Americans out of work, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell urged Congress and the White House to act further to prevent long-lasting harm. More government spending and tax breaks will be \"worth it if it helps avoid long-term economic damage and leaves us with a stronger recovery,\" Powell said.\n\nHe spoke a day after Democratic leaders proposed a $3 trillion aid package for state and local governments, households and health care workers. That would follow nearly $3 trillion in earlier financial assistance. The Fed, for its part, has cut interest rates to near zero and created numerous emergency lending programs.\n\nSome states started easing their lockdowns about two weeks ago, allowing reopenings by establishments ranging from shopping malls in Texas to beach hotels in South Carolina to gyms, bars and restaurants in sparsely populated Wyoming, which has had relatively few cases.\n\nIt can take three to five days for someone newly infected, and possibly infectious, with the coronavirus to feel sick. Some infected people won't even have symptoms. With testing often limited to those with symptoms, it may be five to six weeks before the effects of relaxing shutdowns are known, said Crystal Watson of the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security.\n\n\"As we saw early in the year, epidemics of COVID-19 start slow and take some time to build and become evident,\" Watson said in an email.\n\nAn Associated Press analysis of confirmed cases found steep increases in daily new cases in Hennepin County in Minnesota and Fairfax County, Virginia. In others, such as Bergen County, New Jersey, and Wayne County, Michigan, there's been a steady decline.\n\nThe AP analyzed case counts compiled by Johns Hopkins University, using a rolling seven-day average to account for day-to-day variability in test reporting.\n\nThe push for more testing is near universal: After discovering a handful of new infections, authorities in the Chinese city of Wuhan, where the pandemic first began late last year, are pressing ahead to test all 11 million residents for the virus within 10 days.\n\nSouth Korea was testing hundreds of people as it battles a spike in infections linked to nightlife spots in Seoul that threaten the country's hard-won progress in the fight against the pandemic. It confirmed 29 more coronavirus cases over the past 24 hours.\n\nItaly partially lifted lockdown restrictions last week only to see a big jump in confirmed coronavirus cases in its hardest-hit region. Lebanese authorities reinstated a nationwide lockdown for four days beginning Wednesday night after a surge in reported infections and complaints that social distancing rules were being ignored.\n\nIn Geneva, meanwhile, a top World Health Organization official warned that it's possible the new coronavirus may be here to stay since without a vaccine it could take years for the global population to build up sufficient levels of immunity.\n\nAssociated Press journalists around the world contributed to this report.\n\nFollow AP pandemic coverage at http://apnews.com/VirusOutbreak and https://apnews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak",

    "'Still in the surge': Virus keeps a hold on Massachusetts": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "The coronavirus kept a tight grip Monday on hard-hit Massachusetts, which is barreling toward 1,000 new deaths in just five days as the pandemic peaks in the state.\n\nMassachusetts is getting ready to surpass 3,000 reported deaths, and there are indications the true death toll from the disease could be much higher. Officials are hopeful things could be turning a corner, but devastation remains apparent as newspapers print page after page of death notices.\n\nThe state is \"still in the surge and very much in the fight against COVID-19,\" Republican Gov. Charlie Baker told reporters Monday. \"We will keep the fight up all the way to the end, knowing that when we come out the other side there will be better times and brighter days.\"\n\nMassachusetts health officials reported 169 new COVID-19 deaths Sunday, bringing the number of deaths in the state since the pandemic began to 2,899. The state also reported 1,590 new cases, for a total of almost 55,000 cases.\n\nAn analysis from The Boston Globe suggests that the deaths are probably undercounted, since total deaths in the state rose by 11% last month compared with the average for March over the past 20 years even as the state saw a steep decline in fatal accidents and suicides.\n\nIn a picture of the toll the virus has taken on the state, the Globe on Sunday ran 21 pages of paid death notices. On the same Sunday last year, the Globe ran just seven pages of death notices, the newspaper said.\n\nMore than 1,600 of the deaths in Massachusetts have been residents of long-term care facilities, such as nursing homes, and more than 98% of all the people who died had other health problems, health officials say. The average age of people who have died is 82.\n\nFor most people, the coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough, that clear up in two to three weeks. For some, especially older adults and the infirm, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia.\n\nThere have been more than 55,000 deaths across the U.S., according to Johns Hopkins University. The number of infections is thought to be far higher because many people have not been tested, and studies suggest people can be infected without feeling sick.\n\nMassachusetts has the third highest number of confirmed COVID-19 cases among U.S. states, behind New York and New Jersey.\n\nThere are signs that the worst days for Massachusetts may be behind it.\n\nHospitalizations have leveled off, and more than 50% of the state's hospital beds remain available for patients. But officials warn it could take some time before numbers across the board improve dramatically.\n\n\"We flattened the curve,\" Baker said. \"It seems to have plateaued, depending on which part of Massachusetts you are in. The hope and expectation is it will start to fall, but it will probably fall slowly.\"\n\nAnd improving numbers bring little solace to Cambridge resident Rich Stevens, whose uncle died of COVID-19 over the weekend.\n\n\"I doubt my aunt and cousins see anything encouraging in these numbers,\" he said. \"I know I don't.\"\n\nAssociated Press writer William J.

    "'Tale of 2 outbreaks': Singapore tackles a costly setback": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia -- Weeks after two of his roommates were diagnosed with COVID-19, Mohamad Arif Hassan says he's still waiting to be tested for the coronavirus. Quarantined in his room in a sprawling foreign workers' dormitory that has emerged as Singapore's biggest viral cluster, Arif says he isn't too worried because neither he nor his eight other roommates have any symptoms.\n\nStill, the 28-year-old Bangladeshi construction worker couldn't be blamed if he were more than just a bit concerned.\n\nInfections in Singapore, an affluent Southeast Asian city-state of fewer than 6 million people, have jumped more than a hundredfold in two months -- from 226 in mid-March to more than 23,800, the most in Asia after China, India and Pakistan. Only 20 of the infections have resulted in deaths.\n\nAbout 90% of Singapore's cases are linked to crowded foreign workers' dormitories that were a blind spot in the government's crisis management. Arif's dorm complex, which has 14,000 beds, accounts for 11% of total infections, with over 2,500 cases.\n\nThis massive second wave of infections caught Singapore off guard and exposed the danger of overlooking marginalized groups during a health crisis. Despite warnings from human rights activists as early as February about the dorms' crowded and often unsanitary living conditions, no action was taken until cases spread rampantly last month.\n\nSingapore's costly oversight was also an important lesson to other countries in the region with large migrant populations. Neighboring Malaysia recently announced mandatory coronavirus testing for its more than 2 million foreign workers after dozens were diagnosed with COVID -- 19.\n\nThe slip-up highlighted Singapore's treatment of its large population of low-wage foreign workers, who play an integral part in the economy but live on the fringes in conditions where social distancing is impossible. The misjudgment was also an embarrassment for Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong's government ahead of a general election anticipated in the next few months that is expected to be the last for Lee, who has led Singapore since 2004 and is planning to retire soon.\n\nSingapore's nanny state government, which won global praise for its meticulous contact tracing and testing in the early stages of the crisis, quickly moved to contain the problem by treating the flare-up in the dorms as a separate outbreak from that in the local community, a policy that some say is discriminatory.\n\nThe government shut schools and nonessential businesses island-wide on April 7. So-called \"safe distancing ambassadors\" were recruited to remind people to wear masks and stay at least a meter apart from each other in public places, or face heavy penalties.\n\nMeanwhile, all construction sites and dorms were locked down and foreign workers largely confined in their rooms. More than 10,000 foreign workers in essential services were moved to safer sites to reduce crowding, and testing was ramped up to include people with no symptoms.\n\nIn Arif's S11 Punggol dorm -- advertised as the cheapest in Singapore -- police have mounted a 24-hour patrol of the 13 multicolored housing blocks located in the island's northeast.\n\nArif, who was sharing a room with 11 other workers, said one of them was moved to an army camp in early April to help ease overcrowding. Shortly afterward, another roommate was hospitalized with a fever, and on April 17 another was isolated with light symptoms. Both tested positive for the coronavirus.\n\nArif said he hasn't been tested yet because thousands of residents of his dorm will probably have to be tested. But he said he was comforted by Singapore's top-notch medical facilities and its relatively low number of deaths from the virus.\n\nHe gets food delivered to his room, free Wi-Fi on his cellphone and, most importantly, he said the government has pledged that the workers' salaries will be paid.\n\n\"I am not worried because the government is taking good care of us like Singaporeans,\" said Arif, who has lived in Singapore for seven years. \"Right now, we take our temperature twice a day, try to stay a meter apart from each other and constantly use hand sanitizer.\"\n\nOnce belittled as a tiny red dot on the global map, Singapore has relied on overseas workers to build infrastructure and help power its growth into one of the world's wealthiest nations.\n\nSome 1.4 million foreign workers live in the city-state, accounting for 38% of its workforce. At least two thirds are low-wage, transient migrants from across Asia performing blue-collar jobs that locals shun, with many working in construction, shipping, maintenance or as maids.\n\nRoughly 250,000 of the migrants live in 43 privately run dormitories mostly tucked away in the outskirts far from Singapore's stunning skyscrapers and luxury malls. Workers sleep in bunk beds in rooms usually packed with 12 people, sometimes up to 20, with a required minimum living space of 4.5 square meters (48 square feet) per person.\n\nAnother 120,000 migrant laborers live in factory-converted hostels or temporary facilities at work sites, where conditions are sometimes even more dismal.\n\nMost of Singapore's migrants earn between 500 and 1,000 Singapore dollars ($354-$708) a month.\n\nSince last month, the government's infection data has separated foreign workers' cases from those among the general population. Although cases continue to rise among foreign workers, they have declined in the local community. The government plans to gradually reopen the economy on Tuesday before island-wide restrictions end June 1, eager to show that it has remedied the situation and that the measures have worked.\n\nEugene Tan, a law professor at Singapore Management University, said that the government is trying to promote the outbreak among foreign workers as a separate one that it is addressing, but which most residents of the city-state do not need to be overly concerned with.\n\n\"The larger (government) narrative that cannot be missed is the tale of two outbreaks in Singapore,\" he said.",

    "'You are a miracle': Home care is new front in virus fight": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "NEW YORK -- Ruth Caballero paused outside an unfamiliar apartment door, preparing to meet her new patient.\n\nShe covered the knob with a plastic bag. Put on a surgical gown, then a heavy-duty N95 mask, a lighter surgical mask on top. Cap, face shield, shoe covers. Hand sanitizer between each step of the process. Finally, the nurse donned two sets of gloves and knocked on the door with her elbow, ready to care for her first coronavirus patient.\n\nAfter about three weeks in a hospital, the man was home in his New York apartment but still so weak that sitting up in bed took some persuading.\n\n\"You made it out of the hospital, so you are a miracle,\" Caballero told him. \"Now let's keep you out of the hospital.\"\n\nHome health care is becoming a new front in the national fight against COVID-19 as some patients come back from hospitals and others strive to stay out of them.\n\nHome care nurses, aides and attendants -- who normally help an estimated 12 million Americans with everything from bathing to IV medications -- are now taking on the difficult and potentially dangerous task of caring for coronavirus patients.\n\nWhile Americans are being told to keep to themselves, home health providers and their clients still largely have to engage in person, often intimately. Many agencies are ramping up phone or video visits but can't always get paid for them, and even the smartest phone can't physically dress a wound or get someone to the bathroom.\n\nLike their colleagues in hospitals and nursing homes, home care workers have faced a scarcity of protective equipment, but with a lower public profile. Some agencies have scoured for masks at nail salons, auto body shops and tattoo parlors, said William Dombi, president of the National Association for Home Care and Hospice, an industry group.\n\nThe crisis is testing the industry, but it's also a moment of pride for workers who have often felt under-recognized.\n\n\"It is a challenge to keep the business operational, but it's an opportunity,\" Dombi said. \"We're getting a chance to establish what can be done.\"\n\nCoronavirus care at home has expanded rapidly in the last few weeks. At least some agencies in most states are now taking COVID-19 patients referred after hospitalization or nursing home care or as an alternative to them, Dombi said.\n\nStill, some patients have struggled to get care. After being diagnosed with coronavirus-related pneumonia late last month, Penny Wittbrodt contacted multiple agencies around her home in Winchester, Kentucky. None was then accepting COVID-19 patients, she said, though her doctor was able to arrange home oxygen. Wittbrodt, who has asthma and a history of respiratory hospitalizations, is still not well, though she's had some relief at times.\n\nA retired home health nurse, Wittbrodt feels such care is especially valuable in the pandemic.\n\n\"Home health would expose far less people to COVID than hospitalization,\" she said.\n\nNew York-based Americare Inc. has taken about 100 COVID-19 patients released from hospitals, and over 200 of the agency's other patients also have tested positive or shown symptoms, VP Bridget Gallagher said.\n\nEvery corporate staffer including the CEO is calling protective gear suppliers, but the agency still counts its stock of N95 masks every day.\n\n\"We're doing what we can, but I have to be honest: None of it feels like enough,\" said Gallagher, who's also on the board of the Home Care Association of New York State.\n\nFor many agencies, chronic staff shortages are amplified by absences due to illness or quarantine. And workers are grappling with patients' fears while reckoning with their own risk.\n\nThe surgical mask and gloves that Washington home health aide Adassa Clarke now wears rattle her patient, who has Alzheimer's disease and relies on a wheelchair. The patient doesn't have COVID-19 but can't retain what she's been told about an illness going around.\n\n\"What's going on? Do I have a germ? Am I dying?\" she asks, according to Clarke. Sometimes, the patient breaks into tears.\n\nAt 65, Clarke herself is in an age group at higher risk of severe cases of COVID-19, and she's trying to stay home as much as she can.\n\nBut patients \"come first,\" said Clarke, a certified nursing assistant.\n\n\"I just feel like the more I help, the more I keep going,\" she said.\n\nA home health nurse with Chicago-area patients with COVID-19, Vanessa Pepino-Adraneda is extra-vigilant about protective gear and other precautions. Pepino-Adraneda also girds herself by focusing on caring for her patients and allowing herself moments of sadness, frustration or exhaustion.\n\n\"I try my best to protect my sanity amidst all this chaos,\" she said.\n\nFor some people, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, the virus can cause severe illness or be fatal. For most people, it carries mild symptoms or none at all, meaning some patients could have the virus and not know it.\n\nThe Visiting Nurse Service of New York, one of the nation's largest home health agencies, currently has nearly 400 COVID-19 patients, and another nearly 300 referrals await, Executive Vice President Dan Savitt said. Separately, about 80 confirmed and presumed coronavirus patients are getting hospice care.\n\nAs an industry, \"I do feel like we've risen to the challenge,\" he said.\n\nWhen the agency first told Caballero and other nurses in late March that COVID-19 patients were coming, \"I won't say that I wasn't nervous,\" Caballero says.\n\nShe was relieved, though, to see the protective equipment the agency issued. And her first visit, to the man in the apartment, went well. When she called later that night, he was not only sitting up but had gotten into a chair.\n\nThe person who would have been her next coronavirus patient died before visits began.\n\nCaballero is now caring for several COVID-19 patients. They came home debilitated and fearful, afraid that hospitals \"sent them home to die,\" she says.\n\nShe encourages them to take step after small step: to sit on the side of the bed, to walk to the bathroom, to have a meal at the kitchen table.\n\n\"It is a challenge. This disease has taken so many lives,\" she says, but \"I'm so blessed and so honored and so grateful that these patients are coming home.\"\n\n\"Think about it -- there but for the grace. It could be I.\"\n\nAssociated Press Video Journalist Ted Shaffrey contributed to this report.",

        "body": "BARCELONA, Spain -- A 113-year-old Spanish woman says she is in good health after having overcome infection by the new coronavirus.\n\nMaria Branyas said she \"feels good.\" She avoided developing severe COVID-19 symptoms and had her latest test come back negative. Her daughter told Spanish news agency EFE that her mother, who was born in the United States, tested positive for the virus in April.\n\n\"As far as my health, I feel good, with the little issues everyone has as we get older, but I feel fine,\" Branyas told EFE this week from her nursing home where several residents have fallen ill and died from the new virus.\n\nLocal media say at least 17 residents of her nursing home are suspected to have died after developing symptoms associated with COVID-19. On March 27, Branyas' social media account run by her children said that \"unfortunately the virus has entered our residence.\"\n\nBranyas was born in San Francisco on March 4, 1907 after her family emigrated to Mexico and then the U.S., as her children recount in a Twitter account run in her name called \"Super Catalan Grandmother.\"\n\nAfter living for some years in New Orleans where her father founded a magazine, she returned to Spain's northeastern Catalonia region where she lives in the town of Olot.\n\nBranyas still has memories of crossing the Atlantic Ocean in a boat during World War I, as she related to Catalan news agency ACN on her birthday in March.\n\n\"Because of the war, Germany was still attacking in the north, and there was no way of going through the Nordic seas, so you had to go further south, via Cuba and the Azores,\" she said.\n\nDespite her poor hearing and sight, Branyas said she was aware of the pandemic that has claimed over 27,000 lives in Spain.\n\n\"It is a tragedy,\" she said, \"since only a few people seem to know where it came from, how it got here and why.\"\n\nFollow AP pandemic coverage at http://apnews.com/VirusOutbreak and https://apnews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak.",

        "authors": [],
        "body": "HOUSTON -- Two guards at an immigration detention center in Louisiana have died after contracting the coronavirus, raising new questions about whether the U.S. government is adequately protecting 30,000 immigrants in custody and the staff guarding them.\n\nRelatives of both Carl Lenard, 62, and Stanton Johnson, 51, said the Richwood Correctional Center in Monroe, Louisiana, had at one point prevented them from wearing masks as the virus spread through the facility.\n\nLenard died early Saturday, according to his family. He tested positive for COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus, though his cause of death is still undetermined. His widow, Margarette Lenard, said she now has COVID-19 as well and several relatives have symptoms of the virus.\n\nJohnson died Tuesday, according to his mother, Joyce Johnson, who also said that he had tested positive for COVID-19.\n\nBoth families believe the men contracted the virus working at Richwood, which has 45 detainees confirmed to have COVID-19. There are 425 confirmed cases among detainees nationwide in U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement custody, a figure that has steadily risen in recent weeks. No detainee deaths from COVID-19 have been reported at Richwood or other ICE facilities.\n\nICE has about 30,000 people detained and tested just 705 detainees, according to its publicly released figures. The agency recently said it would receive 2,000 tests a month from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to ramp up testing of detainees.\n\nLaSalle Corrections, the private prison company that operates Richwood, did not immediately respond to a question for comment about the guards. It also did not say how many guards at its immigration facilities are sick. ICE referred questions about jail guard deaths to LaSalle.\n\n\"As an employer, if you employ a person, you have a mandate to protect them,\" said Margarette Lenard, the widow of Carl Lenard. She added that she also blamed the national shortages of protective equipment and the re-use of masks and other gear.\n\nA Richwood employee told The Associated Press in early April that guards were being told not to wear their own masks or gloves to avoid spreading panic among detainees, as many have pleaded for their release to avoid contracting the virus and more than 20 lawsuits have been filed against ICE. The employee was not authorized to speak publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\nTwo days after the AP asked LaSalle Corrections about its personal protective equipment policy, the jail staff was told on April 8 they could start to wear masks and other equipment, according to the Richwood employee. LaSalle executive Scott Sutterfield told the AP that protective equipment \"is provided as necessary and employees can bring and wear masks.\"\n\nIn the meantime, detainees were being brought in from other facilities in Texas and Louisiana to Richwood, the employee said. Some of them were suspected of having the coronavirus.\n\nOne detainee, Salomon Diego Alonzo, was hospitalized shortly after being required to dial into an immigration court hearing where he struggled to speak, according to his attorney, Veronica Semino. A guard standing near Alonzo told the judge during the hearing that the 26-year-old from Guatemala \"does not have the lung capacity.\"\n\nMargarette Lenard confirmed that her husband was concerned about being around detainees without the necessary protective equipment. She eventually obtained three cloth masks for him to wear.\n\nCarl Lenard died unexpectedly in his home about 2 a.m. Saturday, she said. He started having a fever Monday, six days before his death, she said. She gave him Tylenol and called a medical clinic, which had him come in Wednesday for a coronavirus test. His fever eventually broke, though he had a small cough.\n\nHe woke at about 1 a.m. Saturday and was talking to his wife and grandchildren. About 1:45, according to his widow, he started praying. Shortly afterward, he gave a single cough, then stopped breathing, she said.\n\nA nurse practitioner, Margarette Lenard, tried to resuscitate him until the paramedics arrived but was unsuccessful.\n\nJoyce Johnson, the mother of Stanton Johnson, said he died Tuesday. He initially started to have a fever and other symptoms last week, she said.\n\nBoth men had diabetes, their families said. For most people, the new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia and death.\n\nOn Tuesday, lawyers for the American Civil Liberties Union of Louisiana and Southern Poverty Law Center called on ICE to improve conditions at Richwood.\n\n\"The ballooning number of positive COVID-19 cases at Richwood, and the reports of poor medical care that accompany this outbreak, demand your immediate attention to the conditions in that facility,\" the lawyers said.\n\nFollow AP coverage of the pandemic at https://apnews.com/VirusOutbreak and https://apnews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak.",

        "body": "A 22-year-old Chicago mother has lost her battle to COVID-19 after spending three weeks on a ventilator and struggling to breathe.\n\nNyla Moore, who suffered from an asthma attack around April 10 and later tested positive for the coronavirus, died at Rush University Medical Center on May 1, according to her family.\n\n\"I screamed so loud. I just lost it ... it hasn't been the same since ... I haven't watched TV ... it's just been so sad all around,\" her mother, Nikki Collins-Moore told ABC News.\n\nTune into ABC at 1 p.m. ET and ABC News Live at 4 p.m. ET every weekday for special coverage of the novel coronavirus with the full ABC News team, including the latest news, context and analysis.\n\nCollins-Moore said that her daughter was on a ventilator and sedated for 22 days before she died. She said that her final words to her child were on a cell phone when she was sharing some encouragement with her.\n\n\"I love you Nyla. Get well, we got the baby. You got this,\" Nyla's mother recalls telling her daughter.\n\nHer mother said that prior to contracting COVID-19, Nyla didn't have any previous health issues or common virus symptoms, but rather believed that her asthma was flaring up and causing her difficulty breathing.\n\nNyla, who was the youngest out of six children, leaves behind a two-year-old son, Eric. Collins-Moore, who has a dozen grandchildren, says that she and Nyla's father will assist the infant's dad in taking care of young Eric.\n\n\"Her baby, he's too young to know but I know he feels it. His spunk has left a little bit,\" Collins-Moore said.\n\nNyla, the daughter of two Chicago city workers, was a stay-at-home mother who dreamed of becoming a teacher. Amidst the pandemic, she often babysat for family members who are essential workers.\n\n\"Nyla was our fun girl. She was the baby of six ... she loved music and she had a knack for people. She loved people,\" Collins-Moore said.\n\nPrior to graduating high school in 2016, Nyla's mother said that her daughter not only excelled academically, but that she was also multi-talented as well. She participated in various activities such as the debate team, cheerleading and the band. Additionally, she enjoyed working with students with special needs.\n\nHer maternal grandmother, Debra Baker, is a 63-year-old veteran medical worker who has been working on the frontlines in Chicago as an Operating Room Technician at St. Bernard Hospital. Baker has been helping patients in the medical field for over two decades, including previously working at the same hospital where Nyla passed away.\n\nAcross the nation, COVID-19 has claimed the lives of tens of thousands with African Americans, who are dying at a much higher rate than other racial demographics, according to several states' data analysis.\n\nIn Chicago, that also rings true with staggering statistics showing that 72% of coronavirus deaths were black patients despite the city's population only being 32% black.\n\nNow, as dozens of states across the country begin to slowly reopen, Nyla's friend of over seven years, Mariah Starks, is sounding the alarm for anyone, particularly young people, who are not taking the health guidelines seriously.\n\n\"My best friend used to be in the house everyday all day and still caught it. Age doesn't mean nothing ... it's nothing to play with because this is a different type of hurt man,\" Starks wrote on Facebook.\n\n\"I keep trying not to be mad at the world but I cannot help it .. .my heart is broken,\" Starks said.\n\nA viewing for family and friends is scheduled for Nyla on Friday followed by a service on Saturday, where she will be her favorite color: yellow.",

        "authors": [],
        "body": "NEW YORK -- Three children have now died in New York state from a possible complication from the coronavirus involving swollen blood vessels and heart problems, Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Saturday.\n\nAt least 73 children in New York have been diagnosed with symptoms similar to Kawasaki disease -- a rare inflammatory condition in children -- and toxic shock syndrome. Most of them are toddlers and elementary-age children.\n\nCuomo announced two more deaths a day after discussing the death of a 5-year-old boy Thursday at a New York City hospital. He did not give information about where the two other children died, or provide their ages.\n\nThere is no proof that the virus causes the syndrome. Cuomo said the children had tested positive for COVID-19 or the antibodies but did not show the common symptoms of the virus when they were hospitalized.\n\n\"This is the last thing that we need at this time, with all that is going on, with all the anxiety we have, now for parents to have to worry about whether or not their youngster was infected,\" Cuomo said at his daily briefing.\n\nNew York is helping develop national criteria for identifying and responding to the syndrome at the request of the Centers for Disease Control, Cuomo said.\n\nChildren elsewhere in the U.S. have also been hospitalized with the condition, which was also seen in Europe.\n\nAt least 3,000 U.S. children are diagnosed with Kawasaki disease each year. It is most common in children younger than 6 and in boys.\n\nSymptoms include prolonged fever, severe abdominal pain and trouble breathing.\n\nNew York City transit officials said they're providing buses for homeless people to shelter from unseasonably frigid weather this weekend during newly instituted overnight subway closures.\n\nThe subway system has been shutting down from 1 to 5 a.m. since Wednesday as part of an outbreak-related plan for daily train disinfecting. City outreach workers have been persuading homeless people to leave the system for shelters during the shutdowns.\n\nWith temperatures around the freezing mark and a traces of snow reported in Manhattan's Central Park, transit officials said they also would provide a limited number of buses at end-of-line stations Saturday and Sunday.\n\nThe buses are not for transportation, \"but may serve as a place for individuals to escape the elements in the short term,\" according to a prepared statement from New York City Transit President Sarah Feinberg and Transport Workers Union Local 100 President Tony Utano.\n\n\"We are providing these buses only during this cold snap and expect the city to continue to step up and take responsibility for providing safe shelter for those individuals experiencing homelessness,\" according to the statement.\n\nThe Metropolitan Transportation Authority did not immediately respond to an email Saturday morning asking how many buses were provided and how many people were taking shelter in them.",

    "3 takeaways of AP review of COVID-19 in youth detention": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "Fear and frustration is rising in some juvenile detention centers as the number of youth and staff infected by the coronavirus continues to mount, with riots and escapes reported in facilities in hard hit New York and Louisiana.\n\nBut as more and more state and local officials announce the release of at-risk inmates from the nation's adult jails and prisons, parents, advocates for children's rights and criminal justice experts have been asking one question: Why aren't more youths being sent home when the virus threatens their physical and mental health?\n\nAmerica locks up more people than any other country in the world, with more than 2.2 million people behind bars. The juvenile population has seen a steady decline in the last two decades, in 2017 numbering at around 43,000, and around 70% of those youths are being held for low-level crimes. So compared to adults, finding out which kids can safely be returned home should not be a heavy lift. But it's complicated.\n\nIn the juvenile justice system, not just the crime is taken into account, but factors such as family background and a child's emotional development. Decisions are often not made at the state level, but instead carried out county by county with judges reviewing each juvenile case individually. In some places, children's agencies play a role. The system was created to protect youths. But it can work against them during a crisis.\n\nWHY ARE EXPERTS CALLING FOR RELEASES\n\nOvercrowded and underfunded, America's patchwork of jails and prisons are seen as breeding grounds for the coronavirus, and that poses a threat not just to the incarcerated, but society at large. Guards, administrative staff and contractors working inside facilities can carry the virus back into their communities.\n\nCriminal justice and medical experts say the best way to control the virus's spread is to reduce prison populations. Thousands of adults have already benefited from early releases. Some were being held on technical violations or were let out early because they were especially vulnerable -- the elderly, for instance, and those with preexisting health conditions. Others were being held for technical violations or had just a few months left on their sentences.\n\nKIDS LEFT BEHIND:\n\nTo date, 150 juveniles and 283 staff have tested positive for COVID-19 at facilities nationwide, according to the Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit The Sentencing Project, which has been tallying cases for more than a month. Because so few facilities are carrying out mass testing -- and others are not releasing numbers citing privacy concerns -- the real number is believed to be much higher. And new outbreaks are reported almost daily.\n\nSome kids with coronavirus symptoms are being thrown into isolation for 23 hours a day, in what amounts to solitary confinement. Many have been cut off from programs, counselors and school. Some have not been issued masks, social distancing is nearly impossible and they have been given limited access to phone calls home. In some states, authorities have been shuttling kids between facilities, trying to make sure sick and healthy young people are kept apart.\n\nContact AP's global investigative team at Investigative@ap.org.\n\nContact the reporters on Twitter at twitter.com/robinmcdowell and twitter.com/margiemasonAP",

Kevin Earley, pastor of Metropolitan Church of God in Detroit, began the eulogy, close to 800 people were viewing the services via livestream.\n\nEarley said he performed Skylar's parents' wedding, and that the family attends his church.\n\n\"It doesn't get no harder than this,\" he said. \"I will miss my Skylar. In just five years ... she gave a lifetime of love.\"\n\nSkylar died April 19. At the time, Mayor Mike Duggan called her \"a real daughter of the city of Detroit.\" Skylar's mother, LaVondria Herbert, has been a Detroit police officer for 25 years, and Skylar's father, Ebbie, a firefighter of 18 years.\n\nGov. Gretchen Whitmer paid tribute to the family last week.\n\n\"They've been on the frontline and they've served with honor and integrity,\" Whitmer said. \"They did not deserve to lose their child to this virus. Nobody does.\"\n\nFor most people, the coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough, that clear up in two to three weeks. But it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia, for some people, especially older adults and people with existing health problems.\n\nCoronavirus infections leading to death are unusual among children.\n\nSkylar was African American. Early data by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has shown that 30% of patients who died from the virus whose race was known were black.\n\nHealth conditions that exist at higher rates in the black community -- obesity, diabetes and asthma -- make African Americans more susceptible to the virus, according to health officials. They also are more likely to be uninsured, and often report that medical professionals take their ailments less seriously when they seek treatment.",

        "body": "Jayden Hardowar, 8, of Richmond Hill, Queens, spiked a mild fever sometime around April 23.\n\nA pediatrician told Jayden's parents not to worry and to continue taking children's Tylenol, his father, Roup Hardowar, told ABC News on Thursday.\n\nIn three days, his fever went away, but he began feeling weak. Soon, he lost his appetite, and his pediatrician suggested Jayden drink Pedialyte over a video-conferencing call.\n\nRoup said the family wasn't worried about coronavirus because they were following stay-at-home orders.\n\n\"He was doing fairly OK at home,\" Roup said. \"We were confident. We weren't concerned, because we know that we've been practicing social distancing as a family.\"\n\nBut on April 29, while watching Pokemon on TV, Jayden called out for his mother and threw his hands up, struggling for air before going into cardiac arrest.\n\nHis 15-year-old brother, a Boy Scout, did chest compressions until the ambulance got there.\n\n\"He saved his brother's life,\" Roup said. \"We managed to get some sort of breathing back.\"\n\nJayden received an electric shock after first responders found an irregular heartbeat. At Cohen's Children's Hospital in New Hyde Park, he was put on a ventilator in the intensive care unit for three days before the staff saw improvement.\n\nHe is one of at least 64 children in New York State to come down with what health officials are calling pediatric multi-system inflammatory syndrome associated with COVID-19, or \"shock syndrome.\"\n\nDoctors in the U.K. first warned of the mysterious illness linked to exposure to COVID-19 in April. Cities across the country are reporting cases of the rare illness, from Boston to Washington, D.C., to Los Angeles.\n\nAn advisory issued Monday by the New York Department of Health names fever, inflammation and single- or multi-organ dysfunction among some of the symptoms of the syndrome. PIMS, the health advisory says, can feature symptoms that \"overlap with Kawasaki Disease and Toxic Shock Syndrome.\"\n\nChildren's Hospital in Los Angeles reported three cases of PIMS, saying Thursday in a statement, \"These patients tested positive for antibodies against SARS-Cov-2 virus (which causes COVID-19) but tested negative for the virus by RT-PCR,\" suggesting the inflammation is a \"late response to a recent past infection with SARS-Cov-2.\"\n\nDr. James Schneider, the chief of pediatric critical care medicine at Cohen's Children's Medical Center, said this previous infection causes the immune system in these cases to get hyperactive.\n\n\"That overactive immune system leads to this whole systemic inflammation that leads to the cardiovascular system being compromised,\" Schneider said.\n\nHe added, \"There's a standard treatment for Kawasaki that we've known for many years now and is very effective. And so we're treating these children with that therapy.\"\n\nJayden, too, tested negative for the virus, but positive for COVID-19 antibodies, suggesting he had been previously infected weeks or even months ago.\n\nToday, Jayden is alert, but struggling to speak. For the first time since his hospitalization, he's allowed one visitor, which Roup said will be his mother.\n\n\"I'm so glad she gets to see him,\" Roup said.\n\nHe hopes his son will be home by the weekend or early next week.\n\n\"That's our hope right now,\" he said. \"The doctor sort of alluded to that as an option. So we're looking for that.\" But for now, they're taking it one step at a time.\n\nOn Thursday morning, Jayden started eating again on his own -- beginning with a bowl of cereal.",

    "9 ways coronavirus changed treating patients": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "The precipitous climb of COVID-19 has led to substantial changes in both the art and the science of medicine. Amid a global pandemic, doctors and nurses are learning how to practice medicine differently -- adjusting the way they use resources, perform procedures, interact with patients and families, utilize technology, and work with public health and scientific communities for a common mission.\n\nAccording to doctors interviewed by ABC, the pandemic has changed the practice of medicine in nine fundamental ways:\n\n1. Increased information sharing\n\nFor perhaps the first time, everyone is focused on the same issue, collecting and sharing information at breakneck speed.\n\nSince it was first shared publicly, the Johns Hopkins University COVID-19 dashboard built by Professor Lauren Gardner, a civil and systems engineering professor and her graduate student, Ensheng Dong, grew from about 200 million visits in late January to 1.2 billion daily requests in early March.\n\nSuch information sharing has helped build models, improved our understanding of the case definition for COVID-19, and shows where the curve of the pandemic is going.\n\nInformation sharing has also helped doctors treating patients from far reaches of the world communicate with one another as they test potential treatments and vaccines.\n\n2. Increased promotion of public safety\n\nCOVID-19 fundamentally changed how many people view health. No longer just one patient at a time, any hope for bending the curve must rely on everyone.\n\nThose with potential exposure are selflessly staying home for weeks despite potential financial pressure, insurance concerns and other stressors that may otherwise motivate them to go back out.\n\nUnified efforts by health officials, politicians, and even Hollywood elite have shifted towards spreading tips and awareness of COVID-19 for the masses. Seemingly overnight, a new appreciation for #healthheroes sprung into the hearts of everyone while they did their part to #stayathome.\n\nInternally, hospitals have tried to minimize medical procedures that may pose a greater threat of spreading the virus, and use more protection than was typical for these procedures prior to COVID-19.\n\n4. Wearing PPE\n\nN95 respirators, previously reserved for concerns of airborne spread, now serve as a common form of armor for the front line. In fact, adequate personal protective equipment (PPE) inclusive of N95 masks has been one of the most important ways to protect the front line.\n\nThe environment of protection has changed as well. Nearly every person walking into a health care facility is asked to wear a face cover. People sit and stand spaced apart, wait in cars until their turn, get drive-thru testing, and even seek care in pop-up tents and ships.\n\n5. Reducing patient contact\n\nA major change is with the act of touch. Dr. Jayson R. Baman, resident physician at Northwestern University said that although the \"ritual of medical practice has not changed ... in a sense, we now practice medicine from afar.\" The number of people entering the room of a patient with COVID-19 is often limited to ensure safety. Some hospitals are even placing video monitors and tablets in rooms so patients can communicate with their families and their doctors without anyone entering.\n\nUnfortunately, the inability to be in the room can be a heartbreaking sacrifice when it is time to say goodbye. Barman said that sometimes \"their last contact with their loved one is through the glass door.\"\n\n6. Remote access and care\n\nThe federal government expanded access to telemedicine and practices everywhere have incorporated the technology when feasible. Dr. Steve Ommen, cardiologist and medical director for Mayo Clinic's Center for Connected Care highlighted that the \"utility of remote care will be realized as a silver lining from this pandemic.\" he says\n\n\"Patients are able to get care without exposing themselves,\" he said.\n\n\"We have increased video visits by 18,000% in a month,\" said Ommen.\n\nBeyond tele-visits, patients are now using symptom trackers, wearable devices and apps. Ommen said they have sent video devices to high-risk areas like skilled nursing care facilities, \"so providers can do remote consultations ... rapidly evaluate while protecting themselves.\"\n\n7. More proactive follow-up with families\n\nIn the past, families were typically at the bedside or called for important updates. Now, Dr. Baman notes, \"the responsibility has shifted to a daily -- if not more frequent -- practice... even for the most mundane events.\" Dr. Baman notes some hospitals have even extended the use of palliative and spiritual care teams to call patients' next of kin one day and one week after a patient's passing to see how family members are coping.\n\n8. Improved adaptability\n\nFaced with an unprecedented crisis, hospitals have rapidly adapted to restructuring workforces and increasing surge capacity. While the most obvious examples are setting up medical tents and converting other spaces into areas capable of intensive care, staffing restructuring is also apparent.\n\n\"We learned to build pyramids with experienced individuals on top and pulling individuals from multiple backgrounds, often working outside their field of practice to scale up care in response to the crisis. In doing so, we've developed the capacity to flex in a way we have never tested before,\" said Dr. Michael Grosso, chief medical officer at Huntington Hospital in Northwell Health in New York.\n\n9. Unprecedented innovation\n\nNational changes in policies have helped hospitals better manage these patients. However, with the looming public health threat and need for rapid adoption and innovation, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), has reviewed 19 therapeutic options and authorized more than 40 tests .\n\n\"Every kind of innovation we see here will likely persist into the indefinite future. This notion that necessity is the mother of invention is true,\" Grosso said.",

    "A look at what's ahead for virus-stricken aircraft carrier": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "WASHINGTON -- While the fate of its former captain remains unclear, the crew of the USS Theodore Roosevelt, sidelined in Guam with a coronavirus outbreak, is inching toward getting healthy and returning to sea duty.\n\nThe top Navy officer has recommended reinstating Capt. Brett Crozier, who was fired by the then-acting Navy secretary, but Defense Secretary Mark Esper wants more time to review the matter. When Esper would make a decision or whether the White House might get involved remains unclear.\n\nMeanwhile, most Roosevelt sailors are wrapping up weeks of quarantine as the ship prepares for its journey back to sea.\n\nA look at what's happening with the Roosevelt and what lies ahead:\n\nA RECAP\n\nCrozier was fired April 2 after sending an email to several naval officers warning about the growing virus outbreak on his ship and asking permission to isolate most of his crew on shore.\n\nActing Navy Secretary Thomas Modly said Crozier \"demonstrated extremely poor judgment\" and fired him. Modly then flew out to the ship, and in remarks to the crew, condemned Crozier, saying the captain may have been too naive or stupid to command the ship. Modly later apologized and resigned.\n\nAdm. Mike Gilday, the chief of naval operations, met with Esper on Friday, laying out the results of a Navy investigation and his recommendation that Crozier return to the ship as captain.\n\nTHE CAPTAIN\n\nThe return of the popular Crozier would boost the crew's morale. It also would be a high-profile condemnation of Modly's judgment. He was a political appointee of President Donald Trump, but was never nominated to become the permanent secretary.\n\nTrump has both criticized and empathized with Crozier, saying he never should have written the emailed letter but that his career should not be destroyed for having \"one bad day.\"\n\nCrozier, 50, is a 1992 graduate of the U.S. Naval Academy. He had been reported to have the virus but is thought to be recovering on Guam. His interim replacement, Capt. Carlos Sardiello, had previously commanded the Roosevelt but could head to a new assignment if Crozier returns.\n\nThe actions and judgment of Crozier are not the only issues Navy leaders have examined.\n\nA preliminary inquiry conducted by the No. 2 Navy officer, Adm. Robert Burke, also considered a wider sequence of events that took place before the outbreak on the ship, including its visit to a Vietnamese port. It's unclear whether the virus was picked up there or by other means such as air crews that operated off the carrier during its deployment. The Navy has said the decision to make the port visit was by Adm. Phil Davidson, head of the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command.\n\nIN QUARANTINE\n\nMore than 4,000 Roosevelt crew members have been moved ashore and are going through quarantine.\n\nThey've been prohibited from posting details about their confinement, but some sailors and their family members have talked freely about their quarantine in gyms, hotel rooms and other facilities around the island.\n\nSailors testing positive were put in gyms lined with cots, and they are checked by medical staff twice a day. Others are in hotel rooms set aside for the Navy, and public access is restricted. Internet access in some places can be spotty, and food was limited early on but has improved. Sailors read, watch movies and can walk around outside, as long as they stay within quarantine zones. Crew members communicate on a private Facebook page.\n\nGETTING THE CREW HEALTHY\n\nAs of Monday, 955 crew members have the virus, one sailor is hospitalized and 14 have recovered.\n\nSailors must have two successive negative tests before they are considered virus-free. Only then could they begin moving back to the ship.\n\nCrew on the Roosevelt have been cleaning the ship, space by space, and then cordoning off clear areas. No sailors have yet returned to the ship. They'll eventually come back in large waves, go to clean sections and take over running the ship. Those who have remained on the Roosevelt to keep it secure and monitor its nuclear reactor will then go ashore for quarantine.\n\nWhen the ship is deemed virus free, it can then head back to sea.\n\nGETTING UNDERWAY\n\nU.S. officials won't say how long it will take for the ship to return to duty, but it has been docked in Guam for about a month, and could be there another three to four weeks. In order to get back to sea, the ship will have to go through a regimented recertification process.\n\nThe flight deck -- from the pilots to the crews and the system operators -- has to be recertified. Pilots will have to log flight hours and conduct a certain number of take-offs and landings from the carrier. Crews on the flight deck who direct the air traffic and those who operate the sensors and radars have to ensure everything runs right. Those checks could take several days.\n\nThe biggest question is where will the Roosevelt go. Originally it was slated to be at sea for months, then participate in a large Pacific naval exercise before heading home to San Diego.\n\nNow Navy leaders have to decide whether to just send the beleaguered crew home or keep it out for a bit. The USS Ronald Reagan carrier strike group based in Japan could get underway in coming weeks, as could the USS Nimitz, based in Bremerton, Washington.\n\nThe Nimitz pulled out for routine predeployment exercises Monday and likely will be out training for about a month.\n\nAND THEN THERE'S THE USS KIDD\n\nAs the Navy struggles to get one virus outbreak under control, another is bubbling up.\n\nAs of Monday, 47 sailors on the USS Kidd have tested positive. Two were evacuated to the U.S. and another 15 with symptoms were transferred to another ship for monitoring. The Kidd, a naval destroyer that had been doing counter-drug operations off South America, is heading to port in San Diego.\n\nThe ship has a crew of about 350, and about 45 percent have been tested for the virus so far.\n\nAssociated Press writer James LaPorta contributed to this report.",

    "A tale of two outbreaks: Singapore tackles a costly setback": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia -- Weeks after two of his roommates were diagnosed with COVID-19, Mohamad Arif Hassan says he's still waiting to be tested for the coronavirus. Quarantined in his room in a sprawling foreign workers' dormitory that has emerged as Singapore's biggest viral cluster, Arif says he isn't too worried because neither he nor his eight other roommates have any symptoms.\n\nStill, the 28-year-old Bangladeshi construction worker couldn't be blamed if he were more than just a bit concerned.\n\nInfections in Singapore, an affluent Southeast Asian city-state of fewer than 6 million people, have jumped more than a hundredfold in two months -- from 226 in mid-March to more than 23,000, the most in Asia after China, India and Pakistan. Only 20 of the infections have resulted in deaths.\n\nAbout 90% of Singapore's cases are linked to crowded foreign workers' dormitories that were a blind spot in the government's crisis management. Arif's dorm complex, which has 14,000 beds, accounts for 11% of total infections, with over 2,500 cases.\n\nThis massive second wave of infections caught Singapore off guard and exposed the danger of overlooking marginalized groups during a health crisis. Despite warnings from human rights activists as early as February about the dorms' crowded and often unsanitary living conditions, no action was taken until cases spread rampantly last month.\n\nSingapore's costly oversight was also an important lesson to other countries in the region with large migrant populations. Neighboring Malaysia recently announced mandatory coronavirus testing for its more than 2 million foreign workers after dozens were diagnosed with COVID -- 19.\n\nThe slip-up highlighted Singapore's treatment of its large population of low-wage foreign workers, who play an integral part in the economy but live on the fringes in conditions where social distancing is impossible. The misjudgment was also an embarrassment for Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong's government ahead of a general election anticipated in the next few months that is expected to be the last for Lee, who has led Singapore since 2004 and is planning to retire soon.\n\nSingapore's nanny state government, which won global praise for its meticulous contact tracing and testing in the early stages of the crisis, quickly moved to contain the problem by treating the flare-up in the dorms as a separate outbreak from that in the local community, a policy that some say is discriminatory.\n\nThe government shut schools and nonessential businesses island-wide on April 7. So-called \"safe distancing ambassadors\" were recruited to remind people to wear masks and stay at least a meter apart from each other in public places, or face heavy penalties.\n\nMeanwhile, all construction sites and dorms were locked down and foreign workers largely confined in their rooms. More than 10,000 foreign workers in essential services were moved to safer sites to reduce crowding, and testing was ramped up to include people with no symptoms.\n\nIn Arif's S11 Punggol dorm -- advertised as the cheapest in Singapore -- police have mounted a 24-hour patrol of the 13 multicolored housing blocks located in the island's northeast.\n\nArif, who was sharing a room with 11 other workers, said one of them was moved to an army camp in early April to help ease overcrowding. Shortly afterward, another roommate was hospitalized with a fever, and on April 17 another was isolated with light symptoms, with both testing positive for the coronavirus.\n\nArif said he hasn't been tested yet because thousands of residents of his dorm will probably have to be tested. But he said he was comforted by Singapore's top-notch medical facilities and its relatively low number of deaths from the virus.\n\nHe gets food delivered to his room, free Wi-Fi on his cellphone and, most importantly, he said the government has pledged that the workers' salaries will be paid.\n\n\"I am not worried because the government is taking good care of us like Singaporeans,\" said Arif, who has lived in Singapore for seven years. \"Right now, we take our temperature twice a day, try to stay a meter apart from each other and constantly use hand sanitizer.\"\n\nOnce belittled as a tiny red dot on the global map, Singapore has relied on overseas workers to build infrastructure and help power its growth into one of the world's wealthiest nations.\n\nSome 1.4 million foreign workers live in the city-state, accounting for 38% of its workforce. At least two thirds are low-wage, transient migrants from across Asia performing blue-collar jobs that locals shun, such as construction, shipping and maintenance, as well as working as maids.\n\nRoughly 250,000 of the migrants live in 43 privately run dormitories mostly tucked away in the outskirts far from Singapore's stunning skyscrapers and luxury malls. Workers sleep in bunk beds in rooms usually packed with 12 people, sometimes up to 20, with a required minimum living space of 4.5 square meters (48 square feet) per person.\n\nAnother 120,000 migrant laborers live in factory-converted hostels or temporary facilities at work sites, where conditions are sometimes even more dismal.\n\nMost of Singapore's migrants earn between 500 and 1,000 Singapore dollars ($354-$708) a month.\n\nSince last month, the government's infection data has separated foreign workers' cases from those among the general population. Although cases continue to rise among foreign workers, infections have decreased in the local community. The government plans to gradually reopen the economy on Tuesday before island-wide restrictions end June 1, eager to show that it has remedied the situation and that measures have worked.\n\n\"The larger narrative that cannot be missed is the tale of two outbreaks in Singapore,\" said Eugene Tan, law professor at Singapore Management University. \"The outbreak that Singaporeans should pay attention to is the local community. The other outbreak of foreign workers is getting its due attention from the government, but it should not be one that Singaporeans should be unduly concerned about.\"",

    "AP Exclusive: Chicago morgue coping despite surge in deaths": {

        "body": "CHICAGO -- The Chicago area's chief medical examiner starts her day with a numbers problem: how to manage three times the number of deaths as before the coronavirus pandemic with the same number of pathologists.\n\nOn a recent morning when The Associated Press got exclusive access to the Cook County Medical Examiner's Office for the day, Dr. Ponni Arunkumar scanned a list of 62 new death cases. The average last year was 20 a day.\n\n\"We've never gone through anything like this,\" she said of the workloads.\n\nForty of the 62 cases were coronavirus deaths. The oldest to die was a 105-year-old whose obituary described her as a White Sox fan who loved dancing. The youngest was a 53-year-old man who was jailed for allegedly blinding someone in one eye during a barroom brawl.\n\nMedical examiners worldwide face similar challenges, and some are buckling under the emotional strain. But there was no sign of that at the Cook County facility, where employees seemed to be coping well with the historic surge in deaths. The pandemic has only deepened their sense of camaraderie, said the office's director of fatality management, who oversees a temporary morgue set up off-site to handle the influx of corpses.\n\n\"We lean on each other,\" Victoria Raspante said.\n\nThe 45-year-old Arunkumar has an air of calm about her. Soft-spoken and quick to smile, she has a knack for keeping those she supervises at ease.\n\nAccording to figures updated Tuesday, her office has handled 5,323 cases already this year, 2,551 of them COVID-19 deaths since the first confirmed coronavirus death in mid-March. It had 6,254 deaths for all of 2019. Her 18 pathologists have sometimes worked 12-hour days, seven days a week.\n\nThe hope was that stay-at-home orders would sharply reduce gun deaths in Chicago, which has had more homicides than Los Angeles and New York combined for successive years. A drop-off in killings would help keep caseloads at more manageable levels.\n\nThat hasn't happened.\n\nThe office has had 111 homicide cases since mid-March when the pandemic began in the county compared to 113 over the same period last year. One of the 22 non-COVID cases this day is a 21-year-old man who was killed in a drive-by shooting as he sat on a porch.\n\nAt 8:30 a.m., Arunkumar and six fellow pathologists began autopsies on shooting victims and others whose cause of death wasn't clear.\n\nShe pointed to a bullet hole in the shoulder of the man who was killed in the drive-by, his bloody clothes nearby. Another pathologist retrieved the bullet through the wound.\n\nBetween autopsies, Arunkumar walked into the facility's main morgue, where around 250 bodies lined rows of floor-to-ceiling shelving. It was filled to capacity.\n\nDownstairs, Rebeca Perrone stacked 24 boxes of unclaimed cremated remains on shelves that already had 500 others. Some of those cremated were homeless. Others lived alone, estranged from their families.\n\nMore remains are going unclaimed these days -- a sign that more families can't afford the $250 collection fee because of the economic turmoil caused by the pandemic, said Perrone, who arranges funerals for the unclaimed dead and helps poorer families find resources for burials.\n\nPerrone refused to complain about her heavier workloads. Her job sometimes includes informing relatives that a loved-one has died.\n\n\"It's actually nice to be able to talk to someone on the worst day of their life and say, 'This is what we can do to help,'\" she said.\n\nOn the second floor, investigative-unit chief Christopher Kalka said his 27 investigators were also putting in long hours. People who witness suspicious deaths are now asked whether the deceased complained of losing their sense of smell or taste, which are possible symptoms of COVID-19.\n\nAll homicides require an autopsy. Most COVID-19 deaths don't, as a hospital records review is considered sufficient.\n\nNot all COVID-19 cases are clear cut. Pathologists concluded in one man's death that the virus didn't directly kill him, but that it affected his balance. He then fell and broke his hip, causing fatal complications.\n\nDoing fewer autopsies in COVID-19 cases reduces staff exposure to the virus. Risk of infection from the dead is low since it is often transmitted via spray from a sneeze or cough. No one who works at the office has tested positive.\n\nStaff didn't conduct an autopsy on the inmate who was allegedly involved in the barroom brawl. They gave his body a swab test like the ones given to the living to confirm the presence of the virus, though they did it in a room with reduced air pressure so that viruses can't seep out.\n\nHis body was wheeled into a smaller refrigerated unit for coronavirus deaths, an orange biohazard tag affixed to his body bag.\n\nAt an afternoon conference call to talk through the day's cases, Arunkumar sat alone with other pathologists phoning in. Pathologists mostly review records from home these days to reduce the risk of spreading the virus at the office.\n\nOne said she had more than 80 cases to review, including many COVID-19 cases.\n\n\"This is absurd,\" she said without anger.\n\nUpgrades at the office in recent years have helped avert crippling backlogs during the pandemic. Changes included putting records online. That's enabled staff to work from home and clear cases faster.\n\nA key to operations now is a perishable-goods warehouse that was converted to a temporary morgue. National Guard troops unloaded bodies on the day the AP visited. Medical examiner's office staffers measured and photographed the bodies at the loading dock before soldiers took the body bags to one of three rooms the combined size of a football field. They laid them gently on specially constructed scaffolding.\n\nOne room held 130 bodies, but the site can hold up to 2,000. Two of the three rooms were mostly empty -- an encouraging sign amid the grimness.\n\nRaspante worked seven-day weeks for several weeks at the makeshift morgue before recently getting days off. When her kids ask about her job, she doesn't tell them she's among the dead all day, every day.\n\n\"I tell them that I help hospitals learn why people get sick,\" she said.\n\nDeath is in the job description, but that doesn't mean those who work at the medical examiner's office are unmoved by the surge in dead, Arunkumar said. They cope by checking on each other more. Staff also adhere to a strict rule: Treat the dead with the respect they'd want extended to their own loved-ones.\n\nDoing that \"makes it easier to handle what we are doing,\" she said.\n\nAssociated Press writer Don Babwin and video journalist Noreen Nasir contributed to this report.",

    "AP Explains: India lockdown slows virus, but gaps remain": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "NEW DELHI -- India's six-week coronavirus lockdown, which was supposed to end on Monday, has been extended for another two weeks, with a few relaxations such as construction resuming and self-employed people returning to work in New Delhi.\n\nHere's a look at what India has been able to achieve during the lockdown of its 1.3 billion people, and what it hasn't:\n\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi locked India down on March 24, when the country had just 469 confirmed virus cases.\n\nIn mid-April, Modi extended the lockdown for two weeks. Then on Friday, it was extended for two more weeks, but with some relaxations.\n\nThe government has identified three zones: \"red,\" or areas that have been coronavirus hotspots, \"orange,\" where some cases have been found, and \"green,\" or low-risk areas. Stricter measures will continue in red and orange zones, while some movement of people and most economic activities will be allowed in green zones.\n\nAlthough the number of red zones has dipped since the lockdown started, the number of green zones has also declined. Most of India's major cities, including New Delhi and Mumbai, remain red zones.\n\nLocking down the country's 1.3 billion people has cost of millions of jobs and upended lives, especially of India's poor.\n\nBut limited interactions between people did slow the contagion, pushing the peak into the future and buying India \"time to prepare,\" said Ramanan Laxminarayan, an epidemiologist and economist who directs the Center for Disease Dynamics, Economics & Policy in Washington, D.C.\n\nIndia has avoided a major catastrophe, confirming about 42,500 virus cases, 11,706 recoveries and 1,373 deaths. Still, a lack of aggressive testing worries experts who warn that the virus has yet to peak.\n\nIndia has designated more than 600 hospitals for COVID-19 patients only, comprising about 100,000 isolation beds and around 12,000 intensive care unit beds. It also has trained more than a million doctors and 1.7 million nurses to treat patients, according to government data.\n\nAuthorities have tried to ensure that only those who are very sick with the virus go to the designated hospitals. But this separation, aimed at preventing viral outbreaks in hospitals, hasn't always been successful.\n\nIt wasn't until Friday that the government said it would provide all health workers with personal protective equipment, or PPE. But several non-COVID-19 hospitals in large cities like Mumbai and New Delhi have already reported outbreaks. Experts suspect the outbreaks were caused by patients who were unaware they had the virus.\n\nCombined with the government's reluctance to acknowledge that India had reached the stage of community transmission, this left the health care system unprotected, said Dr. T. Sundararaman, a community medicine expert.\n\n\"Even if a patient comes in with a fever, it will not be assumed to be COVID-19,\" he said. \"Unless it's too late.\"\n\nFaced with an unprecedented global demand for the same medical supplies, India has upped its capacity to manufacture ventilators, oxygen cylinders and PPE has risen.\n\nIndia is now building up a stockpile of 80,000 ventilators that it hopes will cover the 75,000 patients it expects will need them in the coming weeks, said PD Vaghela, secretary of the government's pharmaceuticals department.\n\nVaghela said India had almost no domestic manufacturing of PPE before the pandemic.\n\n\"Now we have 111 indigenous manufacturers,\" he said, adding that these domestic companies are expected to provide 70% of the 20 million pieces of PPE needed.\n\nIndia's testing criteria remain restricted outside of hotspots, where those with minor symptoms, like a runny nose or cough, aren't being tested. But it has increased testing, with 70,000 samples tested daily.\n\nStill, India \"needs to be scaling up for a lot more,\" said Dr. Ashish Jha, the director of Harvard's Global Health Institute. He pointed out that while the lockdown had stopped the virus from spreading as quickly as it has in some countries, that doesn't mean that it won't spread faster when restrictions are lifted.\n\nIndia's low testing rate is at least partly due to the unavailability of testing kits. After claiming that the rapid antibody tests it got from China were faulty, India awaited the arrival of 2.1 million standard testing kits, mostly from international companies. Officials said the country will need 3.5 million kits.\n\nIndia's health ministry has denied that it is under-testing. But Jha warned that India can't afford to test in areas only after outbreaks are discovered.\n\n\"If they could freeze the world in time and not ever unlock and stay locked down forever, then no, you'll not need to scale up testing anymore,\" he said. \"But obviously that's not possible.\"",

        "body": "RIO DE JANEIRO -- From the Amazon city of Manaus to the seemingly endless urban sprawl of Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, freshly dug graves have been filling up quickly for weeks with the bodies of Brazilians killed by COVID-19.\n\nDeaths from the coronavirus hit some cities so hard starting last month that officials were unprepared for the crush of bodies even though regional governments imposed measures aimed at halting the spread of the virus.\n\nMeanwhile, President Jair Bolsonaro railed against business shutdowns as more harmful than the virus itself -- and the country's first lockdown was not ordered until this week, when there were already more than 7,000 deaths.\n\nAs the toll rose, Associated Press photographers and videojournalists fanned out across Latin America's largest and most populous country to capture the agony experienced by regular Brazilians -- at cemeteries, at hospitals and at a prison with rioting inmates, as well as at religious ceremonies and inside the homes of grieving relatives.\n\nThey spent days traversing the narrow alleys of Brazil's teeming slums, or favelas, where more than 11 million of the country's 211 million people live in cramped conditions that experts fear could be decimated by virus outbreaks.\n\nIn one Rio favela, 31-year-old manicurist Leticia Machado and her husband, who does odd jobs, haven't had work since business restrictions were imposed in the city. They're relying on food donations from neighbors and a nearby cultural center to feed their seven children.\n\nThe city's hospitals are close to capacity and health workers complain that they don't have enough essential drugs to treat patients. Some workers had to buy their own protective gear at the public hospital where Taina dos Santos' 56-year-old mother worked as a nursing assistant -- until she died of the coronavirus late last month.\n\nAs gravediggers outfitted in white hooded suits stood holding their shovels at a hillside cemetery, dos Santos said goodbye to her mother's casket.\n\n\"She gave everything to her job until the very end,\" dos Santos said.\n\nIn Sao Paulo, an AP photographer captured an image a month ago of hundreds of newly dug grave sites that Bolsonaro called \"fake news\" and \"sensationalism.\" When the photographer visited again last week, the graves were filled along with dozens of new ones.\n\nBolsonaro, who has repeatedly called COVID-19 \"a little flu\" and refuses to wear a mask at his public events, has been criticized by protesters who lean from their apartment windows to bang pots and pans. He was pictured on graffiti on a Rio wall wearing a mask with the word \"coward\" on it, covering his eyes.\n\nBolsonaro's take on the coronavirus angers Valter Azevedo Bonfim, whose mother died at a Rio hospital after he took her there suffering from what he believed were virus symptoms.\n\n\"Look how many hearses are leaving, and that guy is saying that it's a little flu!\" he said outside the hospital. \"He goes and speaks on TV, telling people to go to the streets. How can we go to the streets? My mother went to the street and I buried her!\"\n\nIn Manaus, a city of 2.2 million in the vast Amazon region, the death surge was so extreme that trenches for common graves were dug in one cemetery and caskets were piled atop each other. Some who wanted burials for loved ones opted for cremation instead.\n\nIn a poor working-class Manaus neighborhood, 86-year-old Raimundo Costa do Nascimento died at his home surrounded by family members and was pictured with eight of them as he lay dead in bed.\n\nThey had to wait 10 hours for his body to be retrieved.\n\nAssociated Press video producer Diarlei Rodrigues reported this story in Rio de Janeiro and AP writer Alan Clendenning reported from Phoenix. AP videojournalists Mario Lob\u00e3o and Yesica Fisch and photographer Leo Correa in Rio de Janeiro contributed to this report.",

        "body": "Ramadan is usually a time of togetherness, with Muslims filling mosques for hours of prayer and sharing large, lavish meals with friends and neighbors after days of dawn-to-dusk fasting.\n\nBut as Associated Press images show, the coronavirus has forced Muslims around the world -- from Indonesia, India and Gaza City to Seattle and South Africa -- to alter the way in which they are marking the holiest month on the Islamic calendar.\n\nThis year, many are confined to their homes, travel is heavily restricted and public venues including parks, malls and even mosques are shuttered.\n\nAhmad Kamel, his wife, Nadia Chaouch, and their 2-year-old son Yusuf are staying at home in Seattle. An AP photographer recently captured them in front of a computer in their living room watching the nightly Taraweeh prayer livestreamed from a nearly empty mosque. If it weren't for COVID-19, they would be at the mosque, then sharing festive, fast-ending meals with friends and neighbors.\n\nOutside the Imam Ahmed Raza Jaame Masjid mosque in Springs, southwest of Johannesburg, three women waiting to receive Ramadan candies recently sat in socially distanced chairs, the correct spacing marked by painted white lines. South Africa is under a strict five-week lockdown in an effort to fight the pandemic.\n\nIn New Delhi, a small, solitary group of Muslims could be seen quietly breaking the fast inside the Jama Masjid, one of India's largest mosques that in a non-pandemic year would be packed with thousands of devotees.\n\nMen wearing masks practiced social distancing during prayer at the Tahara Mosque in Marseille, France, last week, while a solitary man fired a vintage cannon from behind a stone wall on a hill in Sarajevo, Bosnia, to signal the breaking of the fast shortly after sunset.\n\nMuslim-majority countries began imposing widespread restrictions in mid-March, with many canceling Friday prayers and shuttering holy sites. Saudi Arabia has largely locked down Mecca and Medina and halted the year-round umrah pilgrimage.\n\nIn Indonesia, the world's most populous Muslim nation, the capital of Jakarta suspended passenger flights and rail services and private cars have been banned from leaving the city.\n\nBut while many are weighed down by anxiety about the pandemic, others have decided to cast those fears aside in favor of honoring religious traditions.\n\nIn Indonesia's deeply conservative Aceh province, which is governed by Islamic law under an autonomy agreement, many mosques were packed on Friday after the top clerical body ruled that prayers could continue.\n\nOne AP image showed hundreds of men, a few with masks but most without, standing shoulder to shoulder at a mosque in the province, despite warnings from global health officials to avoid large gatherings that could spur a rapid spread of COVID-19.\n\nThe virus causes mild to moderate symptoms in most people, who recover within a few weeks. But it is highly contagious and can cause severe illness or death, particularly in older patients or those with underlying health problems.",

    "AP PHOTOS: Spanish ambulance workers fear virus rebound": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "MADRID -- For the first time in weeks, Dr. M\u00f3nica Rodr\u00edguez has found some respite. But even as she enjoys card games and magic tricks at her ambulance team's base in Madrid, the emergency doctor is not letting her guard down.\n\nHer team is only catching its breath before the next urgent call comes in, whether coronavirus-related or not.\n\n\"The virus is out there and will remain. It's not going to disappear,\" Dr. Rodr\u00edguez said during an AP photographer's recent visit with the team.\n\nAfter helping to flatten one of Europe's sharpest contagion curves in the coronavirus pandemic, exhausted ambulance workers in Madrid fear that a resurgence in infections could mean another frantic period on the front line.\n\n\"We fear a rebound,\" Dr. Rodr\u00edguez said as Spain takes its first steps to phase out a strict 7-week confinement after roughly 27,000 reported coronavirus fatalities. \"Unfortunately, people are not taking enough precautions because they are not aware or they don't have a real vision of what's going on.\"\n\nDrawing from lessons learned when Spain had to repatriate two citizens infected with Ebola in 2014, Dr. Rodr\u00edguez's team was specially trained to deal with epidemics. What they didn't expect was to put those skills into practice in a pandemic that would stretch to the limit the Spanish capital's health resources.\n\nIn the second half of March, when the full force of COVID-19 hit Spain, the SUMMA 112 service's ambulances ferried more than 8,000 patients with COVID-19 symptoms to and between hospitals. Daily calls to the emergency hotline sometimes arrived at three times or more the normal level.\n\nThe service employs more than 2,000 people, many working part-time at hospitals or health centers. In a country where medical workers have suffered high rates of infection, 210 of them have contracted the virus.\n\nThe shift begins with a cardiopulmonary resuscitation, a routine one for the team. But all deployments these days involve extra precautions, with protective equipment and meticulous disinfection before and after.\n\nResponding to an urgent call, the ambulance then makes its way from working-class neighborhood to upscale Madrid in a matter of minutes, taking to hospital an elderly woman with advanced Alzheimer's disease who has lost consciousness.\n\nOnly a few weeks ago, when Madrid's medical facilities were overwhelmed by COVID-19 patients, she wouldn't had been admitted, said Dr. Rodr\u00edguez. She remembered those difficult decisions as \"war-time medicine.\"\n\n\"There weren't enough resources for everybody,\" she says. \"You had to apply triaging, taking one patient to hospital but not another one, leaving them at home.\"\n\nThe doctor said now that the pressures are waning, those experiences are taking an emotional toll on all emergency workers. They have increasing difficulty sleeping, anxiety and \"overall sadness.\"\n\nAt 8 p.m., when Spaniards come out to their windows and balconies to honor medical workers, one team member discreetly takes a moment alone and returns with red eyes.\n\nBut there is little time to calm those nerves. Soon there is another call. A middle-aged man has tried to kill himself, the team is told. Speeding through empty streets and red lights, the ambulance arrives on the heels of police vehicles, with sirens wailing.\n\nThe four members of the team rush in so quickly that two of them find no time to put on protective suits. That doesn't stop them with the resuscitation. The doctor is then told that the patient had recovered from COVID-19.\n\nOnce stabilized, the last patient of their shift is taken to hospital. Showing a mix of euphoria, adrenaline and exhaustion, the team heads home, satisfied because, at least today, there were no fatalities.\n\n-- --\n\nAP writer Aritz Parra contributed to this report.\n\nFollow AP pandemic coverage at http://apnews.com/VirusOutbreak and https://apnews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak",

    "AP: Most states fall short of coronavirus testing thresholds": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "ATLANTA -- As more states begin to relax their coronavirus lockdowns, most are falling short of the minimum levels of testing suggested by the federal government and recommended by a variety of public health researchers, an Associated Press analysis has found.\n\nThree months into an unprecedented public health emergency, the White House has largely resisted calls for a coordinated plan to conduct the millions of tests experts say are needed to contain the virus. What federal officials outlined recently isn't even an official benchmark, and AP's analysis found that a majority of states are not yet meeting it.\n\nWith no specific guidelines, states are left to figure out what a successful testing program should be while they simultaneously try to reopen their shattered economies. If states don't have robust testing, public health experts say they will be unable to detect outbreaks quickly enough to contain them, which could lead to more shutdowns.\n\n\"It's dangerous and irresponsible,\" said Lawrence Gostin, a public health specialist at Georgetown University.\n\nIn many states, testing has been limited to hospitalized patients, high-risk individuals and front-line workers. But most public health experts agree that containing the virus will require a massive expansion of testing that eventually includes millions of patients without symptoms, which is not happening now.\n\nA testing blueprint released Monday by the Trump administration lacked any metrics state officials could use to make informed decisions. Instead, the document made clear that states are responsible for testing, saying the federal government is the \"supplier of last resort.\"\n\nThe closest the White House has come to issuing a benchmark does not actually appear in the document. At a recent briefing, senior administration officials said the government would provide each state with enough tests, swabs and related materials to screen at least 2.6% of their populations in May and June. Those hit harder by the outbreak would be eligible for additional assistance.\n\nIt was unclear how the 2.6% figure was reached. When asked about it, officials with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services described it as 2% of state populations per month without explaining the discrepancy. Officials also did not respond to questions about whether the administration has a target for how many daily tests should be done nationwide or when it would issue more details.\n\nOnly about 40% of states currently meet even the 2% testing threshold, according to AP's analysis. The percentage is expected to rise as states increase their testing capabilities. The AP based the monthly testing rate for each state on the average number of new daily tests over the most recent 7 days. The data is from the COVID Tracking Project and includes counts up to April 30th.\n\nA White House spokesman said Friday that the administration's testing threshold is only a suggestion and that states are ultimately responsible for deciding how to reopen in a \"safe and responsible manner.\" The administration says it is working to expand testing and has been highlighting plans first announced in March for additional testing sites at retail pharmacy chains.\n\nStates that do not meet the administration's testing guidance, based on their current screening rates, include some that have been moving into the early stages of reopening, such as Colorado, South Carolina and Texas. Georgia, which has moved aggressively to ease restrictions and lift its stay-at-home order, is just under the 2% threshold.\n\nLouisiana and Kansas, where Republican lawmakers have been putting pressure on Democratic governors to reopen, are falling short, according to the AP analysis. In Kansas, the governor and top health administrator expect to reach the 2% mark this month.\n\nFlorida, which announced its first phase of reopening will start next week, also falls short but has said it will be able to test 30,000 to 40,000 people a day if needed. Michigan, where the Republican-led legislature has sued the Democratic governor over the state's stay-at-home order, is on track to test 2.2% of its population.\n\nFormer health officials and experts were critical of the testing blueprint and said the 2.6% or 2% population metric was too vague and didn't take into account guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control on who should be tested.\n\n\"Why don't they say, 'We'll test everybody with any symptoms of coronavirus and all their contacts?'\" said Dr. James Curran, a former assistant U.S. surgeon general who worked at CDC for 25 years. \"If that amounts to 2% that's fine, but the guidelines are not to test 2%. The guidelines are to test who needs it.\"\n\nMany experts already say the national testing rate falls short of what is needed to safely ease social distancing guidelines.\n\nResearchers at Harvard have calculated that the U.S. needs to be testing roughly 500,000 people per day before considering easing restrictions this month. That's a nearly 150% increase from the recent daily tally of approximately 200,000 tests.\n\n\"I've described it and I still describe it as an absolute bare minimum,\" said Ashish Jha, director of the Harvard Global Health Institute.\n\nMore than half of states are not testing their populations at the daily rate recommended by Jha and his colleagues. The Harvard team developed their statistics in mid-April and noted that projections for U.S. cases have increased since then.\n\nMany states hardest hit by the crisis failed to reach the team's testing recommendations, even if they were already testing more than 2% of their populations, according to an AP analysis using state-by-state figures provided by Harvard. States falling short of the Harvard numbers include many of the epicenters of the outbreak, including New York, New Jersey and Massachusetts.\n\nJha and his colleagues based their testing targets, in part, on the number of tests needed to screen enough people to push positive results below 10%, the level that the World Health Organization considers sufficient to contain the outbreak. More than 16% of U.S. tests nationwide are positive for the virus, according to figures compiled by the COVID Tracking Project website. That compares with a rate of about 3% in South Korea, a country praised for its aggressive testing.\n\nFormer CDC director Tom Frieden has recommended double the current testing levels. He said the U.S. should be testing at minimum 400,000 people a day.\n\nOfficials in at least 20 states have indicated their testing capacity is not adequate and said they are taking steps to address this, according to a review by the AP. But there is little consensus among states on how many people should be tested or whether that should include those with no symptoms.\n\nGeorgia, where in-person dining at restaurants is now permitted with restrictions, has not said how many people it would like to test but recently touted its ability to test over 20,000 people on a single day and has encouraged more people to get tested. New Jersey, which has a slightly smaller population and a higher number of COVID-19 cases, has said it would need to conduct 20,000 to 30,000 tests a day to reopen.\n\nOhio wants to increase testing from 7,200 per day to 22,000 by May 27. Washington state, which has seen one of the largest U.S. outbreaks, has reported averaging 4,650 tests a day and wants to do more than 22,000 but lacks the necessary supplies.\n\nMost states have convened advisory panels to help in setting guidelines, but they run the gamut in terms of expertise and will result in a patchwork of policies that experts say may be ineffective in containing a virus that doesn't respect state borders.\n\n\"Treading water on testing is not going to get us out of this,\" said Jeremy Konyndyk, a disaster preparedness expert who helped lead the Obama administration response to Ebola.\n\n-- -\n\nDearen reported from Gainesville, Florida; Perrone, an AP health writer, reported from Washington, D.C.; and Forster, a data journalist, reported from New York.

    "Advocates demand stronger federal action as nursing homes engulfed by pandemic": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "As authorities revealed the latest mass casualty event to strike an American nursing home amid the pandemic, advocates for the elderly decried an inadequate federal response to the crisis.\n\nNursing homes have been especially devastated by COVID-19. A nationwide review by ABC News found more than 10,000 long-term care residents have died of the virus in just the 28 states that responded to a request for figures. In some states, deaths in nursing homes account for as many as half of all coronavirus-related fatalities.\n\nOn Friday, officials acknowledged that the novel coronavirus had claimed the lives of 98 residents at a single New York City nursing home, a loss that Mayor Bill de Blasio called \"absolutely horrifying.\"\n\nCritics have argued that the federal government has responded too slowly to the worsening situation in nursing homes, where elderly residents have been especially vulnerable to the spread of COVID-19 because they live in such close quarters.\n\n\"The federal and states' response to COVID-19 has been an unquestionable disaster,\" said Wes Bledsoe, founder of A Perfect Cause, a citizen's advocacy organization for nursing home residents. \"Many of these deaths were needless and completely avoidable.\"\n\nLast week, authorities reported that 70 residents had died as the virus quickly spread through the 543-bed Andover Subacute and Rehabilitation Center in western New Jersey. That record death toll was eclipsed on Friday when the 705-bed Isabella Geriatric Center in Manhattan reported the deaths of 98 residents since the outbreak began to take hold in March.\n\nAccording to a statement issued yesterday by the nursing home in New York, the facility had limited access to widespread testing to diagnose residents and experienced staff shortages - problems being reported by many facilities around the country.\n\n\"Sadly, while we have always had daily health screenings of staff, this hampered our ability to identify those who were infected and asymptomatic, despite our efforts to swiftly separate anyone who presented symptoms.\"\n\nThe owner of Andover issued statements to the media saying staffing there was \"solid,\" but that the home found itself \"on the front lines of this crisis.\"\n\nBoth facilities were overwhelmed so quickly, they reportedly experienced difficulty handling the number of bodies.\n\nAs nursing homes operators have issued increasingly urgent requests for supplies, Vice President Pence announced plans to protect nursing homes last week, telling governors the Trump administration was organizing the first federal shipments of gowns, gloves and masks directly to nursing homes, a departure from the earlier strategy which had relied on states to provide supplies to nursing home facilities.\n\n\"We are literally contracting to ship direct what amounts to [protective equipment] packages to all 15,000-plus nursing homes in the country,\" Pence said on a call with governors earlier this week.\n\nGovernors have been trying to manage the crisis as well. Gov. Larry Hogan, a Maryland Republican who chairs the National Governor's Association, held a press conference last week to say the state \"will continue to take aggressive actions to address the spread of COVID-19 in Maryland nursing homes,\" calling those steps \"critically important to our state's recovery efforts.\"\n\nSeema Verma, the administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, told ABC News last week that she believes the federal response has been robust and focused on supporting state officials.\n\n\"At the federal level, we are trying to support what state and local officials are doing by the end of the day,\" Verma said. \"The response is, as we've said many times, it's locally executed. It's state managed and federally supported.\"\n\nPence's announcement was greeted as good news by industry officials. But while some facilities in some hard-hit locations, including New York and New Jersey, expect those shipments to arrive next week, others are not scheduled to arrive until July.\n\nAccording to documents sent by FEMA to some county Departments of Health and obtained by ABC News, the shipments will contain a seven-day supply of personal protective equipment, calculated based on the staffing size of the facility. Nursing homes will likely not be notified, the document said, in advance of the arrival of their shipment.\n\nBledsoe and other advocates said it was all too little too late for facilities in need.\n\nToby Edelman, a Senior Policy Attorney at the Center for Medicare Advocacy, said the shipments of personal protective equipment are \"totally inadequate and very late in coming.\"\n\n\"FEMA should have sent [equipment] to every nursing home after the first outbreak,\" Edelman said.\n\nCarol Herman, president of the Foundation Aiding The Elderly, said she is \"very pleased about the shipment of supplies\" but said \"this should have been done months ago. So many elders had to suffer to make it happen.\"\n\nAnd Mary Kay Henry, president of Service Employees International Union, a labor union that represents many nursing home workers, said she has grave concerns about the numbers of workers dying, a figure that has not been tracked by states or the federal government.\n\n\"If this administration does not start doing everything possible to expedite [protective equipment] to nursing homes and assisted living facilities so that frontline healthcare workers and residents are protected from the virus,\" Henry said, \"not only will more Americans tragically, needlessly die, we will prolong any real recovery from this pandemic.\"",

        "authors": [],
        "body": "HOUSTON -- More people will die of the coronavirus in U.S. immigration custody unless the Trump administration rapidly improves conditions and releases more detainees, lawyers and advocates warned Thursday, following the first confirmed virus-related death of a detainee.\n\nA complaint sent to the Department of Homeland Security includes the stories of 17 people who allege they have been denied release despite in some cases having medical conditions putting them at higher risk of infection. They include a man in remission from a form of cancer known as follicular lymphoma and a woman with pre-diabetes.\n\nCarlos Ernesto Escobar, a 57-year-old man from El Salvador, died Wednesday at the Otay Mesa Detention Center in San Diego, which was holding 132 of the 705 U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement detainees who have tested positive for COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus.\n\nICE says it has tested 1,460 detainees and has just under 30,000 people in custody.\n\nAccording to a representative for his family, Escobar was diabetic and was placed on a ventilator after contracting the virus in detention.\n\nICE says it has released more than 900 people considered to be at risk. In a statement, the agency said it has staggered meal and recreation times to increase social distancing and isolated people exposed to someone who was infected as well as those newly detained.\n\nA coalition of groups including the American Immigration Council and American Immigration Lawyers Association filed Thursday's complaint, which underscores persistent allegations that detainees are being denied protective gear, cleaning supplies, or adequate space to observe social distancing.\n\nKatie Shepherd, a lawyer at the American Immigration Council, said Escobar's death was avoidable and blamed ICE for \"a senseless waste of human life.\" Shepherd called on ICE to hasten the release of people in its custody and provide more personal protective equipment to detainees.\n\n\"We knew it was going to happen. It was just a matter of when,\" Shepherd said. \"But I am afraid about how many more deaths will happen.\"\n\nDetainees at Otay Mesa have reported being denied masks unless they sign a waiver that prevents them from holding private prison operator CoreCivic responsible if they catch the virus. A CoreCivic spokeswoman denied that masks have been withheld, but said the original form requiring a signature was withdrawn.\n\nA man detained at another CoreCivic jail, the Houston Contract Detention Facility, says in the complaint that he was presented with a similar waiver, which he signed \"to avoid problems with the officials.\"\n\nThe man also alleges that guards have not provided enough soap for them to bathe themselves, nor have they given out gloves to use when the detainees clean their living area. Two detainees at the Houston facility have confirmed cases of COVID-19.\n\nThe man's claims could not be independently verified. CoreCivic spokeswoman Amanda Gilchrist denied that detainees were denied soap, saying guards issue a 2 ounce (60 ml) bottle to each person and provide additional bottles at no cost. She said the jail has enough supplies for \"intensified cleaning and disinfecting practices.\"\n\nFor most people, the coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia, or death.",

        "body": "STEFANIE DAZIO, MICHAEL R. SISAK and JAKE BLEIBERG Associated Press\n\nThe new coronavirus doesn't care about a blue uniform or a shiny badge. Police, firefighters, paramedics and corrections officers are just a 911 call away from contracting COVID-19 and spreading it.\n\nWith N95 masks hanging off their duty belts and disposable blue gloves stuffed in their back pockets, they respond to radio calls, make arrests and manage prisoners. But their training never covered something quite like this -- what has been called an \"invisible bullet.\"\n\nIt's sickened thousands of America's first responders and killed dozens more.\n\nBut many have recovered, and they're going back to work -- back to the crime scene, back into the ambulance, back to the jail. Going back to this deadly pandemic's front lines.\n\nThey go with a lingering cough and lost weight. They toss and turn at night, wondering if the claims of immunity are true. They fear that picking up extra overtime shifts may expose them, and their families, to additional risks.\n\nAnd then they pull on their uniforms and go back to work.\n\nHOUSTON -- In Deputy Ravin Washington's squad car, risk rides shotgun. The threats she faces on her solo patrols are usually more immediate than reports of some new unseen virus.\n\nOn the beat in northwest Houston, Washington, 28, has been in fights and drawn her gun. In 2017, three months after she finished the police academy, her partner at the time was shot in the leg.\n\nBut last month, she was following up on a robbery call when it suddenly felt like someone was sitting on her chest. By the time she navigated her cruiser to her sister's apartment, she could barely keep her hands on the wheel. She had no idea what was wrong.\n\nCertainty came a few days later after a nasal swab that felt like it poked her brain. On March 25, Washington tested positive -- one of the first of about 180 Harris County Sheriff's Office employees to be sickened.\n\nIn lonely isolation, her temperature spiked. Her stomach roiled. She lost her sense of taste and could barely rise from bed for days.\n\n\"People don't want to be around you,\" she said. \"People don't want to touch you.\"\n\nWhen she finally healed, she worried about getting sick again -- about whether her colleagues would want her back.\n\nShe returned to patrol this month and found the situation suddenly reversed. Her colleagues gave her hugs. \"People feel like, 'Hey, you have the antibodies. You're the cure,'\" she said.\n\nBack on patrol, Washington has the familiar weight on her hips of a Taser, handcuffs and gun. But her safety also depends on gloves and a mask.\n\nNEW YORK -- Paramedic Alex Tull of the New York Fire Department feels out of breath after walking up a few flights of stairs and has a cough that just won't quit. After some recent chest pains, an X-ray showed lingering inflammation in his lungs.\n\nAs he goes about his days treating coronavirus patients in the Bronx, he thinks about his own battle with the disease and his rush to return to duty late last month before he was fully healed.\n\nAt the height, about a quarter of the city's 4,300 EMS workers were out sick.

        "body": "STEFANIE DAZIO, MICHAEL R. SISAK and JAKE BLEIBERG Associated Press\n\nThe new coronavirus doesn't care about a blue uniform or a shiny badge. Police, firefighters, paramedics and corrections officers are just a 911 call away from contracting COVID-19 and spreading it.\n\nWith N95 masks hanging off their duty belts and disposable blue gloves stuffed in their back pockets, they respond to radio calls, make arrests and manage prisoners. But their training never covered something quite like this -- what has been called an \"invisible bullet.\"\n\nIt's sickened thousands of America's first responders and killed dozens more.\n\nBut many have recovered, and they're going back to work -- back to the crime scene, back into the ambulance, back to the jail. Going back to this deadly pandemic's front lines.\n\nThey go with a lingering cough and lost weight. They toss and turn at night, wondering if the claims of immunity are true. They fear that picking up extra overtime shifts may expose them, and their families, to additional risks.\n\nAnd then they pull on their uniforms and go back to work.\n\nHOUSTON -- In Deputy Ravin Washington's squad car, risk rides shotgun. The threats she faces on her solo patrols are usually more immediate than reports of some new unseen virus.\n\nOn the beat in northwest Houston, Washington, 28, has been in fights and drawn her gun. In 2017, three months after she finished the police academy, her partner at the time was shot in the leg.\n\nBut last month, she was following up on a robbery call when it suddenly felt like someone was sitting on her chest. By the time she navigated her cruiser to her sister's apartment, she could barely keep her hands on the wheel. She had no idea what was wrong.\n\nCertainty came a few days later after a nasal swab that felt like it poked her brain. On March 25, Washington tested positive -- one of the first of about 180 Harris County Sheriff's Office employees to be sickened.\n\nIn lonely isolation, her temperature spiked. Her stomach roiled. She lost her sense of taste and could barely rise from bed for days.\n\n\"People don't want to be around you,\" she said. \"People don't want to touch you.\"\n\nWhen she finally healed, she worried about getting sick again -- about whether her colleagues would want her back.\n\nShe returned to patrol this month and found the situation suddenly reversed. Her colleagues gave her hugs. \"People feel like, 'Hey, you have the antibodies. You're the cure,'\" she said.\n\nBack on patrol, Washington has the familiar weight on her hips of a Taser, handcuffs and gun. But her safety also depends on gloves and a mask.\n\nNEW YORK -- Paramedic Alex Tull of the New York Fire Department feels out of breath after walking up a few flights of stairs and has a cough that just won't quit. After some recent chest pains, an X-ray showed lingering inflammation in his lungs.\n\nAs he goes about his days treating coronavirus patients in the Bronx, he thinks about his own battle with the disease and his rush to return to duty late last month before he was fully healed.\n\nAt the height, about a quarter of the city's 4,300 EMS workers were out sick. Nearly 700 fire department employees have tested positive for the coronavirus and eight have died, including three EMS workers.\n\nTull, 38, says he felt guilty convalescing at home for two weeks, flipping through Netflix and Hulu between naps as his colleagues risked their lives.

    "After some cats test positive, CDC says social distancing applies to pets too": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "After two feline friends in New York became the first U.S. household pets to test positive for the coronavirus, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says pet owners should take the precaution of simply treating pets like \"other human family members.\"\n\nThough there have only been a handful of known cases of animals becoming infected with the virus that causes COVID-19, the advisory issued last week suggests people apply the same social distancing measures to their pets as they do to family with whom they're living.\n\nThat means keeping cats indoors and walking dogs on a leash at least six feet away from other animals and other people. And best to avoid dog parks.\n\nInside the home, it's fine to interact with pets as you normally would, ideally with frequent hand washing and good pet hygiene. But if someone in the household gets sick, the CDC says pets should be kept a safe distance from that person -- just like the human members of the family.\n\n\"Social distancing applies to your pets too,\" said Veterinary Specialist Dr. Melissa Salgado. \"They are at risk of developing this disease so it's best to err on the side of caution.\"\n\nSalgado, who diagnosed one of the infected cats, added that testing for animals is more invasive than it is for humans and for now, routine testing is not recommended by the CDC.\n\n\"Testing requires swabs of the nose, of the mouth, and the conjunctiva of the eyes, as well as fecal testing,\" Salgado said. \"And there's so many illnesses in pets that aren't coronavirus that we aren't advocating for widespread testing.\"\n\nAccording to the CDC, the two felines who tested positive for the coronavirus experienced mild respiratory symptoms and are expected to make a full recovery.\n\nWhile the cats are believed to have contracted the virus from people in their households or neighborhoods, experts say there is not enough information to say that pets can pass it on to humans.\n\nAt a coronavirus briefing last week, Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's top infectious disease specialist, emphasized that \"there's no evidence whatsoever that we've seen from an epidemiological standpoint that pets can be transmitters within a household.\"\n\nHowever, some experts believe some animals are more susceptible to the virus than others.\n\nDr. Sandra Newbury, director of the Shelter Medicine Program at the University of Wisconsin has been conducting studies on how the virus affects animals and was not surprised by the news of the two felines.\n\n\"Cats have a particular receptor and we suspected early on that they might be able to be infected,\" said Newbury. \"We think it is more difficult to infect dogs and our experimental studies have proven just that.\"\n\nThis isn't the first time cats have tested positive for the virus. Eight of the household cats' larger relatives, lions and tigers at the Bronx Zoo, have been infected with the virus that causes COVID-19.\n\nAccording to Newbury, there is a possibility that more animals could be infected but are not displaying symptoms.\n\n\"The cases in Hong Kong had no clinical signs, no symptoms at all,\" Newbury said. \"Animals could be asymptomatic just like some people but more studies need to be done to confirm anything.\"\n\nBut pet owners can generally relax, Newbury said, since there's little evidence that owners pose a risk to their furry companions, and should only take in-home precautions if someone in the home becomes sick.\n\n\"There's no reason to relinquish your pet or send your pet away if you've become sick,\" Newbury said. \"Although it's not easy, refraining from petting and snuggling during this time is the best way to keep your pets safe.\"",

        "authors": [],
        "body": "TEL AVIV, Israel -- Air travel to Israel has come to a near standstill due to coronavirus restrictions, but one type of voyage still endures: the final journey of Jews wishing to be buried in Israel.\n\nFor centuries, Jews have sought to be interred in the Holy Land, going to great lengths to secure their final resting place in the land of their biblical forefathers. Today, not even a once-in-a-century pandemic is halting this ancient last wish.\n\n\"The Land of Israel is a very special place for Jewish people to be buried,\" said Rabbi Michoel Fletcher, who facilitates purchases of burial plots in Israel for Jews from abroad. \"The flights have been reduced heavily, but there are cargo flights. So it may take a bit longer, but we are getting people coming in.\"\n\nDespite the challenges presented by the coronavirus, families, the aviation industry and health workers are finding ways to keep the deceased flying in -- chartering private planes, adding cargo flights and striking deals with handling companies. Israel's Foreign Ministry said 300 bodies, including many COVID-19 victims, have been flown in for burial since February.\n\nDuring that time, Israel's typically bustling Ben-Gurion International airport has become a ghost town, with only a few hundred passengers arriving on a handful of flights each week.\n\nJews have long aspired to be buried in the Holy Land. The biblical forefather Jacob and his son Joseph both requested to be buried in the Promised Land after having died in Egypt. Some Jews believe that being buried in the Holy Land grants atonement for sins or will make resurrection easier when the Messiah comes.\n\nIsrael has managed to keep the coronavirus crisis largely in check, and though it has reported 225 deaths out of more than 16,100 cases, it has not seen hospitals or morgues overwhelmed. More than half of the reported cases in Israel have recovered.\n\nThe virus causes mild to moderate flu-like symptoms in most patients, who recover within a few weeks. But it is highly contagious and can cause severe illness or death, particularly in older patients or those with underlying health problems.\n\nBringing in bodies is complex and costly, even under ordinary circumstances. Purchasing a plot can cost anywhere from a few thousand to tens of thousands of dollars, depending on the location. Many choose to spend hefty sums for a prime spot in Jerusalem's Mount of Olives cemetery, which overlooks the storied Old City and its important Jewish sites. Additional costs include flights and transport from the airport to the cemetery.\n\nThose who choose to be buried in Israel must also navigate a web of bureaucracy, starting with handling companies at their departure point to their local Israeli consulate or embassy as well as the Israeli Health Ministry.\n\nThe coronavirus crisis has complicated an already onerous process. While families typically fly in from abroad to escort the body and attend the funeral, that's not possible under current travel restrictions, which require a two-week quarantine for anyone entering from abroad.\n\nExtra measures are required to prevent contagion, including additional wrapping material and a separate ritual purification process. In hard-hit New York, which has a large Jewish community, some handling companies have refused to deal with the bodies of those who have died of COVID-19, the illness caused by the virus.\n\nEarlier this month, Dan Leshem's father Amnon died from the coronavirus in Belgium, his home for the last 20 years. The bureaucracy and high costs were not a deterrent to bringing his father for burial in Israel, where Leshem lives.\n\n\"His last wish was to be buried in Israel,\" said Leshem, who streamed the funeral to relatives and friends abroad. \"It was clear that we must bring him.\"\n\nAn Israeli aviation official, speaking on condition of anonymity because he wasn't authorized to discuss the process of transporting bodies with the media, said a cargo flight that comes from Belgium five times a week brings in about 20 bodies a flight -- \"an exceptional amount.\"\n\nMost come from France, which has a large Jewish community and a severe outbreak, the official said. He said a weekly cargo flight from New York also brings in bodies but often can't meet families' needs, as Jewish custom requires burying the dead promptly.\n\nFletcher, the burial facilitator, said many in New York have opted to bury their dead in the U.S., intending to exhume the bodies once flights to Israel resume.\n\nBut solutions are being found even now. The aviation official said that even if a cargo flight is full, room will be made for the caskets. \"We will not delay bodies because there is no space,\" he said. Additional cargo flights are expected to be added in Europe, he said.\n\nWealthier families have hired private planes, which have been shipping in bodies about every other day from Europe and the U.S. In a photo released by ZAKA, an Israeli medical service, the sleek, slim interior of a private jet that had recently touched down was packed with four wooden caskets.\n\nIsraeli airline El Al struck a deal last week with a handling company in New York prepared to process the bodies of people who have died of the coronavirus.\n\nYossi Landau, a ZAKA official who has been assisting families with burials during the outbreak, said dignity for the dead, and the bereaved, was a main driver behind getting the bodies to Israel.\n\n\"Behind every person who dies there is also a family, people who are living,\" said Landau. \"They must be respected.\"",

        "body": "ANCHORAGE, Alaska -- Selling Girl Scout cookies is normally a foolproof business model, but the coronavirus outbreak cooled sales of the treats in Alaska.\n\nThe Girl Scouts of Alaska sought assistance, and the organization is expected to receive a federal recovery loan to help compensate for lost cookie sales.\n\nFirst National Bank Alaska facilitated the federal Paycheck Protection Program loan, The Anchorage Daily News reported Sunday.\n\nLeslie Ridle, head of one of two Girl Scouts councils in Alaska, said fears of girls becoming infected with COVID-19 forced the organization to cut its six-week sales season in half.\n\nSales of the famed cookies fund nearly everything the council does, including camps and scholarships for 3,500 girls and wages for 20 full-time employees.\n\n\"It was frenzied shopping, and people were hoarding cookies like they were toilet paper,\" Ridle said of sales before the state ordered business closures last month.\n\nNow her Anchorage-based council is sitting on about 144,000 unsold boxes filling the homes of scouting families in southern Alaska, Ridle said.\n\n\"I'm hearing from lots of families: 'When am I getting these out of my living rooms?' \" Ridle said.\n\nThe First National Bank Alaska loan officer called at night and on weekends, including Easter Sunday, to gather information to obtain the loan, which arrived in the council's bank account last week, Ridle said.\n\nThe funding allowed employees to continue working and provide online programs for Girl Scouts stuck at home, like magic trick lessons and flamenco dancing. A new COVID-19 badge emphasizes good hygiene.\n\n\"It's our bridge to keep things going,\" Ridle said.\n\nCompanies including ConocoPhillips Co., GCI LLC and First National Bank Alaska have also made big cookie purchases to help the Girl Scouts.\n\nPeople whose lives have been altered by the pandemic still want the cookies, the \"ultimate comfort food,\" Ridle said.\n\nFor most people, the new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia, and death. The vast majority of people recover.",

        "body": "PALMER, Alaska -- An Alaska school board postponed a vote over rescinding a ban on selected English course books after taking public testimony on the issue that attracted national attention when a Grammy-winning rock group pledged to purchase the banned books for students.\n\nThe Matanuska-Susitna Borough School District board heard three hours of testimony Wednesday on a proposal to rescind last month's vote to remove five American literature classics from high school English elective courses.\n\nThe board is scheduled to vote on the proposal May 20.\n\nThe list of books includes F. Scott Fitzgerald's \"The Great Gatsby,\" Joseph Heller's \"Catch-22,\" Maya Angelou's \"I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings,\" Ralph Ellison's \"Invisible Man,\" and Tim O'Brien's \"The Things They Carried.\"\n\nMembers of the band Portugal. The Man stepped into the controversy in their Alaska hometown by offering to buy copies of the books for students and families.\n\nAt least 80 people registered to submit testimony by phone rather than in person Wednesday because of health restrictions resulting from the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nThe majority favored rescinding the board's decision to ban the novels from reading lists.\n\nThe board also removed The New York Times' The Learning Network as a teaching resource, although journalism students are permitted to use the newspaper.\n\n\"This was placed back on the agenda because of the difficulties we're having with COVID, the inability for the community to speak, and also in light of the previous vote, information has been brought forth that needs to be considered in this option,\" school board President Tom Bergey said during the meeting.\n\nFor most people, the new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia and death. The vast majority of people recover.",

    "America's business of prisons thrives even amid a pandemic": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "MINNEAPOLIS -- As factories and other businesses remain shuttered across America, prisoners in at least 40 states continue going to work. Sometimes they earn pennies an hour, or nothing at all, making masks and hand sanitizer to help guard others from the coronavirus.\n\nThose same inmates have been cut off from family visits for weeks, but they get charged up to $25 for a 15-minute phone call -- plus a surcharge every time they add credit.\n\nThey also pay marked-up prices at the commissary for soap so they can wash their hands more frequently. That service can carry a 100% processing fee.\n\nAs the COVID-19 virus cripples the economy, leaving millions unemployed and many companies on life support, big business that has become synonymous with the world's largest prison system is still making money.\n\n\"It's hard. Especially at a time like this, when you're out of work, you're waiting for unemployment ... and you don't have money to send,\" said Keturah Bryan, who transfers hundreds of dollars each month to her 64-year-old father at a federal prison in Oklahoma.\n\nMeanwhile, she said, prisons continue their nickel-and-diming.\n\n\"You have to pay for phone calls, emails, food,\" she said. \"Everything.\"\n\nThe coronavirus outbreak has put an unlikely spotlight on America's jails and prisons, which house more than 2.2 million people and have been described by health experts as petri dishes for the virus's spread.\n\nMasks and hand sanitizer often still don't reach inmates. Testing is often not done, even among those with symptoms, despite fears that the virus may spread to surrounding communities. And in some parts of the country, those experiencing symptoms languish in sweltering buildings with poor ventilation.\n\nThe concerns extend to prison medical providers, often accused by health experts of providing substandard care even in the best of times.\n\nSheron Edwards shares a dorm with 50 other men at Chickasaw County Regional Correctional Facility in Mississippi. Given his past experiences with the prison's medical provider, Centurion of Mississippi, he worries about what will happen if coronavirus hits.\n\n\"I'm afraid they'll just let us die in here,\" he said.\n\nWhen he was at the notorious Parchman prison several years ago, Edwards said, Centurion would allow him only one session of physical therapy after a 6-inch rod and screws were placed in his broken ankle.\n\n\"Even though that wasn't life threatening, it was serious,\" he said. \"With COVID-19, I could actually lose my life.\"\n\nMore than 20,000 inmates have been infected and 295 have died nationwide, at Rikers Island in New York City and at state and federal lockups in cities and towns coast to coast, according to an unofficial tally kept by the COVID-19 Behind Bars Data Project run by UCLA Law.\n\nOn Wednesday, officials in San Diego announced the first death of a detainee in a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention center.\n\nWhen incarceration rates soared to record highs in the 1980s and '90s, some corporations saw a business opportunity. Promised lower costs and, in many cases, profit sharing agreements, prison and jail administrators started privatizing everything from food and commissary to entire operations of facilities.\n\nBy the 2000s, the private sector was embedded in nearly every aspect of the correctional system.\n\nToday, some of corporate America's biggest names, and many smaller companies, vie for a share of the $80 billion spent on mass incarceration each year in the U.S., roughly half of which stays in the public sector to pay for staff salaries and some health care costs, according to the nonprofit Prison Policy Initiative.\n\nProponents of for-profit prisons say it's cheaper for private companies to run them than the government, arguing it's easier to cancel contracts and there is more incentive to provide better service. That, they say, leads to better living conditions and more effective reintroduction of the incarcerated back into society, with the ultimate goal of reducing recidivism.\n\nThe advocacy group Worth Rises disagrees.\n\nThe group released a report Thursday detailing some 4,100 corporations that profit from the country's prisons and jails. For the first time, it identified corporations that support prison labor directly or through their supply chains. The group also recommended divesting from more than 180 publicly traded corporations and investment firms.\n\n\"The industry behind mass incarceration is bigger than many appreciate. So is the harm they cause and the power they wield,\" said Bianca Tylek, the group's founder and director.\n\n\"They exploit and abuse people with devastating consequences,\" Tylek said. \"Of course, they aren't unilaterally responsible for mass incarceration, but they're part of the ecosystem propping it up.\"\n\nThe report includes vendors that stock commissaries with Cup Noodles and Tide laundry detergent, along with contracted health care providers that have been sued for providing limited or inadequate coverage to those behind bars.\n\nThere are companies like Smith & Wesson that make protective gear for correctional officers, and Attenti that supplies electronic ankle bracelets. Other household names, such as Stanley Black & Decker, have entire units dedicated to manufacturing accessories for prison doors.\n\nPrisoners also work, making everything from license plates to body armor vests and mattresses. In California, some even serve as firefighters. But in some places, incarcerated people are employed by major corporations such as Minnesota-based 3M.\n\nBilled as a cheap alternative to foreign outsourcing, inmates also previously provided goods to Starbucks, Victoria's Secret and Whole Foods, sparking an uproar that caused many big-name companies to bow out.\n\nSome prisoners leave their lockups to do jobs in the community, such as fast food restaurants. State-owned businesses have also cropped up around the massive prison labor industries, including some with almost comical names, such as Big House products in Pennsylvania and Rough Rider Industries in North Dakota.\n\nWhile some jobs might pay minimum wage as required by federal law for products that enter interstate commerce, the take-home pay of workers in correctional industries can be as low as just 20% of their stated wage after garnishment for room and board, restitution, and other costs.\n\nMeanwhile, private companies market catalogs full of products to lockups. One website advertises an array of pricey bondage items: Leather bed restraints for $267, ankle hobbles for $144 and a metal waist chain with handcuffs going for $76.95.\n\nAn Alabama company markets video visitation systems under a call box with the face of an elderly woman in glasses shown on the monitor inside. Beside it reads the slogan: \"Keep Granny's shank pies away from your facility.\"\n\nBobby Rose, one of the report's researchers, served 24 years in New York state prisons, where he spent a lot of time thinking about the role money plays in America's legal system.\n\nBut he was shocked to learn just how many big-name companies were involved and how much was being made off not only those behind bars, but also their families -- a particularly poignant concept during the pandemic.\n\nHe still thinks about friends left in prison -- two of whom have succumbed to COVID-19.\n\n\"I feel,\" he said, \"that some of these companies that really profit could have provided ... sanitizer or even gave free soap,\" he said.",

        "authors": [],
        "body": "NEW YORK -- Heidi Van Roekel makes instructional art videos for YouTube when coronavirus news overwhelms her. Bill Webb takes his boat out. Stacy Mitchell searches her TV for something -- anything -- to make her laugh.\n\nParadoxically, Kevin Reed, a software designer from Kenmore, Washington, has binged \"The Walking Dead\" after turning off the news. He'd rather watch fake, flesh-eating zombies than a real-life pandemic.\n\nIt's no surprise that news outlets are in demand with a story that directly affects so many people, whether they've gotten sick, lost jobs or are locked down at home. A Pew Research Center survey taken the third week of April found that 88 percent of Americans said they were following coronavirus news either very or fairly closely.\n\nYet that takes a toll. Pew also found that 71 percent of Americans said that they need to take breaks from the news. To watch something else. To do something else. To breathe a little.\n\n\"A week and a half ago I just had to throttle it down,\" said Webb, a writer and consultant who lives in Sarasota, Florida. \"I think you get overwhelmed by it. You're sitting in your house and there's nothing you can do about things.\"\n\nMitchell, a consultant in human resources from Dayton, Ohio, said she watches the \"Today\" show in the morning, the network evening news and tries to catch her state's governor, Mike DeWine, at least at the beginning of his regular briefings.\n\nBut she hit a wall.\n\n\"It was just COVID-19 overload,\" Mitchell said. \"I was very anxious. I had a full-blown anxiety attack and I decided that I was not going to watch more of that stuff.\"\n\nScience supports them. Roxane Cohen Silver, Dana Rose Garfin and E. Alison Holman, researchers at the University of California at Irvine who have been studying the affect of prolonged media exposure to bad news following the Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, wrote an article for Health Psychology magazine in February -- before coronavirus was even on the radar for many Americans -- warning of this effect.\n\nPeople who watch too much can have nightmares, feelings of anxiety and symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder, Silver said. In the long run, they're more likely to report cardiovascular disorders.\n\nSome people who consumed a heavy diet of news about the Boston Marathon bombing in 2013 were actually more stressed out than people on the scene, the researchers found.\n\n\"The news is distressing,\" Silver said. \"There are not many uplifting stories. It's the repetitive bad news that is so draining.\"\n\nThe pandemic story is particularly difficult because it's not a single event that fades with time. There's no telling how long it will go on. Because of unemployment and stay-at-home orders, more people have time to follow it.\n\nThat's precisely what is happening with Jose Moreno of San Antonio, Texas, a caretaker for his elderly mother. The news makes him overthink, he said.\n\n\"When I leave the house, I'm wondering, 'Am I doing something that I shouldn't be doing?' It's a lot of stress,\" he said.\n\nSome news organizations recognize the impact of a steady diet of sobering news and have sought ways to offer relief.\n\nCBS News reporter Steve Hartman, with his regular \"On the Road\" series grounded, is \"teaching\" an online class in kindness. On the other side of the world, the Sydney Morning Herald and other Australian newspapers hunt for stories to fit their \"Good News Initiative.\"\n\nDuring a meeting with fellow editors at The Associated Press one morning in March, running down a particularly distressing list of the day's stories, Sally Stapleton offered some light in the dark clouds.\n\nShe promoted a story about a homebound woman in Norway who asked people on Facebook to send birthday greetings to her children, and people all over the world did. A college student sent home to New York after classes were suspended organized 1,300 volunteers in three days to shop and make deliveries for shut-ins.\n\nThe stories got such a positive reaction that \"One Good Thing\" is now a daily feature. AP journalists all over the world compete to have a story included.\n\n\"I just think it's news,\" said Stapleton, global religion editor. \"These stories are everywhere, all the time. Mostly we ignore them. This is not a time to ignore them.\"\n\nFox News has similarly collected more than 700 television and online stories showing resiliency under the \"America Together\" banner. The featured articles have received more than 25 million page views.\n\n\"If you're in a position to spread these stories that warm the heart at a time when there is uncertainty, sadness and fear, I think it's our obligation to do so,\" said Fox News anchor Dana Perino.\n\nEven people who need to step away from the tough news recognize that it's essential.\n\nLucretia King, a private tutor from San Joaquin County in California, has lost her job since the outbreak began. But her husband and son both work, so she follows the news and texts them if there's anything they need to know urgently.\n\nUCal-Irvine's Silver stays informed by reading online news sites in the morning and evening, and gets notifications during the day. She said she watches no television.\n\nShe doesn't expect many others will avoid TV altogether -- her husband and son certainly don't -- but recommends against keeping the TV or news radio on constantly in the background.\n\n\"People should make a conscious effort to monitor their exposure,\" Silver said.\n\nVan Roekel, a stay-at-home mom from Los Alamos, N.M., said she limits her exposure to national news to four days a week, and makes sure she stays away from social media before bedtime.\n\nShe said her husband has been catching up with old sitcoms and she loves actor John Krasinski's YouTube series, \"Some Good News.\" Mitchell and her husband have watched Disney's \"Avengers\" movies. King checks out home makeovers on HGTV.\n\nEveryone has a personal stress relief valve.\n\n\"You've got to take a break for your mental health,\" Van Roekel said.",

    "Another 1,700 virus deaths reported in NY nursing homes": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "ALBANY, N.Y. -- New York state is now reporting more than 1,700 previously undisclosed deaths at nursing homes and adult care facilities as the state faces scrutiny over how it's protected vulnerable residents during the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nAt least 4,813 residents with confirmed or presumed cases of COVID-19 have died at 351 of New York's 613 nursing homes since March 1, according to Gov. Andrew Cuomo's administration's new list. The list, released late Monday, includes the reported number of both confirmed and presumed deaths as of Sunday evening.\n\nNursing home residents have made up roughly one-fourth to one-fifth of the state's official tally of fatalities. But just how many nursing home residents have died of COVID-19 remains uncertain despite the state's latest disclosure, as the list doesn't include deaths of nursing home residents at hospitals or any details about the number of COVID-19 cases at individual nursing homes.\n\nThe data shows that 22 nursing homes largely in New York City and Long Island have reported at least 40 deaths and that 64 nursing homes have reported between 20 to 49 deaths.\n\nParker Jewish Institute in Queens and Isabella Geriatric Center -- one of New York City's largest nursing homes with 705 beds -- have reported the highest number of deaths: 71 and 64, respectively.\n\nAudrey Waters, a spokeswoman for Isabella Geriatric Center, said in an email last week, \"Isabella, like all other nursing homes in New York City, initially had limited access to widespread and consistent in-house testing to quickly diagnose our residents and staff. This hampered our ability to identify those who were infected and asymptomatic, despite our efforts to swiftly separate anyone who presented symptoms.\"\n\nIn many cases, the state's new figures reveal many more deaths than previously reported at nursing homes: Isabella Geriatric Center had 13 COVID-19 deaths reported as of May 1, and now reports the deaths of 21 patients who were confirmed to have COVID-19 along with 43 deaths of residents presumed to have COVID-19. And Ozanam Hall of Queens now is reporting a total of 53 deaths, up from just 10.\n\nSeveral veterans home have been especially hard-hit by the virus: The Long Island State Veterans Home has reported 53 deaths; including 48 confirmed and five presumed COVID-19 deaths. The New York State Veterans Home at St. Albans in Queens has reported 33 deaths while New York State Veterans Home at Montrose in Westchester says 22 residents have died.\n\nCuomo promised on March 2, when only a handful of coronavirus cases had been reported in New York, to make a \"special effort\" for nursing homes and congregate homes housing senior citizens. The state directed nursing homes to screen visitors and consider modifying visiting hours on March 6, and later suspended visits to nursing homes statewide March 12.\n\nBut the governor is facing criticism over his administration's role in overseeing and supporting New York's overwhelmed, state-regulated nursing homes as many have struggled to treat COVID-19 patients, amass enough personal protective gear or ensure adequate staffing.\n\nAdvocacy groups for the elderly and family members of nursing home residents have called for greater transparency over COVID-19 cases at each state-regulated nursing home and criticized an April 1 state law granting some immunity to hospitals and nursing homes from civil and criminal liability. They also questioned the state's March 25 policy that says \"no resident shall be denied re-admission or admission to a nursing home solely based on a confirmed or suspected diagnosis of COVID-19.\"\n\nThe governor and his administration have defended that policy as ensuring nursing home residents aren't left lingering in hospitals or without anywhere else to go. Cuomo's spokesman tweeted Monday that the policy follows federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services guidance. But the federal guidance says only that a nursing home \"can accept a resident diagnosed with COVID-19\" so long as the nursing home can follow federal guidance on transmission precautions.\n\nCuomo has also said the state has facilities that can house transferred COVID-19 nursing homes patients, and he recently said that nursing homes that tell the state up-front that they can't care for a COVID-19 patient wouldn't face regulatory scrutiny. His administration hasn't responded to a request for questions on the state's current capacity to care for COVID-19 nursing home residents and whether nursing homes were informed.",

        "authors": [],
        "body": "Apple and Google on Wednesday released long-awaited smartphone technology to automatically notify people if they might have been exposed to the coronavirus.\n\nThe companies said 22 countries and several U.S. states are already planning to build voluntary phone apps using their software. It relies on Bluetooth wireless technology to detect when someone who downloaded the app has spent time near another app user who later tests positive for the virus.\n\nMany governments have already tried, mostly unsuccessfully, to roll out their own phone apps to fight the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. Many of those apps have encountered technical problems on Apple and Android phones and haven't been widely adopted. They often use GPS to track people's location, which Apple and Google are banning from their new tool because of privacy and accuracy concerns.\n\nPublic health agencies from Germany to the states of Alabama and South Carolina have been waiting to use the Apple-Google model, while other governments have said the tech giants' privacy restrictions will be a hindrance because public health workers will have no access to the data.\n\nThe companies said they're not trying to replace contact tracing, a pillar of infection control that involves trained public health workers reaching out to people who may have been exposed to an infected person. But they said their automatic \"exposure notification\" system can augment that process and slow the spread of COVID-19 by virus carriers who are interacting with strangers and aren't yet showing symptoms.\n\nThe identity of app users will be protected by encryption and anonymous identifier beacons that change frequently.\n\n\"User adoption is key to success and we believe that these strong privacy protections are also the best way to encourage use of these apps,\" the companies said in a joint statement Wednesday.\n\nThe companies said the new technology -- the product of a rare partnership between the rival tech giants -- solves some of the main technical challenges that governments have had in building Bluetooth-based apps. It will make it easier for iPhones and Android phones to detect each other, work across national and regional borders and fix some of the problems that led previous apps to quickly drain a phone's battery.\n\nThe statement Wednesday also included remarks from state officials in North Dakota, Alabama and South Carolina signaling that they plan to use it.\n\n\"We invite other states to join us in leveraging smartphone technologies to strengthen existing contact tracing efforts, which are critical to getting communities and economies back up and running,\" said North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum, a Republican.\n\nNorth Dakota had already launched a location-tracking app that about 4% of state residents are using, higher than other U.S. states with similar apps but falling far short of the participation rate that experts say is needed to make such technology useful.\n\nTim Brookins, the CEO of ProudCrowd, a startup that developed North Dakota's app, said Wednesday that North Dakotans will now be asked to download two complementary apps -- his model, to help public health workers track where COVID-19 patients have been, and the Apple-Google model, to privately notify people who might have been exposed to the virus.",

    "As virus lockdown eases, Italy ponders what went wrong": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "ROME -- As Italy prepares to emerge from the West's first and most extensive coronavirus lockdown, it is increasingly clear that something went terribly wrong in Lombardy, the hardest-hit region in Europe's hardest-hit country.\n\nItaly had the bad luck of being the first Western country to be slammed by the outbreak, and its total of 26,000 fatalities lags behind only the U.S. in the global death toll. Italy's first homegrown case was recorded Feb. 21, at a time when the World Health Organization was still insisting the virus was \"containable\" and not nearly as infectious as the flu.\n\nBut there's also evidence that demographics and health care deficiencies combined with political and business interests to expose Lombardy's 10 million people in ways unseen anywhere else, particularly the most vulnerable in nursing homes.\n\nVirologists and epidemiologists say what went wrong there will be studied for years, given how the outbreak overwhelmed a medical system considered one of Europe's best. In neighboring Veneto, the impact was significantly more controlled.\n\nProsecutors are deciding whether to lay any criminal blame for the hundreds of dead in nursing homes, many of whom aren't even counted in Lombardy's official death toll of 13,269.\n\nBy contrast, Lombardy's front-line doctors and nurses are being hailed as heroes for risking their lives to treat the sick under extraordinary levels of stress, exhaustion, isolation and fear.\n\nEven after Italy registered its first homegrown case, doctors didn't understand the unusual way COVID-19 could present itself, with some patients experiencing a rapid decline in their ability to breathe.\n\n\"This was clinical information we didn't have,\" said Dr. Maurizio Marvisi, a pneumologist at the San Camillo private clinic in hard-hit Cremona.\n\nBecause Lombardy's intensive care units were filling up within days of Italy's first cases, many primary care physicians tried to treat and monitor their patients at home, even putting them on supplemental oxygen. That strategy proved deadly, since many people died at home or soon after being hospitalized, having waited too long to call an ambulance.\n\nItaly was forced to rely on home care in part because of its low ICU capacity: After years of budget cuts, Italy went into the emergency with 8.6 ICU beds per 100,000 people, below the average of 15.9 within the developed countries of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.\n\nAs a result, Italy's primary care physicians became the front-line filter of COVID-19 patients, an army of mostly self-employed general practitioners who work outside the public hospital system.\n\nSince only those showing strong symptoms were being tested because Lombardy's labs couldn't process any more, these family doctors didn't know if they themselves were positive, much less their patients.\n\nThe doctors also had no guidelines on when to admit the sick or refer them to specialists. And being outside the hospital system, they didn't have the same access to protective equipment.\n\nSome 20,000 Italian medical personnel have been infected and 150 doctors have died.\n\nTwo days after Italy registered its first case in the Lombardy province of Lodi, sparking a quarantine in 10 towns, another positive case was registered more than an hour's drive away in Alzano in the province of Bergamo.\n\nBy March 2, the Superior Institute of Health recommended Alzano and nearby Nembro be sealed off like the Lodi towns. But political authorities never implemented that recommendation, allowing the infection to spread for a second week until all of Lombardy was locked down March 7.\n\nAsked why he didn't seal off Bergamo sooner, Premier Giuseppe Conte argued that Lombardy's regional government could have done so on its own. Lombardy's governor, Atillio Fontana, said if there was a mistake, ''it was made by both. I don't think that there was blame in this situation.''\n\nLombardy has one-sixth of Italy's 60 million people and is the most densely populated region, home to the business capital in Milan and the country's industrial heartland. Lombardy also has more people over 65 than any other region, as well as 20% of Italy's nursing homes, a demographic time bomb for COVID-19 infections.\n\n\"Clearly, with the benefit of hindsight, we should have done a total shutdown in Lombardy, everyone at home and no one moves,\" said Andrea Crisanti, a microbiologist and virologist advising Veneto's regional government. But he acknowledged how hard that was, given Lombardy's outsize role in Italy's economy, which even before the pandemic was heading toward recession.\n\n\"Probably for political reasons, it wasn't done,\" he told reporters.\n\nUnions and mayors of some of Lombardy's hardest hit cities now say the country's main industrial lobby group, Confindustria, put enormous pressure on authorities to resist production shutdowns on the grounds that the economic cost would be too great in a region responsible for 21% of Italy's GDP.\n\nOn Feb. 28, a week into Italy's outbreak and well after more than 100 cases had been registered in Bergamo, the province's branch of Confindustria launched a social media campaign aimed at reassuring skittish investors. It insisted the outbreak was no worse than elsewhere and that production in provincial steel mills and other industries were unaffected. The lobbying group also launched its own campaign in the larger Lombard region.\n\nEven after the national government locked down all of Lombardy March 7, it allowed factories to stay open, sparking strikes from workers worried that their health was being sacrificed.\n\n\"It was a huge error. They should have taken the example where the first cluster was found,\" said Giambattista Morali of the metalworkers' union in the Bergamo town of Dalmine.\n\nWhile the regional government focused on finding new ICU beds, its testing capacity lagged and Lombardy's nursing homes were in many ways left to fend for themselves.\n\nOf particular attention to Milan prosecutors investigating deaths in care facilities was the March 8 decision by the regional government to allow recovering COVID-19 patients to be housed in nursing homes to free up hospital beds.\n\nAnother regional decree March 30 told nursing home directors to not hospitalize sick residents over 75 if they had other health problems and avoid further risking their health during transport or a wait in the ER.",

    "Asia Today: Concerns raised over Malaysia lockdown penalties": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia -- Malaysian lawyers and an international rights group have voiced concern over what they say is excessive sentencing of violators of the country's coronavirus lockdown.\n\nMalaysia, which has confirmed 5,851 cases and 100 deaths from COVID-19, has arrested more than 21,000 people since a partial lockdown began March 8. Violators face a fine or a jail term of up to six months.\n\nIt's not clear how many people have been imprisoned, but a number have been handed jail sentences ranging from a few days to several months.\n\nThe Bar Council, which represents some 15,000 lawyers, urged courts to temper justice with compassion because the offenses don't involve violent crime. Bar president Salim Bashir said in a statement that incarcerating violators raises the risk of virus transmissions in courts and already crowded prisons.\n\nWhile flouting the lockdown must not be taken lightly, Bashir said, \"Sending violators to jail is a cure that is worse than the disease.\"\n\nThe Bar Council also said it was disturbed over cases of disparity in sentencing between ordinary people and those with influence. Malaysia's deputy health minister on Tuesday was let off with a 1,000 ringgit ($229) fine for having a lunch gathering at a religious school.\n\nIn contrast, a university student was sentenced to seven days in jail and a 1,000 ringgit fine for leaving her house to take a cake to her boyfriend. She faces an additional two months in jail if she fails to pay the fine.\n\nHuman Rights Watch said Malaysia should stop jailing violators because it's counterproductive to reducing the virus spread. It also said the temporary detention facilities being used for lockdown violators should instead be used to reduce overcrowding in Malaysia's existing prisons.\n\nIn other developments in the Asia-Pacific region:\n\n-- HOLIDAY WORRIES IN SOUTH KOREA: South Korean officials have issued public pleas for vigilance to maintain hard-won gains against the coronavirus as the nation enters its longest holiday since infections surged in February. Vice Health Minister Kim Gang-lip said Wednesday that 180,000 people are expected to visit the resort island of Jeju during a six-day break from Thursday to Tuesday, despite the island government pleading travelers not to come. Kim urged travelers to wear masks, not to share food and stay at home if they have fever or respiratory symptoms. South Korea' has confirmed 10,761 cases, including 246 deaths.\n\n-- TOKYO SITUATION STILL SERIOUS: Tokyo Gov. Yuriko Koike on Wednesday called for an extension of Japan's nationwide \"state of emergency,\" which requests people to stay home and social distance. She noted that reported daily cases of COVID-19 in Tokyo have topped 100 people recently. The state of emergency lasts through May 6, which marks the end of the Golden Week holidays that began this week. The government has asked people not to travel during the holidays. There is no lockdown in Japan, and some businesses and restaurants remain open.\n\n-- CHINA CONGRESS SET: China has decided to hold the annual meeting of its ceremonial parliament late next month after postponing it for weeks because of the coronavirus outbreak. The official Xinhua News Agency said Wednesday that the National People's Congress would open in Beijing on May 22, according to a decision made by its standing committee, which handles most legislative affairs outside the annual two-week session of the full body. The convening of the full session, which would encompass about 3,000 members, indicates China's growing confidence that it has largely overcame the pandemic that was first detected in the country late last year.\n\n-- AUSTRALIAN MINING MAGNATE URGES INQUIRY DELAY: An Australian mining magnate and partner in the government's pandemic response says a global inquiry into the coronavirus should be delayed until after the U.S. presidential election. Andrew Forrest, who became a billionaire exporting iron ore to China as founder of Fortescue Metals Group, said such an inquiry made \"common sense,\" but should be held after the November election so \"there's not going to be a political dog in this fight.\" Australia's calls for an independent inquiry are damaging bilateral relations with China, which accused Australia of parroting the United States.",

    "Asia Today: India's cases spike with Chennai market cluster": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "NEW DELHI -- Health officials are rushing to contain the spread of the coronavirus in India's southern city of Chennai, where a large cluster has been identified among people at one of the country's largest markets for fruit, vegetables and flowers.\n\nThe busy Koyambedu market, with 500 shops spread over 250 acres, is central to the food supply chain in Tamil Nadu and neighboring states. It had remained open through India's nationwide lockdown, and hundreds of traders visited regularly until the market was shut on Monday after the viral cluster was detected.\n\nSome 7,000 people connected to the market were being traced and quarantined, J. Radhakrishnan, the nodal officer for COVID-19 in Chennai told The Associated Press late Tuesday.\n\nA list of those potentially infected was shared with other districts since many people exposed to the virus had returned to their homes in different districts in the region, Radhakrishnan said. \"Most of them have been quarantined,\" he said.\n\nChennai now has 2,008 cases, with 545 of them detected in two days. Tamil Nadu has confirmed 4,058 cases and many of its fresh cases were linked to the market, the state government said in a statement.\n\nRadhakrishnan said the government was \"aggressively testing\" to try and ensure that customers, whose visits to the market had not been tracked by the public health machinery, would also be identified.\n\nThe market cluster contributed to India's biggest single-day increase in virus infections yet, 3,900 cases and 195 deaths from COVID-19. Those figures reported Tuesday brought India's totals to over 46,000 cases in all and over 1,500 dead. The health ministry attributed the spike to reporting delays by state governments, but experts remain worried.\n\nThey credit the strict, six-week lockdown with giving India time to prepare hospitals, equipment and personnel and to ramp up testing, but they still wonder if it will be enough to avert major catastrophe in a country with limited medical care and vast numbers of poor among its 1.3 billion people.\n\nThe government eased the lockdown on Monday, allowing some movement and business to resume in areas less affected by the virus while maintaining lockdown measures in hard-hit areas like New Delhi and Mumbai.\n\nIn other developments in the Asia-Pacific region:\n\n-- INDONESIAN ELECTIONS DELAYED: The coronavirus has delayed Indonesian regional elections being decided by more than 100 million voters. President Joko Widodo signed a regulation that would move the elections from September to December or later depending on the pandemic situation, the State Secretariat website said. The vote would elect 9 governors, 37 mayors and 224 district chiefs across the archipelago. The General Election Commission already had delayed election preparations because organizers have become ill with COVID-19. The election authority said postponement was the most viable option to prevent the further spread of the virus to rural areas. Indonesia has confirmed 12,071 cases and 872 deaths.\n\n-- LOW SOUTH KOREAN CASES: South Korea reported no fresh cases in cities and towns Wednesday, with its only two new cases detected in airport screenings. The Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's update brought national totals to 10,806 infections and 255 deaths. With few local cases recently, the country is relaxing social distancing and preparing to reopen schoolsstarting next week. Imported cases have declined as authorities stepped up border controls, such as quarantining all arrivals. Prime Minister Chung Sye-kyun said preventing an overwhelming of hospitals in the densely populated Seoul metropolitan area would be key to prevention of a second wave of infections.\n\n-- DROP IN CHINA: China reported just two new virus cases and no deaths, with 339 people remaining in treatment. It has not reported a death from the illness for more than three weeks. Another 908 people were being observed as suspected cases or for having tested positive for the virus but showing no symptoms. China has recorded 4,633 deaths from COVID-19 among 82,883 cases of infection.",

With signs of infections slowing, Abe is seeking to relax the measure while balancing disease prevention and the economy.\n\nHis government plans to lift the state of emergency in 39 of the country's 47 prefectures, while maintaining it in eight prefectures, including Tokyo, Osaka, Kyoto and Hokkaido.\n\nJapan has more than 16,000 confirmed cases of infection, with about 680 deaths from COVID-19. The number of new cases being reported daily has significantly decreased.\n\nAbe will explain details of changing the emergency status at a news conference later Thursday.\n\nEconomy Minister Yasutoshi Nishimura, in his opening remarks at the task force meeting, asked experts to give details on how the emergency would be eased, as well as how it might be tightened if cases resurge.\n\nExperts and officials have urged people to adopt \"new lifestyles\" and continue practicing physical distancing measures such as remote-working and avoid out-of-town trips even after the state of emergency is lifted.\n\nIn other developments in the Asia-Pacific region:\n\n-- NEW CASES IN SOUTH KOREA: South Korea has confirmed 29 more coronavirus cases over the past 24 hours as it battles a spike linked to nightlife spots in Seoul. The additional cases reported by the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention pushed the national total to 10,991 with 260 deaths. Most of the new cases reported Thursday were infected locally while three came from overseas. South Korea's caseload has climbed in the past week, with new cases linked to nightclubs in Seoul's entertainment Itaewon district threatening South Korea's hard-won progress in containing the virus.\n\n-- CHINA MOVES TOWARD REOPENING: China on Thursday reported three new coronavirus cases as the country increasingly moves to reopen business and schools. The National Health Commission said 101 people remain in treatment for COVID-19, while 716 were under isolation and monitoring for being suspected cases or for having tested positive for the virus without showing symptoms. China plans to restart classes for most students on June 1, with other grades to resume at a later date depending on conditions. No announcements have been made on when university classes will resume. China has reported 4,633 deaths among 82,929 cases of the virus.\n\n-- NEW ZEALAND REOPENING: Malls, retail stores and restaurants were reopening in New Zealand, and many people were returning to their workplaces. Most gatherings will be limited to 10 people and social distancing guidelines will remain in place. Most New Zealand schools will reopen Monday but bars won't reopen until May 21, a decision prompted in part by the experience in South Korea, where a spike in cases was linked to briefly reopened nightlife spots in Seoul.",

        "body": "AUSTIN, Texas -- The City Hall in the capital of Texas was vandalized sometime late Monday or early Tuesday with red paint and anti-capitalism graffiti messages as the state prepares to slowly reopen of one of the world's largest economies that has been closed due to the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nRed paint was splattered across the front entrance of the building and messages were spay-painted on the steps outside.\n\nOne message read: \"MAY 1 INTERNATIONAL WORKERS DAY\" with a hammer and sickle. Another said: \"U.S. imperialism is the virus\" and \"socialist revolution is the cure!\"\n\nThe defacement occurred after Texas Gov. Greg Abbott on Monday outlined a plan that allow the state's restaurants, retailers, movie theaters and malls to start letting customers trickle into their establishments starting May 1.\n\nThe governor's move comes as Texas and other states are processing a record-high surge in jobless claims and food banks are seeing spiking demands. However, testing for the virus remains limited.\n\nIt was just the latest act of vandalism at City Hall. In March, a man was arrested and accused of incinerating a statue of a grackle that stood outside the building, burning the art installation to the ground.\n\nAccording to state health officials, Texas had more than 25,200 confirmed cases of COVID-19 as of Monday, with 663 deaths and more than 11,100 deemed recovered. The number of infections is likely higher because many people have not been tested and studies suggest people can be infected and not feel sick.\n\nFor most people, the new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms that clear up within weeks. For some, especially older adults and those with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness and be life-threatening.",

    "Auto workers' tenuous return a ray of hope in jobs crisis": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "DETROIT -- Defying a wave of layoffs that has sent the U.S. job market into its worst catastrophe on record, at least one major industry is making a comeback: Tens of thousands of auto workers are returning to factories that have been shuttered since mid-March due to fears of spreading the coronavirus.\n\nUntil now, it was mostly hair salons, restaurants, tattoo parlors and other small businesses reopening in some parts of the country. But the auto industry is among the first major sectors of the economy to restart its engine.\n\nWith it comes about 133,000 U.S. workers pouring back into assembly plants that will open in the coming week, or just over half of the industry's workforce before the pandemic, according to estimates by The Associated Press. In addition, parts-making companies began cranking this week to get components flowing, adding thousands more workers.\n\nLooming in the background is an economy decimated by the pandemic. Nearly 3 million laid-off workers applied for unemployment benefits last week, raising the total seeking aid to about 36 million. Although some states have begun to let selected businesses reopen, workers are still reporting difficulty getting unemployment benefits. Freelance, gig and self-employed workers are struggling.\n\nEven the auto sector won't see a full return to normal yet, and if people don't start buying vehicles again, the workers could be sent home. Yet automakers say there's enough pent-up demand, especially for pickup trucks, to get factories humming again.\n\nThat could help states slow the drain on their unemployment benefit funds. In Michigan, where over one-third of the labor force sought benefits, the fund fell from $4.6 billion before the pandemic to $4.1 billion on April 30, said Jeff Donofrio, director of the state Department of Labor and Economic Opportunity. Some returning auto employees could work part-time and get still some unemployment benefits, but federal programs could cover part of their payments, he said.\n\nAt Ford, where about 47,000 U.S. factory workers will return by next week, there's optimism that consumer demand will accompany them. Chief Operating Officer Jim Farley said the company, using data collected from new Ford models from the past two years, is seeing sales recover.\n\nIn Europe, China and the U.S., Ford has found a correlation between the number of trips people take and auto sales, with trips increasing as restrictions eased.\n\n\"We started to see in early April a change where people started to take more trips,\" Farley said Thursday. \"The (sales) decline stopped and our retail sales improved a lot.\"\n\nAuto sales in China, where the virus peaked before the U.S., could be harbinger of things to come. China sales fell in 2.6% in April but losses narrowed from the 48% free-fall in March. Production at many plants is nearly back to normal after being shut down in January and February. Volkswagen, Honda, Mercedes and Ford reported no virus cases among employees since reopening. Fiat Chrysler had two, but said the workers never entered factories.\n\nThings are worse in Europe, where sales plummeted 55% in March and some factories are running only at 40% of capacity. The pandemic has affected over 1.1 million European auto industry workers, almost half the sector's manufacturing jobs. Most are getting paid through government support. A survey of auto parts suppliers shows that a third of executives believe it will take at least two years for the industry to recover.\n\nU.S. sales fell 46% in April as the virus took hold, but analysts are forecasting a smaller decline of 30% in May. Sales have been juiced by huge incentives, with some automakers offering 0% financing for as long as seven years.\n\nPickup trucks are giving automakers the most hope, said Jeff Schuster, senior vice president at LMC Automotive, a consulting firm. Through April, total auto sales were down 21%, but pickups were only off 4%, he said.\n\nYet Schuster says automakers could be a little too optimistic about sales overall. \"Those consumers who are still unemployed are not likely to be making auto purchases,\" he said.\n\nSome U.S. automakers, like General Motors, are restarting slowly, only bringing back workers on one shift in factories, some of which ran around the clock before the pandemic. Others, like Subaru in Indiana, have a full complement of employees.\n\nAlthough companies are taking precautions, one big virus outbreak at an auto plant could send the industry back into hibernation. And the industry could face parts supply interruptions from Mexico, where the government wants to reopen factories despite rising virus cases.\n\nAutomakers in the U.S. are requiring employees to fill out questionnaires daily to see if they have symptoms, they're taking temperatures with no-touch thermometers before workers enter buildings, and they're requiring gloves, masks and face shields. They've also tried to keep at least six feet between workers, staggered time between shifts so workers don't interact, and have put up plexiglas barriers when possible.\n\nAll the steps were tested on U.S. workers who volunteered to make protective gear and breathing machines while they were laid off. Automakers say they know of no virus cases among workers in the effort.\n\nBut Phil Cuthbertson a worker at GM's transmission plant in Toledo, Ohio, who will return Monday, said he has mixed feelings about it. \"I just don't want the whole thing to be pushed on us to go back if it's not safe,\" he said.\n\nCindy Estrada, United Auto Workers vice president for Fiat Chrysler, said she's been impressed by the companies' safety commitment. But she's sure some workers, especially in the hard-hit Detroit area, will be fearful because family members or co-workers have had COVID-19. At least 25 UAW members employed by Detroit automakers have died from the virus, although no one is sure if they caught it at a factory.\n\nThe union will be watching in case workers get infected, though there's no magic number for when it will try to close a factory, Estrada said.\n\n\"If something looks like it's becoming a hot spot, then we need to act quickly and make adjustments,\" she said. \"No one wants to see that happen.\"\n\n-- -- -- --\n\nAP reporters Joe McDonald in Beijing, Carlo Piovano in London, Jonathan Mattise in Nashville, Tenn.; John Seewer in Toledo, Ohio; Mike Householder in Ypsilanti Township, Michigan; David Eggert in Lansing, Michigan; and Mary Esch in Albany, N.Y.; contributed to this report.",

    "Back to work, owners make changes so workers feel safe": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "NEW YORK -- Before the coronavirus outbreak, furniture deliveries at Sunnyland Outdoor Living meant two employees sitting side-by-side in a truck. Now, one will be driving the truck while the second follows in a car.\n\nAnd when Sunnyland's workers reach a customer's home, \"we'll deliver outside -- we won't go inside people's houses,\" says Brad Schweig, the retailer's vice president for operations.\n\nEmployee safety is a priority as small and midsize businesses rehire laid-off employees and get back to work and many owners realize that supplying masks and gloves won't be enough.\n\nMany staffers are anxious about increased contact with others that could make them more vulnerable to catching the virus -- feelings owners understand they need to consider. They're staggering work hours and shifts to cut the number of people onsite. They're also redoing floor plans and operations to minimize contact -- a step that also helps keep customers safe.\n\nGeorgia has already allowed businesses like hair and nail salons, restaurants and gyms to open with social distancing restrictions. Alabama has allowed some limited openings, and Texas and Colorado permitted many companies to reopen on Friday. Around the country owners are recalling laid-off workers although they can't resume full operations yet; with government loan money arriving, companies can pay their workers again.\n\nThe steps businesses are taking are in line with recent guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\n\"Some of it is common sense that we should have been doing long before this,\" says Louise McCullough, who hopes to soon reopen her dog care company, Paws Chateau in Huntington Beach, California.\n\nBefore the virus struck, clients would walk their dogs into Paws Chateau and hand the leashes over to staffers. Now McCullough is creating a safe space where dogs will be unleashed by owners outside the building, and then staffers will wipe the dogs down with pet-safe antiseptic soap and take them inside.\n\nWolf's Ridge Brewing, a restaurant and bar in Columbus, Ohio, is a large establishment, with three kitchens. Co-owner Bob Szuter is using all three even though his business right now is limited to takeout and delivery. On a busy Friday or Saturday night, this allows for just four to five staffers in each kitchen instead of the usual 15 or 20.\n\nSzuter recalled about 25 staffers after the company received government loan money, bringing the work force to about 50. As he plans for how Wolf's Ridge will operate safely when the state allows restaurants to resume table service, Szuter is including staffers in the process.\n\n\"It's going to be a negotiation with them. We're asking them, 'hey, what do you guys feel comfortable doing?'\" Szuter says.\n\nAtrend, an audio equipment manufacturer that's now producing protective gear for health workers, has spread its 22 employees across its 50,000-foot warehouse in Chicago -- they're no longer working side by side. And while they used to take coffee and lunch breaks together, those traditions are on hold.\n\n\"They're in the break room by themselves -- their breaks are all staggered,\" CEO Kevin Hundal says.\n\nStaffers are also now getting more than a \"good morning\" as they arrive. Hundal is taking staffers' temperatures, and if someone has a reading of 100.4 degrees or higher, he'll send them home.\n\nMonitoring employees' symptoms, which can include taking temperatures, is something the CDC is encouraging employers to do. But as owners take on that new routine, they may find themselves dealing with confidentiality issues, says Hagood Tighe, a labor law attorney with Fisher Phillips in Columbia, South Carolina.\n\n\"If employers are doing that, they need to be doing it in such a way that an employee's privacy is protected,\" Tighe said. That means testing in a private area, something that may be difficult in a business with close quarters.\n\nStaffers' anxiety is as important a concern for owners as their physical safety. As Front Burner Group's 20 Texas restaurants serve sit-down diners again, in addition to the masks and gloves employees will wear, one staffer will be sanitizing surfaces throughout the establishments -- and wearing a white coat so everyone can see the disinfecting process.\n\nCEO Randy DeWitt and his managers learned how anxious staffers are when they started recalling laid-off workers. Some don't want to come back, including one with a child with respiratory problems.\n\n\"When we contacted people, I would say one out of 10 said, I'm too nervous,\" DeWitt says.\n\nSchweig, the Sunnyland Outdoor vice president, was himself nervous about one staffer who wanted to come back to work; she's in her late 70s, the age group believed to be most vulnerable to the virus. Schweig told her he will pay her to stay home.\n\n\"It's not worth risking her health to come back now,\" he says.",

    "Beachgoers seen carrying virus more than sand or surf": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "HUNTINGTON BEACH, Calif. -- Maureen Osborne is torn by the state's decision to close the sweeping, scenic beach just a 10-minute walk from her home.\n\nShe hasn't gone there much since the coronavirus outbreak because the neighborhood has become crowded with visitors who park their cars to walk down to the shore -- but wishes she could.\n\n\"It is what it is,\" said the 62-year-old, who now carries a mask with her as a precaution when she goes out. \"If people are sensible and do what they're supposed to with the social distancing -- but not everybody is.\"\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom announced his decision Thursday to close beaches in Orange County after seeing photos of thousands of beachgoers clustered on the sands during a heat wave last weekend.\n\nThe move was backed by those concerned about the virus's spread and reviled by others. It spurred questions for many living in beach communities who rely on the shoreline for exercise and open space.\n\nScientists said beaches could contribute to the transmission of the virus because they draw people to congregate in large numbers at a time when virtually all other large group activities -- ranging from school to concerts to sporting events -- have been shut down.\n\n\"The main reason for not going to the beach is just simply you don't want to go to places where people are congregating. It's hard to go to the beach and not congregate,\" said Ali Nouri, president of the Federation of American Scientists.\n\n\"You don't want to put yourself in a situation where you are exposing yourself, for minutes or hours, to people who may potentially be breathing out -- even if they're not coughing or sneezing -- but people who might be breathing out virus.\"\n\nThe virus can be transmitted through large and also small droplets that are light and don't fall to the ground quickly but carry through the air. A strong wind on the coast could push these droplets even farther, Nouri said.\n\nComplicating the issue is that the virus can be transmitted by people who don't have symptoms, he said.\n\nViruses can live in the ocean, but it isn't known whether the coronavirus would remain infectious. Most likely, it would be diluted to the point where it is not a concern, Nouri said.\n\nChad Nelsen, chief executive of the Surfrider Foundation, said there's a study under way to determine whether the virus remains infectious in sewage, though beachgoers shouldn't be in the water anyway in the case of a spill.\n\nAs a result, the main risk to beachgoers is their fellow beachgoer, he said.\n\n\"The primary concern for contagion is physical distancing at the beach or in the water,\" Nelsen said.\n\nSome California counties have adopted measures to try to address the issue. Ventura County allows walking and jogging at the beach, but residents can't sit on the sand and linger. Los Angeles County closed beaches altogether.\n\n\"We actually don't have anything to suggest that just because you're outside means that if you're in close contact with other people this virus won't spread,\" Los Angeles County Public Health Director Barbara Ferrer said.\n\nThe beach is more than a fun day in the sun for those who live along Huntington Beach's shoreline of crashing waves dotted with surfers -- it's a lifestyle.\n\nOsborne said she usually walks with friends on weekends and stops for a bite. She also likes to park along Pacific Coast Highway and take in the views while working in her car.\n\nShe hasn't been able to do either since the viral outbreak, and rarely even goes to the beach to avoid having to walk through congested streets to get there since the city shut down beach parking lots in a bid to discourage crowds.\n\nRyan Selewicz, 28, lives right on the sand in Newport Beach. People in his neighborhood don't have yards -- the homes are wedged between the road and the beach, where people go to watch the sunset and walk their dogs.\n\nHe said he doesn't know what a beach closure would look like because his patio faces the ocean.\n\n\"I don't really know where people are going to be expected to go now to get out of their house and have their outside time,\" he said. \"Most people would probably consider that the front of their house.\"\n\n-- -\n\nAssociated Press writers John Antczak in Los Angeles and Elliot Spagat in San Diego contributed to this report.",

    "Beloved Brooklyn teacher, 30, dies of coronavirus after she was twice denied a COVID-19 test": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "A beloved 30-year-old middle school social studies teacher from Brooklyn has died of COVID-19 following a month-long battle, after twice being turned away for testing before eventually being diagnosed with the virus.\n\nRana Zoe Mungin, who had been clinging to life for more than a month at Mount Sinai Hospital, died on Monday afternoon, her mother confirmed to ABC News.\n\nDespite repeated pleas for help and exhibiting various symptoms of the virus, Mungin was twice denied COVID-19 testing at Brooklyn's Brookdale Hospital, according to her family.\n\nIt was same hospital where her older sister died of an asthma attack 15 years earlier.\n\nAccording to one of her friends, her condition was also dismissed as a \"panic attack\" by an EMT.\n\nMia Mungin, a registered New York City nurse, has been chronicling her sister's journey across social media for more than a month, and said \"she fought a long fight but her body was too weak.\"\n\n\"Racism and health disparities still continues ... [and] the zip code in which we live still predetermines the type of care we receive,\" Mia Mungin wrote on Facebook about the racial disparities in the health care system and the care received by her sister, who was black.\n\nRana Zoe Mungin taught at Ascend Academy in East New York, Brooklyn, an area of New York City that's among the hardest-hit by the coronavirus pandemic, according to data from the state's health department.\n\nShe was a first-generation college student who received a Bachelor of Arts in Psychology from Wellesley College and later earned a Master of Fine Arts from The University of Massachusetts, Amherst, in Creative Writing.\n\nHer case echoes startling data released by the CDC showing that African Americans are being severely impacted by COVID-19 nationwide, accounting for 30% of coronavirus cases in the U.S. despite only comprising approximately 13% of the population.\n\n\"She died not only because of COVID-19, but because we live in a world that is racist and anti-black,\" her friend for more than a decade, Nohemi Maciel, told ABC News. \"We know that black people are dying at disproportionate rates. This cannot be left out of the conversation.\"\n\n\"I'm heartbroken and don't know how to live in a world without Zoe. But I'm also angry. I'm angry that her students lost a wonderful and committed teacher, because representation matters,\" Maciel added.\n\nLauren Liora, who met Mungin during her freshman year at Wellesley College, said that people who live in areas where city hospitals are underfunded are implicitly being told that \"their lives don't matter, that they don't matter.\"\n\n\"Imagine if Zoe had received treatment consistent with the severity of her symptoms, rather than receiving treatment consistent with her origins,\" said Liora.\n\n\"She was the kind of person so captivating and sincere in her dealings with others and her writing that she naturally attracted a following, and scores of friends and admirers recently fought tooth and nail for her without ever having met her,\" Liora added.\n\n\"Zoe was my rock,\" Maciel added \"I cheered her on through grad school and she did the same for me years later. Every accomplishment and setback, Zoe was one of the first to know. She was a fierce and loyal friend.\"\n\nWellesley College President Dr. Paula Johnson, founder and former executive director of the Connors Center for Women's Health and Gender Biology as well as chief of the Division of Women's Health at Brigham and Women's Hospital, called the disproportionate impact of COVID-19 on black and Latinx families is a \"moral and systemic failure.\"\n\n\"Rana touched the lives of so many members of our community during her time here at Wellesley and beyond,\" Johnson, the first black woman to serve as the university's president, told ABC News in statement. \"As a social studies educator in Brooklyn, Rana and her love of teaching exemplified Wellesley's mission to make a difference in the world, and our motto of Non Ministrari sed Ministrare, 'not to be ministered unto, but to minister.'\"\n\nEarlier this month, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio announced that the city would open five additional sites to prioritize the needs of low-income communities of color as an effort to address the racial disparity in coronavirus cases.\n\n\"For Zoe, Mayor de Blasio's efforts are too little and too late, but they may not be for someone else like her,\" Liora said. \"I can only hope her story ignites sweeping change.\"",

    "Blood test helped detect cancer before symptoms, study finds": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "For the first time, a blood test has been shown to help detect many types of cancer in a study of thousands of people with no history or symptoms of the disease.\n\nThe test is still experimental. Even its fans say it needs to be improved and that Tuesday's results are not ideal. Yet they show what benefits and drawbacks might come from using these gene-based tests, called liquid biopsies, in routine care -- in this case, with PET scans to confirm or rule out suspected tumors.\n\n\"We think that it's feasible,\" said Nickolas Papadopoulos, a Johns Hopkins University scientist who helped develop the test. Using it along with standard screening methods \"doubled the cancers that were detected\" in the study, he said.\n\nBut the test also missed many more cancers than it found and raised some false alarms that led to unnecessary followup procedures. It was only studied in women 65 to 75 years old and needs to be tried in men, other ages and more diverse groups.\n\n\"This is not at the place where it could be used today,\" said Dr. Len Lichtenfeld, deputy chief medical officer for the American Cancer Society. \"It will need many more studies to demonstrate value,\" including whether it improves survival, he said.\n\nResults were published in the journal Science and discussed at an American Association for Cancer Research conference that was held online because of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nMany companies are working on liquid biopsies, which look for DNA and other things that tumors shed into blood, to try to find cancer at an early stage. This test was invented by Hopkins doctors who formed a company, Thrive Earlier Detection Corp., to develop it with Third Rock Ventures, a biotech finance firm.\n\nUntil now, these multi-cancer detection tools have been tested on blood samples from people with and without cancer to estimate their accuracy. The new study was the first \"real world\" test in routine medical care, following patients through surgery or other treatment to see how they fared.\n\nNearly 10,000 women 65 to 75 years old with no history of cancer were recruited through the Geisinger Health System in Pennsylvania and New Jersey. That's because some deadly cancers such as ovarian have no screening test now, and women in this age group have a higher risk for cancer yet are young enough to benefit from finding it early, Papadopoulos said.\n\nThey were encouraged to continue regular screenings such as mammograms and colonoscopies and were given the blood test, which was repeated if findings suggested cancer. If the second test also was suspicious, they were given a whole-body PET-CT scan, an imaging test that costs around $1,000 and can reveal the location of any tumors.\n\nAfter one year, 96 cancers had been diagnosed. Usual screenings found 24 and the blood test helped find 26 others. The remaining 46 were found because symptoms appeared or the cancer was discovered in other ways, such as an imaging test for a different reason.\n\nBlood testing \"made a genuine difference in discovering cancers in a small number of patients,\" took seven months on average, and led 1% of women to get a PET scan they turned out not to need, Lichtenfeld said.\n\nThe blood test helped reveal six ovarian cancers, including one in Rosemary Jemo, 71, a hairdresser and exercise instructor who lives near Hazleton in eastern Pennsylvania.\n\n\"I would have never known ... I didn't feel anything\" before the football-sized tumor was found, she said. Surgeons were able to remove it and she is being monitored now.\n\nAlberto Bardelli, a cancer specialist at the University of Turin in Italy who discussed the study at the conference, called it \"extraordinary\" and said it shows a way to move liquid biopsies into routine care.\n\nThe test still needs to be improved, but \"it can become very valuable,\" he said.\n\nThe research was funded by foundations and government grants. Many study leaders have financial ties to Thrive or other companies related to the work and Johns Hopkins holds some patent rights.\n\nSome companies may seek to market liquid biopsies under rules that allow certain tests to be sold without federal Food and Drug Administration approval.\n\nThrive's CEO Dave Daly said the company plans a larger, definitive study and is committed to working with the FDA, but that \"all options are on the table\" for developing the test.\n\nCost hasn't been decided, he said, but will be \"in the hundreds of dollars, not the thousands.\"\n\n-- --\n\nMarilynn Marchione can be followed on Twitter: @MMarchioneAP\n\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute's Department of Science Education.

        "body": "SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina -- Authorities in Bosnia's semi-autonomous Serb-run territory have conceded that a failure to enforce strict social distancing over Orthodox Easter has led to a sharp spike in newly registered coronavirus cases.\n\n\"I am afraid that we are now paying the price for what has happened during Orthodox Easter. despite repeatedly pleading with citizens to respect (social distancing) rules,\" Radovan Viskovic, prime minister of Republika Srpska, told local media Thursday.\n\nAlthough Republika Srpska had restrictions on public activity in place when Orthodox Easter was observed on April 19, Bosnian Serb authorities tolerated gatherings in several churches. At one, priests were recorded using a shared spoon for the Communion ritual.\n\nEpidemiologists in Republika Srpska reported Thursday that 53 confirmed virus cases were recorded in the region over the past 24 hours. A day earlier, the region registered 59 new cases, more than on any other single day since Bosnia's coronavirus outbreak started in early March.\n\nThe Bosnian Serb health minister, Alen Seranic, urged people to continue practicing social distancing and to keep wearing face masks in public despite the gradual easing of coronavirus restrictions that began in Republika Srpska this week.\n\nBosnian Serb authorities have started allowing people over the age of 65 and younger than 18 to leave their homes for a few hours each day after weeks of requesting them to remain in their private residencies at all times. Some small businesses were also allowed to open.\n\nRepublika Srpska and a Bosniak-Croat federation make up ethnically divided Bosnia, which has a population of 3.5 million.\n\nSo far, over 35,000 people in the country have been tested for the novel coronavirus. Officials reported that total confirmed cases during the pandemic reached 1,757 as of Thursday, including 69 deaths.\n\nMost people sickened by the virus suffer mild or moderate symptoms, but for some it can prove more severe, or fatal.\n\nFollow AP news coverage of the coronavirus pandemic at https://apnews.com/VirusOutbreak and https://apnews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak",

        "body": "LE PECQ, France -- Medics at a hospital that treated the first child to die in France with a puzzling inflammatory condition seemingly linked to the new coronavirus initially thought the 9-year-old had scarlet fever, and sent him home.\n\nThe boy then suffered a heart attack at home that night, resulting in brain damage that later led to his death.\n\nDetails of the case were released Friday by the La Timone hospital in the southern French city of Marseille. The child spent six days in intensive care at the hospital after his heart attack in the evening of May 2.\n\nEarlier that afternoon, the boy had been taken to an emergency ward in another of the city's hospitals. There, an experienced pediatrician examined the child and diagnosed symptoms \"similar to scarlet fever,\" said Doctor Fabrice Michel, who heads the pediatric intensive care unit at La Timone. Scarlet fever is generally mild, usually beginning with a temperature and a sore throat, and is easily treated with antibiotics.\n\n\"The child didn't have serious signs, justifying his return home,\" Michel said.\n\nBut the boy suffered a heart attack a few hours later and was rushed to intensive care at La Timone. There, blood tests indicated the boy had been infected with COVID-19 in the previous weeks, although he didn't have its symptoms and was no longer positive for the virus when admitted to hospital.\n\nInstead, some of the boy's symptoms resembled those of Kawasaki disease, a rare blood vessel disorder, Michel said. About 125 children in France have developed Kawasaki-like symptoms during the coronavirus outbreak, arousing suspicions of a link.\n\nThe death at La Timone was the first fatality in France linked to the syndrome. The boy died on May 8.\n\n\"What is certain is that this illness is thankfully very rare,\" Michel said.\n\nDoctors outside of France have also reported small but noticeable upticks of cases, but very few fatalities, involving children with inflammations that required intensive care and other symptoms. Symptoms seen in affected children in France have included persistent high fevers, intense fatigue, rashes and stomach pains, Michel said.\n\nOnly some of the children tested positive for COVID-19, so scientists are unsure whether the symptoms are caused by the new coronavirus or by something else.\n\nThe World Health Organization said Friday that it is studying the condition, which it described as having \"some features similar to Kawasaki's disease and toxic shock syndrome.\"\n\nAP Medical Writer Maria Cheng in London contributed.\n\nFollow AP pandemic coverage at http://apnews.com/VirusOutbreak and https://apnews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak.",

        "authors": [],
        "body": "RIO DE JANEIRO -- Faced with overwhelmed hospitals and surging coronavirus deaths, Brazilian state and city governments are lurching forward with mandatory lockdowns against the will of President Jair Bolsonaro, who says job losses are more damaging than COVID-19.\n\nThe movements of Brazilians have been completely restricted in fewer than two dozen cities scattered across the vast nation of 211 million -- even though Brazil's death toll stands at more than 11,000, Latin America's highest.\n\nWhile public health experts are demanding bolder action, most governors and mayors have not imposed mandatory stay-at-home orders. Their apparent reluctance comes amid Bolsonaro's relentless message for Brazilians to defy regional and local public health efforts to stop the virus' spread.\n\nStricter lockdowns are needed because Brazilian doctors are now being forced to choose who lives and dies and triage situations could generate social unrest if they increase, said Miguel Lago, executive director of Brazil's non-profit Institute for Health Policy Studies, which advises public health officials.\n\n\"We need to avoid a total disaster,\" he said.\n\nLago said mandatory lockdowns across much of the country would help: \"It is late in terms of avoiding hospital collapse, but certainly it isn't too late to avoid a bigger catastrophe.\"\n\nBrazil had more than 165,000 confirmed cases on Tuesday, with the actual figure believed to be much higher because of limited testing. Many intensive care hospital units are full and cemeteries are increasingly overwhelmed with bodies.\n\nBolsonaro, who called the virus a \"little flu,\" has insisted for more than a month that governors are stoking economic carnage with voluntary quarantine recommendations and urges Brazilians to go about their everyday lives.\n\nHe also encouraged protests against the Supreme Court after it affirmed that local governments can impose lockdowns and coronavirus roadblocks and constantly flouts public health recommendations by shaking hands with supporters.\n\nAmid Bolsonaro's rejection of coronavirus danger, most of the country's 27 governors have criticized his stance but none have imposed mandatory statewide lockdown measures recommended by experts. Instead, the governors have either applied selective lockdowns in cities or deferred to mayors to make those decisions.\n\nGovernors had been hoping the virus would not spread in Brazil's warm climate, but the response is also a reflection of Brazil's political landscape because governors depend on mayors to endorse their re-election campaigns.\n\nMany worry that imposing mandatory lockdowns could hurt local leaders in this year's municipal election, decreasing support for incumbent governors in their 2022 campaigns, said Thiago de Arag\u00e3o, director of strategy of the Arko Advice political consultancy.\n\nBut as the death toll rose from less than 7,000 to more than 10,000 last week, local authorities began adopting stricter anti-virus measures.\n\nThe riverside community of Tefe in the Amazon region was among the first, with a lockdown decree specifying criminal charges for residents leaving home except for visits to hospitals, pharmacies and supermarkets. The mayor imposed it because only about half of Tefe's 60,000 residents complied with an earlier recommendation by the governor of Amazonas state to take virus precautions.\n\nThose who did not comply \"think they're immortal, that they won't get it,\" Tefe Mayor Normando Bessa de S\u00e1 said on Facebook.\n\nOver the next three days, the governors of the northern and northeastern states of Maranhao, Para and Ceara decreed lockdowns for their capital cities as intensive-care units filled with COVID-19 patients.\n\nDespite the new lockdowns, Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo still don't have mandatory stay-at-home-orders at the state or city level -- even though they are the hardest hit places in Brazil.\n\nLockdowns \"should have been imposed at least three weeks ago, when the epidemic was already increasing, but not at this speed that it is now,\" said Margareth Dalcolmo, a respiratory physician and researcher with the widely respected Oswaldo Cruz Foundation biological research group.\n\n\"I gave that recommendation more than once,\" said Dalcolmo, among the experts on a COVID-19 panel that advises Rio's governor.\n\nRio Gov. Wilson Witzel has decreed non-binding quarantine recommendations and commerce restrictions through the end of May. He pledged to make police available so the state's 92 mayors can enact lockdowns, instead of imposing them himself.\n\nIn another example of Brazil's scattershot local lockdowns, Rio de Janeiro Mayor Marcelo Crivella on Monday prohibited non-residents from entering 11 neighborhoods and ordered the closure of all businesses except supermarkets and pharmacies in the teeming slums called favelas.\n\n\"People still haven't perceived the need to avoid gatherings, stay home,\" Crivella complained.\n\nFor most people, the new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms including fever and cough. The risk of death is greater for the elderly and people with other health problems.\n\nThe cities of Niteroi and Sao Goncalo near Rio on Monday authorized fines and criminal charges for violating stay-at-home orders. Niteroi police took the temperatures of those entering the city, and put a man and his two dogs inside a police van after he allegedly refused to show documents to justify being out of his home.\n\nIn Sao Paulo state, Gov. Jo\u00e3o Doria last month urged but did not require residents to self-quarantine while shutting down schools and most businesses. Nearly 70% of the state's 44 million people initially complied, but that dropped below 50% in recent weeks, according to cellphone carrier data provided by the state.\n\nDoria, a presidential hopeful, saw his popularity increase as he challenged Bolsonaro. But police stopped enforcing his recommendations after Bolsonaro criticized the handcuffing and detention of a middle-aged woman exercising in a park who resisted removal.\n\nWith noncompliance rising, Doria said last week that \"if we need to step up to a lockdown, we will not hesitate.\"\n\nSao Paulo's mayor this week limited vehicles circulating in the city to 50% of the normal flow. Television images showed long lines of people entering crammed buses with standing room only in clear violation of social distancing guidelines.\n\nPublic health analysts from the Imperial College London, whose COVID-19 research has guided global policymakers, last week called Brazil's anti-virus efforts \"partially successful.\"\n\n\"In the absence of the introduction of further control measures that will more strongly curb transmission, Brazil faces the prospect of an epidemic that will continue to grow exponentially,\" they wrote.",

    "Brazil expands use of unproven drug as virus toll rises": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "RIO DE JANEIRO -- President Jair Bolsonaro unveiled rules Wednesday expanding the prescription of chloroquine, the predecessor of an anti-malaria drug promoted by U.S. President Donald Trump, for coronavirus patients despite a lack of clinical proof that it is effective.\n\nChloroquine was already being used in Brazil for COVID-19 patients who are hospitalized in serious condition, and under the new regulations, it can be given to people with lighter symptoms such as abdominal pain, cough or fever, according to the Health Ministry.\n\n\"There is still no scientific evidence, but it is being monitored and used in Brazil and worldwide,\" Bolsonaro, who has likened the virus to a \"little flu\" and feuded with local governments over their stay-at-home measures, said via his official Facebook page. \"We are at war: 'Worse than being defeated is the shame of not having fought.'\"\n\nMore than 291,000 coronavirus cases have been confirmed in Brazil, the third most in the world after the United States and Russia, and the announcement came a day after the country's single-day death toll from the virus hit a new high of more than 1,100. Officials said Wednesday that 888 more died in the subsequent 24 hours.\n\nTrump has promoted treating COVID-19 with hydroxychloroquine, a variant considered less toxic and more effective than chloroquine, and he announced Monday that he was taking the drug as a precaution. No large, rigorous studies have found either drug safe or effective for preventing or treating the virus.\n\nBolsonaro, a conservative populist and nationalist, has long expressed admiration for Trump and enthusiasm for chloroquine. Brazil's new guidelines were approved by interim Health Minister Gen. Eduardo Pazuello, who had no health experience prior to becoming the ministry's No. 2 official in April.\n\nPazuello's appointment to the top job came after then-Health Minister Luiz Henrique Mandetta was fired last month for publicly supporting state governors who shut down nonessential businesses and adopted other measures against the virus, and after Mandetta's replacement, Nelson Teich, resigned last week. Teich did not explain why he left, but he had publicly disagreed with Bolsonaro over chloroquine.\n\nSpeaking to a group of street cleaners in the capital, Brasilia, Bolsonar suggested Wednesday that he has no plans to replace Pazuello: \"This one is going to stay for a long time.\"\n\nOfficials say nearly 19,000 people have died of the coronavirus in Brazil so far, and experts warn that low testing rates mean the true number of cases is likely far higher.\n\nHealth systems in various states have gone over capacity, with overwhelmed intensive care units unable to take in new COVID-19 patients, and experts say rising numbers of people are dying at home.\n\nCemeteries are using backhoes to dig hundreds of graves at a time, and Manaus in the heart of the Amazon rainforest is burying the dead in mass graves.\n\nGen. Pazuello appointed nine more military officers to the Health Ministry on Tuesday, Folha de S. Paulo reported, including his No. 2, Col. Antonio Elcio Franco Filho.\n\nAlso Wednesday, Bolsonaro announced the resignation of Culture Secretary Regina Duarte, a former soap opera star who was recently criticized by many in the opposition and the arts community for downplaying torture during the 1964-1985 dictatorship and who had warned against the dangers of \"unbearable morbidity\" around the virus.\n\nBolsonaro continues to oppose governors and mayors who are renewing stay-at-home recommendations or introducing stricter measures.\n\nThe former army captain has argued in favor of restarting the economy, even though experts say Brazil has yet to reach the peak of the pandemic. He believes that containment measures are too painful in a country where tens of millions of workers depend on low-paid jobs in the informal sector.\n\nSeveral large observational studies, including one in U.S. hospitals for veterans, have not found benefit from hydroxychloroquine for treating COVID-19. Earlier this year scientists in Brazil stopped part of a study of chloroquine after seeing heart rhythm problems among patients taking a higher of two doses being compared.",

    "Buyer beware? What to know about direct-to-consumer antibody tests": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "You may have heard a lot about COVID-19 antibody testing recently. In fact, your doctor may have even offered you the option of getting the test.\n\nJust because you can get an antibody test, should you?\n\nAntibody tests are most useful from a public health perspective to estimate how many people have been previously exposed to the virus, experts say.\n\nBut they admit that for individual people hoping to use the tests to make better decisions about their health, antibody results may be less helpful, at least until questions around their accuracy are resolved and scientists learn more about recovered COVID-19 patients.\n\nNevertheless, major diagnostic laboratory companies have ramped up their performing capacity to offer these tests directly to consumers. Quest diagnostics, one of the major players, has offered 975,000 COVID-19 antibody tests in just over a month, a number that could increase to 1.4 million each week.\n\nHere's what you should know and consider before getting a COVID-19 antibody test.\n\nWhat's an antibody test?\n\nAntibody tests use a blood sample, either through a fingerprick or blood draw, to determine whether or not you were previously infected with the virus that causes COVID-19.\n\n\"Antibodies are markers of an infection you had,\" Dr. David Grenache, president-elect of American Association for Clinical Chemistry and chief scientific officer of TriCore Reference Laboratories, told ABC News.\n\nWhat types of antibody tests are available?\n\nNot all antibody tests are created equal. There are two major types of COVID-19 antibody tests available to consumers: rapid antibody tests, which, like a pregnancy test, can give yes or no results within minutes, or a laboratory-based antibody test, which can take a couple of hours to process and provide more information on the level of antibodies present.\n\nDr. James Baker, who specializes in immunology and diagnostic laboratory tests, says some rapid antibody tests are very good at detecting people with very high levels of antibodies but the \"low level positives are hard to read.\"\n\nAre all antibody tests on the market reliable?\n\nUnfortunately no. It is your responsibility along with your provider to make sure the test you pay for can be trusted. Before you purchase a test ask your health care provider whether or not the test has been reviewed by the Food and Drug Administration.\n\nBe on the lookout too for any important disclosures. The FDA may have granted emergency use authorization for the test.\n\nInquire into the sensitivity and specificity of the test. Sensitivity refers to \"how often does this test get the correct result in a person that has the antibodies,\" said Dr. David Grenache. A test with low sensitivity means that it \"has the potential to give false negative results, meaning that the antibodies are actually present, but the test fails to detect it,\" he noted.\n\nAccording to Grenache, specificity refers to the tests' ability to accurately return a negative result.\n\nAt the start of the U.S. pandemic, the FDA allowed commercial manufacturers to distribute their own antibody tests as long as they had self validated their own tests and provided evidence to the FDA.\n\n\"So many tests of suboptimal quality have flooded the market and that's been a serious cause for concern,\" said Grenache.\n\nThe FDA more recently tightened its policies following criticism from medical experts and government officials. Now all commercial manufacturers are required to apply for emergency authorization and provide the FDA with more thorough data about their tests' performance. The FDA will review this data to decide whether or not the test can remain on the market. The FDA said it will begin reviewing these tests and prioritize those that appear to be of more dubious quality.\n\nThe timeline, however, for when this review process will be complete or when the agency will take action against questionable antibody tests is still unclear. For now, only 12 COVID-19 antibody tests have received emergency authorization by the FDA. The FDA publicly shares information about these tests online. Many antibody tests that are not yet FDA reviewed may still be available to consumers.\n\nThe FDA warns that even a good test has its limitations. In areas where the rates of infections are very low, the agency says a second antibody test might be necessary to confirm results.\n\nWhat does an antibody result tell you?\n\nAn antibody test cannot diagnose COVID-19 infection on its own. It can only show you whether or not you were infected with the virus in the past.\n\nIf you've experienced certain symptoms a couple weeks ago and are believe you may have had COVID-19, an antibody test might be useful in determining whether or not you were in fact infected.\n\nKnowing you have antibodies to COVID-19 may also make you an eligible candidate to donate plasma for convalescent plasma therapy, an experimental COVID-19 treatment.\n\nBeyond that, a positive or negative result should not change the way you behave.\n\n\"Until we know more, there is not a lot of value to antibody tests right now,\" said Grenache.\n\nScientists are still learning about whether or not antibodies confer any protection or immunity from future reinfection. In fact, the World Health Organization has cautioned against issuing \"immunity passports\" for people who test positive, saying \"at this point in the pandemic, there is not enough evidence about the effectiveness of antibody-mediated immunity.\"\n\nCityMD recently apologized and reversed a previously incorrect statement shared with consumers through its patient portal which said, \"Positive result on the COVID-19 antibody test confers immunity.\"\n\nBaker warns that testing positive for antibodies does not necessarily confer immunity.\n\n\"People need to understand that they may not be totally resistant to reinfection and need to be continue to be careful and distant,\" he said.\n\nTiming is important\n\nAntibody tests typically detect one to two different classes of antibodies, which are produced by the body at different times during the course of infection and recovery.\n\nMost of the antibody tests authorized by the FDA only detect IgG antibodies. It is estimated that IgG COVID-19 antibodies typically develop around seven to 10 days after infection. That means if you take an antibody test within a week or two of being infected, the test may deliver a negative result because it couldn't find the tell-tale antibodies in your blood.\n\n\"Even a very sensitive IgG test will only result in a positive result late on. It could be a couple weeks and you might still not have antibodies detected. You may have a false negative because it's too close to when you thought you were infected,\" said Baker.\n\nBottom line: Ultimately it's your choice whether or not to get an antibody test. Baker says that consumers should keep their providers accountable.\n\n\"If they can't explain what the test means to me in a way I can understand they shouldn't be providing the test,\" he said.",

As a result of that contact, he was tested but that came back negative.\n\nHe is in self-quarantine as well.\n\n\"As Dr. Hahn wrote in a note to staff yesterday, he recently came into contact with an individual who has tested positive for COVID-19,\" the FDA said in a statement. \"Per CDC guidelines, he is now in self-quarantine for the next two weeks. He immediately took a diagnostic test and tested negative for the virus.\"\n\nBoth men will testify by video -- \"due to these unusual circumstances\" -- at Tuesday's Senate Health Committee hearing about the government response to COVID-19.\n\n\"I asked the White House to allow Dr. Hahn and Dr. Redfield to testify by videoconference at this important hearing which is less than three days away,\" Chairman Sen. Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn., said in a statement. \"I am grateful that White House Chief of Staff, Mark Meadows, approved a one-time exception to the Administration's policies about hearings, and has agreed that Dr. Hahn and Dr. Redfield will testify at this hearing by videoconference due to these unusual circumstances.\"\n\nDr. Anthony Fauci will also be testifying at the hearing after the White House rejected a request for him to testify at a House hearing last week.\n\nHahn and Redfield would have regularly come in contact with Vice President Mike Pence and President Donald Trump in consulting with the White House coronavirus task force. Both men have been tested multiple times and come back negative, though it's unclear if they've been tested again this weekend.\n\nTrump said on Friday he would \"probably\" have another test after a military service member -- a personal valet who had brought him Diet Cokes in the Oval Office -- had tested positive.\n\nPence's press secretary, Katie Miller, who's married to top Trump policy adviser Stephen Miller, also was revealed to have tested positive for the coronavirus on Friday.\n\nIt is not clear who tested positive for coronavirus and came into contact with Redfield and Hahn.",

The agency's case definition includes current or recent COVID-19 infection or exposure to the virus, a fever of at least 100.4 for at least 24 hours, severe illness requiring hospitalization, inflammatory markers in blood tests, and evidence of problems affecting at least two organs that could include the heart, kidneys, lungs, skin or other nervous system. The name and definition are similar to those used in Europe, where the condition was first reported several weeks ago.\n\nThe condition has been reported in at least 110 New York children and in several kids in other states. A few children have died.\n\nSome children may have symptoms resembling Kawasaki disease, a rare condition in children that can cause swelling and heart problems.\n\nReported cases have all involved children but the CDC said it is unknown if the condition can occur in adults.\n\nDoctors should be on the lookout for the condition and report suspected cases to local or state health departments. It should be suspected in all deaths in children who had evidence of COVID-19 infection, the CDC said.\n\nChildren are less likely than adults to develop COVID-19 and their illnesses usually are less severe although they can spread the disease without showing symptoms.\n\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute's Department of Science Education.

    "COVID-19 data sharing with law enforcement sparks concern": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "NASHVILLE, Tenn. -- Public health officials in at least two-thirds of U.S. states are sharing the addresses of people who have the coronavirus with first responders. Supporters say the measure is designed to protect those on the front line, but it's sparked concerns of profiling in minority communities already mistrustful of law enforcement.\n\nAn Associated Press review of those states found that at least 10 states also share the names of everyone who tests positive.\n\nSharing the information does not violate medical privacy laws, under guidance issued by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Law enforcement officials say the information helps them take extra precautions to avoid contracting and spreading the coronavirus.\n\nBut civil liberty and community activists have expressed concerns of potential profiling in African-American and Hispanic communities that already have an uneasy relationship with law enforcement. Some envision the data being forwarded to immigration officials.\n\nIn Tennessee, the issue has sparked criticism from both Republican and Democratic lawmakers who only became aware of the data sharing earlier this month.\n\n\"The information could actually have a 'chilling effect' that keeps those already distrustful of the government from taking the COVID-19 test and possibly accelerate the spread of the disease,\" the Tennessee Black Caucus said in a statement earlier this month.\n\nMany members of minority communities are employed in industries that require them to show up to work every day, making them more susceptible to the virus -- and most in need of the test.\n\nThe AP review shows that public health officials in at least 35 states share the addresses of those who have tested positive for the coronavirus -- provided by the state or local health departments to emergency dispatch centers that request it. In at least 10 of those states, health agencies also share their names: Colorado, Iowa, Louisiana, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, North Dakota, Ohio, South Dakota and Tennessee. Wisconsin did so briefly but stopped earlier this month.\n\nThomas Saenz, president of the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, said law enforcement agencies should explain why they are collecting names or addresses and assure minority communities that the information won't be turned over to the federal government. He noted the Trump administration's demands that local governments cooperate with immigration authorities as a concern.\n\n\"We should question why the information needs to be provided to law enforcement, whether there is that danger of misuse,\" Saenz said.\n\nLaw enforcement officials note they have long been entrusted with confidential information -- such as social security numbers and criminal history. The COVID-19 information is just a continuation of that trend.\n\nAccording to the national Fraternal Order of Police, more than 100 police officers in the United States have died from the coronavirus. Hundreds more have tested positive, resulting in staffing crunches.\n\n\"Many agencies before having this information had officers down, and now they've been able to keep that to a minimum,\" said Maggi Duncan, executive director of the Tennessee Association of Chiefs of Police.\n\nCritics wonder why first responders don't just take precautions with everyone, given that so many people with the virus are asymptomatic or present mild symptoms. Wearing personal protective equipment only in those cases of confirmed illness is unlikely to guarantee their protection, they argue.\n\nIn Ohio, Health Director Dr. Amy Acton issued an order April 24 requiring local health departments to provide emergency dispatchers the names and addresses of people within their jurisdictions who tested positive for COVID-19. Yet the order also stated that first responders should assume anyone they come into contact with may have COVID-19. That portion of the order puzzles the American Civil Liberties Union.\n\n\"If that is a best or recommended practice, then why the need or desire to share this specific information with first responders?\" said Gary Daniels, chief lobbyist for the ACLU's Ohio chapter.\n\nDuncan said having the information beforehand is valuable because it allows officers \"to do their jobs better and safer.\"\n\nTo use the data, officers aren't handed a physical list of COVID-19 patients. Instead, addresses and names are flagged in computer systems so that dispatchers can relay the information to officers responding to a call.\n\nIn Tennessee, the data is purged from the emergency communications system database within a month, or when the patient is no longer being monitored by the health department, according to health officials and agreements the AP reviewed.\n\nFirst responders also must agree they won't use the data to refuse a call for service, a requirement also implemented in most other states using the information.\n\nIn Ohio's Franklin County, which includes the state capital, health officials reported 914 confirmed and probable cases to dispatch agencies in May and April, but removed those names from the list after patients spent 14 days in isolation, said spokeswoman Mitzi Kline.\n\nSome are not convinced. The Tennessee Immigrant and Refugee Rights Coalition described sharing the medical information as \"deeply concerning,\" warning that doing so may undermine the trust governments have been trying to build with immigrants and communities of color.\n\n\"Tell us how it's working for you, then tell us how well it's been working. Don't just tell us you need it for your job,\" said state Rep. G.A. Hardway, a Memphis Democrat who chairs the legislative black caucus.\n\nThe data remains highly sought after by law enforcement. In Pennsylvania, two police unions sued to force local health officials to disclose both patient names and addresses. The lawsuit is still pending.\n\nNew Hampshire health officials agreed to start sharing names and addresses in mid-March, but initially there was a misunderstanding. Some first responders also informed local leaders of current cases, said state health department spokesman Jake Leon.\n\nThat has stopped and \"we have not experienced additional issues,\" Leon said.\n\nAssociated Press writers Andrew Welsh-Huggins in Columbus, Ohio; Nomaan Merchant in Houston; Holly Ramer in Concord, New Hampshire; Mark Scolforo in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania; Todd Richmond in Madison, Wisconsin; and Lindsay Whitehurst in Salt Lake City contributed to this report.\n\n-- -- -- --\n\nKimberlee Kruesi can be reached at https://twitter.com/kkruesi\n\n-- -- -- -- --\n\nFollow AP coverage of the pandemic at https://apnews.com/VirusOutbreak and https://apnews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak.",

        "authors": [],
        "body": "LOS ANGELES -- Two groups of inmates at a Los Angeles County jail tried to infect themselves with the coronavirus by sharing water and a mask, and within two weeks 30 prisoners tested positive, authorities said Monday.\n\nSheriff Alex Villanueva at a briefing showed surveillance videos from two dormitory units at the North County Correctional Facility in Castaic.\n\nThe footage captured inmates in one unit sharing a container of hot water and others in a second unit sniffing a mask.\n\nTwo of the 30 inmates, one from each unit, were later released from the jail as part of the department's effort to reduce the prisoner population systemwide, according to Bruce Chase, the department's assistant sheriff of custody operations.\n\nVillanueva said the inmates used hot water to try to raise their temperatures just before a nurse checked them. An elevated temperature is a symptom for coronavirus.\n\nThe sheriff said the inmates mistakenly believed that if they were infected they would be freed.\n\n\"It's dismaying and it's disheartening,\" he said.\n\nNone of the 30 inmates required critical care when they were sick, though some had moderate symptoms, Chase said. No prisoners within the county's jail system -- the largest in the country -- have died from the virus.\n\nJails and prisons nationwide have become flashpoints in the pandemic. More than 25,000 inmates have been infected and about 350 have died nationwide -- from Rikers Island in New York City to federal, state, and local lockups coast to coast, according to an unofficial tally kept by the COVID-19 Behind Bars Data Project run by UCLA Law.\n\nIn California, five inmates in a state prison in San Bernardino County have died from COVID-19 complications and outbreaks at federal penitentiaries at Terminal Island in San Pedro and Lompoc are considered among the country's worst.\n\nIn Los Angeles County, the North County Correctional Facility didn't have a single COVID-19 case in mid-April. Days later, nine inmates were flagged as being potentially sick, Chase said.\n\nDeputies had been reviewing surveillance video trying to see if the inmates were socially distancing and using their masks when \"lo and behold, we stumbled across footage that was very troubling to us,\" Chase said.\n\nThe mid-April video showed a group of inmates passing around a mask and sniffing it. As authorities were investigating that incident, they found out about a second case where inmates were sipping from the same container of water in late April.\n\nWithin two weeks, 21 inmates in the water container case had COVID-19 and nine prisoners from the mask incident were sick, Chase said.\n\nHe said there's no evidence the mask or water container came from an infected inmate, and the prisoners may have just been trying to spread the virus if they had it. No inmates have admitted to a scheme.\n\nChase said his deputies need to better educate the inmates about the virus and the severity of their actions.\n\n\"We're responsible for their care,\" Chase said. \"That includes protecting them from themselves.\"\n\nThe sheriff's department has released more than 5,000 inmates during the pandemic to create more social distancing and reduce the spread of the virus.\n\nThe department has freed inmates using several qualifications, including if they are within 60 days of release. Inmates who have tested positive for the virus can be released; six total inmates from the North County Correctional Facility have been freed.\n\nInmates who are awaiting COVID-19 test results are being held in a downtown jail's hospital ward or being treated at a county hospital if their symptoms are more severe.\n\nFor most people, the coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia and death. The vast majority of people recover.",

        "authors": [],
        "body": "JOHANNESBURG -- Cape Town has become the center of the COVID-19 outbreak in South Africa and one of Africa's hot spots.\n\nThe popular tourist destination at the southern tip of Africa had more than 12,000 confirmed cases as of Thursday, representing 63% of South Africa's 19,000 cases and about 10% of Africa's 95,000 cases.\n\nGauteng province containing Johannesburg, South Africa's largest city, and the capital, Pretoria, had been expected to be the country's epicenter with its population density and poverty levels, but Cape Town defied predictions with high levels of community transmission.\n\n\"No model upfront predicted what we see in Western Cape (province),\" Health Minister Zwelini Mkhize told journalists Thursday. \"The explosion of cases in Western Cape is out of the expected range and it may be that we need to have additional interventions to try and contain those numbers.\"\n\nCape Town's mountains and beaches may have contributed to its high number of COVID-19 cases. With direct flights to several European capitals, it is believed that tourists not showing symptoms brought the virus and it began to spread undetected.\n\nCape Town is expected to reach its peak of cases around the end of June, while the rest of South Africa is expected to peak in August or September.\n\nSouth Africa may see between 40,000 to 45,000 deaths by November, according to the Modelling and Simulation Hub, Africa, a group of scientists and academics advising the government.\n\nBy year's end some 13 million of South Africa's 57 million people could be infected, their study said.\n\nWhile South Africa reportedly has adequate hospital beds it remains short of intensive care facilities. It has about 3,300 intensive care beds but predictions suggest more than 20,000 could be needed.\n\n\"It is not just a question of beds, it is trained staff and ventilators that will be needed and those are difficult to provide quickly,\" said Juliet Pulliam, director of the South African Center for Epidemiological Modelling and Analysis, who contributed to the study. Cape Town could experience a shortage of ICU beds by the end of June, she warned.\n\nCape Town and Western Cape province are six to eight weeks ahead of the rest of South Africa in the outbreak, health experts said.\n\n\"The lessons we are learning now, we are sharing with the rest of the country,\" said Dr. Nomafrench Mbombo, Western Cape's top health officer.\n\nKhayelitsha, a shantytown of nearly 500,000, is one of Cape Town's hot spots. A field hospital is being constructed to increase the capacity of Khayelitsha District Hospital and should open by June 1, according to Doctors Without Borders.\n\nOne local problem is a delay in test results, in some cases up to eight to 10 days, said Dr. Claire Keene, medical coordinator for the Doctors Without Borders project. Another is that some healthcare workers have tested positive.\n\nA second hot spot in the outbreak is the Tygerburg area near Cape Town International Airport.\n\nCape Town has suffered a massive economic slump from the tourism slump and lockdown restrictions, said Western Cape premier Alan Winde, estimating that 200,000 jobs have been lost and 1.2 million to 1.8 million people in the province are hungry.\n\nWinde, in self-isolation after coming in contact with a TV cameraman who later died of COVID-19, wants restrictions relaxed to boost economic activity.\n\n\"We need to see the economy open up with the new normal operations, but without putting our health system under severe strain,\" he told reporters. \"We need to keep the curve as flat as possible.\"\n\nMeanwhile the rest of South Africa eagerly anticipates the relaxation of lockdown restrictions on June 1. Some government officials have said Johannesburg and other parts of the country will allow more people to return to work and resume the sale of alcohol and cigarettes.\n\nSchools will resume classes, starting with students in grades 7 and 12, but many teachers and parents have expressed concern they will be exposed to the virus.\n\nFollow AP coverage of the pandemic at https://apnews.com/VirusOutbreak and https://apnews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak.",

    "Carnival Cruise Line plans to sail again starting in August": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "Carnival Cruise Line said Monday that it plans to gradually resume cruising in North America in August, nearly five months after it halted operations due to the new coronavirus.\n\nSailings will begin on Aug. 1 or soon after, with eight ships setting off from Galveston, Texas; Miami; and Port Canaveral, Florida. A majority of customers can easily drive to those ports, the company noted. Those cruises would sail to destinations including the Bahamas and Cozumel, Mexico, according to Carnival's web site.\n\nCarnival said its operations from other North American and Australian markets will be on hold through Aug. 31. It is also canceling planned sailings from Vancouver to Honolulu on Sept. 25 and Honolulu to Brisbane, Australia, on Oct. 6.\n\nThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control issued a no-sail order to cruise companies on March 14. It was extended and is set to expire July 24, unless the the agency decides to lift it sooner.\n\nThe CDC says infectious diseases can easily spread when crew members from a ship with an outbreak transfer to other ships. It notes outbreaks of COVID-19 on cruise ships also pose a risk because passengers can spread the disease into communities across the world after disembarkation.\n\nCarnival Cruise Line said it is still determining what specific measures it will take to prevent future outbreaks once it resumes sailing.\n\n\"We continue to engage with the CDC and government officials at a variety of levels about new protocols we would implement prior to a return to sailing,\" the company said. \"We will also be in discussions with officials in the destinations we visit.\"\n\nTara Smith, a professor of epidemiology at Kent State University's College of Public Health, said she's not sure how cruising can be done safely. Even with reduced capacity, she said, ventilation systems can still spread droplets through enclosed spaces.\n\n\"Everything would still have to be distanced,\" she said. \"Dancing, concerts on board, other types of entertainment? Doubtful. Pools? Probably overcrowded. Dining? No idea how they'd do it.\"\n\nCarnival said passengers will get refunds or vouchers for future travel if their cruises are canceled.\n\nMiami-based Carnival Cruise Line is the largest brand owned by Carnival Corp., which also owns Princess, Holland America Line and other brands. Carnival Cruise Line has 27 ships and transported 5 million passengers last year.\n\nOther cruise companies are also making plans to return to service. Royal Caribbean says it intends to resume at least some sailings on June 12, while Norwegian Cruise Like plans to restart some operations on July 1.\n\nCruise companies have taken a huge hit from the new coronavirus, which stranded some ships at sea with sick passengers and crew. A month after the no-sail order went into effect, the CDC said it knew of at least 15 ships with crew still on board showing symptoms of COVID-19.\n\nCarnival Cruise Lines halted new sailings on March 13. It initially expected to be able to sail again on April 10.\n\nStill, parent Carnival Corp. is in good financial shape. It has raised nearly $6 billion in debt and equity since the crisis began, and its CEO recently said the company can last through 2020 with no revenue from cruises. The company wasn't eligible for loan assistance from the U.S. government because it is incorporated in Panama.\n\nCarnival Corp. shares rose 3% on Monday, while those of Royal Caribbean added about 1.5% and Norwegian Cruise Line tacked on 4.3%.",

    "Children leave homes briefly as Turkey eases restrictions": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "ANKARA, Turkey -- Parks filled with the sound of children on Wednesday as Turkey allowed kids ages 14 and under to leave homes for the first time in 40 days.\n\nThe country's youngest population were allowed to venture out for four hours between 11 a.m. and 3 p.m. as Turkey eased some restrictions in place to fight the coronavirus outbreak. Youngsters between the ages of 15 and 20 will be able to leave homes for a few hours on Friday, while senior citizens were briefly allowed out for the first time in seven weeks on May 10.\n\nIn the capital Ankara's main park, Kugulu Park (or Swan Park), young children wearing masks took turns going down slides and on swings. An adjacent street teemed with people and police called on the public to abide by social distancing practices.\n\n\"The weather is beautiful. This was a great opportunity because we were so bored at home,\" said Zeyda Ozdemir, who brought her 8-year-old daughter, Zeynep, to the park.\n\nShe added, however, that she felt \"a little uneasy\" because the park was more crowded than she had hoped it would be.\n\nIn the city's Birlik Mahallesi neighborhood, two children were seen riding their scooters up and down a street while a voice from a loudspeaker on the top of the minaret of a nearby mosque called on the public not to be \"fooled by the arrival of spring and good weather.\"\n\n\"The danger of infection is not over yet,\" the announcement said.\n\nThe government set forth a \"normalization plan\" as the number of confirmed coronavirus cases have dropped, but warned of tougher measures if infections go up again. Malls, hairdressers, barber shops and hair salons were allowed to open Monday.\n\nMeanwhile, a lawyer told The Associated Press that he has filed a lawsuit against China on behalf of a private company that is seeking compensation from the country for financial losses suffered because of the coronavirus outbreak.\n\nLawyer Melih Akkurt said the company was forced to suspend operations during lockdowns. It is the first commercial lawsuit in Turkey against China, where the coronavirus pandemic began, Akkurt said.\n\nThe lawyer wouldn't name the company, saying it wanted to remain anonymous. Other companies were preparing to file similar lawsuits, he said.\n\nThe lawsuit holds China responsible for economic losses, accusing it of among other things, failing to provide timely and accurate data to the World Health Organization, of concealing information on the virus' infectiousness, of silencing doctors and not preventing its spread.\n\n\"My client believes there was intent rather than negligence by China,\" Akkurt said.\n\nChina rejects accusations of a cover-up or of not responding to the outbreak in a timely manner.\n\nTurkey has recorded more than 140,000 cases of the virus and nearly 4,000 deaths attributed to COVID-19, according to a tally by John Hopkins University. The true number is likely much higher because many people haven't been tested, and studies suggest people can be infected without displaying symptoms.\n\nFollow AP pandemic coverage at http://apnews.com/VirusOutbreak and https://apnews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak",

        "body": "Many cleaners of businesses in the New York area have lost their jobs because buildings have shut or because they refuse to work after getting coronavirus symptoms while on the job\n\nLissette Serrano asked for a mask while she did her job cleaning toilets and picking up trash at a busy rest stop on a Connecticut parkway. She was told there were none.\n\nSoon after, Serrano came down with coronavirus symptoms and was told by a nurse to isolate for 14 days. When she told her boss she could not leave home, Serrano said, she was fired.\n\n\"She had said, 'That's just an excuse, you don't want to go to work,\" the 49-year-old Serrano, speaking through a translator, said in Spanish of her employer. \"This is not an excuse.\"\n\nSerrano is one of about 3,000 cleaners in New York's Hudson Valley and Connecticut's Fairfield County who belong to the Service Employees International Union, make just over $16 an hour and in the past couple of months put themselves in harm's way to disinfect offices, train stations and other public areas with little protective equipment, said Alberto Bernardez, a union district leader.\n\nMany, like Serrano, lost their jobs when buildings closed or when they were forced to stay home with COVID-19 symptoms, he said.\n\nAbout 80% of the cleaners are immigrants, mostly Hispanic. Many cannot access unemployment benefits, even though they pay taxes, because they are living in the country without legal permission.\n\n\"Right now people are having to choose between feeding themselves and their family or going to work sick and putting their lives in jeopardy and putting others at risk,\" he said.\n\nSerrano's husband is still working at a box factory, but they need the money from her job to help pay the bills and take care of her 12-year-old daughter. She's not sure what they will do now.\n\n\"I'm so scared,\" she said.\n\nSo is Janeth Baldeon, a 35-year-old janitorial worker who lives in White Plains, New York, with her father and her partner and their two children, a 6-year-old boy and 5-year-old girl.\n\nThe Peruvian immigrant and her father were both laid off from their jobs with a cleaning contractor.\n\nThey had been working at a biotech company, Acorda Therapeutics, in Ardsley, New York, when the offices shut down late last month.\n\nBaldeon said she never felt unsafe on the job and believed she was doing something important to keep the virus from spreading.\n\n\"They made sure we had appropriate gloves and we knew how to utilize them,\" she said. \"Masks weren't very common yet, but we felt that with the gloves we had some level of protection.\"\n\nBaldeon is not sure if or when she will get her job back. Her health insurance runs out in a month. She won't be able to go back unless schools and day care centers reopen.\n\nShe said her co-workers and the immigrant community have banded together to help one another with necessities.\n\nShe hopes to get paid for accumulated vacation days and sick days, but her last check included just one day's pay -- the day she was laid off.\n\n\"At this moment, I haven't really been at a loss for food,\" she said. \"I thank the Lord. I wake up. I just see what needs to be done that day. I'm at home with the children and I just get through the day, day by day.\"\n\nIsabel Herrera, 41, of Bridgeport, is still waiting for unemployment benefits after being laid off last month from the Hilton Garden Inn in Norwalk.\n\nAn immigrant from Honduras, she has a work permit and is the only breadwinner for her 18- and 10-year-old children.\n\nHer landlord has offered to defer her rent payments until she gets back to work. The family is living on donated food and the meals Bridgeport schools are supplying the children, even though the schools remain closed.\n\n\"It has affected us just as much emotionally as economically, because it is difficult to get up, go to your kitchen and see that there is no food,\" she said in Spanish through a translator.",

        "authors": [],
        "body": "BOGOTA, Colombia -- Colombia stepped up measures Thursday night aimed at halting coronavirus infections near the border with Brazil as hospitals grow overwhelmed and cases rise in a vulnerable part of the Amazon home to many indigenous groups.\n\nPresident Iv\u00e1n Duque announced that all residents in the Amazonas department are being ordered to stay inside except to seek food or medical attention. The military has also dispatched troops to strengthen border security.\n\n\"We find ourselves in a situation that could turn critical given the differences we have from an epidemiological viewpoint with neighbors,\" Duque said.\n\nColombia has taken some of the region's strictest measures against the virus, implementing an early nationwide lockdown that remains in effect in much of the country. That stands in stark contrast to Brazil, where President Jair Bolsonaro has criticized attempts by governors and mayors to close nonessential businesses.\n\nColombia's river port city of Leticia and the giant Amazonas department have seen a spike in cases in recent days, swelling from 105 at the start of the month to 924. Doctors say the region's poorly equipped hospitals are crowded, and local officials say they may need to open a new cemetery to handle the number of bodies.\n\nThus far, 30 people have died in the department.\n\nMany indigenous people live near Leticia, making them particularly vulnerable to catching the virus. A total of 146 have been diagnosed, according to the National Indigenous Organization of Colombia.\n\nSix people have died, according to the group.\n\nThe dead include an indigenous actor who starred in the acclaimed Colombian film \"Embrace of the Serpent.\" Antonio Bolivar fell ill with symptoms of COVID-19 in late April and died in early May.\n\nHis son told the newspaper El Tiempo that Bolivar initially used traditional indigenous treatments like covering his body in cold, wet cloths to bring down a 104-degree fever. But his family called an ambulance when the fever spiked back up and he began having trouble breathing.\n\nAn ambulance arrived three hours later, transporting him first to a clinic that refused to receive him because it didn't have an oximeter, which measures the oxygen saturation of blood. He was taken to another clinic, where he waited for two more hours before eventually being admitted.\n\nHe died at the hospital a week and a half later.\n\n\"The doctor came out, said he had been delicate and died,\" Cristian Bol\u00edvar said.",

    "Companies ramping up at-home saliva tests for coronavirus are banking on 'endless' demand": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "A handful of U.S. health care companies are banking on massive demand for coronavirus tests and an easing of federal rules as they prepare for a major production blitz that could bring at-home saliva test kits to millions of Americans in the coming months.\n\n\"The plan is to keep scaling,\" said Jason Feldman, the CEO at Vault Health, one of the companies that recently started selling at-home saliva test kits, which rely on a sample of spit in a test tube, which is mailed into a New Jersey lab to screen for COVID-19.\n\nFeldman said his company currently has the capacity to ship 30,000 tests-a-day to consumers at home, who are asked to submit their sample under the watch of a healthcare professional on a teleconference, before they are shipped to the Rutgers lab for processing. He is hoping that number will steadily rise.\n\n\"The demand is endless,\" he said.\n\nTune into ABC at 1 p.m. ET and ABC News Live at 4 p.m. ET every weekday for special coverage of the novel coronavirus with the full ABC News team, including the latest news, context and analysis.\n\nWhile experts agree that any plan to reopen the country relies on the ability to repeatedly test large swaths of the population, a streamlined approach to achieving that lofty goal remains elusive. But experts are increasingly touting the potential of at-home saliva tests, deemed by researchers to be a more convenient and reliable alternative to nasal swabs.\n\n\"For companies trying to make decisions about who can come into work and who should stay home, a diagnostic test that allows people to test at some level of frequency will be super helpful -- and an at-home saliva test could help allow for that,\" said Dr. John Brownstein, an epidemiologist at Boston Children's Hospital and an ABC News contributor.\n\nUntil last week, at-home testing had been prohibited by regulators. But in a notable breakthrough, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has now cleared the way for a Rutgers University lab and its partners to begin distributing at-home saliva tests to patients by way of mail, not unlike commonly used genealogy DNA tests.\n\nDr. Andrew Brooks, the Rutgers scientist who developed a saliva test, told ABC News the early use of the test at designated field collections sights in New Jersey has already yielded two dramatic benefits. The collection is fast, so screeners at drive-through sites were able to test four times more patients per hour than the more common nasal swabs. And because the test is non-invasive, Brooks said healthcare workers used far less protective gear as they conducted the brief saliva collection.\n\nThe question now is whether the fledgling industry surrounding at-home collection can mobilize to meet the demands of a nationwide crisis.\n\nFeldman and Mehdi Maghsoodnia, the CEO of Vitagene, another test kit distributer, both said in interviews that they would not be able to exceed 30,000 tests per day until more labs are authorized by the FDA to join in processing saliva samples.\n\nLeslie Bryant, a spokesperson for Spectrum Solutions, the test kit developer, agreed that the bottleneck at the lab processing stage would not resolve until more labs are approved by the FDA. Officials at the FDA said they could not comment on whether more lab applications are pending.\n\nIn anticipation of last week's FDA ruling, Bryant said Spectrum has been in frequent communication with manufacturing partners, and has made efforts to forge new relationships in order to meet production demands for the at-home test kits. Those manufacturing partners are \"working feverishly, going 24 hours-a-day, hiring new staff,\" Bryant said.\n\nThe spit-tubes and labels are sent to consumers in a small, re-sealable box, a packet that was subjected to its own approval process to be sure samples could be safely shipped to the lab without breaking or being contaminated. But the ingredient that represented a breakthrough for Spectrum was the preservative inside the tube that enables the sample to be processed.\n\nCOVID-19 tests are intended to be free. But companies marketing the at-home tests are charging around $150.\n\nSpectrum currently has the capacity to distribute more than a million of the test kits per month, according to Bryant, with hopes to reach 15 million test kits per month by the end of 2020.\n\nThe manufacturers and distributors are also waiting for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to formally recommend testing for people without symptoms. Under current federal recommendations, physicians are supposed to prioritize tests for patients showing signs of a coronavirus infection.\n\nMaghsoodnia said once those constraints come off, he believes his company - which has experience processing saliva DNA tests for the nutrition company GMC - said the potential for widespread testing is limitless.\n\n\"We believe we can get to 1 million units a month,\" Maghsoodnia said. \"We are balancing between the need of widespread testing and the strict language of the FDA and CDC guidelines that are restricting widespread testing. We need to get FDA and CDC to put it in the letter of the law.\"",

Having a treatment could have a profound effect on the global pandemic, especially because health officials say any vaccine is likely a year or more away.\n\nThe study, run by the National Institutes of Health, tested remdesivir versus usual care in about 800 hospitalized coronavirus patients around the world. The main result is how long it takes patients to recover.\n\nGilead gave no details on results Wednesday, but said an announcement is expected soon. NIH officials did not immediately reply to a request for comment.\n\nRemdesivir is given through an IV and is designed to interfere with an enzyme that reproduces viral genetic material.

Lastre's other cousin, Violeta Mayorga, 45, had also contracted the virus, but she is recovering at the family's Miami home.\n\nMario Mayorga Jr. was diagnosed with the virus in mid-March and about a week later the other family members tested positive. The patriarch died on April 10, Esperanza Mayorga died nine days later and Mario Mayorga Jr. died on Sunday, according to Lastre.\n\n\"Ever since we got the stay-at-home order, every weekend we got bad news,\" she told ABC News.\n\nMario Mayorga Jr., who was a supervisor for a cleaning service that had medical office clients, came down with a fever and dry cough around mid-March and went to a doctor, according to Lastre. Although he wasn't experiencing respiratory issues related to COVID-19, he was instructed to stay at home, and self-isolate.\n\n\"I had video chatted with him during that time,\" Lastre recalled. \"He looked like he had a very bad flu.\"\n\nA few days after that visit, Mario Jr. began to suffer respiratory problems and was admitted to the hospital where he tested positive, Lastre said. Over the next few weeks, Mario Jr.'s condition began to decline, and he needed a bypass surgery and a ventilator, according to his cousin.\n\nTune into ABC at 1 p.m. ET and ABC News Live at 4 p.m. ET every weekday for special coverage of the novel coronavirus with the full ABC News team, including the latest news, context and analysis.\n\nThe remaining family members were tested shortly after he was hospitalized but the first results didn't show any signs of the disease. Mario, Sr., however, was growing more stressed as his son's condition didn't show any signs of improvement, according to Lastre.\n\n\"He locked himself in his room and kept wondering what if something bad happens to [his son]?\" she said. \"He wasn't eating.\"\n\nThe family took Mario Sr. to the hospital over his stress and the family was retested for the virus. This time they all came back positive, and had to be hospitalized, according to Lastre.\n\n\"It was about three to 5 days from one person showing symptoms to the next one,\" Lastre said. \"We thought they would all show symptoms at the same time.\"\n\nEveryone but Violeta Mayorga's condition declined so rapidly that Lastre said she was unsure if Mario Jr. was ever told about his parents' deaths before his own passing.\n\n\"Between the ventilator and the sedatives, I don't know how much he was aware of in the last few weeks,\" she said.\n\nLastre said their deaths were a terrible end to a long journey. The family moved from Nicaragua to America in the '80s, worked hard and gave back to the community.\n\nMario Mayorga Sr. worked in a funeral home and Esperanza worked as a nanny for many years before becoming a homemaker, according to Lastre.\n\n\"They were grateful to be here and become U.S. citizens,\" she said. \"This has been a family who has been together for so long and built so much together.\"\n\nVioleta Mayorga, who works as a hospital clerical worker, is back in the house but has to remain isolated from her 8-year-old son, according to Lastre. She said her cousin's been struggling through this, especially since she hasn't had any physical contact with her friends and family, but support she has received through messages, calls and video has helped.\n\n\"She has to reinvent this life and start fresh without them,\" Lastre said. \"It's a lot to handle.

        "body": "The virus that causes COVID-19 can be found in semen, Chinese researchers report in a small study that doesn't address whether sexual transmission is possible.\n\nDoctors detected the virus in semen from six of 38 men hospitalized with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19. Four were still very sick with the disease while two were recovering.\n\nThe report from Shangqiu Municipal Hospital in China was published Thursday in JAMA Network Open.\n\nThere was no long-term follow-up so it is not known how long the virus may remain in semen or if men can spread it to their partners during sex.\n\nThe results contrast with a study of 34 Chinese men with COVID-19 published last month in the journal Fertility and Sterility. U.S. and Chinese researchers found no evidence of virus in semen tested between eight days and almost three months after diagnosis.\n\nDr. John Hotaling of the University of Utah, co-author of that report, said the new study involved much sicker men, most with active disease.\n\nAuthorities believe the coronavirus mainly spreads from droplets produced when infected people cough, which are inhaled by people nearby.\n\nSome studies have reported finding the virus in blood, feces and tears or other fluid from COVID-19 patients with inflammation in their eyes.\n\nEvidence suggesting that other infectious viruses including Zika and Ebola may be sexually transmitted has prompted questions about the coronavirus.\n\nHotaling said it's an important public health concern but that more research is needed to provide a definitive answer.\n\nThe American Society for Reproductive Medicine said the new study shouldn't be cause for alarm. To be safe, though, \"it may be wise to avoid sexual contact with men until they are 14 days without symptoms,\" Dr. Peter Schlegel, the group's immediate past president, said in a statement.\n\nFollow AP Medical Writer Lindsey Tanner at @LindseyTanner\n\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute's Department of Science Education.

    "Coronavirus lessons from Roosevelt outbreak helped 2nd ship": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "WASHINGTON -- The Navy destroyer USS Kidd was heading east across the Pacific from Pearl Harbor when it added an unusual twist to its transit -- a quarantine-and-isolation drill. The practice was part of a new protocol built on lessons from a coronavirus outbreak aboard an aircraft carrier soon to be sidelined with sickness.\n\n\"That ... actually helped us quite a bit to prepare for what was to come,\" the Kidd's commanding officer, Cmdr. Nathan Wemett, said in a telephone interview Thursday from aboard the ship.\n\nWhat was coming a few weeks later for Wemett and his crew of about 330 was a COVID-19 outbreak that is just the second aboard a Navy ship at sea. Nearly one-quarter of the Kidd's crew has the virus. Still, lessons learned from the outbreak aboard the aircraft carrier, the USS Roosevelt, has allowed the Kidd to avoid a similar spectacle of crisis.\n\nThe Kidd's circumstance is not completely comparable to that of the nuclear-powered Roosevelt, whose crew of 4,900 is far larger and whose presence in the Pacific is a bigger symbol of American power. But Wemett says his ship benefited from information and guidance derived from the unfolding and unforeseen disaster aboard the aircraft carrier.\n\nFor example, on April 20, the Kidd received new medical guidance on additional symptoms to be watching for as indicators of possible coronavirus.\n\n\"That drove us to report our first case\" that same day, Wemett said. The ill sailor was medically evacuated to a medical facility in San Antonio two days later for testing, and the following day a positive result was reported. By this time the ship was putting its at-sea drills to use by placing some crew members in isolation.\n\nEven before the first test result was known, the Navy assembled a medical team in the United States and dispatched it to the Kidd. The team leader, Cmdr. Michael Kaplan, the director of medical services at Naval Hospital Jacksonville in Florida, said he was not standing by in anticipation of such a mission.\n\n\"We had no heads up whatsoever,\" Kaplan said.\n\nBut the team was on its way in a few hours and arrived aboard the Kidd by helicopter the same day. By evening the doctors had tested about 25 people, and within 24 hours nearly a quarter of the crew had been tested. The Navy also diverted an amphibious assault ship, the USS Makin Island, to provide additional support to the Kidd. The Makin Island has fully equipped medical facilities, including an intensive care unit.\n\nKapan' said his team also made a point of testing sailors without coronavirus symptoms, drawing on the Roosevelt experience, which initially tested only those with symptoms, not realizing that asymptomatic people can be transmitters of the virus. Kaplan had the asymptomatic cases isolated on board.\n\n\"We didn't know how long it would take to get back on land, and we wanted to do everything we could to try to minimize the spread on the ship,\" Kaplan said.\n\nAs of Thursday, 78 members of the Kidd's crew had tested positive. None is hospitalized.\n\nNot all aspects of the medical and operational response taken aboard the Roosevelt are known publicly, and that entire episode is now under investigation, including questions about how the virus got aboard in the first place. Just over 1,100 members of the Roosevelt crew have tested positive, and one died of complications from the disease. The Roosevelt's skipper, Capt. Brett E. Crozier, was fired for distributing a letter pleading for faster Navy action to protect his crew, and the official who ordered his removal from command, Thomas Modly, resigned a few days later as the acting Navy secretary.\n\nAt the outset of the Roosevelt's problem, senior Navy officials appeared to underestimate their ability to contain it and keep the warship from being sidelined.\n\nTouting the Navy's response, Modly told reporters on March 24, two days after the first case was confirmed: \"This is an example of our ability to keep our ships deployed at sea, underway even with active COVID-19 cases.\"\n\nIn contrast, the Kidd ended its Central America mission shortly after getting its first coronavirus case, based on a plan made in advance by the U.S. Navy 4th Fleet organizers of the counterdrug operation. Once a ship had a certain number of symptomatic sailors, it was to head for the nearest appropriate U.S. port. Wemett declined to be more specific than to say the triggering number was less than 10.\n\nThe Kidd headed for San Diego, where it arrived Tuesday and moved most of the crew ashore to off-base housing.\n\nThe paths of the Kidd and the Roosevelt diverged in a more literal sense. They initially deployed together on Jan. 17 after the Kidd, home ported at Everett, Washington, joined up with the Roosevelt and the rest of its strike group in San Diego. But the Kidd made it no further than Hawaii, ordered to break off from the strike group and head east again to participate in the Central America counterdrug operation. The Roosevelt and the rest of its strike group, meanwhile, headed to East Asia.",

    "Coronavirus spreads in Yemen with health system in shambles": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "CAIRO -- Hundreds of people in Aden, southern Yemen's main city, have died in the past week with symptoms of what appears to be the coronavirus, local health officials said in interviews with The Associated Press.\n\nThe officials fear the situation is only going to get worse: Yemen has little capacity to test those suspected of having the virus and a 5-year-long civil war has left the health system in shambles.\n\nOne gravedigger in Aden told AP he'd never seen such a constant flow of dead -- even in a city that has seen multiple bouts of bloody street battles during the civil war.\n\nOfficially, the number of coronavirus virus cases in Yemen is low -- 106 in the southern region, with 15 deaths. Authorities in the Houthi rebel-controlled north announced their first case on May 5 and said only two people had infections, one of whom -- a Somali migrant -- died.\n\nBut doctors say the Houthis are covering up an increasing number of cases to protect their economy and troops. And the surge in deaths in Aden -- more than 500 in just the past week, according to the city registrar -- has raised the nightmare scenario that the virus is spreading swiftly in a country with almost no capacity to resist it.\n\nThe upswing in suspected COVID-19 cases in Yemen is sounding alarms throughout the global health community, which fears the virus will spread like wildfire throughout the world's most vulnerable populations such as refugees or those impacted by war.\n\n\"If you have a full-blown community transmission in Yemen, because of the fragility, because of the vulnerability, because of the susceptibility, it will be disastrous,\" said Altaf Musani, the World Health Organization chief in Yemen.\n\nWHO says its models suggest that, under some scenarios, half of Yemen's population of 30 million could be infected and more than 40,000 could die.\n\nHalf of Yemen's health facilities are dysfunctional, and 18% of the country's 333 districts have no doctors. Water and sanitation systems have collapsed. Many families can barely afford one meal a day.\n\nYemen has no more than 500 ventilators and 700 ICU beds nationwide. There is one oxygen cylinder per month for every 2.5 million people. WHO provided some 6,700 test kits to Yemen, split between north and south, and says another 32,000 are coming. The health agency says it is trying to procure more protective equipment and supplies to fight the virus. But WHO said efforts have been hampered because of travel restrictions and competition with other countries.\n\nThe ongoing civil war pits the Houthis, who occupy the north, against a U.S. and Saudi-backed coalition that formed an internationally recognized government in the south. Now that coalition in the South has fragmented: separatists backed by the United Arab Emirates rose up and expelled the government from southern capital Aden last summer and declared self-rule last month. The two factions are fighting in Abyan, a province adjacent to Aden.\n\nThe war has already killed more than 100,000 and displaced millions.\n\nThe two warring sides in Yemen's civil war have taken vastly different approaches to dealing with the pandemic, each in its own way fueling the possible spread of the virus.\n\nThe south is a picture of utter collapse: Rival factions within the U.S. backed coalition are battling for control. No one appears to be in charge as an already wrecked health system seems to have completely shut down.\n\nHealth personnel, with little protective equipment, are terrified of treating anyone suspected of having the coronavirus.\n\nMany medical facilities in Aden have closed as staffers flee or simply turn patients away. No one is answering a hotline set up by U.N.-trained Rapid Response Teams to test suspected cases at home.\n\n\"If you are suspected of having corona and you are in Aden, most probably you will wait at home for your death,\" said Mohammed Roubaid, deputy head of the Aden's health office.\n\nFrom May 7 until Thursday, the city's civil registrar recorded 527 deaths, the head of the office Sanad Gamel told AP.\n\nThe causes of death weren't listed, but the rate was many times higher than the usual average death rate of around 10 people a day, city health official said. Multiple doctors said they were convinced the deaths are COVID-19 related. In a statement Thursday, Save the Children put the toll of people with COVID-19 symptoms in Aden the past week at 385.\n\nIn the north, meanwhile, the Houthi rebels in power there are waging a campaign to aggressively suppress any information about the scale of the outbreak, even as doctors told the AP of increasing infections and deaths.\n\nThe Houthis have refused to release positive test results and intimidated medical staff, journalists and families who try to speak out about cases, doctors and other officials say. Doctors and local health officials said they believed many people are dying of COVID-19 in their homes, undocumented.\n\nDoctors in three northern provinces, including the capital Sanaa, told the AP they have seen increasing numbers of suspected coronavirus cases and deaths. All spoke on condition of anonymity, fearing reprisals from the rebels.\n\nHouthi militiamen have shut down several markets in Sanaa and locked down streets in 10 neighborhoods, barring families from leaving their homes, after suspected cases arose.\n\nMedical staffers said they are under surveillance and can't speak about what they see inside health centers.\n\nBoth local health ministry and international aid officials have been warned not to discuss cases or of possible local transmission of the virus, since the rebels insist the north's few cases came from abroad, according to two officials with knowledge of the discussions.\n\nIn the first week of May, a surge of patients entered the Kuwait Hospital, the sole fully operating COVID-19 treatment center in the capital, said four officials. One official said 50 of them were likely infected with the coronavirus and 15 died later died. Staffers say they believe the patients were infected because Houthi authorities never revealed the results of their tests.\n\n\"When it's negative, they give the results to us,\" the official said.\n\nAn internal document with test results at the hospital on May 4 showed three positive cases. On one page was scribbled the name of a woman who died. The AP obtained a copy of the document, which also circulated on social media. Two officials confirmed its authenticity.\n\nFamilies of those who died of suspected coronavirus infection say they are left in the dark.\n\nRelatives of a man who died in Sanaa recently said Houthi authorities refused to release their father's body from the morgue, saying they were awaiting test results. They believe Houthi officials wanted to bury the body without a mass funeral that could spread the virus.\n\nAfter three days, under heavy pressure from the family, Houthi officials released the body, but not the test results. Two other families told AP about similar experiences.\n\nIn Houthi-controlled Ibb province, a local official said at least 17 people had died. \"The situation is very dangerous and out of control,\" he said. A doctor in Ibb said tests are sent to Sanaa but results are never revealed, adding, \"There are cases, but I'm not allowed to speak.\"\n\nIn Dhamar, a local medical official said at least 10 suspected coronavirus cases had been hospitalized and at least two people had died. One had come from Sanaa, meaning it was a local transmission.\n\n\"We buy plastic sheets and stitch then together to make protective gowns and masks. There is no other way,\" one health offical said.\n\nU.N. officials said the Houthis' control of information about the spread of suspected COVID-19 cases has hampered their response to the outbreak. As long as the Houthis do not officially acknowledge cases, the U.N. cannot rally global donors to send supplies to tackle the outbreak, officials said.\n\nIn the south, authorities announced the first confirmed coronavirus case on April 10, a man in his 70s working at a port in Hadramawt province.\n\nMany families fearing the outbreak fled from Hadramawt to Aden.\n\nTwenty days later, authorities announced a cluster of cases in Aden's densely populated district of Mansoura.\n\nBy early May, city officials reported dozens of deaths per day.\n\nBasic services in Aden were already in shambles because of the civil war. The situation worsened after a separatist group took over.\n\nHealth authorities were split between two camps -- -- those loyal to the internationally-recognized government and those who answer to a group that split off last year -- -- so employees have no clue who to report to, and no one is sure who is making decisions.\n\nIn the midst of the confusion, many health facilities are shutting their doors. At least five doctors suspected of being infected with the coronavirus have died, according to a health ministry official.\n\nAs a result, no one is testing -- and authorities are not eager to see higher numbers anyway, said one official, adding, \"The whole chain is dysfunctional\"\n\nInternational aid agencies believe the coronavirus has been circulating in Yemen since March. But doctors may have missed it in part because of flooding that struck Aden in April, leaving entire sections submerged in sewage and water for weeks.\n\nThat flooding helped cause an outbreak of other diseases, including Dengue fever and Chikungunya, three health officials said. But health offiicals said past outbreaks of these diseases have had nowhere near the same death toll\n\nZakariya al-Qaiti, the outgoing head of Aden's sole isolation center at al-Amal Hospital, said he had no doubt about the cause. \"I can affirm that coronavirus is breaking out in Aden.\"\n\nThe isolation ward has so far received 60 cases, 20 of whom died, officials said.\n\nThe facility is often engulfed in darkness because it runs out of fuel for its power generators. For weeks, it had no equipped laboratory and no special ambulance to bring coronavirus patients.\n\nIt also didn't have any money -- al-Qaiti said the government withheld its budget after the separatist takeover. So its 100 staffers have not been paid, and 15 of them have quit.\n\nThe international humanitarian group Doctors Without Borders is now running al-Amal.\n\nAden resident Assem Sabri said his friend Nabil Abdel-Bari, a young businessman who was suffering from shortness of breath and fever, was refused entry at four hospitals.\n\n\"The doctors took one look at him and shouted, 'You have coronavirus,'\" Sabri said. \"Doctors in Aden have lost all their humanity and mercy. We are heading in a very dangerous direction.\"\n\nAbdel-Bari returned home and died days later, Sabri said.\n\nAt al-Qateea, one of the smallest of Aden's six cemeteries, Abdullah Salem, a gravedigger, said he receives 10 to 15 bodies a day, about 10 times more than normal.\n\nHe said he doesn't know how to deal with the bodies, because burial permits do not list a cause of death.",

    "County has highest rate of COVID-19 cases on West Coast": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "SPOKANE, Wash. -- The highest rate of coronavirus cases of any county on the U.S. West Coast is Washington state's Yakima County.\n\nHealth experts point to a large number of essential workers, a large number of cases in long-term care facilities and a large agricultural workforce living and working in close quarters as the causes. The county has about 250,000 residents.\n\n\"We just haven't been as much down as the rest of the state because our workforce is going to work,'' said Lilian Bravo, a spokeswoman for the Yakima Health District. \"Physically going to work every day is going to put you at a higher risk than others.''\n\nAs of Friday, Yakima County had 1,203 positive cases, a rate of 455 cases per 100,000 residents, the highest in the state. Second was Franklin County at 326 cases per 100,000. The statewide average was 185 cases per 100,000 residents.\n\nYakima County, 140 miles (225 kilometres) southeast of Seattle, also had a relatively high number of deaths from coronavirus with 47. Bravo said people in long-term care facilities account for about a third of cases and most of the deaths from COVID-19 in the county.\n\nBravo said the health district is involved with testing staff and residents at long-term care facilities.\n\nState health officer Dr. Kathy Lofy said Washington Department of Health officials were sent to Yakima to help the long-term care facilities deal with the outbreaks.\n\n\"I think what we're seeing in some of these outbreaks, whether it's a long-term care facility or a food processing plant, is that you get a lot of people together, there's a lot of transmission, and then all these individuals go home and back to their own communities and infect others in their family and others in their community,\" Lofy said.\n\nMeanwhile, nearly 73,000 of the 115,000 Yakima County jobs, or 63%, are in essential industries such as agriculture, health care and wholesale trade, according to the Yakima County Development Association.\n\n\"We're not as shut down as some areas in the state,\" Bravo said.\n\nThe county has a large number of people in the agriculture and food processing industries. Many live and work in close quarters, which can spread the disease.\n\nWith the harvest season just getting underway, Bravo said the health district is wary that the infection rate will continue to grow, especially in housing for migrant workers that tends to be cramped.\n\nThe state recently issued new guidelines to protect agriculture workers against COVID-19.\n\nThe new Department of Labor and Industry rules require growers and operators to have procedures for a suspected or confirmed case of the virus, to educate workers on health recommendations, and to have employees stay home if they are sick. They are also required to ensure social distance and physical barriers between workers, to have hand-washing stations and to increase sanitation.\n\nBut two farmworker groups filed lawsuits in Skagit County Superior Court seeking tougher rules and immediate oversight.\n\nYakima-based advocacy group Latino Civic Alliance is demanding the state adopt enforceable standards to protect agricultural workers from exposure. The organization noted 96% of the state's agricultural workers are Latinos, with many living below poverty levels and without health care benefits.\n\nDespite the high number of cases, the health care system in Yakima County is not overwhelmed, Bravo said.\n\n\"We do have the capacity to serve individuals,'' she said. \"The community has done a great job.''\n\nFor most people, the coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough, that clear up in two to three weeks. But it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia, for some people, especially older adults and people with existing health problems.",

    "Court halts ban on mass gatherings at Kentucky churches": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "FRANKFORT, Ky. -- A federal court halted the Kentucky governor's temporary ban on mass gatherings from applying to in-person religious services, clearing the way for Sunday church services.\n\nU.S. District Judge Gregory F. Van Tatenhove on Friday issued a temporary restraining order enjoining Gov. Andy Beshear's administration from enforcing the ban on mass gatherings at \"any in-person religious service which adheres to applicable social distancing and hygiene guidelines.\"\n\nThe ruling from the Eastern District of Kentucky sided with the Tabernacle Baptist Church in Nicholasville, but applies to all places of worship around the commonwealth. Two other federal judges, including U.S. District Judge David Hale, had previously ruled the ban was constitutional. But also on Friday, Hale, of Kentucky's western district, granted Maryville Baptist Church an injunction allowing in-person services at that specific church to proceed, provided the church abide by public health requirements.\n\nExceptions to the Democratic governor's shutdown order include trips to the grocery store, bank, pharmacy and hardware store. Beshear had previously announced that places of worship in Kentucky will be able to once again hold in-person services starting May 20, as part of a broader plan to gradually reopen the state's economy. Earlier Friday, he outlined requirements for places of worship to reopen, including limiting attendance at in-person services to 33% of building occupancy capacity and maintaining 6 feet (2 meters) of distance between household units.\n\nThe federal judge's order in the Tabernacle Baptist Church case said Beshear had \"an honest motive\" in wanting to safeguard Kentuckians' health and lives, but didn't provide \"a compelling reason for using his authority to limit a citizen's right to freely exercise something we value greatly -- the right of every American to follow their conscience on matters related to religion.\"\n\nTabernacle had broadcast services on Facebook and held drive-in services, but the substitutes offered \"cold comfort,\" according to the opinion. The opinion went on to say that Tabernacle alleged irreparable injury and was likely to succeed on the merits of its federal constitutional claim, as the defendants didn't \"dispute the challenged orders place a burden on the free exercise of religion in Kentucky.\"\n\n\"The Constitution will endure. It would be easy to put it on the shelf in times like this, to be pulled down and dusted off when more convenient,\" Van Tatenhove's opinion read. \"But that is not our tradition. Its enduring quality requires that it be respected even when it is hard.\"\n\nHis opinion says Kentucky's attorney general urged the court to apply the injunction statewide, and since the executive order challenged didn't solely apply to Tabernacle, the injunction granted would also have a similar scope.\n\n\"Both rulings affirm that the law prohibits the government from treating houses of worship differently than secular activities during this pandemic,\" Attorney General Daniel Cameron, a Republican, said in a statement late Friday.\n\nA three-judge federal appeal court panel had last week cleared the way for Maryville Baptist Church to hold drive-in worship services while adhering to public health requirements, an alternative that Beshear has strongly encouraged throughout the coronavirus pandemic. But that panel had stopped short of applying its order to in-person worship services.\n\nMaryville had defied Beshear's order for houses of worship to not hold in-person services amid the COVID-19 outbreak. At least 50 people attended its Easter service at the church, and the church had held other services since. In response, the governor said Kentucky State Police troopers would record license plates and place notices on vehicles telling Easter service attendees they would have to self-quarantine.\n\nThe Bullitt County church had turned to the appeals court after Hale had initially refused to stop Beshear's order from applying to religious services, saying it bans all mass gatherings and thus does not discriminate against religion.\n\nIn his order Friday, Hale said the governor failed to prove there was no less restrictive alternative to help reduce the spread of COVID-19 and failed to address the appeals court's suggestion to limit the number of people who could attend services. He said that the burden of proof was on the governor and Maryville Baptist Church \"would likely succeed on the merits of their claim under the Kentucky Religious Freedom Restoration Act.\"\n\nBeshear's office had not issued a statement on the injunctions as late Friday night.\n\nFor most people, the coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up within weeks. For some, especially older adults and those with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, even death.\n\nFollow AP coverage of the virus outbreak at https://apnews.com/VirusOutbreak and https://apnews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak.",

        "body": "LOUISVILLE, Ky. -- A federal appeals court on Saturday declined to block the Kentucky governor's temporary ban on massing gatherings from applying to in-person religious services.\n\nThe three-judge panel did clear the way for Maryville Baptist Church to hold drive-in worship services while adhering to public health requirements. That's an alternative that Gov. Andy Beshear has strongly encouraged throughout the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nBut the panel stopped short of applying its order to in-person worship services.\n\nThe ruling came soon after the church asked the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for an emergency order stopping Beshear's mass gathering ban from being enforced against religious services.\n\n\"We realize that this falls short of everything the church has asked for and much of what it wants,\"' the Cincinnati-based appeals court panel said Saturday. \"But that is all we are comfortable doing after the 24 hours the plaintiffs have given us with this case.\n\nIt urged a federal district judge to \"prioritize resolution\" of the church's claims in its lawsuit.\n\nBeshear recently announced that places of worship in Kentucky will be able to once again hold in-person services starting May 20. It's part of a broader plan to gradually reopen the state's economy. Exceptions to his shutdown order include trips to the grocery store, bank, pharmacy and hardware store.\n\nIn Saturday's opinion, the judges took note of those \"secular exceptions.\"\n\n\"The breadth of the ban on religious services, together with a haven for numerous secular exceptions, should give pause to anyone who prizes religious freedom,\" the panel wrote, before concluding \"it's not always easy to decide what is Caesar's and what is God's -- and that's assuredly true in the context of a pandemic.\"\n\nThe ruling supports what Beshear has said all along, according to his spokeswoman, Crystal Staley.\n\n\"The governor has allowed and even encouraged hundreds of drive-in services across Kentucky,\" she said in a statement Saturday. \"What the Sixth Circuit decided is that drive-in services are okay, but the governor's order prohibiting in-person services remains in effect. That has been the governor's exact policy since the beginning.\"\n\nMaryville Baptist Church's attorneys -- from the Liberty Counsel, a conservative Christian group -- cited passages from the ruling in claiming a \"stellar victory.\" The group claims Beshear's order violates constitutional protections and Kentucky law.\n\n\"The laws of the commonwealth and the Constitution are not suspended during a crisis or a pandemic,\" said Liberty Counsel Founder and Chairman Mat Staver.\n\nThe appeals court panel said Beshear's orders have \"several potential hallmarks of discrimination.\"\n\n\"We don't doubt the governor's sincerity in trying to do his level best to lessen the spread of the virus or his authority to protect the commonwealth's citizens,\" the panel said. \"And we agree that no one, whether a person of faith or not, has a right to expose the community ... to communicable disease.'\"\n\n\"But restrictions inexplicably applied to one group and exempted from another do little to further these goals and do much to burden religious freedom,\" it added.\n\nAssuming all the same precautions are taken, the panel said: \"Why can someone safely walk down a grocery store aisle but not a pew?\"\n\nThe church turned to the appeals court after a federal judge refused to stop Beshear's order from applying to religious services. U.S. District Judge David Hale said the governor's order bans all mass gatherings and thus does not discriminate against religion.\n\nHale said he would set up additional hearings. But attorneys for the Bullitt County church were dissatisfied with the pace of Hale's consideration of the suit.\n\nMaryville has defied Beshear's order for houses of worship to not hold in-person services amid the COVID-19 outbreak. At least 50 people attended its Easter service at the church, with more services held in the past few weeks.\n\nIn response, the governor said Kentucky State Police troopers would record license plates and place notices on the vehicles of attendees at the Easter service. The notices told attendees they would have to self-quarantine.\n\nFor most people, the new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up within weeks. For some, especially older adults and those with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, even death.\n\nFollow AP coverage of the virus outbreak at https://apnews.com/VirusOutbreak and https://apnews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak.",

    "Cuomo extends New York statewide stay-at-home order until June 13": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "A pandemic of the novel coronavirus has now killed more than 300,000 people worldwide.\n\nMore than 4.4 million people across the globe have been diagnosed with COVID-19, the disease caused by the new respiratory virus, according to data compiled by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering at Johns Hopkins University. The actual numbers are believed to be much higher due to testing shortages, many unreported cases and suspicions that some governments are hiding the scope of their nations' outbreaks.\n\nSince the first cases were detected in China in December, the United States has become the worst-affected country, with more than 1.4 million diagnosed cases and at least 85,581 deaths.\n\nToday's biggest developments:\n\nHere's how the news is developing today. All times Eastern. Please refresh this page for updates.\n\nIn an executive order Thursday night, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo extended the statewide stay-at-home order until June 13 for the regions that do not meet the standards to begin reopening.\n\nMost of the central parts of New York will slowly begin reopening on Friday, but Western New York and the eastern part of the state, from Albany down through the Hudson Valley to New York City and Long Island, will remain closed.\n\nRegions that meet the criteria for reopening before June 13 could see an opening earlier than that date, according to Cuomo. He also said that the stay-at-home order could be extended beyond June 13 for regions where the criteria isn't met.\n\nNew York has more than 343,000 diagnosed cases of COVID-19 in the state and at least 27,641 deaths\n\nDelaware will open beaches and pools at 5 p.m. on May 22, just in time for Memorial Day weekend, Gov. John Carney announced Thursday.\n\nBeaches will be limited to 20% of regular capacity. Beachgoers must follow social distancing requirements, such as keeping 6 feet away from anyone not in their household and wearing face coverings when on the boardwalk.\n\nNonresidents will only be allowed to use the beaches after a 14-day quarantine. Police will be stationed at routes typically used by out-of-state travelers to question visitors, the governor's office said.\n\nRestaurants and bars will remain limited to delivery and takeout only.\n\nA ban on short-term rentals also remains in effect.\n\nLos Angeles County has lost at least 1,709 residents to the coronavirus -- and 51% of those deaths were among people living in institutional settings, mostly nursing homes, the Los Angeles Times reported.\n\nThe county is slowly reopening.\n\nFacilities like tennis courts and equestrian centers can reopen on Friday, as long as people maintain social distancing.\n\nRetail is now permitted to conduct curbside pickup and delivery.\n\nTune into ABC at 1 p.m. ET and ABC News Live at 4 p.m. ET every weekday for special coverage of the novel coronavirus with the full ABC News team, including the latest news, context and analysis.\n\nThe meditation and mindfulness app Headspace is offering a free, one-year subscription to all Americans who are unemployed amid the pandemic, the company said Thursday.\n\n\"While meditation and mindfulness can't change our circumstances in life, it can help us change our perspective on those circumstances,\" Rich Pierson, CEO and co-founder of Headspace, said in a statement Thursday.\n\n\"Now more than ever, that's an incredibly powerful skill to learn,\" he said.\n\nApproximately 36 million Americans have filed for jobless aid.\n\nIn New York state, a phased reopening can begin on May 15 in five regions: North Country, Mohawk Valley, Central New York, Finger Lakes and the Southern Tier, Gov. Andrew Cuomo said.\n\nThe state's remaining four regions -- New York City, Long Island, Mid Hudson, Capital District and Western New York -- have not met the metrics to begin reopening, he said.\n\n\"Phased reopening does not mean the problem has gone away -- it means we have controlled the problem because of what we did,\" Cuomo said. \"I would urge local governments to be diligent about the business compliance and about individual compliance. And if you see a change in those numbers -- react immediately.\"\n\nCuomo again mentioned the \"serious and concerning\" cases of Pediatric Multi-System Inflammatory Syndrome Associated with COVID-19, an inflammatory syndrome, which has features that overlap with Kawasaki disease.\n\nThere are 110 cases in New York state, the vast majority of which are in New York City. Three young people in the state have died.\n\nSixteen other states, as well as Washington, D.C. and six countries in Europe, have reported cases, Cuomo said.\n\nNew York state is leading the national effort \"to understand and combat this new syndrome,\" Cuomo said.\n\nThe largest mall in the U.S., Minnesota's Mall of America, will open the doors of its retail stores on June 1.\n\nWhile retail in the state is permitted to reopen on May 18, mall officials said waiting the rest of the month will allow them time to implement new cleaning and sanitation measures and also allow the stores enough time to rehire and train staff.\n\n\"All dining and attractions will remain closed until further guidance from state officials is provided,\" mall officials said. \"Food establishments may still operate through curbside and delivery.\"\n\nThe Jersey Shore can open on Friday, May 22, though the number of beachgoers will be restricted and visitors must follow social distancing guidelines, New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy announced Thursday.\n\nBoardwalk restaurants must be takeout and delivery only and amusement park rides, games and playgrounds must stay closed, Murphy said.\n\nIt's highly recommended that visitors wear a face covering, Murphy said.\n\nNew Jersey has over 142,000 diagnosed cases of the coronavirus and 9,946 deaths.\n\nMeanwhile, New Jersey's nursing homes have been particularly hit hard by the virus. The state now has over 27,000 cases at long-term care facilities, including 5,168 deaths, Murphy said.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs is working to assist the state, providing five, 10-person health care strike teams who will join the staffs at long-term facilities until June 30, Murphy said.\n\nThe New Jersey attorney general's office started investigating the state's long-term care facilities in April.\n\nThe state has asked the public to report any misconduct anonymously through an online portal.\n\nMinnesota's stay-at-home order will be lifted on Monday, allowing retail stores and malls to open with 50% capacity and social distancing plans in place.\n\nBars and restaurants will remain closed and gatherings must be limited to 10 people.\n\n\"With the capacity that we built while you stayed home, we can chart a new way forward. We can take a measured, Minnesota approach that protects public health and improves economic stability,\" Gov. Tim Walz tweeted Wednesday. \"This means cautious, strategic steps forward. And it means clear measures for determining if and when we need to pull back.\"\n\n\"We are not flipping a switch and all going back to normal at once,\" stressed. \"We are slowly moving a dial.\"\n\nMayor Bill de Blasio said it's \"deeply troubling\" that New York City is now reporting 100 cases of Pediatric Multi-System Inflammatory Syndrome Associated with COVID-19, an inflammatory syndrome which has features that overlap with Kawasaki disease.\n\nOf those 100 young people, 55 tested positive for the coronavirus or antibodies. One New York City child has died, the mayor said.\n\nThere will be weekly webinars with up to 700 pediatric providers to discuss ways to combat the disease, the mayor said.\n\nNew York City is expanding its criteria for who can get tested for the coronavirus, de Blasio said at his Thursday briefing.\n\nNew Yorkers can get tested if they: have symptoms -- regardless of age, chronic conditions or occupation; came in close contact with someone who was confirmed to be positive, regardless of symptoms; work in a congregate residential setting like a nursing home or shelter, regardless of symptoms.\n\nThere are 23 walk-in testing sites in the city and five more are opening, the mayor said.\n\nDe Blasio called it a \"very good day\" as he reported all three daily tracking progress indicators moving in the right direction.\n\nOn Tuesday, 59 people were admitted to city hospitals with suspected COVID-19 symptoms -- down from 78 admissions on Monday.\n\nOn Tuesday, 517 patients were in intensive care units with symptoms -- down from 561 patients on Monday.\n\nAnd 11% of people tested citywide Tuesday were positive -- down from 13% on Monday.\n\n\"Perfect day, New York City!\" the mayor said. \"Let's now put together a bunch of them.\"\n\nAs New Yorkers wait to return to their local restaurants, de Blasio said the possibility of restaurants and bars opening in the city's streets is \"being very thoroughly discussed\" and \"something we might be able to reach.\"\n\n\"I've been talking to restaurant owners ... they're making a great case that this could be a difference maker,\" the mayor said, adding, \"we're not there yet.\"\n\n\"How do you hit that sweet spot where you have the right social distancing and protections, the right capacity ... and the right atmosphere,\" the mayor said. \"We have to be smart about it.\"\n\nThe mayor added that this possibly could only come after New York City meets the city's indicators for 10-14 days and meets the state's indicators -- which is possible to achieve in the first half of June.\n\nA powerful typhoon barreled toward the Philippines on Thursday as local authorities work to evacuate tens of thousands of people from their homes while trying to avoid the coronavirus-related risks of overcrowding emergency shelters.\n\nTyphoon Vongfong was packing maximum sustained winds of 96 mph and gusts of up to 158 mph, according to the latest data from the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration. The storm, the first typhoon to hit the archipelagic country this year, is expected to make landfall on eastern islands later Thursday.\n\nThe Philippines remains under a lockdown to curb the spread of the novel coronavirus. The country has reported nearly 12,000 diagnosed cases of COVID-19 with at least 790 deaths, according to a count kept by Johns Hopkins University.\n\nHarry Roque, spokesperson for the president of the Philippines, said local officials must ensure that social distancing is observed by families as they seek temporary shelter in evacuation centers. He said the government's disaster preparedness protocols would be in full force amid the country's continued fight against COVID-19.\n\n\"We have enough relief foods, our evacuation centers are ready and social distancing will be observed on a per-family basis,\" Roque said during a virtual press conference Thursday.\n\nThe French government warned Thursday that it would be \"unacceptable\" for Sanofi, a Paris-based multinational pharmaceutical company, to reserve the first doses of a COVID-19 vaccine for the United States.\n\nSpeaking to Sud Radio, France's Deputy Finance Minister Agnes Pannier-Runacher said she contacted the firm on Wednesday after its CEO told Bloomberg News he would likely supply a vaccine to the U.S. government first because \"it's invested in taking the risk.\"\n\n\"For us, it would be unacceptable for there to be privileged access to such and such a country for financial reasons,\" Pannier-Runacher told Sud Radio on Thursday.\n\nPannier-Runacher said she spoke to the head of Sanofi's French division who confirmed that its vaccine, when ready, would be available in every country, including France.\n\n\"Not least because [Sanofi] has production capacity in France,\" the deputy minister said.\n\nLast month, Sanofi signed a letter of intent with England-based multinational pharmaceutical firm GSK to jointly develop a vaccine for COVID-19. The companies stated in the letter that they plan to initiate the first phase of clinical trials in the second half of 2020 and, if successful, aim to complete the development required for availability by the second half of 2021.\n\nAn American pilot died when her plane crashed while she was on her way to deliver COVID-19 test kits to a remote village in Indonesia earlier this week, officials said.\n\nJoyce Lin departed from the airport in Sentani in Indonesia's Papua province on Tuesday morning, flying alone in a Kodiak aircraft. Lin, a missionary with Mission Aviation Fellowship, was attempting to bring much-needed supplies to the village of Mamit in the Papua highlands that included COVID-19 test kits for the local clinic.\n\nBut she reported an emergency within minutes of takeoff and the aircraft plunged into Lake Sentani. An Indonesian search and rescue team later confirmed Lin did not survive as they recovered her body from the lake, according to a statement from Mission Aviation Fellowship. The Idaho-based Christian organization said its staff in Indonesia are working with local authorities to investigate the incident.\n\nLin, who was raised in Colorado and Maryland, had worked in Indonesia for Mission Aviation Fellowship for two years, serving as both a pilot and an information technology specialist. Prior to joining the organization, she worked for over a decade as a computer specialist after receiving Bachelor of Science and Master of Engineering degrees from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, according to her biography on the Mission Aviation Fellowship's website.\n\nShe is survived by her parents and two sisters.\n\nMore than 16,000 people in Indonesia have been diagnosed with COVID-19 and at least 1,043 have died, according to a count kept by Johns Hopkins University.\n\nJapanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe announced Thursday that he had decided to lift the state of emergency in 39 of the country's 47 prefectures.\n\nThe decree remains in place for urban regions, including the capital, Tokyo, and the large port city of Osaka. Abe said his government will consider lifting the state of emergency for the remaining prefectures next week.\n\nThe prime minister declared a monthlong state of emergency for Tokyo and six other prefectures on April 7 as Japan reported a surge in COVID-19 cases. Abe later expanded the declaration to cover the entire country and last until May 31. Under the order, prefectural governors asked residents to stay home and for some businesses to temporarily close, but public cooperation was voluntary. There were no penalties for failure to comply.\n\nAbe credited the recent decline in the rate of new infections to the efforts of residents staying at home and practicing social distancing. However, he warned that the state of emergency may have to be reimposed if infections increase.\n\nMore than 16,000 people in Japan have been diagnosed with COVID-19 and at least 678 have died, according to a count kept by Johns Hopkins University.\n\nItaly's government has approved a $60 billion stimulus package to help businesses and families reeling from the economic fallout of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\n\"Your cry of alarm didn't escape us,\" Italian Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said in a national address Wednesday night following a cabinet meeting.\n\nUnder the package, hotel owners won't have to make the next payment of real estate taxes, while parents would receive money to pay for babysitting or summer recreation centers since schools won't reopen in Italy until September.\n\nOnce the worst-hit country in Europe, Italy was the first nation in the world to impose a nationwide lockdown due to the coronavirus pandemic. More than 222,000 people in Italy have been diagnosed with COVID-19 and at least 31,106 have died, according to a count kept by Johns Hopkins University.\n\nLast week, Italy began to slowly lift the strict lockdown by easing some restrictions. The country's economy is forecast to contract by at least 8% this year as a result of the epidemic.\n\nRussia reported 9,974 new cases of COVID-19 on Thursday, the first time in 12 days that the country's daily tally was under 10,000.\n\nThe new cases confirmed over the past 24 hours bring Russia's total to 252,245, according to the country's coronavirus response headquarters.\n\nRussia has the second-largest national tally of COVID-19 cases in the world, behind the United States. The country reported a record 11,656 new infections on Monday.\n\nRussia also has one of the world's fastest rates of new infections in the coronavirus pandemic, second only to the U.S. However, the country's death toll from the disease remains relatively low with just 93 new fatalities reported over the past 24 hours, bringing the nationwide total to 2,305, according to the coronavirus response headquarters.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin has declared an end to a partial economic shutdown across the country due to the outbreak, but he said that many restrictions will remain in place. For instance, wearing face masks and gloves is mandatory for people using public transportation in Moscow.\n\nChina reported three new locally-transmitted infections of the novel coronavirus on Thursday, raising concerns of a rebound of the epidemic in the country's mainland territories.\n\nThe three new cases of COVID-19 were reported across two northeastern provinces on the Chinese mainland that have seen an increase in domestic infections in recent days, although the country's daily tally has plummeted from the height of the outbreak in February.\n\nSong Shuli, a spokesperson for China's National Health Commission, said at a press conference Thursday that the country will ramp up COVID-19 testing and screening nationwide to prevent a resurgence in cases.\n\nThe announcement comes just days after health authorities in Wuhan, the Chinese city that was ground zero of the coronavirus pandemic, declared they would test the city's entire population of 11 million people after detecting a cluster of new locally-transmitted infections there for the first time in over a month.\n\nOverall, the Chinese mainland has reported 82,929 confirmed cases of COVID-19 with 4,633 deaths so far. There are still 101 people in hospitals being treated for the disease, while another 712 people with asymptomatic cases remain isolated under medical observation, according to the National Health Commission.\n\nA woman was recently arrested in Southern California for allegedly selling non-approved COVID-19 test kits, police said.\n\nThe Los Angeles Police Department took 39-year-old Ying Lien Wang into custody Tuesday afternoon after serving a search warrant at her home in Santa Monica, west of downtown Los Angeles. Authorities recovered 61 COVID-19 at-home test kits that had not been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.\n\nPrior to her arrest, investigators went undercover and bought test kits from the woman on three occasions. She was allegedly selling the kits for $50 on Craigslist, according to police.\n\n\"None of the Covid-19 test kits recovered had been tested to meet United States safety standards and could pose a risk to anyone using them,\" the Los Angeles Police Department said in a statement late Wednesday. \"Residents are reminded that Los Angeles is offering free coronavirus testing to all residents.\"",

        "body": "Amber Dean had recovered from a mild bout of the coronavirus and her family of five had just ended their home quarantine when her oldest son, 9-year-old Bobby, fell ill.\n\n\"At first it was nothing major, it seemed like a tummy bug, like he ate something that didn't agree with him,\" said Dean, who lives with her husband and three young children in the western New York town of Hornell. \"But by the next day, he couldn't keep anything down and his belly hurt so bad he couldn't sit up.\"\n\nAt the local hospital emergency room, doctors suspected an appendix infection and sent him home with instructions to see his pediatrician.\n\nIt was only later, after Bobby's condition took an alarming turn for the worse, that doctors realized he was among the small but growing number of children with a mysterious inflammatory syndrome thought to be related to the virus.\n\nNew York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Tuesday that New York is now investigating about 100 cases of the syndrome, which affects blood vessels and organs and has symptoms similar to Kawasaki disease and toxic shock. Three children in the state have died and Cuomo advised all hospitals to prioritize COVID-19 testing for children presenting with symptoms.\n\nIn New York City, which has reported at least 52 children sick with the syndrome, Mayor Bill de Blasio on Tuesday urged parents to call their pediatricians promptly if their children show symptoms including persistent fever, rash, abdominal pain and vomiting.\n\nThat's what Bobby Dean's family did, even though they live in Steuben County, which has only 239 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and is in a part of the state set to start reopening some workplaces on Friday.\n\nThe family doctor performed a coronavirus test the day after his trip to the emergency room, but the results would take 24 hours. By that night, the boy's fever had spiked, his abdomen was swollen, he was severely dehydrated and his heart was racing. His father, Michael Dean, drove him to Golisano Children's Hospital in Rochester, 90 minutes away.\n\n\"At Rochester they did a rapid COVID test and it came back positive,\" Amber Dean said. For the next six days, she was at his hospital bedside while Bobby was hooked up to IV lines and a heart monitor. He came home on Mother's Day.\n\n\"It never affected his respiratory system, it was his heart that it affected,\" Dean said. Inflamed lymph nodes caused the abdominal pain, she said. \"They're hoping he pulls through with 100% recovery but they said there have been children with lasting effects.\"\n\nChildren elsewhere in the U.S. and in Europe have also been hospitalized with the condition known as pediatric multi-system inflammatory syndrome.\n\nIn New York, the syndrome has been found across a wide range of young people. A 5-year-old boy, 7-year-old boy and an 18-year-old woman have died.\n\nAbout 23 percent of cases have occurred in children under age 5, about 29% between the ages of 5 and 9, about 28% between ages 10 and 14 and 16% between the ages 15 and 19.\n\n\"This is a truly disturbing situation and I know parents around the state and parents around the country are very concerned about this, and they should be,\" Cuomo said. \"If we have this issue in New York it's probably in other states.\"\n\nDr. Juan Salazar, the physician-in-chief at Connecticut Children's Medical Center, said two patients there are believed to have the rare condition, which he said often appears to present itself two to four weeks after a child has recovered from COVID-19, often without ever being diagnosed with the infection. Yale Health has said it's treating three children believed to have the syndrome.\n\nCuomo announced last week that New York is developing national criteria for identifying and responding to the syndrome at the request of the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nIn testimony Tuesday before a Senate committee on the administration's coronavirus response, Dr. Anthony Fauci said children in general do better than adults and the elderly, but he warned there is still much to learn about the virus.\n\n\"For example right now, children presenting with COVID-19 who actually have a very strange inflammatory syndrome very similar to Kawasaki syndrome,\" Fauci said. \"I think we better be very careful that we are not cavalier in thinking that children are completely immune to the deleterious effects.\"\n\nAs Bobby Dean's boisterous energy and sardonic sense of humor returns, his mom is vigilant for signs of illness in her younger children, aged 7 months and 3 years.\n\n\"It's a pretty scary thing, watching your child be hooked up to all these wires and IVs and there's nothing you can do,\" Dean said. \"In my opinion, right now, I would not let your child out in public.\"\n\nJake Seiner contributed to this story from New York.",

        "authors": [],
        "body": "SALT LAKE CITY -- Health investigator Mackenzie Bray smiles and chuckles as she chats by phone with a retired Utah man who just tested positive for the coronavirus.\n\nShe's trying to keep the mood light because she needs to find out where he's been and who he's been around for the past seven days. She gently peppers him with questions, including where he and his wife stopped to buy flowers on a visit to a cemetery. She encourages him to go through his bank statement to see if it reminds him of any store visits he made.\n\nMidway through the conversation, a possible break: His wife lets slip that they had family over for Mother's Day, including a grandchild who couldn't stop slobbering.\n\n\"Was there like a shared food platter or something like that?\" Bray asks. \"There was, OK, yep ... sharing food or sharing drinks, even just being on the same table, it can spread that way.'\"\n\nSuddenly, with a shared punch bowl, the web has widened, and Bray has dozens more people to track down.\n\nShe is among an army of health professionals around the world filling one of the most important roles in the effort to guard against a resurgence of the coronavirus. The practice of so-called contact tracing requires a hybrid job of interrogator, therapist and nurse as they try coax nervous people to be honest.\n\nThe goal: To create a road map of everywhere infected people have been and who they've been around.\n\nWhile other countries have devised national approaches, a patchwork of efforts has emerged in the U.S. where states are left to create their own program.\n\nBray normally does this type of work to track contacts for people with sexually transmitted diseases. She is now one of 130 people at the Salt Lake County health department assigned to track coronavirus cases in the Salt Lake City area. The investigators, many of them nurses, each juggle 30 to 40 cases, and try to reach everyone the original person was within 6 feet (1.8 meters) of for 10 minutes or more. They stay in touch with some people throughout the 14-day incubation period, and calls can take 30 minutes or more as they meticulously go through a list of questions.\n\nSome estimate as many as 300,000 contact tracers would be needed in the U.S. to adequately curtail the spread. While some states like Utah have reported having enough contact tracers, others are hundreds or even thousands of people short.\n\nThe contact tracers often find themselves in a tangled web of half-truths and facts that don't match up. Language and cultural barriers arise that require interpreters and taxing conversations that leave the investigators wondering if the person understands what they're trying to do.\n\nThey land on occasion into complicated family dynamics where people are reluctant to tell the truth.\n\nDiCaro found out days into a case that a father was sleeping in his car because he and his wife were separating. The man had stopped returning DiCaro's calls, and that key information came from his child.\n\n\"I get people that lie all time,\" DiCaro said. \"I try to get as much information from the beginning but it's just not always the case. And time is one of those things you can't take back when you are trying to prevent and you know do these contact tracing investigations.\"\n\nEach call is an exercise in good cop, bad cop. She needs people to cooperate, but no one is legally required to answer the questions. Usually kindness works better than strong words.\n\nSome people lie because they're scared, or they forget an outing. Construction workers, housekeepers and others without paid sick time may gloss over symptoms so they can get back to work. Some immigrants without documentation brush off testing because they fear it could lead to deportation.\n\n\"People sometimes think contact tracing is black and white but there is a lot of gray that goes into it,\" said Bray, who often thinks about her parents and 97-year-old grandmother as she works to help stop the spread of the virus. \"Our worst fear is that we push too hard and we lose someone. It's not just their health on the line, it's the people around them.\"\n\nNo matter the tension, Bray and DiCaro give frequent reminders of why it all matters: \"Thank you for what you're doing. You're helping the community,\" DiCaro says during one call.\n\nShe knows that on the other end of the line, the first call from a tracer can be jarring. Sometimes, DiCaro and Bray have to break the news that someone was exposed or tested positive.\n\n\"It's normal to talk to like your doctor, but you don't ever expect the health department to call you and be like, 'You were exposed to a serious disease,'\" said Anissa Archuleta.\n\nThe 23-year-old got a call from DiCaro after she, her sister and her mother took a rare break from hunkering down to help organize a drive-by birthday party for a young cousin. They dropped off a present, then caved and accepted an impromptu invitation to go inside to grab some food.\n\nWhat they didn't know: the father of the birthday boy had the coronavirus, and unknowingly exposed more than a dozen people at the gathering.\n\nAfter that first call, DiCaro checked in every day for two weeks. The fear slowly faded after their tests came back negative and they began building a rapport with DiCaro. She asked about their symptoms and how they were feeling each day and learned about how Ortega lost her voice to fibromyalgia. Archuleta would pass along messages her mother whispered in her ear.\n\nAnd after a while, Archuleta began asking DiCaro about her life and how she was holding up.\n\nAbout a week in to their calls, on the daily check-in, Archuleta thanked DiCaro for caring about them and checking in every day. Tears welled up in DiCaro's eyes.\n\n\"Ah thanks,\" she said as she grabbed a Kleenex to wipe her eyes.\n\nAfter she hung up, she leaned back in her chair and closed her eyes for a few seconds.\n\n\"When you do this like 10-12 hours a day ... It's nice to get those positive reactions from people that are very grateful who do see the purpose of what we are doing,\" said DiCaro. \"It's nice to be appreciated.\"",

        "body": "Infectious disease specialist Dr. Simone Wildes shared her excitement on \"The View\" Thursday after a recent clinical trial showed promising early results for using the drug remdesivir against the coronavirus, calling it a \"step in the right direction.\"\n\nDr. Anthony Fauci, the country's top infectious disease expert and a member of the White House's coronavirus task force, announced the results of the experimental antiviral drug trial on Wednesday. Preliminary results from the randomized, placebo-controlled trial on 1,063 hospitalized patients showed that 31% of the patients who received remdesivir had a faster recovery time than those who received a placebo. The remdesivir group also saw an 8% mortality rate compared to an 11.6% mortality rate among the group on placebo.\n\n\"What it has proven is that a drug can block this virus,\" Fauci said Wednesday, calling the development \"very optimistic.\"\n\nhttps://abcnews.go.com/Politics/trump-fauci-tout-good-news-remdesivir-drug-trial/story?id=70407208\n\nOn \"The View\" Thursday morning, Wildes, of South Short Health in Massachusetts, concurred with Fauci's outlook.\n\n\"I'm excited,\" Wildes said. \"We have been working on the frontlines with a lot of different experimental drugs.\"\n\nWith the trial suggesting the drug might shorten the duration of symptoms, Wildes noted that even \"a day makes a difference\" when it comes to combating the new virus.\n\n\"We know more studies need to be done, but I think it's definitely a step in the right direction, and any ray of hope is hopeful for all of us on the frontlines,\" Wildes said.\n\nTesting for the coronavirus is considered a crucial step to reopening the country. But on Tuesday, Democrats on the House Oversight Committee sent letters to four companies that manufacture and distribute antibody tests to question their accuracy after preliminary results from a study of more than a dozen tests found that many were less sensitive than advertised, therefore posing a risk of false negatives or positives.\n\nWildes agrees that the antibody tests \"have really not been very reliable\" and that there's still \"a lot of work that needs to be done to validate these tests.\"\n\n\"In general, when you have antibodies you do have immunity,\" Wildes said. \"The question is how long does it last? There's still some unknown questions, especially with COVID-19 because it's a new virus.\"\n\nAs states like Vermont, Texas and Georgia begin to reopen, Wildes said she opposes states lifting restrictions on public activity right now as there aren't enough tests to prevent a resurgence of the virus.\n\n\"It's too early to open the states,\" Wildes said. \"We are not at full capacity for testing. We've also not implemented enough steps to do the contact tracing and isolating the individuals that have the disease.\"\n\n\"There's still a number of things that have not been done,\" she continued, \"and so, early opening right now is going to be a little bit premature.\"",

        "body": "CAIRO -- They are regarded as heroes, their fallen colleagues as martyrs. But for doctors and nurses still dealing with Iran's growing number of coronavirus infections, such praise rings hollow.\n\nWhile crippling sanctions imposed by the U.S. left Iran ill-equipped to deal with the fast-moving virus, some medical professionals say government and religious leaders bear the brunt of the blame for allowing the virus to spread -- and for hiding how much it had spread.\n\nThose medical workers say they were defenseless to handle the contagion. And as a result, doctors and nurses in Iran have been hard hit by the virus. During the first 90 days of the outbreak alone, about one medical staffer died each day and dozens became infected.\n\n\"We are heading fast toward a disaster,\" said a young Isfahan doctor who has been working tirelessly, checking dozens of suspected coronavirus patients before referring them to hospitals.\n\nIt is no secret that Iran has been hit hard by the coronavirus. Official government figures show that around 100,000 people were infected by the virus and around 6,500 have died. But a report by the research arm of Iran's parliament said the number of cases could be eight to 10 times higher, making it among the most hardest hit countries in the world. The report said the number of deaths could be 80% higher than officials numbers from the health ministry, about 11,700.\n\nThe Iranian government is currently reporting a decline in the number of COVID-19 infections and deaths, even though local authorities are expanding cemeteries in places like Tehran where the municipal council said it had to add 10,000 new graves to its largest cemetery, Behshet Zahra.\n\nInterviews with more than 30 medical professionals and a review of communications by doctors on messaging apps and other documents by an Associated Press reporter in Cairo revealed many previously unreported details. The reporting paints a fuller picture of the roots and extent of the country's disjointed response as the deadly virus spread throughout the population.\n\nIn the beginning, medical staffers faced the outbreak with very limited equipment. Some washed their own gowns and masks or sterilized them in regular ovens. Others wrapped their bodies in plastic bags they bought at supermarkets.\n\nThe makeshift equipment didn't help as dozens of medical professionals without adequate protection died along with their patients.\n\nIran's leaders, several medical professionals said, delayed telling the public about the virus for weeks, even as hospitals were filling up with people suffering from symptoms linked to the virus. And even as doctors and other experts were warning the Iranian president to take radical action, the government resisted, fearing the impact on elections, national anniversaries, and economy.\n\nOne doctor interviewed by The Associated Press -- who, like all medical workers interviewed for this story, spoke only on the condition that they not be named for fear of persecution -- said he and his colleagues were even discouraged from using protective equipment. He said government officials claimed wearing masks would cause panic.\n\nThe country's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, proclaimed on March 10 that the doctors, nurses, and medical staffers who died in the fight against coronavirus in Iran were \"martyrs.\" Pictures of deceased doctors have been placed alongside those of soldiers who were killed in the bloody Iran-Iraq war in the 1980s, which claimed the lives of a million Iranian and Iraqis.\n\n\"They are normalizing death,\" a Tehran-based health consultant said.\n\nA list compiled by a group of Iranian doctors found that a total of 126 medical staffers have died since the virus was first reported, mostly in the provinces of Gilan and Tehran, while over 2,070 contracted the virus.\n\nHealth Ministry spokesman Kianoush Jahanpour, acknowledged the deadly toll of COVID-19 on the medical profession, telling the AP the total number of deaths is 107. Jahanpour said 470 had tested positive for the virus. But he places the blame on the U.S. \"Remember this is a country under sanctions,\" he said. Even so, Iran has maintained throughout the crisis its own industries made enough protective material to fight the virus.\n\nIran reported its first two cases on Feb. 19 in the city of Qom -- 140 kilometers (88 miles) south of Tehran and home of highly revered Shiite shrines. It would become the epicenter of the outbreak.\n\nBut doctors interviewed by the AP said that before the official announcement, they started to see cases with the same symptoms as the novel coronavirus and warned the national health ministry that it needed to take action.\n\nSome doctors shared with the AP letters sent to the ministry. The doctors at first said they attributed the respiratory problems among patients and deaths to the H1N1 flu. Days later, they started to call for testing for H1N1 and other diseases to rule them out; the rate of infections and deaths seemed unusually high.\n\nThrough channels on the Telegram messaging service, they exchanged data. They reached out to the health ministry and proposed a set of recommendations and actions. At the top of the list: quarantine, and restricting travel and flights with China. But it would be another two weeks before the government took action.\n\n\"We gave a lot of information to the government through letters and communication channels,\" said a Mazandaran-based doctor and activist. He said he and others medical professionals were ignored by government officials.\n\nTwo days after announcing first cases, Iran held its parliamentary elections where thousands lined up to vote. That same day, doctors in Gilan -- one of the worst hit areas in Iran -- appealed to the governor for help, saying their hospitals were flooded with patients amid a shortage of masks and other protection equipment.\n\n\"The health personnel of the province are exposed to a huge threat,\" a letter sent by the doctors read.\n\nBut government officials played down the danger of the virus, calling the physicians' plea for a quarantine \"medieval\" and floating unfounded conspiracy theories that the U.S. created the coronavirus to promote a fear mongering campaign.\n\nThe feared paramilitary Revolutionary Guard kept health facilities under tight control and medical statistics were treated as top secret, the medical staffers said.\n\nDeath certificates were not recording the coronavirus as the cause of deaths -- either because not all severe cases were tested or just for the sake of keeping the numbers down. Thousands of unaccounted deaths were attributed to secondary causes like \"heart attack\" or \"respiratory distress.\"\n\nA doctor in Tehran said the health ministry gave orders not to refer critical cases to hospitals to be tested for the virus -- to keep the numbers low, she said.\n\n\"We suppose they (want to) say they're doing good,\" she said.",

Iran has maintained throughout the crisis that its own industries made enough protective material to fight the virus.\n\nIran reported its first two cases on Feb. 19 in the city of Qom -- 140 kilometers (88 miles) south of Tehran and home of highly revered Shiite shrines. It would become the epicenter of the outbreak.\n\nThe announcement apparently was made under some duress. A doctor there named Mohammed Molei filmed himself next to his bedridden brother, insisting that his brother be tested for the virus. That coincided with a visit by a health ministry delegation to the city.\n\nBut doctors interviewed by the AP say that before the official announcement, they started to see cases with the same symptoms as the novel coronavirus and warned the national health ministry that it needed to take action.\n\nSome doctors shared with the AP letters sent to the ministry. The doctors at first said they attributed the respiratory problems among patients and deaths to the H1N1 flu. Days later, they started to call for testing for H1N1 and other diseases to rule them out; the rate of infections and deaths seemed unusually high.\n\nThrough channels on the Telegram messaging service, they exchanged data. They reached out to the health ministry and proposed a set of recommendations and actions. At the top of the list: a quarantine, and restricting travel and flights with China. But it would be another two weeks before the government took action.\n\n\"We gave a lot of information to the government through letters and communication channels,\" said a Mazandaran-based activist and doctor. He said he and other medical professionals were ignored by government officials.\n\nTwo days after announcing the first cases, Iran held its parliamentary elections where thousands lined up to vote. That same day, doctors in Gilan -- one of the worst hit areas in Iran -- appealed to the governor for help, saying their hospitals were flooded with patients amid a shortage of masks and other protection equipment.\n\n\"The health personnel of the province are exposed to a huge threat,\" a letter sent by the doctors read.\n\nBut government officials played down the danger of the virus, calling the physicians' plea for a quarantine \"medieval\" and floating unfounded conspiracy theories that the U.S. created the coronavirus to promote a fear-mongering campaign.\n\nThe feared paramilitary Revolutionary Guard kept health facilities under tight control and medical statistics were treated as top secret, the medical staffers said.\n\nDeath certificates were not recording the coronavirus as the cause of deaths -- either because not all severe cases were tested or just for the sake of keeping the numbers down. Thousands of unaccounted deaths were attributed to secondary causes like \"heart attack\" or \"respiratory distress.\"\n\nAnd a doctor in Tehran said the health ministry gave orders not to refer critical cases to hospitals to be tested for the virus -- to keep the numbers low, she said.\n\n\"We suppose they (want to) say they're doing good,\" she said.\n\nA Tehran-based radiologist said that he had access to medical files of patients at different Tehran hospitals. The reports include CT scans and blood tests that pointed to the coronavirus. But tests were not done.\n\n\"These are 40% of the cases,\" he said, \"It's just difficult to prove.\"\n\n\"The number of real patients with COVID-19 in Iran, from the beginning ... until today is much more than what has been reported,\" he said, echoing similar sentiments by most medical workers interviewed by the AP.\n\nHe estimated that the numbers are three to four times higher than the figures released by the government.\n\n\"The authorities believe they are doing great and they try to keep things out of spotlight,\" a medical scholar said.\n\nClinics and hospitals became hubs of infection, even as parliamentary elections and national celebrations went on:\n\n-- In Khorasan, the head of the medical science school which oversees hospitals receiving corona patients, Ali Asghar, told a local news agency that a total of 600 people died between Feb. 19 and April 4. The government number through March 22 was 42.\n\n-- In Golestan, AbdolReza Fazel, a top health official, told local media that 230 had died though April 2, while the government recorded just 10 cases.\n\n-- In Isfahan, Tahererh Changiz, the head of the medical school, told the IMNA news agency that the total number of deaths reached 400; the official figure was just 87.\n\n-- According to one health official and two doctors, the total deaths in Gilan have surpassed 1,300 so far. The last breakdown provided by the government on March 22 said the total did not exceed 200.\n\n\"Gilan wasn't ready at all,\" said one physician there. \"It was a catastrophe.\"\n\nSaid another doctor: \"The first weeks, the system has collapsed,\" with patients sleeping in the corridors and doctors forced to make painful choices. A nurse at Shafa Hospital in the provincial capital of Rasht said ventilators were removed from dying patients to let others live.\n\n\"Death certificates were written before they died,\" the nurse said with a hoarse voice. On the death certificates, the doctor scribbled, \"heart attack\" or \"respiratory distress\" as a cause of death.\n\n\"It was my worst day in my life when they cut the oxygen. After work, when I went back home, I could do nothing but crying,\" she said.\n\nA psychologist in Tehran told the AP that many medical staffers were traumatized. Images of the dying patients left them with a deep sense of guilt, suicide thoughts, and panic attacks, he said.\n\nHe recalled one nurse who had a recurring nightmare of burying her parents alone. Another said she dreamt of looking into a telescope, anticipating with horror a meteoric strike.\n\nICU doctor Gol Rezayee appeared in a March 29 video that went viral on social media as he tried, but failed to revive a dying patient's heart.\n\nOn Telegram, he wrote the last words he exchanged with the victim. \"Doctor, if I die, tell my husband to take care of the kids,\" he recalled the woman saying. \"He is careless and naughty.\"\n\nRezayee said he responded: \"It's just like a cold. You will live 120 years.\" Hours later, the woman was dead.\n\nMedical professionals also watched as their own colleagues succumbed to the virus.\n\nAs the outbreak in Rasht unfolded during the last week of February, patients packed the clinic of the city's most popular physician, Moammad Bakhshalizadeh, who often treated the poor for free, set up the first association for physicians in the province and volunteered during the war with Iraq.\n\nAs the virus spread, the 66-year-old doctor examined an average of 70 patients each day, largely without protective gear.\n\nA week after Iran officially announced the first two official cases in Qom, Bakhshalizadeh developed a fever and had trouble breathing. Initial tests for coronavirus were inconclusive. Another test showed that his lungs were turning white.\n\nHe later drove himself to several hospitals until he found one with an empty bed.",

    "Does COVID-19 cause delirium? Doctors race to understand its impact on the brain": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "As we continue to learn about the novel coronavirus, it's become clear that its effects on the body extend well beyond the lungs. Now, doctors are racing to understand one of its most disturbing targets: the brain.\n\nDoctors across the globe are reporting that their patients with severe cases of COVID-19 are left confused, sometimes delirious or exhibiting signs of an altered mental state.\n\nThough the cause remains a mystery, doctors on the front lines are sounding the alarm, noting that many of these patients follow an eerily similar pattern. For example, one patient -- a man in his 50s -- was admitted to a hospital after he was found confused, agitated and non coherent, all signs of a drastic change to his personality.\n\nAt first, doctors thought it was meningitis -- an infection that can affect the brain. They did not initially suspect COVID-19 because the man wasn't experiencing typical respiratory syndromes. To their surprise, the man tested positive for the virus after a routine hospital screening. It was only after he completely lost touch with reality -- unable to recognize who he was or where he was -- that he developed respiratory symptoms more commonly associated with COVID-19. This occurred two days into his hospitalization.\n\nEventually, the patient was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) for invasive ventilation, still unable to comprehend what was happening to him. As of this writing, he remains in the ICU.\n\nDr. Lorenzo Norris, the associate dean at the George Washington University School of Medicine and Health Sciences and editor in chief of MDedge Psychiatry, said cases like that of this patient are a worrying sign that no one fully understands how this virus is impacting the brain.\n\nDoctors already knew that elderly patients are most likely to become delirious during hospital admissions; however, during the COVID-19 pandemic, doctors are noticing that some younger patients are also exhibiting signs of altered awareness as their only symptom. Others are developing delirium later during their hospital stay, and their confusion seems more severe and lasts longer than expected.\n\nNorris has been in the front line in managing and battling the virus during the pandemic. He told ABC News that his hospital has seen an uptick in the number of patients with COVID-19 who experience delirium, regardless of their prior mental health history. Plus, these patients seem to take longer to recover.\n\n\"Delirium is a medical emergency that is associated with increased morbidity and mortality,\" he said.\n\nThough data is sparse, one study from Wuhan, China found that over a third of patients with COVID-19 experienced some sort of neurological symptom -- and that rate increased among those with severe infections. Additionally, a smaller study from France published last month found that among hospitalized patients with COVID-19, about two-thirds were agitated or delirious.\n\nThe confusion manifesting in patients with COVID-19 has now confused doctors, who still don't understand whether it is a direct result of the virus's impact on the brain, or perhaps a side effect triggered by an aggressive inflammatory response.\n\nDr. Beatriz Korc, chief of geriatrics at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center told ABC News that the delirium from COVID-19 could be a result of the virus directly damaging the brain tissue or its blood vessels. Alternatively, delirium could also be a result of the severe respiratory distress resulting in low oxygen levels in the blood.\n\nAnother possible culprit, according to Norris, is a severe overreaction of the immune system, called \"cytokine storms\", which could be causing blood clots to form in the brain.\n\nIn Spain, one of the hardest hit regions in Europe by the pandemic, Dr. Cristinia Abad, an anesthesiologist at Hospital Cli\u0301nicos San Carlos in Madrid, noticed that patients who required mechanical ventilation to support their breathing for long periods of time were taking longer to return to their normal selves.\n\n\"It was taking a lot longer for patients to return to their baseline mental status after we extubated them,\" Dr. Abad told ABC News. \"We were concerned that they had small clots formed in the brain that were causing them to be more confused, because we knew their oxygen status had improved, so that was not the problem.\"\n\nIt's also possible that long periods of hospitalization could be making the problem worse for some patients, causing them to feel disoriented.\n\n\"Isolation, mobility limitations, use of protective personal equipment or absence of familiar faces could be terribly frightening and disorienting, which can further worsen the confusion patients endure,\" Korc said.\n\nKorc, however, said things like family phone calls and attentive nursing care can help, and that the delirium experienced by some COVID-19 patients likely goes beyond the typical confusion associated with long hospital stays.\n\nWith doctors learning more about COVID-19 every day, a growing number are now on the lookout for delirium as a possible symptom. Caught early, delirium can be managed, which can in turn reduce the risk of long-term adverse effects.\n\n\"We're learning something new about this virus every day, but there are the concerns from folks on the front line for what will become of patients with altered mental status and COVID-19,\" Norris said.",

    "Editorial Roundup: US": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "Excerpts from recent editorials in the United States and abroad:\n\nLike the rest of America, we've been following the coverage of the so-called murder hornets showing up in northern Washington state and just across the border in Canada. We still don't know how deeply these hornets from Asia have integrated themselves into North America or whether this will become a problem that will challenge honeybee hives across the United States.\n\nWhat we do know is this: If these jerks show their faces in Texas, authorities should show no hesitation in eradicating every last one of them. We're still hoping that these invasive bugs can be murdered off in Washington state before they gain so strong of a foothold that they're impossible to dislodge. Otherwise, we'll see these hornets wreck honeybee hives by invading them, killing bees, and carrying off parts of their carcasses to feed their own young.\n\nIn Japan, apparently, honeybees have figured out a defense against the murder hornet. The bees pile onto one of these tough creatures as it tries to make its way into their hive, and rather than uselessly employing their stingers against the hornet's hard outer-shell, the bees work to overheat the hornet. Essentially, the bees form a ball around the invader and over time the inside of the ball rises to a temperature the bees can withstand but that the hornet cannot. In the end, what's left is the cooked carcass of a murder hornet.\n\nThat works for us as does any other eradication technique. In this time of coronavirus, we simply can't deal with an additional pestilence that includes something called murder hornets. Enough is enough. Please, pray God, deliver death upon the murder hornet.\n\nThe Guardian on an app released by the National Health Service in England that can trace COVID-19 interactions:\n\nThe idea of the National Health Service tracing app is to enable smartphones to track users and tell them whether they interacted with someone who had Covid-19. Yet this will work only if large proportions of the population download the app. No matter how smart a solution may appear, mass consent is required. That will not be easy. Ministers and officials have failed to address the trade-offs between health and privacy by being ambiguous about the app's safeguards.\n\nInstead of offering cast-iron guarantees about the length of time for which data would be held; who can access it; and the level of anonymity afforded, we have had opacity and obfuscation. It is true that we are dealing with uncertainties. But without absolute clarity about privacy the public is unlikely to take up the app with the appropriate gusto.\n\nThe NHS and the health secretary Matt Hancock are now racing to fix these problems so that the app can be rolled out. Time is of the essence, as digital contact tracing will be required so that the lockdown can be eased. Mr Hancock's problem has been exacerbated because the NHS app is incompatible with a new interfacing software, or API, being developed by Google and Apple.\n\nThe difference is a fundamental one. The NHS in England wants to pool the information it collects in a single database. The tech giants aim to decentralise the Covid-19 data across devices. The NHS app was designed when testing was rare in the UK and is built for self-diagnosis. Users tell the app if they are displaying symptoms and a centralised database records which phones are being sent alerts and roughly where they are. This is a protection against pranksters aiming to deceive the system. The Google/Apple API relies on public health systems and mass testing. Silicon Valley, it seems, wants only medically endorsed results as inputs - once you have good data there's no need for the discipline of a panopticon.\n\nApple and Google could allow third-party developers like the NHS access to the Bluetooth signals smartphones have received in the last two weeks. The tech giants at present only permit developers to ask if a signal has been heard and respond yes or no. They do not allow them to scan a phone's collected signals. Permitting the NHS to do this, the digital behemoths fear, would lead to similar demands from totalitarian regimes interested in the company people keep beyond their Covid-19 status. European nations have been infuriated by this reasoning.\n\nIn England, around 60% of the population needs to download the app to make it work. As Google and Apple account for nine out of 10 phones, it may be easier to piggyback on their software. Without their help, apps strain to work properly. NHS England was not wrong to chart its own course. But the venture has struggled because of a wider failure to build a \"test, trace and isolate\" system. Even with the level of testing England currently has, Google and Apple's app would not be the answer now. Ministers have a few weeks to bridge the gap between an English system that might be rendered redundant in the near future and a Californian one which needs a public health system we do not yet have.\n\nThe Los Angles Times on the Affordable Care Act's contraception mandate:\n\nThe fight over whether employer-provided health insurance has to cover birth control for women returns to a familiar battleground Wednesday: the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nHow did something as simple and straightforward and profoundly important to a woman's life as contraception, and insurance for it, become the focus of years of legal wrangling? Because what started as a narrow exemption for religious organizations from a federal mandate to cover birth control has ballooned into Trump administration guidelines allowing any company to claim a religious or moral belief as a way to evade the mandate. That's going too far, and the Supreme Court needs to put a stop to it.\n\nAll these issues stem from the 2010 Affordable Care Act's requirement that new insurance policies meet minimum federal standards, including coverage of preventive care. The law authorized the Health Resources and Services Administration to issue guidelines to implement that provision. During the Obama administration, the guidelines rightly instructed health plans to include coverage of contraception for women with no out-of-pocket cost.\n\nHouses of worship were exempted in 2013 from having to offer any kind of coverage for birth control. (Under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, the government can't impose a \"substantial burden\" on the exercise of religion unless it's necessary to further an important government interest and it's done in the least restrictive way.) And religious nonprofits were allowed to opt out of offering contraceptive coverage as long as they agreed to an accommodation: They filed a one-page form notifying insurers or plan administrators, which would then provide the coverage at no cost to the employer.\n\nThings only got more complicated from there. In 2014, the for-profit craft company Hobby Lobby argued in the Supreme Court that forcing it to offer birth control coverage violated the Religious Freedom Restoration Act because its owners objected on religious grounds to some of the mandated forms of contraception. Unfortunately, the high court agreed, ruling that the government had to find a less restrictive means of providing contraceptive coverage for employees of closely held corporations whose owners had religious objections. One possibility, the court suggested, was offering them the same accommodation that was available to religious nonprofits.\n\nAfter more legal skirmishing, the Trump administration issued new guidelines allowing any company, if it offered up a sincere religious or moral objection, to refuse to cover its female employees' birth control. And companies would not even be compelled to offer a workaround. The states of Pennsylvania and New Jersey got a federal court to block the guidelines with a nationwide injunction, upheld by a federal appeals court. Now the case is at the Supreme Court, which is set to hear arguments Wednesday.\n\nTo be clear, houses of worship and religiously affiliated groups whose work is intertwined with the practice of their religions should not be compelled to violate their beliefs. The issue here, though, is how to fulfill the government's compelling interest in providing access to preventive care, as Congress mandated in the Affordable Care Act, without trampling on religious rights.\n\nThe workaround developed by the Obama administration met that test, severing religious-affiliated employers from any financial connection to the contraceptive coverage in the policies offered to their employees. The guidelines the Trump administration adopted last year, however, pretend that enabling women to obtain contraceptive coverage is merely optional. They would fully exempt any company whose owners (no matter the number) claim that the contraceptive mandate goes against their conscience, forcing their employees to find contraceptive coverage through separate policies or subsidized programs.\n\nOf course, many companies -- probably most -- would not take away coverage of contraception even if they were allowed to cite a religious or moral objection. Employers compete for workers based in part on the health benefits they offer. Yet even the Trump administration estimates that as many as 120,000 women could be affected, and the National Women's Law Center contends that the total will be far higher.\n\nIt's true the Affordable Care Act doesn't explicitly require birth control be included in new insurance policies. But it does explicitly require those policies to cover preventive healthcare for women. And the Obama administration correctly interpreted that requirement to include coverage of birth control, with rare exceptions for religious employers and with a reasonable accommodation for others with religious objections. The Trump administration shouldn't be allowed to ignore the will Congress expressed in the Affordable Care Act to placate his supporters on the religious right.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal on universal lockdowns versus targeted lockdowns to stop the spread of the new coronavirus:\n\nAmericans are paying a fearsome price for the government's strict lockdowns of American life and commerce, and now comes evidence that targeted lockdowns aimed at protecting those who are most vulnerable to the coronavirus would be better for public health and the economy.\n\nThat conclusion comes in a new working paper from the National Bureau of Economic Research by MIT economists Daron Acemoglu, Victor Chernozhukov, Iv\u00e1n Werning and Michael Whinston. The authors compared relative risks of infection, hospitalization and death for the young, the middle-aged and those over age 65. They then compared strict lockdowns that treat all age groups the same with a more targeted strategy that protects the old.\n\n\"Interestingly, we find that semi-targeted policies that simply apply a strict lockdown on the oldest group can achieve the majority of the gains from fully-targeted policies,\" the authors write. \"For example, a semi-targeted policy that involves the lockdown of those above 65 until a vaccine arrives can release the young and middle-aged groups back into the economy much more quickly, and still achieve a much lower fatality rate in the population (just above 1% of the population instead of 1.83% with the optimal uniform policy).\"\n\nInteresting is right. The universal lockdowns of March and April have been aimed specifically at preventing hospitals from being overrun with Covid-19 patients and thus reducing the death rate. But the paper says a targeted lockdown aimed at seniors combined with other policies like social distancing will reduce the death rate by more.\n\nTargeted lockdowns also reduce economic harm, as you'd expect. \"This policy also reduces the economic damage from 24.3% to 12.8% of one year's GDP. The reason is that, once the most vulnerable group is protected, the other groups can be reincorporated into the economy more quickly,\" the authors write.\n\nThis is consistent with the economic evidence we told you about last week from the University of Chicago's Casey Mulligan.\n\nThe universal lockdowns are finally easing in many states, and the damage in the last two months can't be undone. But these studies can inform governors as they consider how and what to reopen in their states. And in particular they should inform government decisions about the kind of lockdowns to reimpose if there are coronavirus flare-ups, as there are likely to be until a vaccine or cure arrive.\n\nProtect the most vulnerable, but don't put the entire state in economic cold storage in the name of a false choice between saving lives and saving money. On the growing evidence, targeted lockdowns can save more lives and more livelihoods.\n\n\"What breaks my heart is to see how much he aged since being imprisoned. He used to be a man full of energy and vigor. Now, he is old, sickly, skinny, and there's no way out of this situation for him.\" So reported Khadicha Askarova, the wife of Kyrgyzstan journalist Azimjon Askarov, last year after visiting her 68-year-old husband in a jail where, we are sad to say, he still remains. It has been well established that Mr. Askarov is innocent of any crime. But he has spent nine years in prison after receiving a life sentence on trumped-up charges because of his truth-telling reporting on human rights violations.\n\nMr. Askarov's case has been ranked as the most urgent by the One Free Press Coalition in advance of World Press Freedom Day on Sunday. But what is most striking and shameful is that Mr. Askarov is far from alone in a world where journalists' freedoms have come under increasing assault. In 2019, at least 250 journalists were imprisoned, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists, and so far this year, six journalists have been killed and 64 are missing globally. The worst offenders are the authoritarian regimes in Turkey, Egypt and China.\n\nSolafa Magdy, a freelance multimedia journalist in Egypt, has been jailed (along with her husband) on charges that include \"spreading false news.\" Four Yemeni journalists -- Abdulkhaleq Amran, Akram al-Waleedi, Hareth Hameed and Tawfiq al-Mansouri -- have been sentenced to death on charges of spreading false news. Truong Duy Nhat, a blogger in Vietnam, has been sentenced to 10 years after a half-day trial on charges of \"abusing his position and power while on duty.\"\n\nSome journalists -- Elena Milashina in Russia; Mir Shakil-ur-Rehman in Pakistan; Yayesew Shimelis in Ethiopia -- have been targeted for their reporting on covid-19. The pandemic not only underscores the vital role that journalists play in providing critical information to the public, but it gives real urgency to the need to free journalists who have been jailed for simply doing their jobs. Prisons and detention facilities have become hot spots for the deadly virus, and journalists such as Mr. Askarov, who was tortured and is in declining health, are at high risk.\n\n\"Freedom,\" said Ms. Askarov, \"is his main wish and goal. He lives for it.\"\n\nThe New York Times on sexual harassment and assault accusations against former Vice President Joe Biden:\n\nFormer Vice President Joe Biden, the Democrats' presumptive nominee for president, has forcefully denied allegations of sexual harassment and assault made against him by Tara Reade, a former staff assistant in his Senate office.\n\n\"They aren't true,\" Mr. Biden said in a statement on Friday. \"This never happened.\"\n\nMs. Reade's accusations, which have been percolating for several weeks, are grave and graphic. She charges that, in the spring of 1993, Mr. Biden cornered her in a deserted hallway of the Capitol complex, pinned her against a wall, reached under her skirt and penetrated her with his fingers.\n\nMs. Reade's brother and multiple friends have said that she told them of the incident around the time it occurred. Some bits of evidence lend credence to her claim, even as others prompt skepticism. When Ms. Reade's brother, Collin Moulton, first spoke to The Washington Post about his sister's accusations, for instance, he mentioned only that she talked about Mr. Biden touching her neck and shoulders; several days later, Mr. Moulton texted The Post to say that he also recalled her sharing that Mr. Biden had put his hand \"under her clothes.\"\n\nAs is so often the case in such situations, it is all but impossible to be certain of the truth. But the stakes are too high to let the matter fester -- or leave it to be investigated by and adjudicated in the media. Mr. Biden is seeking the nation's highest office.\n\nIn 2018, this board advocated strongly for a vigorous inquiry into accusations of sexual misconduct raised against Brett Kavanaugh when he was nominated to a seat on the Supreme Court. Mr. Biden's pursuit of the presidency requires no less. His campaign, and his party, have a duty to assure the public that the accusations are being taken seriously. The Democratic National Committee should move to investigate the matter swiftly and thoroughly, with the full cooperation of the Biden campaign.\n\nMs. Reade's account has some apparent inconsistencies. Last year, she was one of several women who came forward with complaints of Mr. Biden hugging or touching them in ways that made them uncomfortable, but she did not raise the assault accusation until this March. She says she tried to share her story with the media earlier, only to get \"shut down.\"\n\nMembers of Mr. Biden's staff from that period have denied that Ms. Reade expressed any complaints about Mr. Biden, and they reject the idea that the office tolerated any harassment.\n\nMs. Reade says that she filed a formal harassment complaint with a congressional personnel office in 1993. (She says the report did not mention the assault.) Although she kept some of her employment records from that time, she says she does not have a copy of that complaint. In his statement, Mr. Biden said that if such a document existed, there would be a copy of it in the National Archives, which retains records from what was then the Office of Fair Employment Practices. He called on the archives \"to identify any record of the complaint she alleges she filed and make available to the press any such document.\" Later on Friday, after the National Archives said it did not have personnel documents, Mr. Biden asked the secretary of the Senate to direct a more extensive search, also asking for \"any and all other documents in the records that relate to the allegation.\"\n\nThis is a start, but it does not go far enough. Any serious inquiry must include the trove of records from Mr. Biden's Senate career that he donated to the University of Delaware in 2012. Currently, those files are set to remain sealed until after Mr. Biden retires from public life -- a common arrangement. There are growing calls for Mr. Biden to make those records available to see if they contain any mention of Ms. Reade or perhaps others who raised similar complaints about his behavior.\n\nIn a Friday interview on MSNBC, Mr. Biden resisted these calls, insisting that his Senate papers do not contain any personnel files and so could not possibly shed light on Ms. Reade's allegations. He added that they do, however, contain sensitive information about his past work that could be unfairly exploited in a presidential campaign.\n\nWhile understandable, this concern is not prohibitive -- and Mr. Biden's word is insufficient to dispel the cloud. Any inventory should be strictly limited to information about Ms. Reade and conducted by an unbiased, apolitical panel, put together by the D.N.C. and chosen to foster as much trust in its findings as possible. Admittedly, this would be a major undertaking. Mr. Biden served 36 years in the Senate. He turned over nearly 2,000 boxes and more than 400 gigabytes of data to the University of Delaware; most of it has not been cataloged. But the question at hand is no less than Mr. Biden's fitness for the presidency. No relevant memo should be left unexamined.\n\nIt has been noted that President Trump has been accused of sexual harassment or assault by more than a dozen women. Those claims also should be investigated, and the Republicans concerned about Mr. Biden's behavior now should be at least equally focused on the questions about Mr. Trump's. For his part, Mr. Trump does not seriously address the claims against him; he simply denies them and attacks his accusers.\n\nMr. Biden has set higher standards for himself. That has been central to his appeal. His campaign is founded on the promise of restoring sanity, civility and decency to the presidency. Even if certainty isn't possible in this matter, the American people deserve at least the confidence that he, and the Democratic Party, have made every effort to bring the truth to light.",

    "El Salvador quarantine centers become points of contagion": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador -- Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele has imposed some of the hemisphere's toughest measures against the new coronavirus -- closing his country's borders, imposing a national quarantine and dispatching police and the army to detain violators.\n\nAn overwhelming majority of Salvadorans approve of Bukele's performance, but human rights advocates complain the 38-year-old leader has ignored the country's constitution and rulings by its Supreme Court.\n\nAt the heart of the controversy are \"containment centers\" where thousands of Salvadorans have been detained for more than a month at a time without judicial review, some swept off the street as they went to buy food for their families. Others had the bad luck to be traveling outside the country when Bukele imposed the quarantine and were locked up upon return.\n\nIn some 90 rented hotels, convention centers and gymnasiums hastily converted to police-guarded shelters, the government mixed the sick with the healthy, often waiting weeks before testing people for the virus, according to human rights groups and people who have been detained.\n\nThe country's Supreme Court has ruled repeatedly that the detentions are unconstitutional since no law authorizes them. But Bukele has ignored the order and accused critics of seeking the deaths of thousands of Salvadorans.\n\n\"Of course in all containment centers there's a risk of the illness, because they are designed to hold the population that has the highest risk of suffering the illness,\" Health Minister Francisco Alab\u00ed told The Associated Press. He apologized if the 30-plus day detentions resulted in \"inconveniences.\"\n\nTourism Minister Morena Valdez, who is part of the government's containment team, said that some 7,000 people in the nation of about 6.4 million have been held in the shelters. Officials have not revealed how many of those held have tested positive for the disease, nor how many have died. Nationwide, the government has reported 1,265 cases and 26 deaths.\n\nBukele announced on March 11 that El Salvador was closing itself to foreigners and that Salvadorans returning to the country would be subject to 30-day forced quarantine in the new centers -- a stay twice as long as that recommended by the World Health Organization.\n\nThe next day, 67-year-old Carlos Henr\u00edquez Cortez, a Salvadoran manager for a steel company on a two-day business trip to Guatemala, checked with his embassy there. He was told that because he was over 60 years old and suffered from hypertension he would have to quarantine at home -- not in a government center -- according to a detailed account by the Jos\u00e9 Sime\u00f3n Ca\u00f1as Central American University Human Rights Institute and his relatives.\n\nA day later, Henr\u00edquez flew into a San Salvador airport in chaos. After hours of confusion, he was bused with dozens of others to a sports complex known as the Olympic Village that was being used to house those swept up in the president's quarantine decree.\n\nPhotographs he sent to his family depict a sea of people crowded together in a large hall, clogged toilets, broken sinks and mold-coated showers. People coming from all over the world, including the most infected countries, were stuffed 10 to a room on bunk beds that touched.\n\nHenr\u00edquez told relatives he felt surrounded by people getting sick. People coughed through the night.\n\nThat experience was shared by business executive Ernesto S\u00e1nchez, 38, who flew into El Salvador March 12 after a 36-hour business trip to Panama and was also bused to the Olympic Village.\n\n\"They didn't examine us,\" he told the AP. \"The most they did was take our temperature.\"\n\nHe said 50 to 55 men were assigned to his unit, sharing dirty communal showers and bathrooms. He said he was terrified of those around him.\n\n\"I knew they came from countries with infections,\" said S\u00e1nchez, who asked that only part of his name be used to avoid retaliation. \"It was more a center of contamination.\"\n\nFive days into Henr\u00edquez 's stay he had a fever and began coughing. He waited in line for hours to see a doctor who gave him medicine for his fever.\n\n\"We as a family identified, after a week, the symptoms (in him) one by one,\" said his son Carlos.\n\nHenr\u00edquez's condition worsened and on March 22 he was transferred to a small hotel, according to the report. A doctor saw him the following day and diagnosed him with colitis and dehydration. Under pressure from his family, the Health Ministry sent another doctor to see him. That doctor ordered his immediate transfer to a hospital.\n\nSoon unable to talk, he sent his family desperate text messages. \"Get me out of here,\" \"I'm scared,\" \"Help.\" Held in a ward surrounded by COVID-19 patients, Henr\u00edquez wasn't tested until March 27. The result was positive.\n\nA week later, before heading to his second hospital, Henr\u00edquez wrote to his wife to say goodbye. It was the last communication his family would have with him, because the hospital took his phone. A few days later, the attending doctor told his family he was intubated and in intensive care.\n\nAt a third hospital, doctors told the family Henr\u00edquez's kidneys were failing and he needed dialysis. But the dialysis machine never arrived.\n\nOn April 22, Henr\u00edquez died.\n\nThe human rights center concluded that Henr\u00edquez's detention had been arbitrary, unsupported by any law and likely led to his death.\n\nThe case \"is a clear example of the improvisation and disorganization of the government in managing the containment and prevention measures of the COVID-19 pandemic,\" the institute concluded.\n\nHenr\u00edquez's relatives said they have received no response from the government since the human rights report was published last week, nor has it provided information about those who have fallen ill inside its containment centers. They believe he was infected during detention.\n\n\"My father-in-law was a very good person, a man of faith and he always fought against injustices and was a person who helped his neighbors,\" said Oscar Monedero. \"That motivated us to bring to light the injustices that he lived.\"\n\nTourism Minister Valdez told the AP conditions have improved, and that the centers now separate those who test positive.\n\nSanchez, meanwhile, was eventually moved to another center and was tested three times, coming up negative. But officials held him for 48 days.\n\n\"They have violated my rights,\" S\u00e1nchez said. \"They told me it would be for 30 days and it was 48. ... I had not committed any crime and I had a right for them to tell me what was happening.\"",

    "Elon Musk becomes champion of defying virus stay-home orders": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "Among the supporters was President Donald Trump, who on Tuesday morning tweeted that Tesla's San Francisco Bay Area factory should be allowed to open despite local health department orders that it stay closed except for minimum basic operations.\n\n\"It can be done fast & safely,\" the president tweeted, joining many of Musk's 34 million Twitter followers who back the defiance.\n\nAmong Musk's biggest critics is California Assemblywoman Lorena Gonzalez, who used an expletive to describe the CEO after his threats to relocate his operations to Texas or Nevada. She said the company is disregarding worker safety and bullying public officials.\n\nTesla's factory reopened Monday with Musk practically daring local authorities to arrest him. The plant apparently continued operations on Tuesday. The company met a Monday deadline to submit a site-specific plan to protect worker safety, which the Alameda County Public Health Department is reviewing, said county spokeswoman Neetu Balram.\n\nThe restart defied orders from the county health department, which has deemed the factory a nonessential business that can't fully open under virus restrictions. The department said Monday it warned the company was operating in violation of the county health order, and hoped Tesla will \"comply without further enforcement measures\" until the county approves a site-specific plan required by the state.\n\n\"We look forward to reviewing Tesla's plan and coming to agreement on protocol and a timeline to reopen safely,\" the statement read.\n\nState law allows a fine of up to $1,000 a day or up to 90 days in jail for operating in violation of health orders.\n\nThe plant in Fremont, a city of more than 230,000 people south of San Francisco, had been closed since March 23. It employs about 10,000 workers.\n\nPublic health experts have credited the stay-home orders with slowing the spread of novel coronavirus, helping hospitals handle an influx of cases. The coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms for most people. But it has killed more than 80,000 people in the U.S., with the death toll rising.\n\nAlameda County was among six San Francisco Bay Area counties that were the first in the nation to impose stay-at-home orders in mid-March. Gov. Gavin Newsom has repeatedly said that counties can impose restrictions that are more stringent than state orders.\n\nThe order in the Bay Area has been extended until the end of the month, but the counties plan to allow some limited business and manufacturing starting May 18, the same day Detroit automakers plan to reopen auto assembly plants. Some auto parts plants were to restart production this week.\n\nThe Detroit automakers' 150,000 U.S. workers are represented by the United Auto Workers union, which has negotiated for added safety precautions. Tesla's workers do not have a union.\n\nMusk, whose company has sued Alameda County seeking to overturn its order, threatened to move Tesla's manufacturing operations and headquarters from the state.\n\nTesla contends in the lawsuit that Alameda County can't be more restrictive than orders from Newsom. The lawsuit says the governor's coronavirus restrictions refer to federal guidelines classifying vehicle manufacturing as essential businesses that are allowed to continue operating.\n\nNo agency appeared ready to enforce the order against Tesla. County sheriff;s Sgt. Ray Kelly said any enforcement would come from Fremont police. Geneva Bosques, Fremont police spokeswoman, said officers would take action at the direction of the county health officer.\n\nCounty Supervisor Scott Haggerty, who represents Fremont, said he's been working on the issue for weeks trying to find a way for Tesla to reopen in a way that satisfies the health officer. He said officials were moving toward allowing Tesla to restart May 18, but he suspects Musk wanted to restart stamping operations to make body parts needed to resume assembling electric vehicles.\n\nTesla has a plan to maintain worker safety, including the wearing of gloves and masks, installing barriers between workers and maintaining social distancing. Haggerty said the company initially pushed back on checking employee temperatures before boarding a company bus to get to work. But Tesla relented, he said, and agreed to check workers.\n\nKrisher reported from Detroit. AP Reporters Janie Har and Juliet Williams in San Francisco and Kathleen Ronayne in Sacramento, California, contributed to this report.",

    "Essential farmworkers risk COVID-19 exposure to maintain food supply": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "Cleotilde is a farmworker in Ventura County who wears a colorful bandana to protect her from the sun and pesticides, but since COVID-19 broke out, she also hopes it can protect her from the virus.\n\n\"Farm work is an honorable job, but a tough job,\" she said. Her employers have implemented social distancing in the fields, but she said she's worried about putting her three daughters at risk when she returns home. \"I leave at 5 in the morning and return at 5 in the evening, and I always have this fear on my mind.\"\n\nWhile many Americans are working from home, farmworkers have continued laboring in fields. The government has deemed their work essential, meaning they're excluded from stay-at-home orders. The pandemic puts additional strain on a community historically overworked and underrepresented.\n\nLillian Argueta is doing everything she can to help them. Thread by thread, she weaves together splashes of brightly colored cloth to make face masks -- about 100 each day.\n\n\"One mask can save a life,\" she said. \"I feel so happy to be able to share what I know how to do. It's my grain of sand.\"\n\nArgueta has been creating masks as part of the Ayudando Latinos a So\u00f1ar organization's project \"Un Respiro de Vida,\" which translates to \"one breath of life.\"\n\nSpearheaded by Dr. Belinda Arriaga, the organization has been distributing masks to farms throughout the West Coast, where many field workers have been laboring without protective gear. The group has delivered about 4,000 masks over the last few weeks.\n\n\"We really started it as a small local project -- we didn't realize the magnitude of how many and how hard it was to get this protection for the farmworkers,\" Arriaga said. \"We're going into a season where everything is harvesting and being grown, and this pandemic has not stopped them.\"\n\nMarciana Lazaro, who picks lettuce and celery in Monterrey County, California, was given a letter by her employers that explained she was an essential worker traveling to and from the fields. Her workplace told employees they could show the letter to police if stopped while commuting.\n\nHer employer has implemented strict social distancing guidelines and ramped up sanitation practices in order to help keep Lazaro and her co-workers safe, but she has heard reports of farmworkers in neighboring towns who've been infected with COVID-19. She said she's put aside her fears to keep working, to provide for her son who's deaf.\n\n\"If I don't work, how will I pay rent?\" she asked.\n\nOrganizations that have built relationships with farmworkers are often the first to find out about incidents where employers aren't following safety protocols.\n\n\"We're getting reports about not enough wash bins, having to bring your own toilet paper, about not having masks,\" said Diana Torres, executive director at the United Farm Workers Foundation.\n\nTorres said one of the biggest challenges farmworkers face in advocating for healthier environments is fear of retaliation from employers -- or deportation.\n\nThere are between 2 to 3 million agricultural workers in the United States. According to the U.S. Department of Labor's National Agricultural Workers Survey, nearly half are undocumented immigrants. The Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act, recently signed by President Donald Trump, provides economic help for some employees and businesses, but it excludes undocumented immigrants. Even without access to health insurance or paid sick leave, most of these workers opt to continue, at substantial personal risk.\n\nAt the beginning of the outbreak, Wilmer Jimenez, western coordinator at the Rural and Migrant Ministry, said some farmworkers in New York state were told to keep working even though they were exhibiting symptoms of COVID-19.\n\n\"They were sick and didn't know that, so they were working along with other people who didn't have the virus,\" he said. \"But later on, when they got tested and came back positive, some of them still went to work.\"\n\nAdditionally, many of those workers return home to environments where social distancing measures suggested by the Centers for Disease and Control and Prevention are difficult, if not impossible, to adhere to. A study conducted by Farmworker Justice, a nonprofit that advocates for healthier living and working conditions, estimates that one-third of farmworkers live in houses and apartments where multiple families share the same household.\n\n\"Their housing tends to be crowded,\" said Alexis Guild, director of Health Policy and Programs at Farmworker Justice. \"They have shared bathrooms and shared kitchens and don't necessarily have the ability to physically distance themselves or to practice those CDC recommendations of hand-washing to keep themselves healthy.\"\n\nHeather Riden, manager of the Western Center for Agricultural Health and Safety at the University of California, Davis, has been working to come up with practical recommendations employers can apply to help keep workers safe while on the clock, but said there are still challenges in implementing social distancing when it comes to certain aspects of farm work.\n\n\"So, OK, if you're having people working in row crops, skip a row in between people so there's greater spacing,\" she said. \"What about when you have equipment that is used for planting or harvesting that requires two people to be sitting in close proximity in order for that equipment to work or to be used? We don't have an exact recommendation for that -- that's a long-term engineering kind of issue.\"\n\nAlexandra Allen and her husband own Main Street Produce in Santa Maria, California, and have placed signs written in Spanish warning workers that they're prohibited from entering the strawberry fields if they're exhibiting flu-like symptoms. They've placed a diagram of two people standing 6 feet apart under the tent where employees pack strawberries to remind them about social distancing. They're also stuffing paycheck envelopes with the latest information from the CDC.\n\n\"The last thing we would ever want to do is let anybody come to work who is sick,\" Allen said.\n\nIn neighboring San Luis Obispo County, Ryan Talley also said he's focusing his efforts on keeping employees safe -- staggering shifts, limiting the number of people riding in each vehicle, disinfecting all of the shared facilities multiple times a day. In some cases, he's reduced production in order to increase safety for employees -- people he refers to as his extended family.\n\n\"Even though our machines require literally individuals being shoulder to shoulder, we've made the adjustment to where we are pulling out every other row, every other individual, so they're at least 6 feet apart in their harvesting,\" he said. \"Our efficiencies have suffered, but we feel that's the most responsible for our employees out in the field.\"\n\nThe Occupational Safety and Health Administration, the government agency that oversees health and safety in workplaces, published \"Guidance on Preparing Workplaces for COVID-19,\" a set of practical guidelines employers should follow to protect workers.\n\nState OSHA agencies in Washington and Oregon have taken a stronger stance against employers who ignore CDC guidelines. They've announced temporary emergency rules to increase protections for agricultural workers from COVID-19. Businesses violating state rules may be susceptible to citations.\n\n\"A couple states are issuing rules, which have an actual legal protection behind it, but federal OSHA has not done any kind of actual rule, which means that it will vary state by state,\" Guild added.\n\n\"Employers are and will continue to be responsible for providing a workplace free of known health and safety hazards,\" a Department of Labor spokesperson told ABC News. \"OSHA's standards remain in place and enforceable, and they will continue to be as workers return to their work places.\"\n\nCleotilde submitted a selfie video to ABC News from the field where she works, on a recent morning as the sun was rising.\n\n\"Good morning, we're here ready to start another day of work in the fields even though we are very worried about the presence of this disease,\" she said in the video. \"Here we are, doing everything possible despite these times, the good and the bad. We're harvesting food and sending it to the table of the millions who need it.\"",

        "authors": [],
        "body": "SAN DIEGO -- Former California Rep. Duncan Hunter wants to push back the start of his prison term for stealing campaign funds until next year because of concerns over the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nHunter's lawyers and prosecutors filed a joint motion in federal court on Tuesday and were awaiting a ruling from a judge on their request to change the surrender date from May 29 to Jan. 4.\n\nIf granted, Hunter promised to not ask for any other changes to his term or that his home confinement be counted toward the 11-month prison stint.\n\n\"In light of the unprecedented challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, this is not a time to be adding to the prison population unnecessarily,\" attorney Devin Burstein said in an email to The Associated Press on Wednesday.\n\nHunter was sentenced in March to 11 months in prison after pleading guilty to stealing campaign funds and spending the money on everything from outings with friends to his daughter's birthday party. The ex-Marine resigned from Congress in January after representing one of Southern California's last solidly Republican districts. A Democrat and Republican are headed to a November runoff for his seat.\n\nLast month, another convicted former congressman from New York, Chris Collins, had his prison start date delayed until June after his lawyers told the court the 69-year-old is in a high risk category if he contracts the coronavirus. Collins, a former Republican representative sentenced to 26 months for securities fraud, is now set to surrender June 23.\n\nAt Hunter's sentencing hearing, his lawyers had asked for most or part of his sentence yo be served in home confinement, citing his military service in Iraq and Afghanistan, and his nearly six terms in Congress. But U.S. District Court Judge Thomas J. Whelan cited the amount of money Hunter misspent and the number of years he carried out the pilfering in rejecting the request.\n\nHunter and his wife Margaret, who was his campaign manager, were accused in a 60-count indictment of stealing more than $250,000 in campaign funds and trying to hide it on financial disclosure records, listing some personal expenses as contributions to Wounded Warriors.\n\nEach pleaded guilty to a single count in separate plea agreements last year, and each had faced up to five years in prison. His wife's sentencing hearing is June 8.\n\nFor most people, the coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia, and death. The vast majority of people recover.",

        "body": "The virus that has sickened over 4 million people around the world and killed more than 250,000 others is so new that patients face considerable uncertainty about what they can expect in recovery and beyond\n\nAn angelic voice singing \"Hallelujah\" echoes off the stately stone and brick canyons of a narrow Montmartre street.\n\nStill struggling with COVID-19 complications two months after falling ill, Parisian soprano Veronica Antonelli wanted the impromptu performance from her third-floor balcony to project hope. Hours earlier, her doctor had delivered troubling news: The lung scarring that sometimes makes her too tired to sing may last for months. Or maybe years.\n\n\"It makes things a bit complicated, given my profession,\" Antonelli said sadly.\n\nThe virus that has sickened over 4 million people around the world and killed more than 280,000 others is so new that patients face considerable uncertainty about what they can expect in recovery and beyond.\n\n\"The short answer is that we're still learning,\" said Dr. Jay Varkey, an infectious disease specialist at Emory University in Atlanta. \"What we know has been gathered mostly by anecdotal reports from COVID-19 survivors.\"\n\nIn support groups created on social media sites, survivors post head-to-toe complaints that read like a medical encyclopedia: anxiety, heart palpitations, muscle aches, bluish toes. It's hard to know which ones are clearly related to the virus, but the accounts help fuel doctors' increasing belief that COVID-19 is not just a respiratory disease.\n\nPersistent exhaustion is a common theme, but every survivor's story is different, said Brandy Swayze, a coronavirus sufferer who created a Facebook survivors group after developing pneumonia. She was hospitalized in late March and early April. Her fatigue comes and goes. Insomnia is another concern.\n\n\"We're just people who have more questions than anybody else about this thing because we're going through it,\" said Swayze, 43, of Cabin John, Maryland.\n\nOn top of her lung damage and fatigue, Antonelli has issues with her memory and a diminished sense of taste and smell -- a common early symptom that lingers for many, which doctors say stems from the virus attacking nerves.\n\nTwo-thirds of patients in a study in Italy had a loss of smell and taste. Some reports suggest these problems last only a few weeks, but it's been almost two months for Antonelli. She said that when she asked a voice specialist when she would be able to smell again, his answer was \"'We know nothing. We just have to be patient. We have no solution.'\"\n\nAntonelli, 45, needs her stamina back to resume her offbeat career -- singing opera a capella at outdoor monuments and historic sites, a profession she chose because she likes how natural environments shape her voice.\n\nStuck at home, she sings at her balcony when she can to bring happiness and thank health workers, grocers and others for their service during the pandemic. Some days, though, she's simply too tired to leave her bed.\n\nIn Wuhan, China, where COVID-19 emerged in December, physicians first considered it a type of pneumonia. But they came to realize \"this virus is so smart. It just attacked everywhere in the body,\" Dr. Xin Zheng of Wuhan Union Hospital said in a livestreamed webinar this month.\n\nLungs, hearts, kidneys, even the brain can be affected. Some hospitalized patients develop blood clots, while others have elevated enzymes suggesting liver abnormalities.\n\n\"That's a very unique characteristic of it,\" said Dr. Thomas McGinn of Northwell Health hospitals in New York. He co-authored the largest U.S. study of hospitalized COVID-19 patients, and a follow-up is planned to see how they're faring in recovery.\n\nAlex Melo, a retired marine from York, Maine, became critically ill with COVID-19 last month. He spent a few days on a ventilator for pneumonia, but also developed blood clots that threatened his heart and lungs. After two weeks in the hospital, he was sent home on blood thinners he must take for at least a few months.\n\nThe drugs make him prone to bleeding, and he worries how that will affect his work as a survival instructor for a Department of Defense contractor. But he's not ready for that work anyway. After two weeks at home, his lungs are still recovering and he can't run without getting winded.\n\n\"I need to take this slow,'' Melo said.\n\nReports from China suggest those with mild infections recover two to three weeks after first showing symptoms. For those with more serious infections, recovery may take six weeks, said Varkey, the infectious disease specialist.\n\nBut recovery may take much longer for those with the most severe infections, including patients who spent time in intensive care on ventilators or dialysis.\n\nWuhan doctors have reported heart problems in a small portion of hospitalized patients, including inflammation of the heart muscle and irregular heartbeats, both of which can increase risks for heart failure, Varkey noted.\n\nMany of the problems may be caused by the virus itself, a hyperactive immune response to the virus, the treatment involved or a combination of all three, he said.\n\nSome survivors who had long stays in intensive care may require oxygen therapy or dialysis at home. Some may develop a condition called post-intensive care syndrome, which can include persistent muscle weakness, fatigue, attention and memory problems and anxiety. The condition has been seen in COVID-19 survivors who were put on ventilators, but it can happen after any critical illness and may be related to treatment, including sedation and prolonged bed rest.\n\nConsidering that most COVID-19 patients on ventilators don't survive, western Illinois truck driver Scott Dobbels is making a remarkable recovery.\n\nDobbels spent 17 days in the hospital, eight of them on a ventilator. He returned to his home in Silvis on April 20 weighing 20 pounds less and pushing a metal walker. The next day, he went just to check things out at the lumber yard where he works and returned exhausted.\n\n\"It put me back in bed for three days. Too much, too soon,\" he said.\n\nAt first, just brushing his teeth was an effort. After several sessions with a physical therapist, he's regaining muscle and strength. And to exercise his damaged lungs, he blows into a special inhaler several times a day.\n\nDobbels says he feels great, despite lingering muscle pain and some weakness, and plans to return to work May 13.\n\nHe also has lingering questions about why his case was so severe when his wife, Elizabeth, became infected but experienced only mild symptoms.\n\n\"Why me?\" he said. \"Why did I get it, why did I almost die, when others weren't as severely affected?''\n\nAssociated Press journalist Federica Narancio contributed to this report from Maryland.\n\nFollow AP Medical Writer Lindsey Tanner on Twitter: @LindseyTanner\n\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute's Department of Science Education.

    "FDA approves drug for heart failure that may keep patients out of the hospital during COVID-19 pandemic": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "AstraZeneca's diabetes drug, Farxiga, has become the first in its class to receive FDA approval as a treatment for heart failure.\n\n\"It's great news for patients with this condition,\" said Dr. Mikhail N. Kosiborod, a cardiologist at Saint Luke's Mid America Heart Institute and vice president of research at Saint Luke's Health System, who investigated the efficacy and safety of the drug prior to its approval.\n\nKosiborod said the newly approved drug -- which was initially developed as a diabetes drug -- will give patients \"a new treatment option that's unlike any other heart failure medication. It works through a completely different mechanism of action and addresses all of the key objectives in treating patients with heart failure.\"\n\nAs doctors consider prescribing Farxiga drug to patients with heart failure, AstraZeneca is also studying whether the drug may benefit certain patients with COVID-19 -- some who suffer from mysterious cardiovascular problems such as blood clots and heart damage.\n\nHeart failure accounts for a large number of hospitalizations and healthcare expenditures in the U.S. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, it affects about 6.5 million people in the country, and in 2017, it contributed to 1 in 8 deaths.\n\nThere are two main types of heart failure. About half of the people who suffer from the disease have reduced ejection fraction, which means that their heart cannot properly pump blood because its muscle has been weakened. As for the other half, their heart's ability to pump blood is fairly conserved, but an underlying condition like high blood pressure compromises its normal functioning.\n\nSo far, Farxiga has been approved only for the group of heart failure patients with decreased ejection fraction, but studies are ongoing to see if the drug could also work for the others.\n\nIn patients diagnosed with heart failure with reduced heart function, the drug, when taken in conjunction with traditionally prescribed heart failure medication, has been proven -- in a previously published study -- to reduce the risk of hospitalization and death, whether or not the patient was also diagnosed with type 2 diabetes.\n\n\"Heart failure is not just a highly morbid disease because of the risk of dying or having to go to a hospital, it is also associated with a heavy burden of debilitating symptoms, like shortness of breath or exertional intolerance,\" Kosiborod said.\n\nFarxiga was shown to reduce the burden of these symptoms and improve patients' quality of life.\n\n\"This is actually a pretty positive study,\" said Dr. Varinder Singh, chief of cardiology at Lenox Hill Hospital. With the FDA approval in place, he believes this \"drug should definitely be used in clinical practice,\" but that doesn't mean Farxiga will be right for every patient.\n\n\"It is always going to be on a case-by-case basis. Some patients may not tolerate it, you'd have to find your specific subgroup of patients,\" he added. For example, this medication may not be suitable for people with compromised kidney function.\n\nFarxiga belongs to a class of drugs called SGLT2 inhibitors, which \"when first introduced to the world were really thought entirely as diabetes treatment,\" Kosiborod said. \"We started discovering that these medicines have remarkable additional properties beyond lowering blood sugar and treating diabetes, which included prevention of heart failure.\"\n\nKosiborod believes that the positive results on patients, along with the FDA's nod of approval, will help pave the way for a new class of medication to be used beyond diabetes treatment. \"I think this approval formally marks the official transition of this entire class of agents from being viewed as diabetes medications to being viewed also as cardiovascular medications.\"\n\nSingh says that Farxiga is a \"welcome addition to our armamentarium.\" Although it may take time for large medical associations to respond to the approval with updated guidelines on how to integrate it into preexisting heart failure clinical treatment plans, Singh says that physicians may already start prescribing it to patients who are suitable candidates.\n\nThis approval, amidst the current pandemic may also help further the treatment of certain COVID-19 patients.\n\nResearchers are conducting various studies to determine whether or not Farxiga could be potentially beneficial in certain patients that are hospitalized with COVID-19.\n\n\"We know that COVID-19 is not just a respiratory illness, it also affects the heart, as well as other vital organs,\" Kosiborod said.\n\nFor high-risk patients who contract COVID-19 with preexisting cardiovascular disease, researchers hope Farxiga may help reduce the risk of disease progression and of serious complications.\n\nThrough the ongoing global Phase III trial, DARE-19, researchers will determine whether the drug could decrease the severity of illness and lessen the cardiovascular, respiratory, and kidney complication in this particularly vulnerable group of COVID-19 patients. Kosiborod says, \"We think there is a reasonable possibility that they may be beneficial,\" but further investigations need to be done to evaluate whether the potential benefits outweigh any potential risks.\n\nEden David, who's studying neuroscience at Columbia University and matriculating to medical school later this year, is a contributor to the ABC News Medical Unit.",

        "authors": [],
        "body": "WASHINGTON -- Vice President Mike Pence's press secretary has the coronavirus, the White House said, making her the second person who works at the White House complex known to test positive for the virus this week. A member of the White House coronavirus task force has placed himself in self-quarantine for the next two weeks after coming in contact with a person who has tested positive for COVID-19\n\nPresident Donald Trump, who publicly identified the affected Pence aide, said he was \"not worried\" about the virus spreading in the White House. Nonetheless, officials said they were stepping up safety protocols for the complex.\n\nPence spokeswoman Katie Miller, who tested positive Friday, had been in recent contact with Pence but not with the president. She is married to Stephen Miller, a top Trump adviser. The White House had no immediate comment on whether Stephen Miller had been tested or if he was still working in the White House.\n\nKatie Miller had tested negative Thursday, a day before her positive result.\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration is not disclosing the identity of the person who had tested positive and with whom the agency's commissioner, Stephen Hahn, had come in contact.\n\nFDA spokeswoman Stephanie Caccomo said Hahn tested negative for the virus after he learned of the contact. He wrote a note to staff on Friday to alert them. Now in self-quarantine, Hahn was scheduled to testify before a Senate committee on Tuesday, along with infectious disease expert Dr. Anthony Fauci and Dr. Robert Redfield, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nThe positive test for the senior Pence aide came one day after White House officials confirmed that a member of the military serving as one of Trump's valets had tested positive for COVID-19.\n\nSix people who had been in contact with Miller were scheduled to fly with Pence on Friday to Des Moines, Iowa, on Air Force Two. They were removed from the flight just before it took off, according to a senior administration official.\n\nNone of those people were exhibiting symptoms, but were asked to deplane so they could be tested \"out of an abundance of caution,\" a senior administration official told reporters traveling with Pence. All six later tested negative, the White House said.\n\nThe official said staff in the West Wing are tested regularly but much of Pence's staff -- which works next door in the Executive Office Building -- are tested less frequently. Katie Miller was not on the plane and had not been scheduled to be on the trip.\n\nPence, who is tested on a regular basis, was tested Friday. Miller tweeted she was \"doing well\" and looked forward to getting back to work.\n\nWhite House chief of staff Mark Meadows said the administration was stepping up mitigation efforts already recommended by public health experts and taking other unspecified precautions to ensure the safety of the president.\n\nMeadows said the White House was \"probably the safest place that you can come,\" but he was reviewing further steps to keep Trump and Pence safe.\n\nThe White House requires daily temperature checks of anyone who enters the White House complex and has encouraged social distancing among those working in the building. The administration has also directed regular deep cleaning of all work spaces. Anyone who comes in close proximity to the president and vice president is tested daily for COVID-19.\n\n\"We've already put in a few protocols that we're looking at, obviously, to make sure that the president and his immediate staff stay safe. But it's not just the president, it's all the workers that are here ... on a daily basis,\" Meadows said.\n\nTrump's valet's case marked the first known instance where a person who has come in close proximity to the president has tested positive since several people present at his private Florida club were diagnosed with COVID-19 in early March. The valet tested positive Wednesday.\n\nThe White House was moving to shore up its protection protocols to protect the nation's political leaders. Trump said some staffers who interact with him closely would now be tested daily. Pence told reporters Thursday that both he and Trump would now be tested daily as well.\n\nMadhani reported from Chicago.

    "FDA probes accuracy issue with Abbott's rapid virus test": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "WASHINGTON -- Federal health officials are alerting doctors to a potential accuracy problem with a rapid test for COVID-19 used at thousands of hospitals, clinics and testing sites across the U.S., including the White House.\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration said late Thursday it is investigating preliminary data suggesting Abbott Laboratories' 15-minute test can miss COVID-19 cases, falsely clearing patients of infection. The test is used daily at the White House to test President Donald Trump and key members of his staff, including the coronavirus task force.\n\nThe warning came one day after researchers at New York University reported results suggesting Abbott's test can miss up to half the infections caught by a rival test made by Cepheid. The research has not been peer-reviewed or published in a medical journal and was based on about 100 patients.\n\nThe researchers found that Abbott's test, run on the company's portable ID NOW system, missed one-third of the infections caught by Cepheid's test when swabs were stored in liquid used to transport laboratory samples. When the samples were kept dry the test missed 48% of the cases flagged by Cepheid's test.\n\nThe researchers called the test's performance \"unacceptable,\" due to the risk of falsely clearing patients who could spread the infection to others. They acknowledged shortcomings of the study, including the time needed to transport patient samples to the device for processing.\n\nAbbott rejected the findings, saying the researchers used the test \"in ways that it was not designed to be used.\"\n\n\"ID NOW is intended to be used near the patient with a direct swab test method,\" the company said in a statement. The company pointed to other independent study results that found the test accurately detected 90% or more infections.\n\nLast month Abbott changed the instructions for its test to explicitly warn against putting patient samples in transport chemicals. The update came after researchers at the Cleveland Clinic reported a 15% false negative rate for samples stored in the chemicals.\n\nThe FDA said in a statement it is reviewing the data with Abbott and working on a letter to health care providers about potential accuracy issues. The agency said physicians may need to confirm the results of a negative Abbott test if patients have signs and symptoms of the virus. Regulators said they are requiring Abbott to conduct follow-up studies on the test's accuracy.\n\n\"This test can still be used and can correctly identify many positive cases in minutes,\" said Dr. Tim Stenzel, FDA's diagnostics director.\n\nThe FDA first cleared Abbott's test in late March under emergency powers used to quickly accelerate the review of tests and treatments during a public health crisis. The agency has authorized more than 90 tests, effectively flooding the market with testing options amid persistent problems ramping up testing levels.\n\nFor weeks, Trump has promoted Abbott's test as a \"game changer.\" On Monday, the company's ID NOW system and test cartridges were displayed prominently at a Rose Garden press conference meant to highlight the nation's progress on testing.\n\n\"These tests are highly sophisticated -- very quick, very good,\" Trump told reporters.\n\nThe administration has shipped more than 235,000 of the tests to state public health laboratories. And Abbott has separately said it has distributed 1.8 million tests to health care facilities in all 50 states.\n\nA White House spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment Thursday night.\n\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute's Department of Science Education.

        "body": "TEHRAN, Iran -- The false belief that toxic methanol cures the coronavirus has seen over 700 people killed in Iran, an official said Monday.\n\nThat represents a higher death toll than so far released by the Iranian Health Ministry.\n\nAn adviser to the ministry, Hossein Hassanian, said that the difference in death tallies is because some alcohol poisoning victims died outside of hospital.\n\n\"Some 200 people died outside of hospitals\", Hassanian told The Associated Press.\n\nAlcohol poisoning has skyrocketed by ten times over in Iran in the past year, according to a government report released earlier in April, amid the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nThe national coroner's authority said that alcohol poisoning killed 728 Iranians between Feb. 20 and April 7. Last year there were only 66 deaths from alcohol poisoning, according to the report.\n\nSeparately, the Iranian health ministry spokesman, Kianoush Jahanpour said that 525 people have died from swallowing toxic methanol alcohol since Feb. 20, state TV reported on Monday.\n\nJahanpour said that a total of 5,011 people had been poisoned from methanol alcohol.\n\nHe added that some 90 people have lost their eye sight or are suffering eye damage from the alcohol poisoning.\n\nHassanian also said the final tally of people who lost their eye sight could be much higher.\n\nIran is facing the worst coronavirus outbreak in the Middle East with 5,806 deaths and more than 91,000 confirmed case.\n\nMethanol cannot be smelled or tasted in drinks. It causes delayed organ and brain damage. Symptoms include chest pain, nausea, hyperventilation, blindness and even coma.\n\nIn Iran, the government mandates that manufacturers of toxic methanol add an artificial color to their products so the public can tell it apart from ethanol, the kind of alcohol that can be used in cleaning wounds. Ethanol is found in alcoholic beverages, though its production is illegal in Iran.\n\nSome bootleggers in Iran use methanol, adding a splash of bleach to mask the added color before selling it as drinkable. Methanol also can contaminate traditionally fermented alcohol.\n\nThe consumption of alcohol is generally prohibited in Iran. However, minority Christians, Jews and Zoroastrians can drink alcoholic beverages in private.\n\nFollowing the coronavirus outbreak, Iran's government announced it would issue permission for new alcohol factories quickly.\n\nIran has currently some 40 alcohol factory that have been allocated for pharmaceutical and sanitizing items.\n\nAlready before the outbreak, the Iranian economy was struggling under severe U.S. sanctions blocking the sale of its crude oil abroad.",

        "body": "MIAMI -- The family of a cruise crew member who died after testing positive for COVID-19 filed a lawsuit against Royal Caribbean Cruises on Tuesday saying the company failed to protect its employees as the pandemic ravaged sailings around the world.\n\nThe wrongful death case filed in circuit court in Miami says Pujiyoko, 27, worked in housekeeping on the Symphony of the Seas and suffered from flu-like symptoms including a fever and shortness of breath but was not tested for six days.\n\nThe lawsuit also argues Royal Caribbean failed to follow basic safety precautions allowing buffets and parties and mandating crew members to participate in drills even after the U.S. government had issued a no-sail order to curb coronavirus infections.\n\nFor the cruise ships that were at sea when the order took effect, companies negotiated for their passengers to disembark, wrangling with countries and local governments wary of sick travelers. But for the most part, crew members remained on board vessels floating off-coast.\n\nPujiyoko, of Bali, Indonesia, was disembarked in a life boat and taken to a hospital in Fort Lauderdale on March 30, seven days after first reporting to the ship's medical facility. He died on April 11.\n\nMichael Winkleman, a maritime lawyer representing the family, says Pujiyoko had no underlying conditions and had passed preemployment and reemployment medical screenings to work for Royal Caribbean.\n\nWinkleman says he will be arguing the arbitration agreements that limit crew members from suing cruise companies don't apply to this case because his contract was terminated by Royal Caribbean. The company said it does not comment on pending litigation.\n\nThe complaint seeks an undetermined amount but says his family is entitled to the income the man would have continued to earn and the cost of funeral expenses.\n\nClarifies that Pujiyoko, like many Indonesians, uses only one name. Fnu stands for \"first name unknown\" in the complaint.\n\nFollow AP coverage of the pandemic at https://apnews.com/VirusOutbreak and https://apnews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak.",

        "body": "The family of a Pennsylvania meat factory worker who was killed by the coronavirus is suing the company, alleging his employer didn't provide him with protective equipment.\n\nEnock Benjamin died from complications of the virus on April 3, just four days after the JBS slaughterhouse in Souderton, Pennsylvania, closed its doors because workers showed symptoms, according to the family's attorney, Robert J. Mongeluzzi.\n\nMongeluzzi said the factory had employees work in unsafe conditions with no protective equipment, which led to his client's sickness, adding in a statement: \"JBS treated workers as expendable and placed them standing shoulder-to-shoulder without basic protective equipment such as masks. JBS placed profits over safety and must be held accountable.\"\n\nThe wrongful death suit filed in Philadelphia contends JBS failed to adhere to guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention about providing masks and PPE for employees. The suit claims the factory owners increased production in March to meet higher demand.\n\nJBS didn't immediately return requests for comment from ABC News. On April 2, 19 employees at the Souderton plant contracted the virus, according to the lawsuit. The facility reopened April 20.\n\n\"In a demonstration of placing profits over safety, the JBS Defendants ignored the health of vulnerable workers and did not shut any plants prior to March 30, 2020, despite a mountain of evidence of a public safety concern of unforeseen magnitude,\" attorneys said in the filing.\n\nBenjamin, who was the union chief steward of the plant, first began experiencing symptoms March 27, after several coworkers began showing symptoms, the suit said.\n\nHe left behind his wife of 37 years, Mirielle, two children, Debbie and Ferdinand \"Cabo,\" and a granddaughter.\n\nThe suit doesn't specify the amount in compensation the family is seeking.\n\nRepresentatives from UFCW Local 1776, Benjamin's union, didn't immediately return messages seeking comment. President Wendell Young told ABC affiliate WPVI that the plant owners should have been more cautious.\n\n\"If you need PPE and you don't have it, you don't allow your people to go to work,\" he said.",

    "Faxes and email: Old technology slows COVID-19 response": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "On April 1, a researcher at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention emailed Nevada public health counterparts for lab reports on two travelers who had tested positive for the coronavirus. She asked Nevada to send those records via a secure network or a \"password protected encrypted file\" to protect the travelers' privacy.\n\nThe Nevada response: Can we just fax them over?\n\nYou'd hardly know the U.S. invented the internet by the way its public health workers are collecting vital pandemic data. While health-care industry record-keeping is now mostly electronic, cash-strapped state and local health departments still rely heavily on faxes, email and spreadsheets to gather infectious disease data and share it with federal authorities.\n\nThis data dysfunction is hamstringing the nation's coronavirus response by, among other things, slowing the tracing of people potentially exposed to the virus. In response, the Trump administration set up a parallel reporting system run by the Silicon Valley data-wrangling firm Palantir. Duplicating many data requests, it has placed new burdens on front-line workers at hospitals, labs and other health care centers who already report case and testing data to public health agencies.\n\nThere's little evidence so far that the Palantir system has measurably improved federal or state response to COVID-19.\n\nEmails exchanged between the CDC and Nevada officials in March and early April, obtained by The Associated Press in a public records request, illustrate the scope of the problem. It sometimes takes multiple days to track down such basic information as patient addresses and phone numbers. One disease detective consults Google to fill a gap. Data vital to case investigations such as patient travel and medical histories is missing.\n\nNone of this is news to the CDC or other health experts. \"We are woefully behind,\" the CDC's No. 2 official, Anne Schuchat, wrote in a September report on public health data technology. She likened the state of U.S. public health technology to \"puttering along the data superhighway in our Model T Ford.\"\n\nHOLES IN THE DATA\n\nThis information technology gap might seem puzzling given that most hospitals and other health care providers have long since ditched paper files for electronic health records. Inside the industry, they're easily shared, often automatically.\n\nBut data collection for infectious-disease reports is another story, particularly in comparison to other industrialized nations. Countries like Germany, Britain and South Korea -- and U.S. states such as New York and Colorado -- are able to populate online dashboards far richer in real-time data and analysis. In Germany, a map populated with public data gathered by an emergency-care doctors' association even shows hospital bed availability.\n\nIn the U.S., many hospitals and doctors are often failing to report detailed clinical data on coronavirus cases, largely because it would have to be manually extracted from electronic records, then sent by fax or email, said Johns Hopkins epidemiologist Jennifer Nuzzo.\n\nIt's not unusual for public health workers to have to track patients down on social media, use the phone book or scavenge through other public-health databases that may have that information, said Rachelle Boulton, the Utah health department official responsible for epidemiological reporting. Even when hospitals and labs report that information electronically, it's often incomplete.\n\nDeficiencies in CDC collection have been especially glaring.\n\nIn 75% of COVID-19 cases compiled in April, data on the race and ethnicity of victims was missing. A report on children affected by the virus only had symptom data for 9%of laboratory-confirmed cases for which age was known. A study on virus-stricken U.S. health care workers could not tally the number affected because the applicable boxes were only checked on 16% of received case forms. In another study, the CDC only had data on preexisting conditions -- risk factors such as diabetes, heart and respiratory disease -- for 6% of reported cases.\n\nMissing from daily indicators that CDC makes public is data such as nationwide hospitalizations over the previous 24 hours and numbers of tests ordered and completed -- information vital to guiding the federal response, said Dr. Ashish Jha, director of the Harvard Global Health Institute.\n\n\"The CDC during this entire pandemic has been two steps behind the disease,\" Jha said.\n\nREINVENTING THE WHEEL\n\nInstead of accelerating existing efforts to modernize U.S. disease reporting, the White House asked Palantir, whose founder Peter Thiel is a major backer of President Donald Trump, to hastily build out a data collection platform called HHS Protect. It has not gone well.\n\nOn March 29, Vice President Mike Pence, who chairs the task force, sent a letter asking 4,700 hospitals to collect daily numbers on virus test results, patient loads and hospital bed and intensive care-unit capacity. That information, the letter said, should be compiled into spreadsheets and emailed to the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which would feed it into the $25 million Palantir system.\n\nOn April 10, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar added more reporting requirements for hospitals.\n\nThose mandates sparked a backlash among stressed hospitals already reporting data to state and local health departments. Producing additional cumbersome spreadsheets for the federal government \"is just not sustainable,\" said Janet Hamilton, executive director of the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists.\n\nHHS Protect now comprises more than 200 datasets, including reporting from nearly three-quarters of the roughly 8,000 U.S. hospitals, according to Katie McKeogh, an HHS press officer. It includes supply-chain data from industry, test results from labs and state policy actions.\n\nBut due to limited government transparency, it's not clear how accurate or helpful HHS Protect has been. Asked for examples of its usefulness, McKeogh mentioned only one: White House task force coordinator Dr. Deborah Birx receives a nightly report based on what the system gathers that provides \"a common (nationwide) operating picture of cases at a county level.\"\n\n\"We will continue to work to improve upon the common operating picture,\" McKeogh said when asked about holes in HHS data collection. Neither HHS nor the CDC would provide officials to answer questions about HHS Protect; Palantir declined to discuss it on the record.\n\nFIXING THE PROBLEM\n\nFarzad Mostashari, who a decade ago oversaw the federal effort to modernize paper-based medical records, said it would be far more efficient to fix existing public-health data systems than to create a parallel system like HHS Protect.\n\n\"We have a lot of the pieces in place,\" Mostashari said. A public-private partnership called digitalbridge.us is central to that effort. Pilot projects that automate infectious disease case reporting were expanded in late January. Overall, 252,000 COVID case reports have been generated so far, said CDC spokesman Benjamin N. Haynes. In December, Congress appropriated $50 million for grants to expand the effort, which is already active in Utah, New York, California, Texas and Michigan.\n\nGoing forward, the CDC is evaluating how to spend $500 million from March's huge pandemic relief package to upgrade health care information technology.\n\nIn the meantime, public-health officers are still doing things the hard way. Up to half the lab reports submitted for public health case investigations lack patient addresses or ZIP codes, according to a May 1 Duke University white paper co-authored by Mostashari.\n\n\"We're losing days trying to go back and collect that information,\" said Hamilton of the epidemiologists' council. \"And then we're reaching out to hospitals or physicians' offices that, quite frankly, are saying 'I'm too busy to tell you that.'\"",

    "Fear of future that devastated NYC restaurant workers face": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "For years, working in restaurants has been a constant for Isabella Gutierrez.\n\nIt was something she could always fall back on to pay the bills while she pursued her creative dreams. It was the first job she had when she moved to New York City in 2011 from California.\n\nBut no more. The coronavirus outbreak and the likely impact it's going to have on New York City's restaurants, how they serve, how they staff, how they pay, has disrupted all of that.\n\n\"This could fundamentally change restaurant culture,\" said Gutierrez, 33.\n\nEven when the restrictions are lifted and businesses start opening up, \"I, for one, don't see myself returning to restaurant work after this,\" she said. \"There's going to be less money in it.\"\n\nIt's a concern for restaurant owners in New York City, where sitting cheek by jowl in a crowded hotspot or in that tiny hole-in-the-wall hidden gem has been a way of life -- one that doesn't work in a socially distancing world.\n\n\"There's a lot of fear,\" said Melissa Fleischut, president of the New York State Restaurant Association. \"Will tourists come back, will people come out? Are the employees going to want to come back to work? How are we going to convince everybody it's safe and healthy to eat in a restaurant again?\"\n\nShe said the social distancing restrictions have been devastating -- of the 660,000 people employed in restaurants in New York state in February, many of whom are in New York City, their estimates say 527,000, have been furloughed.\n\nFor Gutierrez, the end came abruptly. She had been scheduled to go in for a dinner shift at the Brooklyn restaurant where she was a server on March 15 when she got a call from her manager telling her the place was shutting down and \"everyone was out of a job.\"\n\nSince then, thanks to the base unemployment amount plus an additional amount from one of the federal government's pieces of stimulus legislation, she's been getting about what she would make in a decent week as a server.\n\nGutierrez, who was sidelined by COVID-type symptoms in late March, has also applied for food stamps, spoken to her landlord and credit card company, and deferred her student loans.\n\n\"For me, the most overwhelming thing is I don't know when I'll get a job again,\" Gutierrez said. \"The concept of not being able to get a job, of not knowing when I'm going to get a job if that's even possible because of the pandemic is very frightening.\"\n\nShe's trying to think of it as an opportunity, putting her yoga teaching certification to use by conducting online sessions, working on her podcast and writing. After all, that's why she had gone back to waitressing after four years away, to give her the flexibility to do more with her creative dreams.\n\n\"In one regard I'm excited about pursuing my creative endeavors harder because that's now my only option,\" she said.\n\nThere is no other option for Gabby Namm, 27, who had been working as a cook at her Brooklyn restaurant for about a month and a half when it shut down in March.\n\nThe Queens resident has been cooking professionally for about eight years, and has always loved it.\n\n\"Food makes people really happy,\" she said. \"I really enjoy just seeing the results kind of immediately. There's something so satisfying about being able to know ... you nourished people in some way.\"\n\nNamm also saw it as a solid bet for employment, doing what her dad, a former newspaper printer, advised her -- picking a job that a computer couldn't take over.\n\n\"Restaurants always need cooks. It was always reliable, until recently,\" she said.\n\nHer restaurant also shut down in the face of the pandemic, forcing her to file for unemployment, along with her fiance, who is also a chef.\n\nNamm applied for unemployment in mid-March, spending hours on the phone, but still hasn't started getting money, forcing her to tap into savings to stay afloat.\n\n\"I think I'm OK for now. If my unemployment doesn't come in soon, I'm definitely going to have a talk with my landlord,\" she said.\n\nShe's apprehensive about what the future holds for New York City's restaurants, worried about finding another place to cook in a world where there are limits to how close people can be to each other.\n\n\"If I want to go back to my job, will they be able to afford to have me back, will they be allowed to have the staff that they want,\" Namm said. \"It's definitely a whole other level of anxiety that has been brought on.\"\n\nShe's thought about whether there was something else she could do, but \"this is what I do best. This is what I fell in love with doing and brings me joy everyday.\"\n\nFleischut, the state restaurant association president, was optimistic that New York City would continue to have some form of the vibrant restaurant culture it's renowned for.\n\n\"I don't think it's that hopeless,\" she said, adding that restaurant owners \"feel there won't be a large presence of restaurants, it's just, what does it look like? Can the small mom-and-pop dine-in restaurants survive? That's the real question.\"\n\nHajela has covered New York for The Associated Press for 20 years.

    "Fears grow as coronavirus bears down on Mexico City": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "MEXICO CITY -- A hand-washing station and bright yellow signs warning of an area of \"high infection\" now greet the steady stream of hearses at the entrance to the San Nicolas Tolentino cemetery in a working-class neighborhood of this sprawling metropolis.\n\nFuneral parlors and crematoriums in Iztapalapa, a borough of 2 million people, are working day and night to manage the surging number of dead in the capital's hardest-hit corner.\n\nConcern is growing that mixed messages about the seriousness of the pandemic from Mexico's president and lax enforcement of social distancing are manifesting in what could be a frightening preview as infections begin to peak in Mexico City and its suburbs -- where some 20 million people live in close quarters, jamming subways and buses, shopping in crowded markets and clustering around street food stalls.\n\nOn a recent morning, Rafael Hern\u00e1ndez, who has sold tacos at the cemetery's entrance for 40 years, said an average day before the pandemic might bring five or six hearses past his stand. \"Today there have been 10 in an hour,\" he said.\n\nRafael Herrera said in his 25 years working in the crematorium next door he's never seen anything like it. They've had to add another shift, and funeral parlors are calling for crematoriums like his to run their ovens run 24 hours a day as Mexico City recommends and pays for the cremations of coronavirus victims.\n\n\"We can't keep up,\" Herrera said. \"We're working from 6 in the morning to midnight.\"\n\nBehind that surging demand are personal tragedies. People are falling sick, dying and being cremated often before families receive test results if they come at all.\n\nErika, a 42-year-old lawyer, lost her mother two weeks ago, her brother is on a ventilator and her husband was admitted to the hospital Monday complaining of difficulty breathing. Her mother, who was diabetic, died two days after starting to feel ill and was cremated before a coronavirus test was performed. Her death certificate lists \"respiratory insufficiency, atypical pneumonia, likely COVID-19.\"\n\n\"The cruelest thing in all of this is not being able to honor or accompany your relative,\" said Erika, referring to the traditional gatherings in homes that attract dozens or hundreds of mourners.\n\nShe is awaiting test results on her brother.\n\n\"I think what's happening to me is happening to a lot of families,\" said Erika, who didn't give her last name because she's a criminal defense attorney and feared repercussions. She blamed a lack of early information from the government, saying that if the family had known her mother had the virus they would have taken more precautions. The family entered in a panic after her mother's death, but aside from her brother hasn't been able to get tested and struggles to get information about hospitalized relatives.\n\n\"My father is devastated. He doesn't sleep because of my brother. He doesn't sleep because his wife just died. And yesterday in the time that my husband was admitted there were three deaths,\" she said. Her father was rushed to the hospital Wednesday with a fever, but later released.\n\nIn Mexico City, there are more than 7,500 positive cases and more than 600 deaths -- about a quarter of the national total -- though health authorities concede the real number of infections is many times higher.\n\nAnd authorities and experts agree the worst is yet to come.\n\n\"We have to prepare ourselves for the hardest, ugliest part,\" said Dr. Mauricio Rodr\u00edguez, of Mexico's National Autonomous University. There will be more hospitals filled to capacity and more deaths.\n\nRodr\u00edguez said there was a certain \"schizophrenia\" in the political messaging, because at the same time the government is urging people to prepare for the epidemic's peak, they're talking about relaxing measures to satisfy economic sectors.\n\nHe emphasized, however, that from a public health perspective, it is crucial now for people in the most affected areas -- the capital metro area first among them -- to stay inside, and isolate themselves if they have symptoms. He reminded people the virus can seriously sicken someone in very little time and with hospitals overwhelmed there may be nowhere to take them.\n\nMexico has extremely limited testing compared to other countries, which makes experts believe the country's infections are much higher. Mexico City Mayor Claudia Sheinbaum said recently the city was performing only about 700 tests per day. The government has defended its limited testing of only people meeting a list of criteria, but it has left a growing number of families unsure of what killed their loved ones.\n\nGuadalupe Guti\u00e9rrez's 38-year-old son Gabriel Ulises Mart\u00ednez was cremated this week with the family still uncertain of what he died from. She said he was hospitalized for 11 days with heart problems and flu-like symptoms but they were advised to cremate him because he might have had coronavirus.\n\nThe usually bustling streets of Iztapalapa are noticeably quieter these days. There is palpable worry, especially among the majority of its residents who can't afford to stay home.\n\nAmong them is Christian Antonio Castillo, the 27-year-old cook in the kitchen of public hospital No. 47.\n\nWhen his father was admitted to his hospital with low oxygen levels, Castillo decided he should no longer sleep at home, where some 20 family members -- nearly half of them diabetic -- live together in a house with a shared kitchen and bathrooms.\n\nNow Castillo sleeps in his car outside the hospital, next to a tent where anxious relatives wait day and night for word of their loved ones. As he spoke, three women cried together and another jumped when she heard her relative's name called. Outside a nearby door, the hospital's dead continued to exit one by one.\n\n\"I always thought I'd be the first to catch it,\" Castillo said. \"Now we're all nervous, because the whole family was living with him,\" he said of his father, who is on a ventilator with damaged lungs as the family awaits his test result.\n\n\"The test is the least of our worries,\" he said. \"I just pray this ends.\"",

        "body": "WASHINGTON -- A pregnant inmate whose baby was delivered by cesarean section while she was on a ventilator after being hospitalized with coronavirus symptoms has died in federal custody, the Bureau of Prisons said Tuesday.\n\nAndrea Circle Bear, 30, died on Tuesday, about a month after she was hospitalized while serving a 26-month sentence for maintaining a drug-involved premises.\n\nShe is the 29th federal inmate to die in the Bureau of Prisons custody since late March. As of Tuesday, more than 1,700 federal inmates have tested positive for COVID-19. About 400 of those inmates have recovered.\n\nCircle Bear was first brought to FMC Carswell, a federal prison medical facility in Fort Worth, Texas, on March 20 from a local jail in South Dakota. As a new inmate in the federal prison system, she was quarantined as part of the Bureau of Prisons' plan to slow the spread of the coronavirus.\n\nShe was taken to a local hospital on March 28 for \"potential concerns regarding her pregnancy,\" but was discharged from the hospital the same day and brought back to the prison, officials said. Three days later, prison medical staff members decided she should be brought back to the hospital after she developed a fever, dry cough and other symptoms, according to the Bureau of Prisons.\n\nCircle Bear was put on a ventilator the same day she arrived at the hospital and her baby was born the next day by C-section, officials said. She tested positive for COVID-19 days later, on April 4.\n\nCircle Bear's pregnancy made her high risk for the virus, but she would not be considered priority for release under the Bureau of Prisons and Justice Department guidelines on releasing prisoners to home confinement to help stop the spread. She was already on a ventilator when an expanded home confinement memo was handed down by the Justice Department in early April.\n\nAttorney General William Barr ordered the increased use of home confinement and the expedited release of eligible inmates by the Bureau of Prisons, with priority for those at low- or medium-security prisons -- starting with virus hot spots. Under the Bureau of Prisons guidelines, the agency is prioritizing the release of those who have served half of their sentence or inmates who have 18 months or less left and who served at least 25% of their time.\n\nCircle Bear, of Eagle Butte, South Dakota, had been sentenced in January after she pleaded guilty in federal court. The charges stemmed from incidents in April 2018 when she \"unlawfully and knowingly used and maintained a place for the purpose of distributing methamphetamine on the Cheyenne River Sioux Indian Reservation,\" the Justice Department said.\n\nFollow Balsamo on Twitter at twitter.com/MikeBalsamo1",

    "Focus on nursing home workers amid continued virus outbreaks": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "For nearly two months, many nursing homes nationwide have been on virtual lockdown.\n\nFamilies of residents are not allowed inside, vendors have to drop deliveries outside and the only people coming in and out are health care workers and assistants.\n\nDespite all that, the outbreaks continue -- possibly spread by the same nursing home workers who are risking their lives to tend to tend to some of society's most vulnerable. In response, many workers are significantly increasing their own vigilance, nursing homes are adding safety measures, and testing of residents and workers is steadily increasing, though experts say much more is needed.\n\n\"Many residents are asymptomatic, and so are the staff, so they don't always know that they have it,\" said Charlene Harrington, professor emeritus at University of California, San Francisco's nursing school.\n\nMore than 23,000 people have died in long-term care and nursing home facilities since the first coronavirus outbreak in a nursing home in a Washington facility in February, according to a tally by The Associated Press.\n\nOn March 13, federal officials limited visits to essential healthcare workers and told facilities to halt communal dining and group activities and screen staff for fevers or cough. Many of the outbreaks have come since then, including in California, Texas, Minnesota and West Virginia, among other states.\n\nThere is no national tally on the number of nursing home workers, ranging from nurses to assistants, who have had the virus, in part because many don't necessarily feel sick or get tested. In most cases, it's impossible to confirm how the disease was brought in or how long it was at a facility before manifesting itself in patients or workers. But with families and vendors barred, and many residents not allowed out of their rooms, most circulating comes from workers tending to patients.\n\nAcross the country, facility staff post supportive messages on social media and are touted by their employers as heroes. And while they bravely head to work, many fear they'll contract the virus there and bring it home to their families -- or that they could pick it up unknowingly at the supermarket and transmit it to their elderly patients.\n\nJeffrey Ravago, a 36-year-old certified nurse assistant, said his temperature is taken before each shift at a Northern California skilled nursing facility and outside work he only goes to Costco to buy essentials.\n\n\"The only way for it to get in is through us, because we're basically locked down right now, and we're being very careful,\" he said.\n\nMark Parkinson, president of the American Health Care Association, said officials were slow from the start to help prepare and protect the country's skilled nursing and assisted living facilities. While the initial focus was on urgent hospital needs, workers in these centers struggled for weeks with a lack of personal protective equipment and limited testing.\n\n\"The inability to access a sufficient supply of masks has made it virtually impossible to stop the virus inside of buildings,\" Parkinson said.\n\nThe organization is also pushing for expanded, rapid testing for all facility residents and workers because many can still carry the virus without showing symptoms.\n\nNeighboring nursing homes in Riverside, California, underscore the difficulty in keeping the virus out from a host of facilities.\n\nSo many staffers failed to show up for work at Magnolia Rehabilitation and Nursing Center -- some sick, some reportedly scared -- that 82 residents were evacuated on April 8.\n\nSeveral employees said the facility, which had a below-average rating from federal regulators and was slated for a program aimed at improving troubled centers, had problems before the virus infected nearly three dozen residents and five staff. Employees' paychecks had bounced, prompting protests. Some staff were dismissed and others quit.\n\n\"It has been understaffed since the day I got the job,\" said Gary Glaser, a certified nurse assistant who said he worked at Magnolia for four years and was out sick with a stomach bug in the days leading up to the evacuation.\n\nWhile visitation stopped in early March, Magnolia was still receiving patients from hospitals, including a man with pneumonia who later tested for the virus, according to a worker who requested anonymity, fearing a backlash.\n\nA facility administrator from Magnolia declined comment.\n\nAround that time, the virus had also reached a facility next door. Valeria Viveros, a 20-year-old certified nurse assistant at Extended Care Hospital -- which has a five-star rating from federal regulators -- was rushed to the hospital on April 4 after being sick for about a week, her uncle said.\n\nThat was a day before county officials reported 30 patients and staff tested positive for the virus and the same day they conducted widespread virus testing at Magnolia. Viveros died within days.\n\n\"More than likely, she probably got it from work. Where else?\" uncle Gustavo Urrea said.\n\nTrent Evans, a lawyer for Extended Care, said the facility was grieving the loss and had taken numerous precautions, including limiting visitors, since early March.\n\nTo combat outbreaks, many nursing homes have increased efforts to improve workers' safety and protect residents.\n\nPhylene Sunga, administrator at Lone Tree Convalescent Hospital in Antioch, California, said her facility has ramped up cleaning and all workers, including office workers, wash hands hourly. Therapists change their clothes and wash their hands every time they travel between facilities, and the 99-bed center asked staff to limit shopping after work to a single stop to try to limit their exposure.\n\n\"Our staff are dedicated and they're still coming to work when others don't have to,\" Sunga said.\n\nIn California, some counties, including Riverside, have started deploying teams to provide training and equipment and try to prevent a staff shortage before the virus hits or assist them if it does.\n\nStill, the challenges are enormous. And cases crop up so quickly that by the time health officials are called the priorities are to limit contagion and ensure residents have care.\n\nAt Redwood Springs Healthcare Center in Visalia, California, officials got involved after residents already had virus symptoms, and the source of infection -- which has affected a third of staff and two-thirds of the patients -- is still unknown, said Carrie Monteiro, a Tulare County spokeswoman.\n\nTwo healthcare workers at the facility showed symptoms on March 29 and received positive test results two days later, said Dave Oates, a spokesman for the center.\n\nApril Verrett, president of Service Employees International Union Local 2015, said many nursing home workers use public transportation to get to their jobs and must still shop for groceries for their families. They take all the precautions they can, but it is a challenge, said Verrett, whose union represents nursing home workers.\n\n\"This is not a workforce that can self isolate at home,\" she said. \"If you are around other people, you spread it.\"",

        "authors": [],
        "body": "Only now, she performs in an operating room rather than the pool.\n\nOne of America's greatest Olympic swimmers, Thompson is on the front line of the fight against coronavirus as an anesthesiologist at the VA Medical Center in Charleston, South Carolina.\n\n\"I like things that happen fast,\" she said in a telephone interview with The Associated Press. \"In the operating room, things happen fast.\"\n\nThompson competed in four Olympics, winning eight golds and 12 medals overall before she retired after the 2004 Athens Games. Then she turned to her other passion.\n\nHealth care.\n\nThe Massachusetts native chose anesthesiogy because it fit the persona of a swimmer who specialized in shorter races.\n\n\"I loved the acute nature of helping patients during surgery,\" Thompson said. \"As a sprinter, I really appreciated the fast changes you see in physiology. You're giving drugs and seeing immediate results.\"\n\nAfter working in a private practice in Maine for seven years, she moved to Charleston in 2018 along with her husband and their two young sons, now 4 and 7.\n\nThe coronavirus outbreak added a whole new element to her job.\n\n\"When I saw it coming our way, I had a lot of fear about being protected,\" the 47-year-old Thompson conceded. \"Once we had adequate PPE (personal protective equipment), I felt like I was ready.\"\n\nThe virus has yet to have a major impact in South Carolina, which has recorded about 6,500 cases and less than 300 deaths. The VA hospital in Charleston has dealt with only one serious case of Covid-19, according to Thompson, and a handful of other patients who were stricken milder symptoms.\n\nBut aging veterans are an especially vulnerable group. Thompson knows the numbers could get worse, especially with South Carolina joining a growing list of states that are taking steps to reopen even as the death toll in the United States climbs toward 70,000.\n\nA mandatory \"work-or-home\" order was lifted Monday by South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster, who also eased other restrictions on daily life.\n\n\"The end is not anywhere in sight. I know we will see more patients,\" Thompson said. \"We're prepared and we're ready.\"\n\nShe has mixed feelings about lifting restrictions that have helped curb the spread of the highly infectious virus, but have sent the economy into a record-setting plunge.\n\n\"I'm worried there's going to be another surge of cases,\" Thompson said. \"I also think it's a delicate balance of what people can handle, and what the economy can handle. Unemployment is the worst it's been in history, but people need to be accountable for their actions.\"\n\nThis past weekend, there were scenes around the country of people gathering in large numbers, many of them not wearing masks or staying the recommended 6 feet apart. Some headed to the beach. Others congregated in city parks. There were even reports of people lining up at an Atlanta mall to purchase a newly released Air Jordan sneaker from Nike.\n\nThat is troubling to health-care workers such as Thompson.\n\n\"We have to take social distancing seriously,\" she said, \"We have to wear masks. We have to stay 6 feet apart. We can't have parties. We need social responsibility. I know we need to open up, but we need to do it smartly, based on data. We can't just have a date in mind to do it. We need to do it only when it's appropriate for that region based on the data.\"\n\nThompson looks back fondly on her athletic career. She was one of America's greatest relay swimmers, capturing 10 of her 12 Olympic medals while teaming with others. She is tied with fellow swimmers Dara Torres and Natalie Coughlin for the most overall medals by an American woman. Only Michael Phelps has won more.\n\n\"For a long time, I was so immersed in my medical training and starting a new career and having a new family, I didn't think about it too much,\" Thompson said. \"But as time goes on, and people are still talking about what I did, it's becoming more clear that it was a really special career. I'm just so grateful for all the people around me who helped me.\"\n\nSwimming, it turned out, merely prepared her for a higher calling.\n\nThomson still has the fierce competitiveness that served her so well in the pool. Only now, she's taking on a far more daunting opponent.\n\n\"Through my swimming career, I learned mental toughness and how to deal with adverse situations,\" she said. \"I've tried to extend the mental toughness to those around me. This is the ultimate challenge that any of us has ever faced.\n\nFollow Paul Newberry on Twitter at https://twitter.com/pnewberry1963 and find his work at https://apnews.com\n\nMore AP sports: https://apnews.com/apf-sports and https://twitter.com/AP -- Sports",

        "body": "HOUSTON -- Former major league manager and infielder Art Howe is in intensive care in a Houston hospital with the coronavirus.\n\nThe 73-year-old Howe, best known as the manager of the \"Moneyball\" Oakland Athletics playoff teams in the late 1990s and early 2000s, confirmed to Houston TV station KPRC 2 on Thursday night he has been dealing with the illness since first feeling symptoms of COVID-19 on May 3.\n\nHowe told the station he found out he was positive two days after being tested and tried to recover at home. He went to the hospital by ambulance on Tuesday, and remained in ICU.\n\n\"Never experienced anything like it before,\" Howe said, adding that he needs to go 24 hours without a fever before he can be released from the hospital.\n\nHowe spent 12 seasons in the majors as a player, primarily at second base and third base, during stints with Pittsburgh (1974-75), Houston (1976-82) and St. Louis (1984-85). He began his big league managerial career with the Astros in 1989 and led them for five seasons.\n\nHe took over the A's in 1996 and managed them for seven years while winning 600 regular-season games and leading Oakland to the playoffs three times. Those teams were known for general manager Billy Beane's then-unconventional method of using sabermetrics to evaluate players. Author Michael Lewis wrote a bestselling book on the A's called \"Moneyball,\" and it was later turned into a film starring Brad Pitt as Beane and Philip Seymour Hoffman as Howe.\n\nHowe was released from his contract with the A's after the 2002 season and became the manager of the New York Mets for two seasons. He most recently served as Texas' bench coach during the 2007 and '08 seasons.\n\n--\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP -- Sports",

    "French doctors: First virus case may have been in December": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "LONDON -- French scientists say they may have identified a possible case of the new coronavirus dating back to December -- about a month before the first cases were officially confirmed in Europe.\n\nIn a study published in the International Journal of Microbial Agents, doctors at a hospital north of Paris reviewed retrospective samples of 14 patients treated for atypical pneumonia between early December and mid-January. Among those were the records of Amirouche Hammar, a fishmonger in his 40s from Algeria who has lived in France for years and had no recent travel history.\n\nHammar told French broadcaster BFM-TV on Tuesday that he drove himself to a hospital emergency unit at 5 a.m. one morning in late December because he felt very sick, with chest pains and breathing difficulties.\n\n\"They said, 'Perhaps you have an infection, a pulmonary infection, although it's not certain. But what you have is very serious, very serious, because you are coughing blood. It's not normal flu,'\" he said.\n\nHammar was admitted to the hospital with symptoms doctors say were consistent with COVID-19 patients in China and Italy. One of his children had also gotten sick with an unusual pneumonia shortly before Hammar fell ill. When doctors retested Hammar's old sample, they found it was positive for the coronavirus.\n\n\"Identifying the first infected patient is of great epidemiological interest as it changes dramatically our knowledge\" regarding the spread of the coronavirus, wrote Dr. Yves Cohen, one of the French researchers. An intensive care specialist, Cohen works in the northern suburbs of Paris where Hammar lives and which have been particularly hard-hit by COVID-19 infections and deaths.\n\nCohen told BFM-TV that when Hammar sought treatment in December, they figured he was simply suffering from a form of viral pneumonia that they couldn't put their finger on. \"We told ourselves, 'It's a virus that we haven't discovered,' but we stopped there.\"\n\nThere doesn't appear to have been any further transmission of the virus from Hammar, who later recovered after being treated with antibiotics in the ICU. Cohen and colleagues suggested their results showed there could be many other unidentified coronavirus cases from before the disease was officially detected in Europe.\n\nStill, the scientists acknowledged that because the study, which was published online Sunday, was done retrospectively, \"medical records were not exhaustive and some relevant information might have been missing.\"\n\nOther experts said the results were interesting, but hardly conclusive.\n\nJonathan Ball, a professor of molecular virology at the University of Nottingham, said it was possible the results were due to lab contamination.\n\n\"If he was infected (with COVID-19), then you would expect a more rapid and earlier spread of the virus in France than was seen,\" he said in a statement. Ball wasn't connected to the published study.\n\n\"Sequencing any virus in the sample might give you insight into whether or not the virus truly was an early isolate or likely contamination, but it looks from the data that the amount of virus in the sample was low, so would be difficult to analyse further,\" he said.\n\nRowland Kao, an epidemiologist at the University of Edinburgh, said it was possible that in the early days of the disease's emergence, there were many instances in which infected people traveled around the world but that the virus wasn't spread any further.\n\nChristian Lindmeier, a spokesman for the World Health Organization, described the findings as \"exciting news\" and said they could help scientists better understand the evolution of the new coronavirus.\n\n\"This gives us a whole new picture on everything, and yes of course, it would be great if all countries who have unspecified cases of pneumonia in the recent months, and even in December, and in even in November, would check them against COVID-19,\" he said.\n\nJohn Leicester in Paris, and Jamey Keaten in Geneva, contributed to this report.\n\nFollow AP pandemic coverage at http://apnews.com/VirusOutbreak and https://apnews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak\n\nThis story has deleted a paragraph that stated incorrectly that doctors in Italy have also reported finding retrospective cases of the coronavirus in the country long before the disease was officially identified.",

    "Frontier Airlines will drop open-seat fee that drew attacks": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "Frontier Airlines is dropping plans to charge passengers extra to sit next to an empty middle seat after congressional Democrats accused the airline of trying to profit from fear over the new coronavirus.\n\n\"We recognize the concerns raised that we are profiting from safety and this was never our intent,\" Frontier CEO Barry Biffle said late Wednesday in a letter to three lawmakers. \"We simply wanted to provide our customers with an option for more space.\"\n\nBiffle said the airline will rescind the extra fee, which Frontier called More Room, and block the seats from being sold.\n\nEarlier in the day, Democrats had railed against Frontier's plan to charge passengers at least $39 per flight to guarantee they would sit next to an empty middle seat. The offer was to begin with flights Friday and run through Aug. 31.\n\nThe chairman of the House Transportation Committee called it \"outrageous.\" Peter DeFazio, D-Ore., said the Denver-based airline was using the need for social distancing during a pandemic \"as an opportunity to make a buck ... capitalizing on fear and passengers' well-founded concerns for their health and safety.\"\n\nSen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., highlighted the fee during a congressional hearing on how COVID-19 is affecting the airline industry.\n\n\"I don't think it's appropriate for some passengers who can't afford to pay an additional charge for a seat to be less safe than other travelers,\" Klobuchar said.\n\nU.S. air travel has dropped more than 90% from a year ago because of the pandemic, and many flights are nearly empty. However, some flights -- highlighted on social media -- have been much more full, with many passengers not wearing face coverings. That has led airlines to say they will block middle seats when possible to create space between passengers.\n\nFrom the outset, Biffle rejected the notion that his airline would be charging for social distancing.\n\n\"We are offering the option, and it is guaranteed. We don't believe you need it -- if everybody is wearing a facial covering - to be safe,\" he told The Associated Press earlier this week. \"It gives people more peace of mind if they want it.\"\n\nBiffle said ticket sales rose after previous announcements around safety, including a decision to require passengers to wear masks, and he expected the same reaction to the empty-seat offer.\n\nAirlines steal ideas from each other all the time, but so far, none have copied Frontier's More Room offer.\n\nDuring Wednesday's Senate Commerce Committee hearing, the president of Airlines for America, a trade group for the biggest U.S. carriers, said none of his airlines have a similar charge. Frontier is not a member.\n\nThe trade group official, Nicholas Calio, said other airlines block some middle seats and board passengers from back to front to keep spacing on planes.\n\nKlobuchar asked if the federal government should issue guidelines to \"fix\" Frontier's policy. Calio said rules aren't necessary.\n\n\"Hopefully the market will take care of that,\" Calio said.\n\n\"Well, it didn't with Frontier,\" Klobuchar responded.\n\nHilary Godwin, dean of the school of public health at the University of Washington, said the Frontier policy \"is exactly the reason that some national-level guidance\" is needed for social distancing on airlines and in airports.\n\nGodwin said crowded planes and long flights create the greatest risk for spreading the virus.

        "body": "A backlash is building against Frontier Airlines over its decision to charge extra to sit next to an empty middle seat\n\nLawmakers on Capitol Hill lashed out Wednesday against Frontier Airlines over the budget carrier's move to charge passengers extra to guarantee they will sit next to an empty middle seat while flying during the coronavirus outbreak.\n\nThe chairman of the House Transportation Committee called it \"outrageous.\" Peter DeFazio, D-Ore., said the Denver-based airline is using the need for social distancing \"as an opportunity to make a buck ... capitalizing on fear and passengers' well-founded concerns for their health and safety.\"\n\nSen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., highlighted the fee during a congressional hearing on how COVID-19 is affecting the airline industry.\n\n\"I don't think it's appropriate for some passengers who can't afford to pay an additional charge for a seat to be less safe than other travelers,\" Klobuchar said.\n\nU.S. air travel has dropped more than 90% from a year ago because of the pandemic, and many flights are nearly empty. However, some flights -- highlighted on social media -- have been much more full, with many passengers not wearing face coverings.\n\nOn Monday, Frontier announced that from Friday through Aug. 31 passengers can pay a fee, starting at $39 per flight, to guarantee an empty middle seat next to them. CEO Barry Biffle rejected the notion that his airline is charging for social distancing.\n\n\"We are offering the option, and it is guaranteed. We don't believe you need it -- if everybody is wearing a facial covering - to be safe,\" he told The Associated Press. \"It gives people more peace of mind if they want it.\"\n\nBiffle said ticket sales rose after previous announcements around safety, including a decision to require passengers to wear masks, and he expects the same reaction to the empty-seat offer.\n\nAirlines steal ideas from each other all the time, but so far, none have copied Frontier's More Room offer.\n\nDuring Wednesday's Senate Commerce Committee hearing, the president of Airlines for America, a trade group for the biggest U.S. carriers, said none of his airlines have a similar charge. Frontier is not a member.\n\nThe trade group official, Nicholas Calio, said other airlines block some middle seats and board passengers from back to front to keep spacing on planes.\n\nKlobuchar asked if the federal government should issue guidelines to \"fix\" Frontier's policy. Calio said rules aren't necessary.\n\n\"Hopefully the market will take care of that,\" Calio said.\n\n\"Well, it didn't with Frontier,\" Klobuchar responded.\n\nHilary Godwin, dean of the school of public health at the University of Washington, said the Frontier policy \"is exactly the reason that some national-level guidance\" is needed for social distancing on airlines and in airports.\n\nGodwin said crowded planes and long flights create the greatest risk for spreading the virus. She said the expectation that air travel will recover slowly is a good thing -- it will give airlines and health officials time to decide the best steps to protect travelers and airline and airport workers.\n\nU.S. health officials stress the importance of social distancing, and they also recommend that people wear cloth face coverings in public because some who are infected don't feel symptoms and could unknowingly spread the virus.\n\nAssociated Press writer Jonathan Poet in Philadelphia contributed to this report.",

    "Georgia deploys 3D printers, Guard units in testing scramble": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "AUGUSTA, Ga. -- Seeing a chance to help amid a shortage of kits to test people for the coronavirus, Dr. Jeffrey James dedicated a 3D printer at the dental college where he teaches to churning out nasal swabs at a rate of 300 per day.\n\nThen Georgia officials working with Gov. Brian Kemp heard about the project. They asked James if he could crank up swab production even more -- to 5,000 daily.\n\n\"I said yes,\" James recalled, \"then I left the meeting and had a panic attack.\"\n\nNow seven printers with names like Mighty Mouse and Sonic 1 and 2 hum constantly in a room on the third floor of Augusta University's dental school. Volunteering dental residents, endodontists, orthodontists and oral surgeons rotate between two daily 12-hour shifts, even on weekends, to meet the demand.\n\nThe production push is one way Georgia is scrambling to catch up on COVID-19 testing after the Republican governor lifted shelter-at-home orders for most people and allowed hair salons, gyms, tattoo parlors and bowling alleys to reopen and restaurants to resume dine-in service.\n\nThe Trump administration's plans for emerging from lockdowns imposed to slow the virus have largely left individual states on their own when it comes to supplying themselves with test kits and finding workers and sites to administer those tests. Georgia lagged behind most U.S. states in testing even as Kemp moved aggressively to ease restrictions and restart the economy.\n\nPublic health experts say expanded testing is critical to keeping watch for a resurgence of infections as states begin reopening. What's lacking, both at the federal and state level, is a clear and coordinated long-term strategy, said Dr. Harry J. Heiman, a professor of public health at Georgia State University in Atlanta.\n\n\"You don't manage a pandemic by waiting for people to come to you and raise their hand and say, 'I have an idea and I'm willing to help,'\" Heiman said.\n\nThe virus has killed more than 1,100 people in Georgia. Health officials have confirmed more than 28,600 infections statewide.\n\nAcknowledging his own \"frustration\" with the lack of testing in Georgia, Kemp rolled out plans on April 20 to use National Guard troops as well as clinicians and other staff from Augusta University's medical schools to dramatically ramp up testing. The same day, the governor announced some shuttered businesses would soon reopen with restrictions.\n\nAlthough testing was initially limited to high-risk populations, such as the elderly and medical workers, Kemp is now encouraging anyone with flu-like symptoms to get tested for COVID-19, as well as grocery store, chicken plant and other essential workers who aren't showing symptoms.\n\n\"Our goal is to use every single test we've got every single day,\" Kemp said Thursday.\n\nThere have been signs of improvement. On April 20, the total number of people tested in Georgia was just over 84,300. By Sunday, it had more than doubled to 174,800, according to the state Department of Public Health. Compared with other states, Georgia now ranks in the bottom 20 for per capita testing. It had previously been in the bottom 10.\n\nKathleen Toomey, commissioner of the Georgia Department of Public Health, said Thursday that her agency's goal is to have administered more than 200,000 total coronavirus tests by sometime this week.\n\nKemp touted more than 20,000 new tests reported Thursday -- the most Georgia had seen in a single day -- and nearly 13,000 new tests Tuesday. But those figures don't reflect sustained daily testing, which still fluctuates greatly. During the same week, Georgia reported fewer than 4,000 new tests on April 27 and Wednesday.\n\n\"If they can do 13,000 a day, every day, then from purely a numbers perspective that's a great place to be,\" Heiman said. \"Am I seeing a trend where it seems we're getting where we need to be? My candid answer is no.\"\n\nAs part of Georgia's recent expansion effort, the National Guard, already tasked with disinfecting nursing homes across Georgia, has deployed 10 teams capable of administering 1,500 tests daily to long-term care facilities and other coronavirus hotspots.\n\nAbout 30 Guard troops sent to Augusta University have turned a classroom into a call center where citizen-soldiers in fatigues and boots are manning phones to schedule testing appointments for people showing symptoms. Those patients are being referred by clinicians at the university who screen them using a cellphone app. Georgia now operates 49 drive-thru testing sites statewide.\n\nWith nasals swabs used to collect samples for testing being 3D printed, cleaned and sterilized across campus, Dr. Phillip Coule said the greatest supply shortage now is the chemicals used to test the samples, called reagents. That's something the university can't produce, said Coule, the chief medical officer for the Augusta University Medical System. And it's limiting how many tests his staff and the National Guard can arrange.\n\n\"That's the weak link right now,\" Coule said. \"I could double capacity if I had more reagent.\"\n\nBynum reported from Savannah, Georgia.

        "authors": [],
        "body": "HARTFORD, Conn. -- Thelma Uranga is sprucing up her back deck in Chicago, hoping to host some small gatherings to take the place of the summer's usual neighborhood festivals built on music, food and time with friends.\n\n\"People look forward to summer because winter tends to feel like an eternity,\" said Uranga, 38. \"We were just getting to that point where things kick off.\"\n\nInstead, she and many others are \"mourning summer 2020\" as cancellations pile up because of efforts to stop the spread of the coronavirus.\n\nFrom Cape Cod to California, festivals are being nixed, businesses in tourist havens are looking at empty reservation books, and people who have been cooped up through a dismal spring are worrying summer will bring just more of the same.\n\nAs the weather warms, some already have begun venturing outside in larger numbers, despite guidance to stay home. Government officials say they aim to manage public health risks in a way that allows for a gradual return to normal, but with the course of the outbreak still unknown, nobody is sure what summer will bring.\n\nOn a typical summer day, the Ship Bottom Brewing beer house on New Jersey's Long Beach Island is packed. Bartender Bridget Barlet isn't expecting anything close to that this season.\n\n\"I'm scared even if we do open up, it just won't be the same, especially if distancing rules are continued,\" she said. \"A lot of people will still be too nervous to venture back into what life as usual used to look like.\"\n\nYouth baseball leagues are holding out hope they will get in a sliver of a season, water parks are unsure if they will be able to open, and restaurants are wondering if it's worth welcoming dine-customers when social distancing guidelines would slash the numbers they can host at one time.\n\nLittle League coach Noah Rouen, 45, of Plymouth, Minnesota, a father of four boys, is hoping there might still be time for a shortened season. After all, he said, 95% of baseball is played without anyone getting within 6 feet of one another.\n\n\"Those games under the lights, that's something special for the kids,\" he said.\n\nIn New Jersey, Gov. Phil Murphy has not indicated when his state's beaches and casinos will reopen. He said Monday he hoped there would be \"some semblance of normal\" at the shore this summer but gave no indication when those decisions might be made.\n\nAlong Virginia's coast, a long list of festivals have already been canceled, and the usually bustling Virginia Beach oceanfront sits quiet and empty.\n\nThe now-scrapped Something in the Water music festival, organized by musician and producer Pharrell Williams, should have wrapped up Sunday. Late May's Patriotic Festival, which celebrates the military community, has also been called off.\n\n\"It's surreal and sobering,\" said Mike Standing, 50, a Virginia Beach restaurateur and hotel owner. \"Our losses will probably take five years to regain.\"\n\nSome destinations are taking measures themselves to manage the risks.\n\nAt Tony Gore's Smoky Mountain BBQ & Grill in Sevierville, Tennessee, which opened to dine-in guests Monday, each diner faced the same infrared thermometer gun required of the employees clad in masks and gloves.\n\n\"You've gotta start somewhere, is the way I look at it,\" said Keith Carter, the restaurant's general manager. \"You've gotta start getting the business back and start getting the economy headed back in the right direction.\"\n\nTennessee officials, who allowed restaurants to reopen in 89 of the state's 95 counties starting Monday, have said they are discouraging travelers from out-of-state and have yet to release guidelines for tourist attractions, such as Dolly Parton's Dollywood theme park in Pigeon Forge where hundreds of furloughed employees are waiting to get back to work.\n\nCities and towns across the country also are sorting out what the pandemic will mean for municipal pools, beaches and summer caps.\n\nCan the virus be spread in chlorinated pools? Will day-campers have to remain 6 feet apart while playing? New Haven, Connecticut, Mayor Justin Elicker said he and his staff are working on getting answers -- but it's not easy.\n\n\"If businesses open, then parents or guardians will have to work,\" Elicker said Monday. \"So, we want to be able, as much as we can, to provide opportunities for care and meaningful activities for young people. The challenge is how to do that while at the same time ensuring the safety of the young people.\"\n\nChildren appear to be among the least affected by the virus, but experts warn that people of all ages can likely play a role in transmitting it. For most, the virus causes mild or moderate symptoms. For some, especially older adults and people with health problems, it can cause more severe illness and lead to death.\n\nIn Southern California, the Orange County Fair was canceled Monday for the first time since World War II. Last year the summer staple drew nearly 1.4 million visitors for its livestock shows, carnival rides, fried food and big-name concerts.\n\n\"This is the worst news, just devastating,\" chef Linda Johnsen said. Since 2013 Johnson has owned Filomena's Italian Kitchen and Market in Costa Mesa, a few blocks from the fairgrounds. She estimated that her revenue jumps between 40% and 60% during the three-week exhibition.\n\nChuck Rage owns a hotel and a resort in Hampton, New Hampshire, and leases out several businesses on the beach. All his businesses are shuttered due to the state's stay-at-home order, but he's hopeful a summer season can be salvaged, even if it's a bad one.\n\nThe one thing that isn't missing is pent up demand, Rage said.\n\n\"I have gotten phone call after phone call,\" Rage said. \"All my regulars that come every year: 'I need my Hampton Beach time. I need to come to Hampton Beach. I am sick of being in this house.'\"\n\nAssociated Press writers Lisa Rathke in Vermont, Wayne Parry in Atlantic City, New Jersey, Jonathan Mattise in Nashville, Tennessee, Ben Finley in Norfolk, Virginia, Jeff Baenen in Minneapolis, Kathleen Foody in Chicago, Christopher Weber in Los Angeles and Michael Casey in Boston contributed to this story.",

        "authors": [],
        "body": "COLUMBUS, Ohio -- An order for people to wear face coverings while in stores was reversed last week because it \"went too far,\" Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine said Sunday.\n\nDeWine reversed the order Tuesday, saying many Ohioans saw it as \"one government mandate too far\" and saying face coverings were strongly recommended but would no longer be required. He repeated that sentiment Sunday on ABC's \"This Week,\" calling it \"a bridge too far\" and saying, \"People were not going to accept the government telling them what to do.\"\n\n\"So my ability to communicate to the people of Ohio, frankly, I thought, was going to be really impeded and we would get hung up on the mandatory masks for someone going in as a customer and it just wasn't going to work,\" he said. \"And so you got to know what you can do and what you can't do.\"\n\nOn Friday, the Republican governor extended the state shutdown until May 29 while also allowing retail stores to expand their business earlier than expected. He spoke as Ohio COVID-19 deaths topped 1,000 for the first time and as dozens of protesters of Ohio's stay-at-home orders returned to the statehouse.\n\nConstruction companies, distributors, manufacturers and offices are allowed to reopen Monday, and retail businesses on May 12. Health care offices were allowed to reopen Friday. Bars and movie theaters remain closed, along with in-person dining at restaurants. Sporting events and concerts are still prohibited.\n\nThe governor said reopening Ohio is a \"balancing\" act between bringing the economy back while protecting people and added that he will be prepared to take action should the situation worsen again.\n\nThe governor earlier said multiple working groups were being formed to come up with the best and safest way to restart activities, including hair care, dining out, going to the gym, visiting libraries and participating in sporting events.\n\n\"So when we open tomorrow in regard to a lot of businesses as well as office, it's going to be based upon really best practices that were laid out by people in those businesses who do that,\" he said Sunday.\n\nOhio state health officials say the number of confirmed and probable deaths associated with the coronavirus has now reached 1,038.\n\nThe Ohio health department posted figures Sunday indicating 957 confirmed deaths and another 81 probable deaths associated with the virus.\n\nThe department noted more than 19,000 confirmed cases of the virus and a probable total of more than 19,900.\n\nFor most people, the virus causes mild or moderate symptoms that clear up in a couple of weeks. Older adults and people with existing health problems are at higher risk of more severe illness, including pneumonia, or death.\n\nThis story has been corrected to show that DeWine called the order \"a bridge too far\" on Sunday, not Tuesday.",

    "Graduation ceremonies draw thousands despite pandemic fears": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "HOOVER, Ala. -- High schools nationwide have canceled or postponed traditional graduation ceremonies to avoid worsening the spread of the new coronavirus, but some are going ahead with full-fledged springtime commencement exercises as usual, with tweaks to account for health concerns.\n\nThousands of graduates, parents, siblings and grandparents will gather at a nearly 11,000-seat stadium on Wednesday and Thursday nights in the Birmingham suburb of Hoover as its two high schools -- among the largest in Alabama -- hold traditional commencement exercises despite COVID-19.\n\nA school in a nearby city held its ceremony Tuesday, with chairs for more than 540 graduates spread apart across a football field and a keynote address by Alabama's state school superintendent, Eric Mackey. Few in attendance wore protective face masks, and seniors hugged and gathered in tight groups of friends for pictures.\n\nDr. Michael Saag, who treats infectious diseases at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, said the threat of spreading the coronavirus poses too great a risk to hold such ceremonies. Virus carriers without symptoms could unknowingly infect others, he said.\n\nSaag has a special perspective: He survived COVID-19 after being infected in March.\n\n\"Having had this before, even if you survive it, which most people do, it's still a harrowing thing to go through,\" said Saag, now back at work.\n\nSchool officials in Hoover announced the ceremonies in the city's open-air baseball stadium, after Gov. Kay Ivey eliminated state restrictions on the size of group gatherings as long as people from different households stay 6 feet (1.8 meters) apart.\n\nFor the ceremonies, hundreds of chairs for graduates have been spread across the dirt infield; spectators will sit on metal bleachers or in blue stadium seats. Workers applied red tape to seats that spectators are to avoid.\n\nKathy Murphy, the city school superintendent, said the ceremonies will comply with the rules.\n\n\"All of our students will be celebrated, even those who choose not to come, and we understand that. But we will call their names, their names will appear on the large Jumbotron,\" Murphy said in a video posted online.\n\nSchools in California planned virtual graduations after the state canceled traditional events, and students at an Illinois school walked across a stage in an otherwise empty auditorium. Some systems delayed ceremonies until the summer, and former President Barack Obama recorded a video graduation speech for seniors. At some schools, graduating classes were split into smaller groups for live ceremonies.\n\nSome, mostly smaller schools have held traditional commencements for entire classes. But Spain Park and Hoover are two of the largest, top-ranked state schools. Both are in a heavily populated area, making such ceremonies all the more risky, critics said.\n\nAs a precaution, students are being given face masks, along with instructions not to hug friends, exchange high fives, toss caps or linger afterward. Tickets are limited to four students each, and everyone present must wear a face covering.\n\nStill, the numbers of potential attendees are daunting at a time when sporting events, concerts, and movies are still prohibited because of crowd concerns.\n\nSome 390 seniors will graduate on Wednesday night from Spain Park, meaning about 1,950 graduates and guests could attend. Another 690 will graduate on Thursday from Hoover High, so some 3,450 people could be inside Hoover Metropolitan Stadium.\n\nCritics say that even with the rules, such huge ceremonies could hasten additional coronavirus transmission in metro Birmingham, an area of more than 1 million people. The city of Hoover, with 85,000 residents, sits astride Shelby and Jefferson counties, which have more than 1,770 cases of COVID-19 combined.\n\nBonnie Kaiser, a 2004 graduate of Hoover High School who teaches in the Department of Anthropology and Global Health Program at the University of California-San Diego, was among 31 health professionals and system alumni who signed an open letter asking officials to reconsider the ceremonies.\n\n\"I think the thing is there's not a away to do it safely even if everyone has perfect behavior as far as what is being recommended, and we know at a graduation that just will not happen,\" Kaiser said in an interview.\n\nParents pleased their children could have a traditional graduation ceremony flooded the school's social media feeds with thanks to school officials, But critics also aired their complaints. And some top-ranked students said they won't attend.\n\nOmar Mohammad, a 17-year-old senior at Spain Park, organized a small protest outside the graduation site Saturday with about three dozen supporters. He plans to skip his graduation, calling the ceremony \"unsafe and irresponsible.\"\n\n\"All it takes is one asymptomatic person handing out fliers to others to make it spread,\" Mohammad said. \"This isn't about graduation.

    "Groups sow doubt about COVID vaccine before one even exists": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "NEW YORK -- A coronavirus vaccine is still months or years away, but groups that peddle misinformation about immunizations are already taking aim, potentially eroding confidence in what could be humanity's best chance to defeat the virus.\n\nIn recent weeks, vaccine opponents have made several unsubstantiated claims, including allegations that vaccine trials will be dangerously rushed or that Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's top infectious diseases expert, is blocking cures to enrich vaccine makers. They've also falsely claimed that Microsoft founder Bill Gates wants to use a vaccine to inject microchips into people -- or to cull 15% of the world's population.\n\nVaccine opponents in the U.S. have been around for a long time. Their claims range from relatively modest safety concerns about specific vaccines or the risk of side effects to conspiracy theories that border on the bizarre.\n\nThe movement is receiving renewed attention, especially as it aligns itself with groups loudly protesting restrictions on daily life aimed at controlling the spread of the virus. Health professionals say vaccine misinformation could have lethal consequences if it leads people to opt for bogus cures instead.\n\n\"Only a coronavirus vaccine can truly protect us from future outbreaks,\" said Dr. Scott Ratzan, a physician and medical misinformation expert at the City University of New York and Columbia University. \"But what if the effort succeeds and large numbers of people decide not to vaccinate themselves or their children?\"\n\nWhile vaccines for diseases such as polio, smallpox and measles have benefited millions, some skeptics reject the science, citing a distrust of modern medicine and government. Others say mandatory vaccine requirements violate their religious freedom.\n\nRita Palma, the leader of the anti-vaccine group in Long Island called My Kids, My Choice, is among those who say their families won't get the coronavirus vaccine.\n\n\"Many of us are anxiety stricken at the thought of being forced to get a vaccine,\" Palma said. \"I will never choose to have a COVID-19 vaccine. I don't want the government forcing it on my community or my family.\"\n\nFrom the outset of the coronavirus pandemic, vaccine skeptics have tailored several long-standing claims about vaccine safety to fit the current outbreak. When the first U.S. case was announced in January, some alleged the coronavirus was manufactured and that patents for it could be found online.\n\nThousands of deaths later, vaccine opponents are endorsing unapproved treatments, second-guessing medical experts and pushing fears about mandatory vaccinations. They've also latched onto protests against stay-at-home orders in the U.S.\n\n\"The coronavirus has created this perfect storm of misinformation,\" remarked David A. Broniatowski, an associate professor at George Washington University's school of engineering and applied science who has published several studies on vaccine misinformation.\n\nLast week, an anti-vaccine activist was arrested in Idaho after repeatedly refusing police orders to leave a playground closed because of the pandemic. The woman, who was there with other families, is affiliated with two groups that protested at the Idaho Statehouse against stay-at-home orders.\n\nFacebook groups formed to organize the protests have been peppered with vaccine hoaxes and myths. Perhaps no one plays a bigger role in the conspiracy theories than Gates, who is funding vaccine research. The online movement has centered concerns around a COVID-19 vaccine on false claims that Gates is planning to microchip people with the vaccine or use it to reduce the world's population.\n\nRobert F. Kennedy Jr., a vaccine critic who helped popularize unsubstantiated claims that vaccines can cause autism, said Gates' work gives him \"dictatorial control of global health policy.\" Roger Stone, a former adviser to President Donald Trump, went further on a New York City radio show, saying Gates \"and other globalists\" are using the coronavirus \"for mandatory vaccinations and microchipping people.\"\n\nSuch wild theories can have real-world effects. False rumors that Gates hoped to test an experimental vaccine in South Africa became mainstream after a news site erroneously reported the claim. One of the country's political parties then sent a letter to President Cyril Rampahosa demanding answers about \"deals\" struck with Gates.\n\nIn fact, Gates and his wife are financing a vaccine trial in Philadelphia and Kansas City, Missouri, not South Africa. He also suggested creating a database of people immune to the virus, not implanting microchips.\n\nOn Monday, during remarks recognizing World Immunization Week, World Health Organization Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus criticized vaccine skeptics for spreading misinformation at a time when many families are delaying or skipping routine childhood immunizations because they're afraid of COVID-19 exposure in doctors' offices.\n\n\"Myths and misinformation about vaccines are adding fuel to the fire,\" he said.\n\nHealth experts have repeatedly said there is no evidence the coronavirus was intentionally created or spread. They also insist that vaccines are not only safe, but essential to global health.\n\n\"Vaccine researchers and anyone who is a vaccine advocate cares deeply about vaccine safety,\" said Dr. Paul Offit, a Children's Hospital of Philadelphia physician and co-inventor of a vaccine for rotavirus, which kills hundreds of thousands of children annually.\n\nFor most people, the coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough, that clear up in two to three weeks. But it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia, and death for some people, especially older adults and people with existing health problems.\n\nThe vaccine debate is fertile ground for groups looking to sow discord in the United States. Russia seized on it to create divisions before the 2016 U.S. election, and appears to be at it again.\n\nA report from a European Union disinformation task force found numerous conspiracy theories in English-language Russian media, including state-run RT, claiming an eventual vaccine will be used to inject nanoparticles into people.\n\n\"When pro-Kremlin disinformation outlets spread anti-vaccine tropes, they become responsible for those who will hesitate to seek professional medical care,\" the EU report said.",

President Alejandro Giammattei recently referred to it as \"that damned flight,\" showing his frustration with a topic that has become sensitive domestically as the country's teetering health system tries to confront the virus' spread.\n\nIn total, at least 100 Guatemalans deported from the U.S. between late March and mid-April have tested positive for the virus. The April 13 flight of infected deportees so unnerved Guatemala's government that the U.S. sent a team from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to Guatemala to verify the tests.\n\nSince at least March, the government had been asking its U.S. counterparts to certify the health of deportees before putting them on flights. Until now, that had meant only checking their temperature or looking for other symptoms.\n\nIt appeared Guatemala's two-week suspension finally moved the U.S. government to test deportees. It was not immediately clear if the U.S. would begin testing deportees to other countries.\n\nThe issue had become sensitive for Giammattei at home where there was a growing fear and accounts of harassment of deportees because people feared they carried the virus.\n\nLast week, Giammattei said in an interview that some countries were helping Guatemala with financial and medical resources to confront the virus while others \"have sent us infected deportees, but not a dime.\"\n\nLast Friday, President Donald Trump called the presidents of Honduras and El Salvador to offer encouragement and medical equipment while praising their assistance in controlling immigration. Giammattei was notably not included among those calls.\n\n\"To the United States it sounds bad that a little country wants to push its luck and blame them for deporting infected deportees, even though it's true,\" said Renso Rosal, a Guatemalan political analyst.",

    "Health workers badly hit as Russia becomes coronavirus hotspot ": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "There are fears worrying numbers of health workers in Russia are becoming infected with the coronavirus amid a shortage of protective gear and alleged failure by local administrators to take appropriate quarantine measures.\n\nAfter an apparent lag with European countries, the epidemic has surged in Russia. This week, the country became fifth in the world for total recorded cases, overtaking France and Germany and now behind only the U.K., Spain, Italy and the United States. Russia's number of new cases grew by over 10,000 a day most of last week, a rate of infection second only to the U.S.\n\nThat wave of infections has crashed into health workers. Medics in Moscow and other cities across Russia have been reporting many of their colleagues falling ill. In the regions outside the capital -- where the health system is much less resourced and often crumbling -- medical staff have described feeling unprotected, sometimes posting desperate pleas on social media demanding action from officials.\n\nIn Saint Petersburg's primary coronavirus hospital almost 200 medics are being treated, according to local health officials. In Moscow around 2,000 medics have been infected, its mayor has said. In Ufa, 700 miles east of Moscow, doctors have demanded a criminal inquiry be opened after dozens of patients and staff tested positive in a single hospital.\n\nAs the epidemic worsens, however, some health workers have expressed fears that if the rate of infection among their colleagues continues it will lead to a shortage of staff, as many have to go into self-isolation or are hospitalized. In Moscow, authorities have already started bringing in medical students as reinforcements.\n\n\"We are on the threshold simply of a collapse in health personnel,\" said Andrey Konoval, who heads the independent union, Dyeistviye, which represents around 4,000 health workers across 49 Russian regions. \"It's no coincidence\" Moscow has been calling up students, he said.\n\nTo avoid that, Konoval said, he thought authorities would likely have to abandon the policy of sending health workers exposed to the virus into quarantine, if they didn't have severe symptoms.\n\nThere are signs Moscow is now bracing for a possible wave of critically ill patients. Authorities this week converted a pavilion at a Soviet-era exhibition park as well as a suburban mall to create around 4,000 more coronavirus beds. This is in addition to a large temporary hospital built from scratch in March outside the city. Moscow's mayor Sergey Sobyanin on Thursday also extended the city's lockdown until May 31.\n\nUntil now, Moscow has seemed to largely cope with the influx of virus patients, except for a day early-on when dozens of ambulances carrying patients became backed-up in miles-long lines for hours trying to deliver them to two hospitals. The city has been able to learn from the experience in Northern Italy, several doctors said, where the health system was overwhelmed, and has used the delay before its own epidemic to increase bed capacity.\n\nDoctors in the capital have told ABC News the situation in their hospitals has been harrowing but so far manageable. But they were concerned by the number of their staff getting sick.\n\nIra Apraksina, a doctor in the diagnostic imaging department at the War Veterans Hospital No 3, one of Moscow's primary coronavirus hospitals, said in the first two weeks of the outbreak virtually her entire department had fallen ill. The majority have now recovered, she said, although one doctor has died. The number of new staff getting ill now has shrunk she said because so many have already had the virus.\n\nApraksina's hospital had been one of those where a backlog of ambulances had occurred. She said that had not happened again and that the hospital had not been overwhelmed yet.\n\nA doctor at her hospital said on Saturday that 505 of its 800 beds were occupied after a substantial number of patients were signed out. But it's three intensive care units with 60-person capacity was completely full they said. \"Every centimeter is occupied,\" they said.\n\nAlexander Erlich, a cardiologist at Moscow's City Clinical Hospital No. 29, said in mid-April his hospital had been due to be reclassified to take only coronavirus patients but the decision was reversed at the last minute, a sign -- he believed -- that Moscow still had enough beds. Two weeks on though, his hospital has now been made a coronavirus center and he himself had become infected, spending two weeks in quarantine.\n\nDespite that, Erlich said he still hoped Moscow would manage to avoid Italy's scenario.\n\nSo far Russia's official death toll has remained low, at just 1,915, far less than in other countries with similar numbers of infections, something that has puzzled experts. And as cases have grown, Russian health workers have started recording deaths among their own colleagues, in the absence of what they feel is proper counting by authorities.\n\nThey have produced a \"list of memory\" on a webpage with the names of those who have died. On Sunday the page had 158 names.\n\nThat number raises questions about Russia's official death toll for the virus. The number of medics killed is a higher proportion of the total deaths in the wider population compared to other countries with similar numbers of infections. It suggests either Russian health workers are dying at a higher rate than elsewhere or Russia's death toll in reality is much higher -- or both.\n\nIn the U.K., between 150 and 200 health workers are estimated to have died when the country has recorded a total 31,000 coronavirus deaths. As the Guardian newspaper noted this week, when Italy reported that 100 medical workers had died, the country's death toll had just surpassed 18,200.\n\n\"If we take the statistics in Britain, or Italy, the U.S., it's 20 times, 30 times higher than in Russia,\" he said. \"Of course, everyone looks at that and understands that it cannot be that way,\" said Erlich, one of the doctors behind the list.\n\nDoctors have suggested many coronavirus deaths may be being recorded under other causes, such as heart failure or pneumonia.\n\nOfficial data published on Sunday showed the total number of deaths registered in Moscow in April was 18% higher than the same period last year, up by around 2,000 more. Other countries have suggested such \"excess deaths\" will likely give a better idea of the real toll of the virus.\n\nBut it is the regions outside Moscow where health workers are facing the virus with the fewest defenses. For weeks, videos and posts have been appearing from medical staff across Russia pleading for proper protective gear and saying they were afraid their leadership would punish them for speaking out.\n\nIn St. Petersburg, a doctor at a veteran's hospital last month resigned in protest over a lack of gear and said a second hospital she had been moved to had no \"clean zones\" set up. A nurse at another hospital in the city this week appealed in a post online for help, saying they had only single-use masks. \"It's frightening to go to work,\" the nurse wrote, saying staff had been threatened with firing if they spoke publicly. \"We're like cockroaches for the leadership.\"\n\nDmitry Seryogin, who leads a paramedic union in Oryol, about 250 miles southwest of Moscow, said for a month he and his colleagues had been attending most calls wearing only ordinary surgical masks and gloves, despite requests for hazmat suits.\n\nAt the end of April, two of his team tested positive he said but officials refused to quarantine their paramedic station. After they began complaining to regulators, he said, the administration finally closed the station and sent 40 paramedics into quarantine.\n\nAndrey Konoval, whose union includes Seryogin's, said he was receiving reports from doctors that some hospitals were deliberately limiting testing of their staff to avoid sending them to quarantine. He said the situation with protective gear had begun to improve as federal authorities began to make it more available for local administrations, but he feared it was too late.\n\n\"There is serious progress, but the time has been lost,\" Andrey Konoval, whose union includes Seryogin's . \"And already, in some sense, that battle so that medical facilities don't turn into hotspots for spreading the infection and that the staff are preserved for work, that situation it seems me is already lost.\"",

    "High-tech devices help NFL teams keep players safe, in shape": {

        "body": "INDIANAPOLIS -- Darius Leonard works relentlessly at his rural South Carolina home to prepare for another football season. He's also wary of pushing too hard, knowing a minor injury could become a major setback given the dearth of medical experts in his area.\n\nSo when in doubt, the Indianapolis Colts star confers with his coaches, who are creating safer, more efficient individual workout programs based on data collected the past few weeks.\n\nIt's all part of a changing NFL world: high-tech devices supplanting old-school creativity.\n\n\"We are getting a ton done,\" Colts coach Frank Reich says. \"With the technology today, they all have heart rate monitors, so they do their workouts, it's all logged, it all kind of shoots to our system. This isn't, 'Hey, I'm watching you.' This is, 'Hey, I'm interested in you.' I'm a little bit of a numbers guy, so I like to see these charts. Then I'll show them to the team.\"\n\nThat fits neatly into the new guidelines for this year's revamped offseason program, too.\n\nTeams can conduct classroom instruction and on-field activities through Zoom meetings or similar apps instead of at their facilities. They can meet virtually as much as four hours per day, four days per week.\n\nPlayers also can voluntarily wear monitors to track workouts. Teams can send up to $1,500 to each player to purchase equipment.\n\nNot everyone has followed the same script. New Orleans canceled its offseason program. But the Colts are taking advantage of their allotted time. Reich estimates Indy spends half its time in meetings and the rests monitoring workouts.\n\nTechnological advances are helping everyone cope with the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\"I understand a lot more about the NFL now than I did 10 years ago,\" new Dallas Cowboys backup quarterback Andy Dalton said, comparing the difficulty he faced during the 2011 lockout with today's circumstances. \"So I guess the advantage now is there's still these virtual meetings, so you're able to connect and talk through the offense and talk through different things, stuff that I didn't have my rookie year during the lockout.\"\n\nSocial media also plays a part.\n\nDetroit Lions coach Matt Patricia recently reminded running back Ty Johnson about training safely -- after watching a video of Johnson pulling a Jeep while wearing a helmet.\n\n\"Obviously, I'm pretty sure there was someone in the car to hit the brakes in case he slipped,\" Patricia said. \"I go to safety first. I mean it's a Jeep, so once you get it moving, the ball bearings kick in and the tires go. Some of that, I was busting his chops about.\"\n\nCompanies such as WHOOP and Myzone could become game changers even after things return to normal.\n\nWHOOP, an online fitness company, partners with the NFLPA to provide wearable monitors for players. Nearly 1,000 players have used the service over the past three years as well as teams from Major League Baseball, the NBA, NFL and Major League Soccer.\n\nThe waterproof device can be worn around the wrist or bicep and tracks heart rate and strain during workouts and recovery periods. In addition to measuring heart rate variability, resting heart rate and respiratory rate, it provides information about sleep performance to give coaches the necessary information to ensure safe, efficient workout plans that won't overstress the body.\n\n\"If you go too far and keep training in a state where you're not recovered, you're not making physiological gains at that point. You're just digging a hole,\" said vice president of performance Kristen Holmes, a former U.S. national field hockey player and NCAA title-winning coach at Princeton. \"It's not about more and more and more. It's about being smart and managing load.\"\n\nThe results may even help in the fight against COVID-19. WHOOP has information showing customers who tested positive saw a spike in their respiratory rates just a few days before the onset of symptoms.\n\nZebra Technologies has been using computer chips in shoulder pads and practice shirts since 2014. Now it has installed them in footballs. Radio transmitters at stadiums and practice fields transmit data that company officials say can track measurements within 6 inches of actual distance.\n\nThe results often appear on television broadcasts: how far or fast a player ran; how far a ball was thrown; or how much separation a receiver had from a defender. Those numbers came in handy when most pro days were canceled because of the pandemic.\n\n\"Not only did we track the Senior Bowl game, but we tracked all of the practice sessions. We captured all of the player information that week,\" said John Pollard, vice president of Zebra sports business development. \"The teams apply it as a tool like any other training process or mechanism they may have in place. It can help with things like rehab, too.\"\n\nBut without the radio transmitters, Zebra cannot track workouts at home. WHOOP and Myzone still can, and their numbers help players like Leonard, a 2018 All-Pro, return to football healthy and prepared.\n\n\"I'm not going to say I can get enough out of it, but I can get a good bit,\" Leonard said of his modified regimen. \"It sucks being from the country where you don't have a chiropractor, you don't have a physical therapist who can actually work on you day in and day out. So with me, a guy who loves to train hard and run fast every day, I can't do that now because if I tweak something I have no one here to help me out. So I really have to take my time and kind of do all the small things right.\"\n\nAP Pro Football Writer Schuyler Dixon and Sports Writer Larry Lage contributed to this report.\n\nMore AP NFL: https://apnews.com/NFL and https://twitter.com/AP -- NFL",

    "Houston confronts one-two punch of COVID-19 and oil bust": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "HOUSTON -- When you're known as the energy capital of the world, oil busts are nothing new. But Houston now finds itself in uncharted territory -- grappling with an oil downturn in the middle of a pandemic.\n\nLike in other cities, the coronavirus has shut down much of Houston's economic activity, slashing thousands of jobs as well as sales tax revenues. Mayor Sylvester Turner expects a city budget deficit of about $200 million, the worst in the history of this city of more than 2.3 million, the country's fourth largest.\n\nAt the same time, the price of oil plunged below zero in April as demand plummeted due to the worldwide lockdown to stop the virus' spread. For some companies in the local oil sector -- which accounts for a third of Houston's economy -- bankruptcy is all but inevitable.\n\nThis one-two punch from COVID-19 and oil prices will make it much harder for Houston to recover from a looming recession, according to economists.\n\n\"Tough times have been seen many, many times before and these are going to be particularly tough times,\" said Bill Gilmer, director of the Institute for Regional Forecasting at the University of Houston.\n\nThose tough times will also be felt by other local businesses, including restaurants, which are boosted by the energy industry.\n\n\"You don't think a cake maker is going to care about the price of oil. In Houston, they do,\" said Jon Rosenthal, who was laid off from his energy sector job during the 2015-16 downturn, when his favorite bakery closed.\n\nFor most people, the coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness.\n\nThe dramatic drop in oil prices in the wake of COVID-19 has resulted in oil wells being shut down, companies slashing production and exploration budgets and new projects being redesigned or shelved.\n\nTexas produces more than 40% of the nation's crude oil. Very little drilling takes place in the Houston area, which has more than 237,000 energy workers. The city is instead the hub for the executive and technical talent, including engineers, that manage worldwide drilling projects.\n\nThe beating heart of Houston's oil economy is the Energy Corridor, a white-collar hub of gleaming office towers along Interstate 10 and filled with heavyweights including ConocoPhillips and BP.\n\nWhile the oil industry was already facing problems before the pandemic, including a credit crunch, Jose Sagaseta thought his job of eight years with an oilfield services company in Houston was safe.\n\n\"You never expect you're going to be the one on those lists,\" said Sagaseta, 45, who was laid off in mid-April. \"Companies are trying to hunker down ... and going to some survival mode.\"\n\nIn January, U.S. benchmark West Texas crude was trading at about $63 a barrel. Last month, the cost to have a barrel of U.S. crude delivered in May plummeted to negative $37.63. By Wednesday, the price was at about $23 a barrel. But it would have to rise to $60 to $65 a barrel to be profitable and for lost jobs to come back, Gilmer said.\n\nElisa Cook and her mother Hilary Trammell were both laid off in April. This is Cook's third job lost in the decade she's been in the industry, where her most recent job was performing audits for a company that makes tubular equipment.\n\n\"It's a love-hate relationship with oil and gas because when it's good it's good and when it's not, it's not,\" said Cook, 32.\n\nIn a survey by University of Houston researchers from early April, 53% of contacted energy workers said they felt insecure about their jobs.\n\nSagaseta, who's married and has two kids, said he's job hunting while also navigating those days where it feels like things are \"doom and gloom.\"\n\nSince mid-March, more than 8,200 workers tied to the energy industry in Texas have either been laid off or furloughed, with the majority -- more than 4,500 -- in the Houston area, according to state filings.\n\n\"No one likes laying people off,\" said George Crawford, chief information officer for Catapult Energy Services, a Houston-based venture capital firm that's bankrolled several oil field services companies. \"These are friends ... you've met their families.\"\n\nCliff Vrielink, a Houston attorney who's worked in the energy industry for 27 years, said some of his clients are debating layoffs. One client is already planning a bankruptcy filing.\n\nThe current downturn isn't expected to be as bad as the 1980s oil bust when the energy, banking and real estate markets fell. The city's economy is more diversified now.\n\nBut the city could lose up to 30,000 energy jobs, said Patrick Jankowski, senior vice president of research for the Greater Houston Partnership, a local business group.\n\nMany energy jobs typically pay twice as much as other local employment and \"once you start to cut those jobs out, you are taking a lot of purchasing power out of the economy,\" Jankowski said. Oilfield services companies have already furloughed or laid off workers. In the next few months, accountants, geologists and drilling managers will follow, Jankowski said.\n\nThe lost energy jobs along with other COVID-19 related layoffs will reduce city coffers as revenue from sales and property taxes drop, said City Controller Chris Brown, Houston's chief financial officer.\n\n\"This is a perfect storm event for Houston,\" Brown said,\n\nAssociated Press writer Paul J. Weber in Austin, Texas, and video journalist John Mone in Houston contributed to this report.\n\nFollow Juan A. Lozano on Twitter at www.twitter.com/juanlozano70",

    "How apps could change the workplace after coronavirus crisis": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "Imagine you are going in to work. If you work in an office building, you probably have to go through the front doors, maybe past a security desk. You might even get on an elevator.\n\nYou may pick up some coffee or tea in the break room and say hello to a co-worker, before finally sitting down at your workspace.\n\nSounds pretty normal so far, but as many states begin the process of reopening as the novel coronavirus pandemic loosens its grip, experts say it's time to start thinking about how to keep those workplaces germ-free.\n\nMark Ein, the CEO of Kastle Systems, a security company specializing in office buildings, told ABC News' \"Perspective\" podcast that technology can play a role in monitoring surfaces around the building that could have the virus, starting at the front door.\n\n\"As you approach the building, the security app on your phone, which we [already] have today, will connect with the motorized door, because the app said that you're authorized to come into the building, [and] the door will open automatically,\" said Ein.\n\nThe same smartphone app can also save you from touching elevator buttons.\n\n\"[Instead of] pushing both the floor and that you need an elevator, you'll put it in your app and the app will talk to the elevator, call the elevator and tell it where you're going,\" said Ein.\n\nThe app is part of a larger plan that Kastle has come up with called Kastle Safe Spaces. Ein said it's designed as a framework employers can use as they start to bring workers back.\n\nThere's even a version of an immunity passport scaled down for use around the office.\n\n\"At the point when we have widespread testing, if we also use antibody testing as a way to determine who is safe, all of those things can be entered into your health record and you can effectively get an easy pass if you're known to be safe,\" Ein said.\n\nThe easy passes can also work in reverse by tracking people who may not have symptoms, but could still be spreading the virus.\n\nIt's a form of contact tracing, which is considered by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to be a key strategy in slowing the spread of coronavirus.\n\nApple and Google recently teamed up to develop their own tracing technology, but those strategies all address large populations.\n\nHoward Tiersky, the CEO of FROM, a digital marketing firm, developed an app designed specifically for the workplace by using the Bluetooth on your smartphone.\n\n\"It's recording what we call an incident, and an incident is a period of time when you get closer than a certain threshold to another person with the app,\" Tiersky told the \"Perspective\" podcast. \"It's generally around 7 feet and it records how long you were near that person, who the other person was and approximately how far away from them you were.\"\n\nThere can be downsides to contact tracing in an office, according to Quentin Rhoads-Herrera, the professional services director at cybersecurity firm Critical Start.\n\nHe told \"Perspective\" that it could make it easier for employees to identify sick co-workers, even if the data is anonymized.\n\n\"All of a sudden one person disappears, and now I'm getting an alert that I've been around somebody who has been infected with COVID-19. Well, I'm going to be able to make an assumption that was that person,\" said Rhoads-Herrera.\n\nThat could have unintended consequences.\n\n\"Nobody wants to be shamed for something like COVID-19, or anything, and I think that would lead to that,\" said Rhodes Herrera.\n\nFor his part, he said that it's an employer's responsibility to create a corporate culture where that type of shaming is not allowed, similar to anti-discrimination policies around gender, age or disability reporting.",

    "How faxes and email are slowing the U.S. COVID-19 response": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "The U.S. created the internet, but you'd never know it given the chaotic way it collects vital pandemic data\n\nYou'd hardly know the U.S. invented the internet by the way its public health agencies are collecting vital pandemic data.\n\nWhile health-care industry record-keeping is now mostly electronic, cash-strapped state and local health departments still rely heavily on faxes, email and spreadsheets to gather infectious disease data and share it with federal authorities. The data dysfunction hamstrings the nation's coronavirus response, including in tracing people potentially exposed to the virus.\n\nIn April, the Trump administration set up a parallel reporting system run by the Silicon Valley data-wrangling firm Palantir. Duplicating many data requests, it placed new burdens on front-line workers at hospitals, labs and clinics already reporting case and testing data to public health agencies. There's little evidence the Palantir system has measurably improved federal or state response to COVID-19.\n\nEmails exchanged between Nevada officials and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in March and early April, obtained by The Associated Press in a public records request, lay bare disease-reporting bottlenecks. It sometimes takes multiple days to track down patients' addresses and phone numbers. Data vital to case investigations such as patient travel and medical histories is missing.\n\nNone of this is news to the CDC or other health experts.\n\n\"We are woefully behind,\" the CDC's No. 2 official, Anne Schuchat, wrote in a September report on public health data technology, likening the state of U.S. public health technology to \"puttering along the data superhighway in our Model T Ford.\"\n\nMost hospitals and other health care providers have long since ditched paper files for electronic health records that are easily shared within the industry.\n\nBut data collection for infectious-disease reports is another story, particularly compared to countries like Germany and Britain, which are populating online dashboards rich in current COVID-19 data and analysis. In Germany, a map populated with public data gathered by an emergency-care doctors' association even shows hospital bed availability. Many U.S. states -- New York and Colorado stand out -- also have dashboards that help guide policy.\n\nIn the U.S., many hospitals and doctors often fail to report detailed clinical data on coronavirus cases, largely because it would have to be manually extracted from electronic records, then sent by fax or email, said Johns Hopkins epidemiologist Jennifer Nuzzo. It's not unusual for public health workers to have to track patients down on social media, or use the phone book, said Rachelle Boulton, a Utah health department.\n\nDeficiencies in CDC collection have been especially glaring.\n\nIn 75% of COVID-19 cases compiled in April, data on the race and ethnicity of victims was missing. A report on children affected by the virus only had symptom data for 9% of laboratory-confirmed cases for which age was known. A study on virus-stricken U.S. health care workers could not tally the number affected because the applicable boxes were only checked on 16% of received case forms. In another study, the CDC only had data on preexisting conditions -- risk factors such as diabetes, heart and respiratory disease -- for 6% of reported cases.\n\nMissing from daily indicators that CDC makes public is data such as nationwide hospitalizations over the previous 24 hours and numbers of tests ordered and completed -- information vital to guiding the federal response, said Dr. Ashish Jha, director of the Harvard Global Health Institute. \"The CDC during this entire pandemic has been two steps behind the disease,\" he said.\n\nInstead of accelerating existing efforts to modernize U.S. disease reporting, the White House asked Palantir, whose founder Peter Thiel is a major backer of President Donald Trump, to hastily build out a data collection platform called HHS Protect. It has not gone well.\n\nOn March 29, Vice President Mike Pence, who chairs the White House pandemic task force, sent a letter asking 4,700 hospitals to collect daily numbers on virus test results, patient loads and hospital bed and intensive care-unit capacity. That information, the letter said, should be compiled into spreadsheets and emailed to the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which would feed it into the $25 million Palantir system.\n\nStressed hospitals already reporting to state and local health departments protested. Producing additional cumbersome reporting \"is just not sustainable,\" said Janet Hamilton, executive director of the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists.\n\nHHS Protect now comprises more than 200 datasets, including reporting from nearly three-quarters of the roughly 8,000 U.S. hospitals, according to Katie McKeogh, an HHS press officer. But it's not clear how accurate or helpful HHS Protect has been. Asked for examples of its usefulness, McKeogh mentioned only one: task force coordinator Dr. Deborah Birx receives a nightly report that provides \"a common (nationwide) operating picture of cases at a county level.\"\n\nFarzad Mostashari, who a decade ago oversaw the federal effort to modernize paper-based medical records, said fixing existing public-health data reporting makes more sense than creating parallel systems.\n\n\"We have a lot of the pieces in place,\" Mostashari said. A public-private partnership called digitalbridge.us is central to that effort. Since automated case reporting was expanded in late January more than 252,000 COVID reports have been generated, said CDC spokesman Benjamin N. Haynes.",

        "authors": [],
        "body": "U.S. states and countries worldwide are cautiously relaxing restrictions while watching for potential spikes in coronavirus infections. Getting the timing right is complicated. Disease trackers note the impossibility of seeing clearly what's happening without widespread testing.\n\nThe virus can circulate undetected, then flare up in a nursing home or after a family gathering. So it could be several weeks to see surges in infections. What's more, there are still new infections happening now during lockdowns. Some parts of the U.S. are seeing increasing numbers of daily new cases and some are seeing declines. Health officials will be looking at the number of new cases per day and the percentage of positive COVID-19 tests.\n\nWHY DOES IT TAKE THAT LONG?\n\nAfter exposure to the virus, it can take three to five days for someone to feel sick, and many infected people won't have symptoms or only mild ones. Some with mild illness might delay getting tested. It can take another few days to get test results back and report them. All told, it can take two weeks or so -- the time for one group of people to spread the virus to another -- to have enough testing data. Crystal Watson of the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security said it will take a few rounds of infection spread -- five to six weeks -- to know how reopening has affected epidemic curves.\n\nIF THERE'S A SPIKE, HOW WOULD WE STOP IT?\n\nIdeally, investigators would call people who test positive, track down their contacts and get them into quarantine before they can spread the virus to others. There's evidence the coronavirus can spread before people feel sick, making it important to act quickly. States are just starting to expand their ability to do this contact tracing. Without adequate testing and contact tracing, returning to restrictions or a lockdown might be necessary if there is a surge in infections.\n\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute's Department of Science Education.

        "body": "ANCHORAGE, Alaska -- The Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race has announced that the first 50 mushers who enter the 2021 race and the 2022 race will receive hundreds of dollars in reimbursements to help cover veterinary costs.\n\nMoney would come from the $50,000 Pike Dog Wellness First Initiative, which started by a donation from longtime race supporter David Pike, the Anchorage Daily News reported.\n\nPike owns a home in Girdwood, Alaska, and is the managing owner of a law firm based in Shepherdsville, Kentucky.\n\nThose eligible could receive up to $500 for diagnostics, vaccines, deworming and other services provided by a licensed veterinarian or a licensed veterinarian technician, race officials said.\n\nThe Pike Dog Wellness program has allocated $25,000 to each of the races.\n\nThe program partnered with the Iditarod in anticipation of \"the impact that the COVID-19 pandemic may have on Iditarod mushing kennels due to lost revenue from tourism declines and other economic hardships,\" according to a statement.\n\nFor most people, the new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia and death. The vast majority of people recover.\n\nThe first day of signups for the 2021 race has not yet been announced but is usually in late June, officials said.\n\nThis year, Thomas Waerner, 47, crossed the finish line first on March 18, completing the nearly 1,000-mile (1,609-kilometre) race across Alaska with a nearly six-hour lead in front of second-place musher, three-time champion Mitch Seavey.",

    "In Brazil Amazon, help a flight away for many virus patients": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "SANTO ANTONIO DO ICA, Brazil -- Residents of Santo Antonio do Ica hid from the sun under umbrellas as they waited anxiously for the twin turboprop plane to land in their town in the farthest reaches of the Brazilian Amazon.\n\nAboard the aircraft, doctor Daniel Siqueira and nurse Janete Vieira prepared for the day's mission: the evacuation of two patients from the municipality of some 22,000 people. Because COVID-19 has slammed its small population, with almost 500 cases, the town has the highest incidence per capita of any Brazilian municipality, according to a compilation of official data by the G1 news portal.\n\nThe lives of 89-year-old Sildomar Castelo Branco and the town's mayor, Abra\u00e3o Lasmar, would be in the health workers' hands until they landed in state capital of Manaus, some 550 miles (880 kilometers) away.\n\nThe sparsely populated but vast rainforest region is among Brazil's hardest hit, with scattered riverside towns completely unprepared to cope with the virus that crept upriver from Manaus. Some towns can't get oxygen tanks refilled or don't have breathing machines, forcing nurses to manually pump air into lungs. When they do have machines, power cuts frequently shut them down.\n\nMany patients need higher level care -- so they must wait for the puddlejumper to take them to Manaus, the only place in the state of 4 million people that has full intensive care units. While they wait, their conditions worsen.\n\n\"They managed to isolate the remote areas for a bit, but now (the virus) has invaded the remote areas, and there are a lot of patients getting worse who need to be brought to the capital,\" said Siqueira. \"If we leave them there, they would die.\"\n\nThis story was produced with the support of the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting.\n\nFlying to Manaus is a gamble. The altitude and pressure during the trip can strain already damaged lungs, and a patient's condition can deteriorate in a matter of minutes. The day before this trip, Siqueira lost a COVID-19 patient just 35 minutes after taking off. But there's no alternative.\n\n\"In the interior of the state, we don't have human resources, we don't have doctors, we don't have enough people to operate intensive-care unit machines,\" Gov. Wilson Lima said in an interview in Manaus.\n\nTo reach Santo Antonio do Ica, near the border with Colombia, takes several days by boat on the Solimoes River, and there is only so much equipment small aircraft can bring in. Each turboprop can only bring out one critically ill patient at a time because of the demands on the accompanying medics; it can carry an additional less sick patient in a pinch.\n\nMost medical personnel in Amazonas state are concentrated in the swamped hospitals of its capital. There was only one doctor working in Santo Antonio do Ica until Anancy Lasmar, the mayor's niece, returned to her hometown to help. The town has only one ventilator.\n\n\"It's hard not to get emotional. I was brought up here and when I got to the front line I saw everyone who I know,\" Lasmar said. She has lost two uncles and 20 patients.\n\nA federal judge ruled this week that the situation is so critical in the region, which is home to countless indigenous people who are particularly vulnerable, that authorities must urgently expand capacity at a military hospital in the area.\n\nAmazonas, almost as big as Alaska, has the fourth highest number of confirmed coronavirus cases among Brazil's states -- despite a small population and insufficient testing. Brazil has confirmed over 271,000 cases and nearly 18,000 deaths; the daily increases to its death toll have been growing.\n\nOn Tuesday, state health authorities reported for the first time fewer infections in Manaus -- home to nearly half of the state's population -- than in the rest of Amazonas. The numbers are reflected in the waiting list of patients requesting medical evacuations that has tripled in recent days, Siqueira said.\n\nIn Santo Antonio do Ica, he and his colleague had to jump into action even before their patients boarded. Castelo Branco, the octogenarian, urgently needed a breathing tube inserted -- right on the runway. Sweating under his protective suit in the humid air, Siqueira performed the procedure.\n\n\"My dad never got sick. Even the flu couldn't bring him down,\" Castelo Branco's daughter Telma Maria lamented. \"But this damn virus brought him down.\"\n\nMayor Lasmar, 53, always one to chat and joke with locals like a natural politician, smiled and waved at well-wishers who had gathered at the airport as he boarded the plane. But he couldn't muster a complete sentence as he struggled to breathe.\n\nResidents and relatives watched and prayed as the plane took off. They were unsure whether they'd see them again. For most people, the coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms. But for some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness and lead to death.\n\nFor the next three hours, doctors did everything they could to keep Castelo Branco alive, while the mayor, whose condition required less medical attention but was rapidly worsening, coughed nearby.\n\nMinutes into the flight, Castelo Branco's heart rate skyrocketed, forcing Siqueira to inject a cocktail of drugs. The loss of a patient on the prior day's flight was fresh in his memory, and he didn't want a repeat.\n\nBut just after his heart rate stabilized, Castelo Branco's blood pressure plummeted. The medical team injected a second round of drugs.\n\nTwo ambulances were waiting at Manaus' airport when the plane touched down. Its back hatch opened and Castelo Branco -- along with a network of tubes, cables and machines -- was pulled from the plane.\n\nHe still had a pulse.\n\n\"Now he's no longer mine,\" Siqueira said, breathing a sigh of relief that he had done his part.\n\nAs Lasmar climbed into the other ambulance, he gave a thumbs up and managed through strained breath to utter the words: \"Thank you.\"\n\nHundreds of miles upriver in Santo Antonio do Ica, five more people were waiting for airlifts that might not arrive in time.",

    "In Japan, pandemic brings outbreaks of bullying, ostracism": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "TOKYO -- The coronavirus in Japan has brought not just an epidemic of infections, but also an onslaught of bullying and discrimination against the sick, their families and health workers.\n\nA government campaign to raise awareness seems to be helping, at least for medical workers. But it's made only limited headway in countering the harassment and shunning that may be discouraging people from seeking testing and care and hindering the battle against the pandemic.\n\nWhen Arisa Kadono tested positive and was hospitalized in early April, she was only identified as a woman in her 20s in food business. Soon, friends let her know that groundless rumors were circulating: that the family-run bar she helps with was a hotbed of virus; that she had dined with a popular baseball player who was infected earlier but she has never met; that she was sneaking out of the hospital and spreading the virus.\n\n\"It was as if I was a criminal,\" Kadono said in an interview from her home in Himeji, western Japan, after ending her three-week hospitalization.\n\nApart from a fever on the first day and a loss of smell, Kadono had no major symptoms though she repeatedly tested positive for the virus that causes COVID-19. Her mother developed pneumonia and was briefly in intensive care at another hospital.\n\n\"There are many other people who also have faced discrimination and prejudice,(asterisk) said Kadono, who decided to speak out on her own behalf and that of other COVID-19 survivors and their families. \"I really want to change people's tendency to blame those who get infected.(asterisk)\n\nApart from fear of infection, experts say the prejudice against those even indirectly associated with the illness also stems from deeply rooted ideas about purity and cleanliness in a culture that rejects anything deemed to be alien, unclean or troublesome.\n\nMedical workers risking their lives to care for patients are a main target, but people working at grocery stores, delivering parcels and carrying out other essential jobs also are facing harassment. So are their family members.\n\n\"I can imagine people fear the virus, but we are working hard at the front lines under enormous pressure,\" said a nurse in her 30s, speaking on condition of anonymity out of fear she might be targeted if identified. \"We also have our own families we care about. Discrimination against us just because we are medical workers is discouraging and demoralizing.\"\n\nAnother nurse was approached by a few mothers and asked to leave a Tokyo park she was visiting with her children. Some nurses are unwelcome at restaurants they usually eat at. Some are rejected by taxi drivers. The Health Ministry issued a directive to day care facilities after some barred the children of doctors and nurses.\n\nA veteran nurse in the northern island of Hokkaido said the mother of one of her coworkers was suspended from work. The husband of another was told at a job interview he wouldn't be hired because of his wife's job.\n\nThe nurses, both assigned to COVID-19 patients, were staying at hotels to protect their families while working under severe conditions without adequate protective equipment and testing.\n\n\"We understand people's fears, but medical workers are doing their utmost to prevent infections at hospitals. We seek your support,\" said Toshiko Fukui, head of the Japanese Nursing Association.\n\n\"We are not asking for anything special. ... Just a word of thanks is a huge reward that boosts our motivation,\" Fukui said.\n\nThe backlash against coronavirus patients may lead some who fall sick to avoid seeking medical care, raising the risks of infection spreading further, clinical psychologist Reo Morimitsu at the Suwa Red Cross Hospital said in an interview with NHK public television. Reports said Japanese police last month found about a dozen people dead at home alone or collapsed on the streets who later tested positive for the virus.\n\n\"The virus not only infects our body but also our minds and behavior, harming us and dividing our society,\" Morimitsu said.\n\nPrejudice against those not viewed as mainstream or \"pure\" is a legacy of feudal times, when some Japanese engaged in professions such as leather tanning and butchering were deemed unclean. Their descendants still face discrimination. People suffering from ailments such as Hansen's disease, or leprosy, were likewise forced to live in isolation decades after a cure was found.\n\nVictims of the 1945 U.S. atomic bomb attacks on Japan, known as \"hibakusha,\" and others injured in industrial accidents such as mercury poisoning have faced similar treatment. More recently, some who fled the 2011 nuclear meltdowns in Fukushima have suffered bullying and harassment.\n\n\"Underlying the (coronavirus) discrimination is a sense that the patients are impure,\" Naoki Sato, an expert on criminology and Japanese culture at the Kyushu Institute of Technology, wrote in a recent article in the Gendai Business online magazine. \"Growing anxiety and fear of infection are adding to discrimination against the infected.\"\n\nRandom acts of hatred have been reported from across the country:\n\n-- Arson threats were made against Kyoto Sangyo University after some of its students were infected.\n\n-- An Osaka city assemblyman compared a young patient to \"a murderer\" of elderly people.\n\n-- In Mie, central Japan, people threw stones at a patient's house and vandalized property.\n\n-- In Iwate, a man died while in self-quarantine after his future neighbors sought to bar him from moving into a retirement home and the local government office refused to register him.\n\nPrime Minister Shinzo Abe and other officials have denounced such behavior.\n\n\"It's shameful,\" Abe told a recent parliamentary session. \"Anyone could get infected.\"\n\nSome places in Japan have begun following the examples set in Europe and elsewhere of sending messages of appreciation and praising medical workers and others in essential jobs. Some offices have started collecting donations and other support for hospitals.\n\nThe belated campaign to raise awareness and combat corona discrimination is only a first step, but it's a start, said the nurse from Hokkaido.\n\n\"People started to cheer us,\" she said. \"Neighborhood stores sometimes bring us treats like pancakes, fried noodles and milk.\"\n\nFollow Mari Yamaguchi on Twitter at https://www.twitter.com/mariyamaguchi",

    "In the 'epicenter of the epicenter,' were early heart attacks a missed coronavirus warning?": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "New York City officially earned the grim distinction of becoming the nation's coronavirus epicenter on March 20, but city records analyzed by ABC News suggest a crisis swelling far earlier, signaled by a sudden uptick in cardiac arrest cases that experts now say were likely linked to the virus.\n\nEmergency calls for cardiac arrest began to climb in mid-February, in close-knit neighborhoods of Brooklyn and Queens, some of the same local areas that would soon form the \"epicenter of the epicenter\" of America's coronavirus pandemic.\n\n\"I've never seen anything like this,\" New York City Emergency Medical Services (EMS) Chief Lillian Bonsignore told ABC. \"It was astounding. We went from normal to wartime EMS in a week. And then it was just explosive and it continued.\"\n\nFor nearly three weeks, she said, calls escalated exponentially, particularly cardiac arrest emergencies.\n\n\"We went from about 70 or 80 [cardiac arrests] a day which is what we normally do, to almost five times the amount,\" Bonsignore said. \"I really was very surprised. I've never experienced a global pandemic.\"\n\nThough early on other symptoms, like fever, were known to be warning signs of a coronavirus outbreak, doctors have since noted a strong link between coronavirus infections and heart damage, though exactly how the virus goes after the heart is unknown.\n\nAs the virus attacks a patient's respiratory system, other organs -- like the heart -- suffer stress, a complication that could lead to cardiac arrest and even death. The virus has also been found to cut the oxygen supply in some patients, something that could wreak havoc on the heart, especially among those who might already have cardiac problems.\n\n\"The most devastating\" complication is \"when the virus goes in and affects the heart cells directly and kills them,\" Dr. Varinder Singh, Chief of Cardiology at Lenox Hill Hospital on Manhattan's Upper East Side, said.\n\nTune into ABC at 1 p.m. ET and ABC News Live at 4 p.m. ET every weekday for special coverage of the novel coronavirus with the full ABC News team, including the latest news, context and analysis.\n\nHe said that the inflammatory response from the virus is so severe to the heart that there were reports of \"seeing what looked like a classic heart attack.\" A majority of heart attacks are associated with clogged arteries, but Singh's team was surprised to find that in these patients \"their arteries were actually normal.\"\n\nDr. Siyab Panhwar, cardiology fellow at Tulane Medical Center, also warned that it was \"very possible\" that blood clotting triggered by the coronavirus could be to blame and \"causing more cardiac arrests.\"\n\nAs the coronavirus spread, Panhwar was brought in as a cardiology consult for COVID-19 patients and said he has seen the same patterns playing out as found around the world: an unexpected prevalence of blood clotting, sometimes followed by sudden events like cardiac arrest.\n\n\"It's a really interesting trend,\" Panhwar said. \"Since autopsies aren't being done a lot right now, it's still hard to know. COVID-19 infections have a lot of effects on the heart, and just because we don't know everything yet doesn't mean it's not happening. It's worth looking at.\"\n\nOn Saturday night, medical examiners released the autopsy for what is now the first known coronavirus death in the nation: a woman in San Jose, in northern California's Silicon Valley. Patricia Dowd, 57, died in early February, from what appeared to be a massive heart attack, though she had also suffered flu-like symptoms.\n\nShe had coronavirus, which doctors did not know at the time. In addition to her heart, the virus had attacked her lungs and intestines, according to a medical examiner cited by the San Francisco Chronicle.\n\nBack in New York, as COVID-19 jumped from person to person in densely populated precincts throughout the nation, New York City's biggest boroughs, Brooklyn and Queens, took the unwelcome status for most seriously overwhelmed. Front-line health care workers were seen triaging patients in tents, in hallways, in waiting areas -- any place they could.\n\nBy the time New York was declared ground zero for the American chapter in the pandemic, confirmed cases in the city amounted to a third of all cases in the U.S.\n\nAn analysis of EMS cardiac call data broken down by zip code reveals cardiac emergency calls and deaths both soaring with infection rates -- not just in tandem, but in the same neighborhoods. Looking back, it appears a significant portion of those heart emergencies were likely linked to the virus, according to medical experts consulted by ABC News.\n\n\"Significant hypoxia [from COVID-19] could be the root case of sudden cardiac death,\" Dr. Fred Jacobs, a pulmonologist and the former commissioner of health in New Jersey, told ABC News. Hypoxia is the medical term for the condition that occurs when too little oxygen reaches the body's organs, causing them to fail.\n\n\"The data is showing an increase in cardiac arrest calls in the areas that also show an increase in COVID-19. So the question will be, 'Is it causative?'\" Jacobs said. \"There are a lot of contributory factors here coming together in a perfect storm... This is a good part of the picture, but we also need a deeper dive into the data.\"\n\nEMS call volume for cardiac arrests began rising to record levels at the end of March, the same time frame that saw hospitals like Elmhurst and Brookdale in Brooklyn bursting at the seams with coronavirus victims. By mid-April, numbers were more than six times what they'd been the same time a year earlier. On April 6, there were 366 cardiac calls; over 76 percent resulted in death. By April 13, the death rate had risen to more than 79 percent.\n\n\"This was new for all of us,\" Bonsignore said. \"I really didn't know if we could do this - it happened so fast, like a tsunami coming in.\"\n\nAreas of Jamaica, Corona and Far Rockaway in Queens; Brooklyn zones like Flatbush, East Flatbush, Brownsville, Canarsie and Bedford-Stuyvesant; in the Bronx, Kingsbridge and Allerton saw high volumes of cardiac arrest calls and deaths. They all were also struck with acute clusters of the virus, with the majority within the highest bracket of between 1,164 and 3,045 cases.\n\nIn the high-pressure push to learn more about what first responders have called a \"silent bullet,\" experts say there is a critical need for medical science to know more about coronavirus.\n\nTo them, it's not just an academic exercise. Knowledge could make the difference between life and death when victims of COVID show up but present strange symptoms that could easily be mistaken, and it could help protect the front line workers responding as well.\n\n\"We have family members that are there, they expect a miracle, they expect we're going to bring back their loved one,\" Bonsignore said. \"Our rescuers are resilient, they're dedicated to saving lives, but they're also human. And they themselves haven't been immune to this enemy. As we're doing this medical war on the front lines, our members were getting sick as well.\"\n\n\"I think we're going to have a lot of work to do when this is over,\" Bonsignore said. \"This was new for all of us ... I didn't know we could do it to be honest. This thing was spreading so quickly -- we're just working to stay in front of it.\"",

        "body": "DUQUE DE CAXIAS, Brazil -- Specialists stood over intubated patients in the intensive care unit, reviewing charts and jotting down notes. They conversed in low voices, barely audible amid the incessant beeps from patients' monitors.\n\nTwo empty beds were in sight Saturday morning, but doctors at the Sao Jose hospital in a working class city just north of Rio de Janeiro said they would be occupied by afternoon. It likely will be only a matter of days, or perhaps hours, until the rest are full, too, as the coronavirus spreads.\n\n\"People are coming from all over,\" Jos\u00e9 Carlos de Oliveira, health secretary for the city of Duque de Caxias, told The Associated Press in the hospital's parking lot.\n\n\"This disease is not kidding around. Whoever thinks it's a joke is going to lose their life,\" said de Oliveira, a physician who recently recovered from the virus himself.\n\nFour ambulances soon pulled up simultaneously at the hospital.

All transported COVID-19 patients and were making a dash for the facility's precious few remaining beds.\n\nSao Jose is accepting overflow from other hospitals whose facilities are already maxed out in treating COVID-19 cases.\n\nIn Rio de Janeiro state, which has the second highest number of deaths in Brazil, most hospitals accepting COVID-19 patients have run out of intensive care beds. According to the state's health secretary, as of Thursday, 369 people thought to have the virus were waiting to be transferred to an ICU.\n\nThe Sao Jose facility was just inaugurated, on May 4, and already 90% of its 128 beds are occupied. Less than a week after the World Health Organization declared a pandemic, the city of Duque de Caxias bought a private hospital and began racing to transform it into an intensive care facility exclusively for treatment of COVID-19 patients.\n\nMore than 15,000 Brazilians have died from the disease so far, though many experts say the figure is probably significantly higher, with cases missed because of insufficient testing. In recent days, more than 800 people have been added to the death toll every 24 hours and the crisis' peak has yet to hit Latin America's largest nation, the experts say.\n\nPresident Jair Bolsonaro has consistently downplayed the pandemic, calling the coronavirus a \"little flu\" and fiercely criticizing state governors and mayors who have closed businesses, introduced lockdowns and recommended stay-at-home measures. Bolsonaro has instead advocated for everyone who doesn't belong to \"at-risk\" groups to return to work so the economy doesn't collapse.\n\nFor most people, the new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms including fever and cough. The risk of death is greater for the elderly and people with other health problems such as diabetes or hypertension.\n\n-- --\n\nAssociated Press video journalist Yesica Fisch reported this story in Duque de Caxias and AP writer Diane Jeantet reported from Rio de Janeiro.",

    "Iraqi doctor's fight with virus lays bare a battered system": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "BAGHDAD -- Dr. Marwa al-Khafaji's homecoming after 20 days in a hospital isolation ward was met by spite. Someone had barricaded her family home's gate with a concrete block.\n\nThe message from the neighbors was clear: She had survived coronavirus, but the stigma surrounding the disease would be a more pernicious fight.\n\nThe young physician was catapulted into the front lines of Iraq's battle with the virus in early March. The Associated Press followed her tale from inside a squalid quarantine room to her return to the streets of her childhood, where she found piercing glares had displaced greetings.\n\nHer struggles mirror those of Iraq's battered health system, laid bare by the pandemic: Hospitals without supplies, medical staff intimidated by an unknown disease, and widespread stigma associated with infection.\n\nFear of stigma -- driven by religious beliefs, customs and a deep mistrust of the health system -- has been a main driver of the pandemic in Iraq, doctors say, as people hide their illness and avoid seeking help.\n\nAt least 115 people have died among more than 3,030 confirmed coronavirus cases across Iraq, according to Health Ministry statistics. The daily rate of cases jumped after curfew hours were shortened for the holy month of Ramadan, from 29 on April 22 to 119 on Wednesday. Officials fear a flare-up would be catastrophic.\n\nIraqi officials described the ministry's response as adequate and said Iraq was spared the exponential rise in cases seen in neighboring Iran and Turkey.\n\nMinistry spokesman Saif al-Badr blamed the spread on people who had symptoms or came from an affected country and \"didn't disclose these facts due to arrogance.\"\n\nBut Khafaji's story, as well as interviews with half a dozen doctors and nurses, reveal a haphazard response with no comprehensive strategy from a hobbled government that until recently had only caretaker status.\n\n\"Inside quarantine, the future felt uncertain,\" Khafaji said. \"Outside it's no different.\"\n\nIn mid-March, Khafaji, 39, grew alarmed when her elderly mother, Dhikra Saoud, showed signs of respiratory distress. The virus had just started to hit Iraq and had yet to leave its mark on the city of Karbala where she lives.\n\nBut the doctor connected the dots. Days before, her father showed mild flu-like symptoms that she treated at home. Now her mother was presenting the same, but in acute form.\n\nShe was certain it was coronavirus. But at three different hospitals, doctors refused to test her mother. At the time, the limited test kits were rationed for those who had been to Iran.\n\nAt each hospital visit, Khafaji's mother was afraid the neighbors would hear where she was. \"I beg you. Take me home,\" she said.\n\nHer symptoms worsened, until a tearful Khafaji pleaded to a physician friend at 3 a.m.: Please, \"give my mother the test.\" He agreed.\n\nOn March 19, policemen came to the house to take both mother and daughter to the hospital. Both had tested positive. Here again was a repercussion of the stigma: People often refuse to be quarantined, so police are sent to force them.\n\nKhafaji knew the shortcomings of the system she worked in. Inside quarantine, she experienced it from the eyes of a patient.\n\nOn the first day, Khafaji's mother looked at the squalid ward in disgust. \"You have brought me to a prison,\" she said.\n\nThe quarantine zone of the Imam Hussein teaching hospital was a communal ward, with patients separated by metal screens. The floors were cracked, mold bloomed in the shared bathroom, dust coated surfaces despite daily cleanings.\n\nKhafaji was no stranger to hardship: The mother of a 5-year-old, she recently divorced a husband who shot her in the leg following a domestic dispute. She asked the staff for cleaning materials and scrubbed the room and bathrooms herself.\n\nWhen the sheets and blankets remained unwashed for days, she threw hers out in protest.\n\nIraq's centralized health system, largely unchanged since the 1970s, has been ground down by decades of wars, sanctions and prolonged unrest since the 2003 U.S. invasion, with little investment from successive governments.\n\nThere are eight physicians and 1.4 hospital beds per 10,000 people. The country of 38 million has at most 600 ventilators, a Health Ministry official said. One Karbala doctor, Assel Saad Saleh, said his hospital sees 1,000 patients a day, well over triple its capacity.\n\n\"Patients get angry with lack of supplies, drugs and testing kits,\" he said.\n\nThe patients who flowed into the quarantine during Khafaji's stay reflected the course of the virus in Iraq. First came pilgrims returning from Iran, then those from Syria. Finally, patients with no travel history whatsoever.\n\nKhafaji took solace in routine.\n\nAt 8 a.m. she woke her mother, served breakfast and waited for the doctor's morning check to see what treatment or testing he might order. She often interjected with her own medical opinion. When one doctor proscribed a patient nebulizer therapy twice daily, she said it was needed every hour.\n\nAt night, given the doctor shortage, Khafaji monitored patients and reported changes to nurses who checked in only every six hours, trembling as they approached virus patients.\n\nShe stood aghast when an emergency physician told her he didn't know how to intubate a patient's airway.\n\n\"They are untrained,\" she said. \"And they are afraid of us.\"\n\nOn her worst day she suffered fatigue, headache and a high fever.\n\n\"My eyes were like rocks,\" she said.\n\nOn April 10, Khafaji and her mother tested negative for the virus and could leave.\n\nBut another crisis awaited: the cement blocks that neighbors had erected, blocking their home's front and back gates.\n\nEven after they were removed, things weren't the same.\n\nWhen her son goes to play in the garden, Khafaji hears other mothers calling their children back into the house.\n\nBy May, she was back putting in 12-hour shifts at the hospital on an $800 a month stipend, the average physician's salary in Iraq. At her request, she works in the waiting room, helping diagnose potential virus patients.\n\n\"Everyone has a limit,\" she said. \"I haven't reached it till now.\"\n\nAssociated Press writer Qassim Abdul-Zahra contributed from Baghdad.",

Public transportation has been shut down and police are manning roadblocks to prevent travel.\n\nThe Israeli air force devoted its annual fly-by to health workers, with planes crisscrossing the nation and performing aerial acrobatics over hospitals and medical centers. Other events were to be broadcast online, with no live audience.\n\nIsrael has reported more than 15,700 cases and at least 210 deaths from the coronavirus. The virus causes mild to moderate symptoms in most patients, but can cause severe illness or death, particularly in elderly patients and those with underlying health problems.\n\nIsrael imposed sweeping restrictions on movement and ordered most businesses to close in mid-March. It has recently begun easing those restrictions as the rate of new infections appears to have stabilized.\n\nThe Independence Day lockdown is set to be lifted Wednesday night. Most shops will then be allowed to reopen, provided they meet regulations on social distancing and hygiene. People are required to wear masks in public places.",

It has infected over 15,000 Israelis and killed nearly 200 people, but Israel has not seen its health system overwhelmed like hard-hit places such as Italy or New York.\n\nLitzman, an ultra-Orthodox politician with no formal medical training, has come under criticism for appearing ill-prepared at news conferences and reportedly resisting proposals to tighten lockdown measures that would affect the country's religious community. Early this month, Litzman was diagnosed with COVID-19, apparently after ignoring his own ministry's orders to avoid group prayer in public places. He has since recovered.\n\nThe coronavirus causes mild to moderate symptoms in most patients, who recover within a few weeks. But it can cause severe illness or death, particularly in older patients or those with underlying health problems.\n\nWith the crisis appearing to be in check, the government announced new easing measures Sunday.\n\nBarbershops, beauty salons and other small businesses reopened, and restaurants were permitted to serve takeout orders for the first time in nearly two months. Last week, some shops were allowed to open as well. Malls and outdoor markets, however, remain closed out of concern of a renewed outbreak of the disease.\n\nThe restrictions on the operation of many small businesses has helped propel unemployment in Israel to over 25% since the beginning of March.\n\nMerchants at Jerusalem's large central Mahane Yehuda outdoor market protested its continued closure while many other businesses, including furniture giant IKEA, were allowed to reopen.\n\nThe Hebrew business paper The Marker reported that the owners of IKEA's Israeli franchisee have donated at least $1.3 million in recent years to the ultra-Orthodox organization that Litzman belongs to.\n\nLitzman denied any connection between IKEA Israel and ultra-Orthodox officials and the government's decision to permit the Swedish furniture chain to open its four locations in Israel.\n\nDespite the easing of restrictions, the government has approved a nationwide lockdown that will close military cemeteries on Memorial Day on Tuesday and cancel public celebrations for Wednesday's Independence Day.\n\nThe government has also ordered the closure of stores in Muslim communities from 6:00 p.m. until 3:00 a.m. until the end of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, which began last week.",

        "authors": [],
        "body": "O'FALLON, Mo. -- A federal judge dismissed a lawsuit filed on behalf of employees at a rural Missouri meatpacking facility, ruling that oversight of how the plant adheres to guidance aimed at slowing the spread of the coronavirus falls to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, not the courts.\n\nU.S. District Judge Greg Kays issued his 24-page ruling Tuesday in favor of Smithfield Foods. A lawsuit on behalf of workers at Smithfield's pork processing plant in Milan, Missouri, sought an injunction requiring the plant to abide by federal guidelines. The lawsuit accused Virginia-based Smithfield of not doing enough to protect workers from the coronavirus.\n\n\"Plaintiffs are naturally concerned for their health and the health of their community in these unprecedented times,\" Kays wrote. \"The Court takes their concern seriously. Nevertheless, the Court cannot ignore the USDA's and OSHA's authority over compliance ... or the significant steps Smithfield has taken to reduce the risk of a COVID-19 outbreak at the Plant.\"\n\nThe Milan plant has not seen an outbreak of COVID-19. Just one case has been reported in Sullivan County, where the plant is located. But outbreaks have become common at other meat plants across the U.S., infecting thousands of workers, leading to the closure of some plants and prompting meat shortages. Several big grocery chains this week were restricting customer purchases of meat, and Wendy's was unable to serve hamburgers at some locations.\n\nPresident Donald Trump issued an executive order last week requiring meatpacking plants to stay open. The order was widely seen as giving processors protection from liability for workers who become sick on the job, and it came after the Missouri lawsuit against Smithfield Foods.\n\nIn Washington, Trump and Vice President Mike Pence met Wednesday in the Oval Office with Department of Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue and Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds in a session that was upbeat about reopening meat plants quickly and safely.\n\n\"We think the story will be we'll see more variety, and more meat cases fully supplied,\" Perdue said. \"I'd say probably a week to 10 days we'll be fully back up.\"\n\n\"We're going to hopefully prevent what could have been a really sorry situation where we were euthanizing some of our protein supply and really impacting the food supply, not only across the country but throughout the world,\" Reynolds said.\n\nOn the matter of safety, she said companies \"know how important it is to take care of their workforce.\"\n\nPerdue said that since Trump's order, the USDA has worked with OSHA and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to ensure that meat plants are abiding by federal guidelines.\n\nThe attorney for the workers in Milan, David Muraskin, didn't rule out an appeal but said the lawsuit had demonstrated workers' power by prompting several changes at the plant, including better spacing of employees, additional cleaning and sanitizing, and an improved sick leave policy that means workers don't feel obligated to come to work if they have symptoms of the coronavirus.\n\nSmithfield said it was pleased the court dismissed what it called a \"frivolous\" lawsuit.\n\n\"Importantly, the Court recognized the 'significant measures' Smithfield is taking to protect the health and safety of its employees,\" the company said in a statement.\n\nAlso Wednesday, Trump said he has asked the Justice Department to investigate allegations of potential market manipulation and possible price fixing by meatpackers during the pandemic. Attorneys general for 11 Midwestern states this week asked for a federal investigation, and some members of Congress had also asked about the issue.\n\nSeparately, the Minneapolis Star Tribune reported Wednesday that more than 300 federal meatpacking inspectors are either sick from the coronavirus or in self-quarantine after exposure. Citing a USDA spokesman, the newspaper said through Tuesday, 197 inspectors had tested positive; the Food Safety and Inspection Service has about 8,000 employees. The agency said it continues to meet its responsibilities.\n\nAssociated Press writers Michael Balsamo and Kevin Freking in Washington contributed to this report.",

        "authors": [],
        "body": "Associated Press -- The city of Los Angeles and LA County must find shelter for thousands of homeless people who are living near freeways, a federal judge ordered Friday, saying their health is at risk from pollution, earthquakes and the coronavirus.\n\nU.S. District Court Judge David O. Carter issued a preliminary injunction requiring relocation of an estimated 6,000 to 7,000 people camping near freeway ramps and under overpasses and bridges. He gave officials one week -- until May 22 -- to come up with a plan for providing \"humane\" housing.\n\n\"Without adequate access to shelter, hygiene products, and sanitation facilities, individuals experiencing homelessness face a greater risk of contracting the novel coronavirus, and an outbreak in the homeless community would threaten the general public as well,\" Carter wrote.\n\nHe said those living near freeways are exposed to pollution, including lead, that can shorten their life expectancy by decades. Carter also said the location means the homeless face a greater danger of being struck by a car or injured during an accident or earthquake.\n\nCarter said alternatives to shelters could include \"safe parking sites\" to camp or hotel and motel rooms that the county is renting under Project Roomkey, a state program established during the pandemic to get thousands of homeless off the streets temporarily to avoid transmission of COVID-19.\n\nThe injunction was issued in a lawsuit filed by the LA Alliance for Human Rights, which accused officials in greater Los Angeles of failing to comprehensively address the homelessness crisis.\n\n\"It seems like this order was meant to galvanize action and really compel all parties to start thinking these challenges in a new and innovative way,\" said Daniel Conway, policy adviser for the alliance. \"The judge has, frankly, issued a challenge: Let's make this work and let's start saving lives.\"\n\nLos Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti expressed hope for an agreement by the deadline.\n\n\"The judge has asked us to work with him to prioritize folks that are there, living under and over freeway overpasses, and we hope in the coming week that we can come to some common agreements with all the parties in the court case,\" he said.\n\nThe lawsuit, filed in March, asked the judge to set a \"legally enforceable mandate\" to establish homeless services and enough beds for anyone who needs one on any given night.\n\nResidents are confronted daily with public health risks, blocked sidewalks, untreated mental illness and addiction, environmental hazards and increased crime, according to the filing.\n\nWhile once largely confined to the notorious Skid Row neighborhood in downtown Los Angeles, encampments have spread countywide. Freeway overpasses are lined with tents, and it's a common sight to see someone pushing a shopping cart filled with belongings through even suburban neighborhoods.\n\nA 2019 count by the Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority reported that there were close to 60,000 homeless people living in LA County, including 36,000 within the city limits. Both figures were up more than 10% from the previous year.\n\nProject Roomkey was created in April by Gov. Gavin Newsom and uses mainly federal money to acquire hotel and motel rooms for the homeless to shield them from the virus. Los Angeles County has by far the largest number of homeless in California -- about 60,000 -- and officials there set a goal of obtaining 15,000 rooms through the program.\n\nBut so far only about 2,200 rooms have been leased in the county and homeless advocates have criticized the slow pace. There are 2,067 people sheltered with another 375 rooms available, said Christopher Yee, spokesman for the Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority.\n\nThere are hundreds of other rooms under contract but they haven't yet been certified as ready to receive people.\n\nSome Project Roomkey rooms would conceivably be available to house some homeless people covered by the judge's order, although Yee noted that the rooms are specifically reserved for those considered most vulnerable to the virus: those 65 and older and those with underlying health conditions.\n\nFor most people, the coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia, and death.",

        "authors": [],
        "body": "MIAMI -- A federal judge ordered authorities to release hundreds of immigrants from three Florida detention centers to prevent a wider spread of the coronavirus and protect detainees with underlying conditions.\n\nU.S. District Court Judge Marcia Cooke issued an order late Thursday for the Immigration and Customs Enforcement to begin the steps to bring down the number of detainees from 1,400 to about 350 within two weeks.\n\nTwo others orders were also issued on Thursday by federal judges in California and Louisiana siding with groups seeking the release of immigrants at high risk.\n\nIn Miami, seven detainees at the Krome Detention Center have tested positive for COVID-19. And court filings state at least eight staff members have been infected at the same detention center.\n\nThe judge said she found violations of the Fifth and Eight Amendments that protect due process and against unusual punishment as conditions are worsening each day at Krome and authorities have failed at practicing social distancing at one of the other facilities.\n\n\"These failures have placed petitioners at a heightened risk of not only contracting COVID-19, but also succumbing to the fatal effects of the virus as some of the petitioners have serious underlying medical illness,\" Cook wrote in the document. \"Such failures amount to cruel and unusual punishment because they are exemplary of deliberate indifference.\"\n\nICE was ordered to submit a report Sunday with the steps to release detainees. Cooke also gave ICE two days to give masks to every detainee at the three Florida facilities, in Miami, Broward County and Glades County.\n\nImmigrant rights groups celebrated the judge's decision on Friday, saying there was no justification to keep immigrants fighting civil matters behind bars in the middle of a pandemic.\n\n\"By ignoring the advice of doctors and public health experts, the agency is knowingly putting detained peoples' lives in grave danger,\" said Paul R. Chavez, an attorney for the Southern Poverty Law Center. \"Their wholly unnecessary detention has led to catastrophic outbreaks that will soon burden an already strained health care system.\"\n\nAn ICE spokesman said he could not speak specifically about the lawsuit as litigation is pending. The agency says it reviews releases on a case-by-case basis and has released nearly 700 people from custody due to the spread of the coronavirus.\n\nSPLC and other groups filed the complaint on April 13 seeking the immediate release of detainees at three Florida facilities saying they were at risk of infection because officials were not following guidelines to prevent the spread of COVID-19.\n\nAccording to testimonies from detainees cited in the complaint, there is not enough soap and some said they had not received masks or gloves even after asking for the equipment. Some men said they continue to be close to people with flu-like symptoms because of cell and sleeping arrangements.",

        "authors": [],
        "body": "FLAGSTAFF, Ariz. -- A judge has ruled in favor of tribal nations in their bid to keep Alaska Native corporations from getting a share of $8 billion in coronavirus relief funding -- at least for now.\n\nIn a decision issued late Monday, U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta in Washington, D.C., said the U.S. Treasury Department could begin disbursing funding to 574 federally recognized tribes to respond to the coronavirus but not to the corporations.\n\nThe ruling comes in a case brought by at least 15 tribes against the Treasury Department. The tribes allege that Congress intended the funding to go only to tribal governments and that the corporations don't fit within the definition of \"Indian Tribe\" in the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act.\n\nMehta said the tribes easily showed they would suffer irreparable harm unless he limited the funding temporarily to tribal governments while he awaited more argument on the question of eligibility of Alaska Native corporations.\n\n\"These are monies that Congress appropriated on an emergency basis to assist tribal governments in providing core public services to battle a pandemic that is ravaging the nation, including in Indian Country,\" Mehta said.\n\nThe Treasury Department and the U.S. Justice Department representing the Treasury did not immediately respond to requests for comment Monday.\n\nJustice Department attorney Jason Lynch had argued that the Treasury Department's decision to include Alaska Native corporations wasn't subject to judicial review because the funding is for a public health emergency. Mehta rejected the argument.\n\nThe Treasury Department has said it could start sending payments to tribes Tuesday -- two days past the deadline in the coronavirus relief bill. But it has not said how it would determine who gets what.\n\nHarry Pickernell, Sr., the chairman of the lead plaintiff tribe, the Confederated Tribes of the Chehalis Reservation in Washington state, said he was pleased with the judge's decision.\n\n\"This ruling will help tribal governments to lead in the aid and recovery of their people,\" he said in a statement.\n\nAlaska Native corporations are unique to Alaska and own most of the Native land in the state under a 1971 settlement known as the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act. Mehta said neither the corporations nor the Treasury Department showed the corporations are providing public services comparable to the tribes to combat the coronavirus.\n\nThe corporations, which are not parties to the lawsuit, have said they support Alaska Natives economically, socially and culturally.\n\nTwo associations representing some of the corporations -- the ANCSA Regional Association and the Alaska Native Village Corporation Association -- said they believe the corporations ultimately will be deemed eligible for funding.\n\n\"This will mean a delay in necessary resources and economic assistance for Alaska Native people in our communities and our state,\" the groups said. \"However, Alaska Native people have a history of resilience and strength. Together we will prevent the spread of COVID-19, care for those who get sick, and repair our economies.\"\n\nFor most people, the coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness and death. The vast majority of people recover.",

    "Judge to Chicago jail: Do more to protect inmates from virus": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "CHICAGO -- Cook County Jail in Chicago must do more to ensure social distancing among its 4,000 inmates to stem the spread of the coronavirus that's already killed six detainees and one guard at the facility, a federal judge ruled Monday.\n\nJudge Matthew Kennelly stopped short of mandating a process that would lead to the release of older inmates and those with underlying health conditions more susceptible to dying from COVID-19.\n\nThe southwest Chicago jail -- one of the nation's largest -- has already taken measures to limit close contact, including by creating more single-occupancy cells and providing more reading material to inmates to encourage them stay in their cells and away from common areas, Kennelly noted.\n\nHe issued an order on April 9 requiring the jail to provide ample sanitizer to inmates, and it later distributed 28 gallons of sanitizer despite concern that some inmates would drink the alcohol-based substance. That order didn't mandate social distancing procedures beyond intake areas, citing security constraints.\n\nIn his latest ruling, Kennelly noted testimony that some guards openly mocked social distancing. Others told him the jail wasn't cleaning common areas sufficiently, and that phones weren't sanitized between inmate calls. The new order says phones and other objects must be cleaned after each inmate use.\n\nSome jail officials said inmates are partly to blame for not heeding instructions on how to protect themselves. Kennelly's order calls on jail authorities to speak regularly to inmates to stress the importance of social distancing.\n\nThe judge praised Cook County Sheriff Tom Dart, who oversees the jail, for \"a significant and impressive effort to safeguard\" inmates from infection. But he agreed with lawyers who filed a lawsuit on behalf of detainees fearful of catching COVID-19 that more needs to be done. The suit led to both of the April orders.\n\nThe jail must mostly phase out the practice of doubling up inmates in some cells or holding them in large-group units, Kennelly said. He set April 29 as the deadline for compliance.\n\nAs of Sunday, 229 detainees have the coronavirus, including 17 who are hospitalized, and 232 have recovered, sheriff's data shows. In addition, 158 correctional officers and 35 sheriff's employees have the virus, while 170 have recovered and returned to work.\n\nKennelly said earlier this month that the jail had an infection rate of 50 per 1,000 people, far higher than elsewhere in the county. Dart responded that this was because the jail tests everyone with symptoms, which isn't the case outside.\n\nThe jail's population has dropped by more than 1,000 to around 4,000 following another judge's order in March for bail reduction hearings leading to the release of detainees not considered a threat.\n\nCiting those numbers, Kennelly said Monday it was clear that inmates vulnerable to COVID-19 already had recourse for winning their release. And he rejected pleas from inmates' lawyers that crowding in jail itself during a pandemic could be grounds for release.\n\n\"This,\" he said, \"would be tantamount to saying that, in the present circumstances, the Constitution prohibits detaining people in jails.\"",

        "body": "DALLAS -- For 81-year-old Dell Kaplan, the offer to get calls from a stranger just to chat while staying home during the coronavirus pandemic was immediately appealing.\n\n\"It gets pretty lonely here by yourself,\" said Kaplan, a suburban Dallas resident who has been missing meals out with friends, family get-togethers and going to classes at a nearby college.\n\nThe program being offered by the city of Plano is among those that have popped up across the U.S. during the pandemic to help older adults with a simple offer to engage in small talk.\n\n\"It's really just to give them a social outlet that they might not have otherwise,\" said Holly Ryckman, a library support supervisor who is among about 15 staffers from several city departments in Plano who together have been making about 50 calls a week starting in April.\n\nBrent Bloechle, a library manager who helped organize the program, said the city plans to keep it up through at least mid-summer, and maybe permanently.\n\nThe people receiving the calls have various amounts of social interaction in their lives, Ryckman said. Many, she said, talk about relatives who are in touch, so her call might be just be \"one piece of the puzzle\" helping them stay engaged.\n\nThat's the case for Kaplan, who regularly talks with her daughter, granddaughters and friends, keeps up with people on Facebook and has been participating online in her adult-learning classes.\n\nBut Kaplan said her biweekly chats with Ryckman give her something to look forward to \"besides the usual.\"\n\nLaurie Onofrio-Collier has been making calls to older people across the U.S. from her California home as part of the AARP's Friendly Voices program. Onofrio-Collier said her goal is for each person she calls \"to feel uplifted, to feel good.\"\n\nLike the Plano program, the volunteers for the Friendly Voices program guide people to resources if they need help from local groups for things like getting groceries -- AARP's Community Connections site lists groups across the U.S. offering help -- but the main point is conversation.\n\nOnofrio-Collier said some people she has called live with a spouse, while others live alone.\n\nShe said conversations touch on everything from hobbies to vacations to happy memories.\n\nOnofrio-Collier bonded with one caller over a shared experience: \"We ended up talking about how ... when we were kids we loved to read so much that we would read under the covers with a flashlight.\"\n\n\"I get off the phone with a smile,\" Onofrio-Collier said.\n\nShe is among about 1,000 volunteers making the calls, according to Andy Miller, senior vice president of AARP Innovations Labs.\n\nMiller said some people want help with technology so they can stay connected with their grandchildren. One volunteer helped a woman figure out how to play online checkers with her grandchild.\n\n\"We're seeing a lot of that -- where people are just trying to stay connected to family in ways that they probably didn't do before,\" Miller said.\n\nOlder adults are among those who are particularly vulnerable to severe illness and death from the coronavirus that causes COVID-19. That's why health officials are encouraging people over 65 to stay home even as some states loosen restrictions put in place because of the pandemic. For most people, the virus causes mild or moderate symptoms, and the vast majority recover within a few weeks.\n\n\"Some seniors may be the last ones out because of the vulnerability,\" Miller said.\n\nKaplan, who retired 11 years ago after more than two decades managing Plano's senior center, said she and Ryckman didn't know each other, but found common ground in talking about the city and dealing with isolating at home.\n\nRyckman said the calls have been \"a gift\" for her.\n\nKaplan said that when she feels it's safe for her to venture to places other than the grocery store, she plans to visit the library and meet Ryckman in person.",

    "Know the risks: Where you are most likely to get coronavirus": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "Recommendations on how to protect ourselves from contracting the virus that causes COVID-19 are everywhere, like washing your hands, wearing a mask, and staying at least 6 feet away from people outside your home. But not all risks are created equal; home, public transportation and the grocery store all have different challenges.\n\nA blog post by University of Massachusetts Dartmouth professor, Dr. Erin Bromage, who studies immunity of infectious diseases in animals, titled \"The Risks - Know Them - Avoid Them\" garnered major attention for showing that some of the highest risk areas may not be what you'd expect.\n\nA lot of attention is being spent on opening up the economy, but it seems like the highest risk is more likely your own living room.\n\nThe data suggests that most people will get infected in their home, according to Bromage.\n\nTune into ABC at 1 p.m. ET and ABC News Live at 4 p.m. ET every weekday for special coverage of the novel coronavirus with the full ABC News team, including the latest news, context and analysis.\n\nSo where are the highest risk areas in the community for getting infected?\n\n\"The general theme of what I can see is, lots of people together in an enclosed environment with poor airflow and usually some sort of talking or singing involved leads to lots of people in that environment getting infected,\" said Bromage, in an interview with ABC News.\n\nCase studies that traced back COVID-19 outbreaks at the beginning of the pandemic, have found that the main sources of infections in the community lead back to the workplace, public transportation, social gatherings, and restaurants -- indoor environments, with limited air circulation, and many people spending a prolonged period of time in the same place.\n\nSome of the biggest outbreaks, excluding nursing homes, in fact, that have been reported and traced occurred in prisons, religious ceremonies, choir practices, indoor sporting events, and even birthday parties.\n\n\"You've got a lot of people in an enclosed space with lots of huffing, puffing, or yelling, which just led to large outbreak events,\" Bromage said.\n\nBeing exposed to the virus does not automatically mean you will be infected. A successful infection is dependent on the time exposed to the virus and the amount of viral particles you are exposed to. For example, \"While joggers may be releasing more virus due to deep breathing, remember the exposure time is also less due to their speed,\" Bromage writes.\n\nScientists call the amount of exposure to the virus that leads to infection the \"infectious dose.\" Although scientists are still learning more about how many viral particles lead to infection, they do know that sneezing and coughing release the highest amount of viral material into the air, and you're more likely to become infected if you're in a confined space.\n\nA single sneeze, according to Bromage, has been estimated to release about 30,000 droplets that can travel up to 200 miles per hour, which means it could easily cross a room. A cough releases round 3,000 droplets that can travel around 50 miles per hour. These particles may drop to the ground or could hang around in the air for a short period of time.\n\nIn fact, a recently published study showed that speaking loudly in an enclosed space creates \"substantial\" risk of transmitting the virus to others. Prolonged contact and lots of direct talking, breathing, and yelling between individuals increases the direct exposure to viral particles, which increases the likelihood for infection.\n\nThe amount of virus a person release changes over the course of the infection and varies by person. This is dependent on the infected persons' viral load, which is the amount of the virus detected in a test sample from a patient and reflects how well the virus is replicating.\n\nMany people are asymptomatic and may easily spread the virus, unknowingly, by directly talking, singing, yelling, or even breathing around other people in close contact. This is why the CDC advises that everyone wear face coverings in public.\n\nBromage underscores that the exact number of people infected by respiratory droplets versus transmission through touching contaminated objects like door handles and elevator buttons is unknown, which is why it's also important to wash your hands often and avoid touching your face. But the compilation of studies he wrote, \"serves to highlight that being in an enclosed space, sharing the same air for a prolonged period increases your chances of exposure and infection.\"\n\nIn very high-risk situations, social distancing guidelines are not as effective because even if you are far away from an infected individual in a small, poorly ventilated enclosed space for a long period of time, a low dose of the virus in the air can reach you and over a sustained period of time may be enough to cause infection.\n\nBromage said that the activities many typically view as highest risk for infection like grocery shopping might not be as risky if you're spending a brief amount of time at the store, you're avoiding other shoppers, not speaking directly with people, and the store restricts the number of people that can enter at a given time.\n\nPublic bathrooms may also pose a risk, but for slightly different reasons, said Bromage. Bathrooms have a lot of high touch surfaces like door handles, faucets, and countertops.\n\nSo far, the science seems to suggest that outdoor areas and large ventilated spaces are the lowest risk areas for infection. Outdoor areas are generally safer because wind and infinite air space could dilute the viral particles circulating. If you are actively moving outside that also reduces the exposure time to any viral particles hanging around.\n\nWith restrictions lifted in some states, many Americans will face a new challenge: \"Just because something is open doesn't mean it is an instruction to go,\" said Dr. Andrew Noymer, associate professor of population health at UC Irvine.\n\nBefore you put yourself in a high-risk situation, Bromage suggests asking yourself, \"Are there too many people here and how much time have they spent here? Are there loud talkers? Singing or yelling? What's the amount of people in my area that actually are infected?\" If you are in an environment with a lot of people, you should also assess what changes the business owner put in place to lower the risk of virus spreading.\n\nIf you choose to meet other people, you should also consider their level of exposure and health status. Ask your friends or family where they have been, how often they go to the store and whether they have been staying home, suggests Dr. Henry Raymond, epidemiologist and associate professor at Rutgers University.\n\n\"It's not just about your health but about the health of those people around you,\" Raymond said.\n\nIf you know your friend or relative has underlying health conditions or is at an increased risk of developing severe symptoms due to a weaker immune system you should take extra precautions to avoid exposing them to the virus. If your state permits social gatherings and you decide to meet up, keep it to a small group and make it safe as possible by staying outside, Raymond said. Agree on some ground rules, such as: \"We don't shake hands, we bring our own food, we space the chair out at least 6 feet away.\"\n\n\"The best course of action is to be personally cautious and personally responsible. We don't have a vaccine. But we do have social distancing and masks,\" said Raymond.",

        "body": "MOSCOW -- Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Wednesday that he has been diagnosed with double pneumonia caused by the coronavirus and that he hadn't met in person with Russian President Vladimir Putin for a month.\n\nIn an interview with Russian business newspaper Kommersant, Peskov said that after he tested positive for the virus his only sign of illness initially was a small fever. He told the paper he remained at home for several days until a CT scan showed infections in both of his lungs.\n\nPeskov, 52, a key aide of Putin's, revealed Tuesday that he was hospitalized with the virus but didn't give details about his condition. His wife, Olympic ice dancing champion Tatyana Navka, also was infected and said she felt OK.\n\nHe said in the interview that after he tested positive, the absence of symptoms beyond the fever gave him a false feeling of security, but then his condition worsened and he went to a hospital.\n\n\"They caught it just in time,\" Peskov said. \"The essential thing isn't to miss the moment, this virus is very bloodthirsty.\"\n\nHe said he had followed all recommended precautions to avoid infection, noting that people were wearing protective gear inside the Kremlin, work documents were getting sprayed with disinfectant and in-person meetings were few.\n\nPeskov was the fourth senior Russian official to test positive for the virus. Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin announced on April 30 that he was infected. Construction Minister Vladimir Yakushev and Culture Minister Olga Lyubimova subsequently tested positive as well.\n\nIt wasn't clear when those officials last met with Putin, who has limited public appearances and held most of his meetings online during the virus pandemic.\n\nPeskov said he and Mishustin discussed their their health on the phone, adding that the prime minister was recovering and already in \"working condition.\"\n\nHe said that prior to getting infected he had undergone tests on practically daily basis. \"I had a feeling I was keeping things under control,\" he said.\n\nWith over 242,000 reported cases, Russia now ranks second in the world after the United States in total confirmed infections. Russia also has reported 2,212 virus-related deaths.\n\nPutin on Monday lifted a partial economic shutdown imposed in late March to stem the outbreak, saying it has helped slow down contagion and prevented the nation's health care system from being overwhelmed. He allowed the regions to reopen industrial plants, construction sites and other businesses depending on the situation in each of Russia's 85 provinces.\n\nSome questioned the wisdom of lifting the restrictions, pointing that Russia is yet to see a peak of contagion and raising doubts about the ability of the underfunded health care system to cope with the situation if the number of infections rise from some a daily level of 10,000-11,000 new cases reported over the past week.",

        "authors": [],
        "body": "CINCINNATI, Ohio -- Just days after announcing it would end hazard \"hero\" pay to front-line workers, Kroger says it will give them extra \"thank you\" bonuses, the Cincinnati Enquirer reports.\n\nThe move comes after an outcry from the grocery store's union, the United Food and Commercial Workers International, which said workers are still risking their lives by coming to work.\n\nThe bonus is $400 for full-time workers and $200 for part-time workers to be paid out in two installments on May 30 and June 18, Kroger announced Friday. Hazard pay was a $2-per-hour supplement.\n\nUFCW Local 75 president Kevin Garvey said the union will continue to pressure the company to provide bonus pay for as long as the pandemic goes on.\n\n\"COVID-19 is not going away soon,\" he said. \"Our members still have to work in the same conditions and deal with the same pressures. They are worth every penny of the $2.00 premium and the (latest) bonus.\"\n\nThe Cincinnati-based company did not address the dispute with its union in its announcement. The grocer estimates the new bonus will provide $130 million to its workers.\n\n\"Our associates have been instrumental in feeding America while also helping to flatten the curve during the initial phases of the pandemic. To recognize and thank our associates for their incredible work during this historic time, we offered special pay in March, April and May,\" said CEO Rodney McMullen, in a statement.\n\nNationwide, UFCW International estimates that at least 65 grocery workers have died at Kroger and other retailers after contracting the coronavirus.\n\nAlso on Friday, UFCW International called on 49 major grocery companies, including at Walmart, Trader Joe's, Whole Foods, Costco and Sam's Club, to extend hazard pay for their workers.\n\nIn his letter, Perrone challenged the companies' executives to publicly state they think the dangers of COVID-19 have passed if they chose to stop hazard pay.\n\nFor most people, the new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms that clear up within weeks. For some, especially older adults and those with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness and be life-threatening.\n\n-- -\n\nFollow AP coverage of the virus outbreak at https://apnews.com/VirusOutbreak and https://apnews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak",

        "authors": [],
        "body": "CHICAGO -- Staff at dozens of Illinois nursing homes called off a strike set to begin Friday after the workers' union reached a tentative deal with nursing home owners that union officials said would help safeguard both staff and residents during the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nLeaders of the Service Employees International Union, which represents more than 10,000 workers at 100 nursing homes, most in the Chicago area, said in a statement Thursday morning that the planned strike had been averted after they reached a two-year tentative contract with nursing home owners. They said the deal would protect workers and residents \"during this time of unprecedented vulnerability and risk.\"\n\nThe union said the tentative agreement was overwhelmingly supported by members of its bargaining committee, but still must be ratified by the larger group of union members.\n\nUnion leaders have said that the pandemic revealed long-standing issues including low wages, short staffing and lack of adequate supplies inside nursing homes.\n\nNursing homes are among the most dangerous climates despite efforts to prevent the virus' spread by shutting down visits and screening employees for signs of infections.\n\nMore than 20,000 deaths have been reported in nursing homes and long-term care facilities across the U.S. according to a tally based on state health departments and media reports kept by The Associated Press.\n\nThe union said the tentative deal includes higher baseline wages that will bring all workers above $15 an hour, hazard pay for all workers for the duration of the pandemic, and additional fully paid sick days for COVID-19-related testing, illness or quarantine for the duration of the health crisis.\n\nThe agreement also includes provisions ensuring that employees are not required to work without adequate personal protective equipment as determined by regulatory agencies.\n\n\"All of the major contract gains will help safeguard the health and safety of workers and the residents for which they care -- at a time when both are vulnerable to the risks associated with COVID-19,\" the union said in its statement.\n\nThe union's existing contract with home owners expired at the end of April. The two sides were at odds over sick pay, added bonus pay during the pandemic and higher wages overall for certified nursing assistants and support staff whose duties include food service, activities, laundry and housekeeping.\n\nStaff at 44 Illinois nursing homes were set to begin a strike Friday that workers at another 20 Illinois facilities were also expected to join. Nearly all of the homes are in Chicago or the surrounding suburbs.\n\nFor most people, the coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia, or death.\n\nIllinois in April began releasing state data on nursing home cases and deaths linked to the virus. According to the latest totals, more than 1,000 deaths have been linked to long-term care facilities in the state.",

    "Lawsuit on behalf of Missouri meat plant workers dismissed": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "O'FALLON, Mo. -- A federal judge dismissed a lawsuit filed on behalf of employees at a rural Missouri meatpacking facility, ruling that oversight of how the plant adheres to guidance aimed at slowing the spread of the coronavirus falls to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, not the courts.\n\nU.S. District Judge Greg Kays issued his 24-page ruling Tuesday in favor of Smithfield Foods. A lawsuit on behalf of workers at Smithfield's pork processing plant in Milan, Missouri, sought an injunction requiring the plant to abide by federal guidelines. The lawsuit accused Virginia-based Smithfield of not doing enough to protect workers from the coronavirus.\n\n\"Plaintiffs are naturally concerned for their health and the health of their community in these unprecedented times,\" Kays wrote. \"The Court takes their concern seriously. Nevertheless, the Court cannot ignore the USDA's and OSHA's authority over compliance ... or the significant steps Smithfield has taken to reduce the risk of a COVID-19 outbreak at the Plant.\"\n\nThe attorney for the workers, David Muraskin, didn't rule out an appeal but said the lawsuit itself prompted several changes at the plant, including better spacing of employees, additional cleaning and sanitizing, and an improved sick leave policy that means workers don't feel obligated to come to work if they have symptoms of the coronavirus.\n\n\"This worker power is starting to be effective,\" Muraskin said Wednesday. \"Workers will organize and they will protest and when necessary they will sue to protect themselves because these companies need to be held to account.\"\n\nEmail messages seeking comment from Smithfield were not immediately returned.\n\nThe Milan plant has not seen an outbreak of COVID-19. Just one case has been reported in Sullivan County, where the plant is located.\n\nBut outbreaks have become common at other meat plants across the U.S., infecting thousands of workers, leading to the closure of some plants and prompting meat shortages.\n\nPresident Donald Trump issued an executive order last week requiring meatpacking plants to stay open. The order was widely seen as giving processors protection from liability for workers who become sick on the job, and it came after the Missouri lawsuit against Smithfield Foods.\n\nU.S. Department of Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue said Wednesday that since Trump's order, the USDA has worked with OSHA and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to ensure that meat plants are abiding by federal guidelines.\n\n\"This ruling is directly in line with what the Federal government has been calling for companies and communities to do in light of the President's Executive Order. If we continue to work together, we can maintain the critical supply of meat and poultry for Americans while also protecting worker health and safety,\" Perdue said in a statement.",

        "authors": [],
        "body": "BEIRUT -- Lebanese rushed to food stores to stock up on vegetables and basic items, hours before the government was to reinstate a four-day nationwide lockdown on Wednesday, following a spike in reported coronavirus cases.\n\nThe government called on the public to stay home, starting Wednesday evening and until dawn on Monday, reversing measures earlier this month that phased out restrictions imposed since mid-March.\n\nThe new shutdown is a rare reversal and comes as many countries, seeking to balance economic and health care needs, have started easing restrictions despite grave concerns of a setback.\n\nRestaurants will close down after they partially opened 10 days ago, and food deliveries will be halted altogether. The country's top Sunni Muslim cleric announced that communal Friday prayers in mosques will also be halted, only a week after they were allowed to resume at limited capacity.\n\nThe public health crisis comes at a particularly turbulent period for Lebanon. The country is facing an unprecedented economic and financial crisis, putting pressure on a population that is seeing its savings erode. The currency, pegged at a fixed rate to the dollar since 1997, has lost 60% of its value in a few weeks.\n\nUnemployment had been rising even before the coronavirus restrictions as economic growth and investment dropped. Officials say 45% of the population now lives in poverty. The government has asked the International Monetary Fund for financial assistance, and talks over the rescue plan are due to begin with the IMF later Wednesday.\n\nLebanon began a phased-out plan to relax a national lockdown late last month that allowed small businesses to reopen, and shortened a nighttime curfew.\n\nBut after a few days of single-digit cases detected, there was a spike in reported infections this week, including among Lebanese returning home during repatriation programs who did not observe quarantine measures.\n\nLebanon, a country of just over 5 million, has so far been able to contain the virus, recording only 870 infections, including 117 repatriated Lebanese, and 26 deaths after imposing early lockdown measures and strictly implementing restriction on movement.\n\nBut over the last few days, government and health officials criticized carelessness and lax implementation of social distancing and other restrictions among the public, warning that the relaxation of restrictions would be reconsidered.\n\nMeanwhile, Saudi Arabia said Wednesday it will go into a full lockdown during the days of celebration that follow the Muslim holy fasting month of Ramadan.\n\nThe Interior Ministry said the lockdown would be in effect from May 23 through May 27 -- days mark the Eid al-Fitr holiday that comes at the end of Ramadan. That holiday typically sees families invite loved ones over for meals and go out to eat and drink during the day.\n\nAnd the United Arab Emirates, a federation of seven sheikhdoms, said it will offer free coronavirus testing for all citizens, beginning next week. Foreigners in the country with coronavirus symptoms, pregnant women, those over 50 and those in contact with those who fell ill with COVID-19 also will be among those able to be tested for free.\n\nPrivate beaches at hotels also are beginning to reopen in Dubai, even as the number of confirmed cases and deaths continue to rise in the country.\n\nIn Tehran, mosques temporarily reopened Tuesday night after about two months closure, for a special night of prayers in Ramadan.\n\nA mosque at Tehran university campus in central Tehran hosted worshippers for the \"Qadr,\" or ''Night of Destiny,\" a special night of prayers in the Muslim holy month.\n\nOfficials in Iran had closed down all mosques and holy sites across the country in mid-March, at the height of the coronavirus outbreak, to lower the risk of the contagion. The virus has killed more than 6,700 people and infected more than 110,000 people in Iran so far.\n\n\"Obviously, everyone is feeling great tonight. It has been a tough time especially for mosque-goers and those who love praying, \" said Reza Abbasi, a worshipper who was praying along with his family on the campus of Tehran university.\n\nUpon entering the campus, a group of medical students disinfected hands and shoes of worshippers and gave away face masks. Worshippers also had their body temperatures taken by infrared thermometers. Spots were marked on the mosque floor for worshippers to sit down while practicing proper physical distancing.\n\nAssociated Press writer Zeina Karam in Beirut; Jon Gambrell in Dubai, the United Arab Emirates; Mohammad Nasiri and Mohsen Ganji in Tehran, Iran, contributed to this report.",

        "authors": [],
        "body": "LOS ANGELES -- The legal drama \"All Rise\" has become the first U.S. scripted television series to adapt the the pandemic by producing an episode remotely, enlisting its stars to work from home on their own makeup, set design and lighting.\n\nThe season finale, airing Monday night on CBS, finds Simone Missick's Judge Lola Carmichael presiding over a Los Angeles Superior Court bench trial via video conference.\n\nMissick said she was exhausted at the end of each shooting day after making her own adjustments to costume and sound, converting her living room into an office and her dining room into a court room.\n\n\"I did pick up new skills. I think that I could be a location scout-slash-set design coordinator. I don't need to lead the department, but I could be in the background,\" Missick laughed in a Zoom interview. \"So if this acting stuff doesn't work out, I could maybe pick up a career doing it virtually because that was the fun part.\"\n\nWhile most full-season shows cut production short due to stay-home orders, \"All Rise\" creator Greg Spottiswood said he realized that the dialogue-heavy nature of his show allowed for remote production. A key challenge -- predicting how the legal world would adjust to the novel coronavirus, with prisons becoming outbreak hotspots and video chats replacing in-court hearings.\n\n\"The justice system needs to find a way to respond to this moment. Technology is one of the ways that they're responding to it,\" he said.\n\nSpottiswood said producers paid the full crew, even those that weren't able to work, for the episode. While the show could produce more episodes remotely in a second season if necessary, he's anxious to get back to sets and real-world locations.\n\nMissick said her mother-in-law in Atlanta had been hospitalized with COVID-19 for eight days, with symptoms serious enough to require a ventilator. She had fully recovered by the time Missick began shooting, but it brought the coronavirus crisis close to home for the 38-year-old actress.\n\nIn her downtime after production, Missick has enjoyed Hulu's \"Little Fires Everywhere\" and the Netflix series \"Unorthodox.\" But she's been struck by how far away from today's reality the action on the screen can feel.\n\n\"Everything is BC. It's 'before coronavirus.' You're watching people -- they're in restaurants, they're hugging each other. You're like, 'God, I remember what that was like.'

        "body": "TEL AVIV, Israel -- With the Nazis murdering Jews and ransacking their property outside on the infamous nights of Kristallnacht in 1938, 13-year-old David Toren sat in the sunroom of his wealthy great-uncle in Germany admiring a favorite painting depicting two men on horseback on a beach.\n\nWithin a year, Toren would be smuggled out in one of the final Kindertransports, a series of rescues for Jewish children organized by several European countries. Left behind, his family would perish in the death camps and their vast art collection would be seized by Nazis and later traded by unscrupulous dealers.\n\nToren would serve in the Israeli pre-state militia before moving to America with less than $100 to his name. He went on to build a successful law practice with an office on the 54th floor of the World Trade Center. Many of the early-life possessions he kept there were destroyed in the 9/11 attacks, carried out before he arrived to work that day.\n\nBut even as a degenerative eye condition robbed him of his sight later in life, the images of his past never escaped him, and he embarked on a quest to reclaim some of what was lost. He sued the government of Germany for his great-uncle's collection and in 2015, after a lengthy saga, recovered the Max Liebermann work \"Two Riders on the Beach\" that so moved him in his youth.\n\n\"He regarded it as justice and felt very strongly about it,\" said his son, Peter Toren. \"The art is something that was taken from his family and it was something there was a possibility of getting back. He couldn't get back all the lives that were exterminated.\"\n\nToren died on April 19 in his Manhattan home from symptoms of the coronavirus. He was 94. He left behind his son Peter and two grandchildren.\n\n-- -- -- --\n\nEDITOR'S NOTE: This is part of an ongoing series of stories remembering people who have died from coronavirus around the world.\n\n-- -- -- --\n\nBorn Klaus-Gunther Tarnowski in Breslau, now part of Poland, Toren and his family at first seemed immune to the rise of the Nazis. His father, a decorated World War I veteran, was a prominent lawyer who was allowed to practice even after the Nazis forbade most Jews from doing so and he published poetry and wrote plays that were performed at local theaters.\n\nBut eventually he too was taken away to a concentration camp and came back three weeks later \"a broken man,\" according to Peter Toren. He and his wife eventually died in Auschwitz.\n\nToren's great-uncle, the wealthy Jewish industrialist and art collector David Friedmann, was forced to flee and the Nazis pillaged his extensive collection. Many of the works ended up in the hands of Hildebrand Gurlitt, a notorious German art dealer who traded in what the Nazis called \"degenerate art\" -- works deemed inferior because they were un-German, Jewish or Communist or, as is the case with Impressionist and other Modernist works, did not employ traditionally realistic forms. Still, they were happy to sell the works to help fund their war machine.\n\nMuch of Gurlitt's collection remained unseen for decades and experts feared they had been lost or destroyed. But a vast horde resurfaced by surprise in 2012 when German authorities raided a Munich apartment belonging to his son Cornelius while investigating him for tax evasion. Paintings by artists including Claude Monet, Pierre-Auguste Renoir and Henri Matisse were discovered.\n\nThe reclusive Cornelius Gurlitt, who said he had inherited much of the art from his father, kept more than 1,200 works in his Munich apartment and 250 more in Salzburg, Austria. The discovery brought renewed attention to the many unresolved cases of looted art that was never returned to original Jewish owners or their descendants. Cornelius Gurlitt died in 2014 at age 81, designating Switzerland's Kunstmuseum Bern as the sole heir to a collection worth billions of dollars.\n\nFriedmann's daughter Charlotte died in Auschwitz, leaving Toren as the only descendant to stake a claim. After reclaiming \"Two Riders on the Beach,\" Toren tracked down another piece that had oddly made its way to Israel. After a lengthy negotiation he got back \"Basket Weavers\" as well, an Impressionist work depicting five boys weaving baskets out of straw.\n\nPeter Toren said his father spent his final years pursuing the art collection and further efforts were ongoing to acquire more than 50 documented antiques seized from Friedmann's collection.\n\nDespite his background, Toren had no problem using his language skills to cultivate German clients in New York, even those with Nazi connections. As a patent attorney, he once represented a Bavarian farm machinery company with ties to the infamous Nazi doctor Josef Mengele.\n\n\"I asked my father how he could deal with Nazi clients and he told me that if he didn't do the work someone else would,\" Peter Toren said, before adding. \"And he charged such clients an unofficial 25% Nazi surcharge.\"\n\nToren's grandson, Ben, said his grandfather pursued the art collection in retirement with the same \"unsentimental\" focus and tenacity as he did in his law career.\n\n\"The artwork thing gave him a new lease on life,\" he said. \"He very strongly felt that these paintings were his paintings and it gave him a lot of purpose.\"\n\n\"But he never presented himself as being any kind of victim and he never asked for any pity,\" he quickly added. \"He was always fairly stoic in his demeanor, in how he carried himself. His life experience required of him to have a rock-solid exterior. That's how he presented himself to the world.\"\n\n-- -- -- --\n\nFollow Aron Heller at www.twitter.com/aronhellerap",

    "Los Angeles offers virus tests to all, still has unused kits": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "LOS ANGELES -- With ample coronavirus tests and not enough sick people seeking them, the mayor of Los Angeles recently did something on a scale no other major U.S. city had done -- allow anyone with or without symptoms to be tested as often as they want.\n\nA website to book a test was quickly swamped by residents in the nation's second-largest city and the surrounding county who couldn't get tested under more stringent guidelines and were concerned they were infected or could be asymptomatic carriers unwittingly exposing others.\n\nBut despite overbooking to compensate for a third of the people who didn't show up, the city still has thousands of tests that aren't being used each week, according to figures provided to The Associated Press by the mayor's office.\n\n\"Wasted tests at a time when we still have insufficient testing is really unfortunate,\" said Dr. Eric Topol, head of the Scripps Research Translational Institute, a San Diego-based medical research partnership. \"I applaud what they're doing. The more people tested the better.\"\n\nMayor Eric Garcetti's vow to not let a test go to waste was the result of a partnership with a start-up company that developed an easy-to-administer test that doesn't rely on scarce supplies. But it was a significant departure from stricter state criteria and guidelines set by the health department the city shares with the county to limit tests to those who need them most.\n\nIt comes at a time when expanded testing is a cornerstone of the state's plan to ease its stay-at-home order and as Los Angeles County has become the epicenter of the virus outbreak and lags progress the rest of the state has shown.\n\nWhile the virus was initially worse in Northern California, LA County, home to a quarter of the state's nearly 40 million residents, now accounts for more than half the state's deaths and a case count growing more rapidly than other major state counties. A large nursing home population, accounting for about half the county's deaths, and densely housed poor people are two main reasons.\n\nWhen Garcetti opened up testing April 30, the county at large had relaxed some guidelines on who could get a test, with priorities going to the sickest and most vulnerable. It allowed testing some people without symptoms, including health care workers and emergency personnel most at risk of exposure.\n\nFrom a public health perspective, wider testing could help determine the disease prevalence, though that would require random sampling, not people seeking to be tested, said Karin Michels, an epidemiology professor at the University of California, Los Angeles. And testing asymptomatic people comes at the expense of those who can't get a test.\n\n\"In a perfect world, you want to test the whole state, you want to test the whole country,\" Michels said. \"We don't have enough test kits for everybody right now.\"\n\nAs the mayor removed limits on who could get tested, appointments filled up.\n\n\"I was stunned,\" said Sarah Wolf, who reserved a slot online after receiving a text alert. \"There are people on the East Coast I know who can't get tested.\"\n\nLos Angeles was not the first big city to offer free tests for everyone. Houston had done so nearly two weeks earlier but on a much smaller scale of 500 to 1,000 tests a day.\n\nLA has paid $137 per test to Curative-Korva, a start-up run by Fred Turner, a 25-year-old British wunderkind. The firm was making sepsis tests when a worker there thought he was infected with coronavirus, couldn't get a test and devised one to collect a specimen by swabbing the inside of the mouth after coughing, spokesman Kyle Arteaga said.\n\nThe test got emergency approval from the Food and Drug Administration.\n\nLos Angeles has 75,000 tests available each week to use mainly at eight drive-thru sites open six days a week, though it also tests at homeless shelters, nursing homes and recreation centers. It has conducted a weekly average of close to 57,000 tests in the two weeks since the mayor expanded testing.\n\nThe test is self-administered in cars and samples are dropped in a collection bucket, removing the need for a healthcare worker to collect the specimen and change gloves, masks and other protective clothing -- all of which have been in short supply -- with each test. It also uses a widely available swab, not the scarcely available long nasal swabs that have led to test shortages.\n\nThe Curative test, which is being used by the U.S. Air Force and sold to the states of Alaska and Florida, is one of several newer tests gaining attention. A saliva test developed by Rutgers University was given emergency FDA approval May 8 for home use.\n\nAnne Wyllie, a Yale University researcher who found in a preliminary study that testing for the presence of the virus in saliva was more effective than deep nasal swab specimens, said the Curative method looked promising because it captures sputum from the lungs, along with saliva and cellular material in the mouth.\n\n\"It's like they're covering all their bases. If the virus is present somewhere, they are improving their chances of capturing where that is and detecting it,\" Wyllie said. \"It's hard to mess up spitting into a tube really, or swiping the inside of your mouth.\"\n\nThe day after Garcetti made his announcement, testing tripled to nearly 10,000 in Los Angeles, he said.\n\nIn the first nine days after everybody was offered a test, sites averaged 8,900 tests a day, Garcetti's office said. Testing increased in the past week, bringing the daily average above 9,500, which is below the 10,000 tests Curative-Korva can process daily.\n\n\"It's just limited by the demand,\" said Dr. Jeffrey Klausner, a UCLA professor who is medical director for Curative-Korva. \"Demand limitations on how many can go to a testing site. How many people can go through a testing site in an hour.\"\n\nFor most people, the coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia, and death.\n\nWolf did not have a cough, fever or other signs of coronavirus, but after reading about people without symptoms spreading the virus, decided to get tested because it was available and free.\n\nShe drove from her Hollywood home to a drive-thru clinic at the Crenshaw Christian Center in South LA and waited in a line of cars that slowly snaked forward.\n\nIt took about an hour to arrive at the point where she was handed a test kit in a biohazard bag. She closed the windows of her Mercedes, opened the kit, coughed hard a few times, swabbed deep in her mouth for about 30 seconds and put the swab in a test tube. She then drove forward, rolled down her window and dropped the sample in a collection bucket.\n\nThe results arrived three days later. She was negative, which is what she suspected. But it was a relief.\n\n\"You just don't know how many people have gotten it and haven't had any symptoms,\" Wolf said. \"I would hate it if I was doing an errand and passed it on if I had it and didn't know it.\"",

        "authors": [],
        "body": "MALE, Maldives -- The Maldives, an Indian Ocean archipelago nation with one of the world's most congested capitals, has seen a rapid rise in coronavirus cases over the past few weeks.\n\nHealth officials predict that more than 77,000 people -- or a fourth of those currently living in the country -- could become infected, with more than 5,000 possibly needing intensive care treatment.\n\nOfficial figures updated Saturday showed 766 cases, including 743 that are still active. A vast majority of the patients are residents of Male, the capital. Three people have died so far.\n\nThe Maldives, known for its luxury tourist resorts, reported its first case of COVID-19 in March, and until mid-April appeared to have contained the virus within the isolated resort islands that had been converted into quarantine centers.\n\nMale is highly congested, housing more than 150,000 people in a 5.8-square-kilometer (2.3-square-mile) area. The government had taken precautions to stop the virus from entering the capital by suspending on-arrival visas and screening people entering through airports and arriving from other islands.\n\nBut a patient in Male whose source of infection has not yet been identified triggered an explosion in the number of cases. Six inhabited islands, including Male, are now under lockdown.\n\n\"The main hurdle at the moment is the rapid spread of the disease among expatriate migrant workers living in congested accommodation. Many are undocumented, do not report symptoms or are asymptomatic,\" said Mohamed Mabrook Azeez, spokesman for the National Emergency Operations Center.\n\n\"Physical distancing measures is logistically difficult in place like Male in any situation,\" he said.\n\nThere are about 60,000 migrant workers, mostly from Bangladesh, working as unskilled laborers in Male, according to Azeez. They also serve as the primary source of couriers to deliver essentials.\n\nTheir congested living quarters have been a cause for the rapid spread of the virus, with at least 416 Bangladeshi migrants testing positive, Azeez said. The government plans to relocate some 3,000 Bangladeshi nationals to other islands in the Maldives to enable social distancing, he said. It also plans to repatriate 1,500 unregistered Bangladeshi workers.\n\nNima Hassan, a Male resident, was in self-isolation with a fever awaiting test results at her home.\n\n\"Even with a mild fever, it got you overthinking. Did I get the disease? Was it the delivery man who dropped by the other day? Were we not careful enough?\" she said. \"Are we not safe inside our four walls?\"",

        "body": "DUBLIN, Calif. -- A man facing a second trial after a fire killed 36 partygoers at a San Francisco Bay Area warehouse he's accused of illegally converting into a cluttered artists enclave was released from jail Monday over coronavirus concerns.\n\nDerick Almena, who's been behind bars since 2017, was released after a court hearing by phone, the Alameda County sheriff's office said. He will be under electronic monitoring while he waits for a new trial.\n\nThe 50-year-old is charged with involuntary manslaughter in the Dec. 2, 2016, fire that swept through an electronic music party at the so-called Ghost Ship warehouse in Oakland. Prosecutors allege Almena, who was the master tenant on the lease, was criminally negligent when he turned the industrial building into a residence for artists and held events without proper permits.\n\nThe building was packed with furniture, extension cords and other flammable material but had only two exits and no smoke detectors, fire alarms or sprinklers, prosecutors say.\n\nA jury deadlocked on the charges in September and a new trial has been scheduled for July. His co-defendant, Max Harris, was acquitted of the same charges.\n\nAt least 35 confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been reported at the Santa Rita Jail where Almena was held. According to his attorneys, a report by jail medical staff said Almena's psychological and physical health were in jeopardy.\n\nAlmena was released in the rural community of Upper Lake, where his wife and children live. He is banned from contacting relatives of victims or witnesses. He can't leave home unless a court gives written approval, and any violation can send him back to jail, the Mercury News reported.\n\nAlmena posted $150,000 bail last month, and officials verified where he is staying Monday, the last step for his release, the newspaper reported.\n\nJails and prisons in California and across the U.S. have released inmates in response to the pandemic, with crowded quarters and a lack of protective equipment making it ripe for the virus to spread behind bars.\n\nFor most people, the coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia and death. The vast majority of people recover.",

        "body": "PARIS -- For Amirouche Hammar, it started with a phone call from a doctor at his local hospital in a Paris suburb. \"When he told me the news that I'm positive with COVID-19, frankly it shocked me a little,\" Hammar told ABC News. The 43-year-old found out ten days ago that he was infected with the virus back in December, over a month before the first cases were recorded in Europe.\n\nFrance, where more than 25,000 people have died from COVID-19 since March 1, confirmed its first three cases on January 24.\n\nBut Professor Yves Cohen, the head of the intensive care unit at a Paris suburban hospital, made a surprising discovery when his team checked old test samples of patients with pneumonia in December and January. Out of 24 patients, one patient's sample from Dec. 27 twice tested positive for COVID-19 -- Amirouche Hammar's.\n\n\"Frankly, I never suspected it. Even my family, loved ones said to me, 'I think [COVID's] what you got'. But the disease had just started in China ... For me it was a local disease, in a region in China,\" he said.\n\nAmirouche Hammar recalled the days before his hospitalization and described symptoms which are now familiar: dry cough, fever, fatigue and severe breathing difficulties. He first thought it was the flu but after feeling chest pains like \"an electric shock,\" he went to the hospital.\n\nAt the hospital, the diagnosis was clear: a lung infection. His situation deteriorated quickly and doctors decided that he needed intensive care and placed him on oxygen.\n\nThe father of four had not traveled abroad before falling ill in December. The causes of his contamination remain hypothetical but Amirouche believes his wife might have infected him. \"Maybe it was me,\" said Fatiha Hammar. \"I'm the only one who works.\" Her husband, she said, only goes to school and shopping.\n\n\"I go to work so it is possible that I was in contact with the clients, perhaps,\" she said. Fatiha Hammar, who works as a fishmonger in a big shopping center, had also shown symptoms of fatigue a few days before her husband fell ill, but they had only lasted three days. After Amirouche, their two children, 10 and 5 years old, were hospitalized with the same symptoms. \"They had coughs, colds, and the eldest had a fever,\" said Amirouche.\n\nWorld Health Organization epidemiologist Maria Van Kerkhoven said in Geneva on Wednesday that it was \"possible that there could have been a case as early as December\" in France. The WHO urged countries to investigate any other early suspicious cases.\n\nThe family is doing well now and Amirouche feels grateful his life were spared. \"I've been miraculously saved from a disease that is wreaking havoc, it's a tidal wave,\" said Amirouche. But the household is under stress since Cohen's phone call gave them the news. \"As soon as I hear a cough, my heart is pounding,\" said Fatiha Hammar. \"We don't live normally with this disease anymore.\"",

        "body": "ROME -- As Italy prepares to emerge from the West's first and most extensive coronavirus lockdown, it is increasingly clear that something went terribly wrong in Lombardy, the hardest-hit region in Europe's hardest-hit country.\n\nItaly had the bad luck of being the first Western nation to be slammed by the outbreak, and its official total of 26,000 fatalities lags behind only the U.S. in the global death toll. Italy's first homegrown case was recorded Feb. 21, at a time when the World Health Organization was still insisting the virus was \"containable\" and not nearly as infectious as the flu.\n\nBut there is also evidence that demographics and health care deficiencies collided with political and business interests to expose the 10 million people in the northern Italian region of Lombardy to COVID-19 in ways unseen anywhere else, particularly the most vulnerable in nursing homes.\n\nVirologists and epidemiologists say what went wrong there will be studied for years, given how the outbreak overwhelmed a medical system long considered one of Europe's best, while in the neighboring Veneto region, the impact was significantly more controlled.\n\nProsecutors, meanwhile, are deciding whether to lay any criminal blame for the hundreds of dead in nursing homes, many of whom don't even figure into Lombardy's official death toll of 13,269, half of Italy's total.\n\nBy contrast, Lombardy's front-line doctors and nurses are being hailed as heroes for risking their lives to treat the sick under extraordinary levels of stress, exhaustion, isolation and fear. One WHO official said it was a \"miracle\" they saved as many as they did.\n\nHere's a look at the perfect storm of what went wrong in Lombardy, based on interviews and briefings with doctors, union representatives, mayors and virologists, as well as reports from Italy's Superior Institute of Health, national statistics agency ISTAT and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, which advises developed economies on policy.\n\nCAUGHT UNPREPARED\n\nItaly was the first European country to halt all air traffic with China on Jan. 31, and even put scanners in airports to check arrivals for fever. But by Jan. 31, it was already too late. Epidemiologists now say the virus had been circulating widely in Lombardy since early January, if not before.\n\nDoctors treating pneumonia in January and February didn't know it was the coronavirus, since the symptoms were so similar and the virus was still believed to be largely confined to China. Even after Italy registered its Feb. 21 case, doctors didn't understand the unusual way COVID-19 could present itself, with some patients experiencing a rapid decline in their ability to breathe.\n\n\"After a phase of stabilization, many deteriorated quickly. This was clinical information we didn't have,\" said Dr. Maurizio Marvisi, a pneumologist at a private clinic in hard-hit Cremona. \"There was practically nothing in the medical literature.\"\n\nBecause Lombardy's intensive care units were already filling up within days of Italy's first cases, many primary care physicians tried to treat and monitor patients at home. Some put them on supplemental oxygen, commonly used for home cases in Italy.\n\nThat strategy proved deadly, and many died at home or soon after hospitalization, having waited too long to call an ambulance.\n\nReliance on home care \"will probably be the determining factor of why we have such a high mortality rate in Italy,\" Marivi said.\n\nItaly was forced to use home care in part because of its low ICU capacity: After years of budget cuts, Italy entered the crisis with 8.6 ICU beds per 100,000 people, well below the OECD average of 15.9 and a fraction of Germany's 33.9, the group said.\n\nAs a result, primary care physicians became the front-line filter of virus patients, an army of mostly self-employed practitioners who work within the public health system but outside Italy's regional hospital network.\n\nSince only those with strong symptoms were being tested because Lombardy's labs couldn't process more, these family doctors didn't know if they themselves were infected, much less their patients.\n\nWith so little clinical information available, doctors also had no guidelines on when to admit patients or refer them to specialists. And being outside the hospital system, they didn't have the same access to protective masks and equipment.\n\n\"The region was extremely behind in giving us protective equipment and it was inadequate, because the first time, they gave us 10 surgical masks and gloves,\" said Dr. Laura Turetta in the city of Varese. \"Obviously for our close contact with patients, it wasn't the correct way to protect ourselves.\"\n\nThe Lombardy doctors' association issued a blistering letter April 7 to regional authorities listing seven \"errors\" in their handling of the crisis, key among them the lack of testing for medical personnel, the lack of protective equipment and the lack of data about the contagion.\n\nThe regional government and civil protection agency defended their efforts, but acknowledged that Italy was dependent on imports and donations of protective equipment and simply didn't have enough to go around.\n\nSome 20,000 Italian medical personnel have been infected and 150 doctors have died.\n\nLOST WEEKS\n\nTwo days after registering Italy's first case in the Lombardy province of Lodi, sparking a quarantine in 10 towns, another positive case was registered more than an hour's drive away in Alzano in Bergamo province. Whereas the emergency room of the Lodi-area hospital was closed, the Alzano ER reopened after a few hours of cleaning, becoming a main source of contagion.\n\nInternal documents cited by Italian newspapers indicate the handful of serious pneumonia cases the Alzano hospital saw as early as Feb. 12 were likely COVID-19. At the time, Italy's health ministry recommended tests only for people who had been to China or been in contact with a suspected or confirmed positive case.\n\nBy March 2, the Superior Institute of Health recommended Alzano and nearby Nembro be sealed off as the towns in Lodi had been. But political authorities never implemented the quarantine recommendation there, allowing the infection to spread for a second week until all the Lombardy region was locked down March 7.\n\n\"The army was there, prepared to do a total closure, and if it had been done immediately maybe they could have stopped the contagion in the rest of Lombardy,\" said Dr. Guido Marinoni, head of the association of doctors in Bergamo province. \"This wasn't done, and they took softer measures in all of Lombardy, and this allowed for the spread.\"\n\nAsked why he didn't seal off Bergamo sooner, Premier Giuseppe Conte argued the regional government could have done so on its own. Lombardy's governor, Attilio Fontana, shot back that any mistake \"was made by both. I don't think that there was blame in this situation.''\n\nLombardy has one-sixth of Italy's 60 million people and is the most densely populated region, home to the business capital in Milan and the country's industrial heartland. Lombardy also has more people over 65 than any other Italian region, as well as 20% of Italy's nursing homes, a demographic time bomb for COVID-19 infections.\n\n\"Clearly, with the benefit of hindsight, we should have done a total shutdown in Lombardy, everyone at home and no one moves,\" said Andrea Crisanti, a microbiologist and virologist advising the Veneto regional government. But he acknowledged how hard that was, given Lombardy's outsize role in the Italian economy, which even before the pandemic was heading toward a recession.\n\n\"Probably for political reasons, it wasn't done,\" he told reporters.\n\nINDUSTRIAL LOBBYING\n\nUnions and mayors of some of Lombardy's hardest hit cities now say the country's main industrial lobby group, Confindustria, exerted enormous pressure to resist lockdowns and production shutdowns because the economic cost would be too great in a region responsible for 21% of Italy's GDP.\n\nOn Feb. 28, a week into the outbreak and well after more than 100 cases were registered in Bergamo, the province's branch of Confindustria launched an English-language social media campaign, #Bergamoisrunning, to reassure clients. It insisted the outbreak was no worse than elsewhere, that the \"misleading sensation\" of its high number of infections was due to aggressive testing, and that production in steel mills and other industries was unaffected.\n\nConfindustria launched its own campaign in the larger Lombardy region, echoing that message, #Yeswework. Milan's mayor proclaimed that \"Milan doesn't stop.\"\n\nAt the time, Confindustria Lombardy chief Marco Bonometti acknowledged the \"drastic measures\" needed in Lodi but sought to lower the sense of alarm.\n\n\"We have to let people know they can go back to life as it was, while safeguarding their health,\" he said.\n\nEven after the Rome-based national government locked down all of Lombardy March 7, it allowed factories to stay open, sparking strikes from workers worried their health was being sacrificed to keep Italy's industrial engine rolling.\n\n\"It was a huge error. They should have taken the example where the first cluster was found,\" said Giambattista Morali of the metalworkers' union in the Bergamo town of Dalmine. \"Keeping factories open didn't help the situation; obviously it worsened it.\"\n\nEventually, all but essential production was shut down nationwide March 26. Confindustria's national president, Carlo Bonomi, has been urging that industry be reopened, but in a safe way.\n\n\"The paradigm has changed,\" Bonomi told RAI state television. \"We can't make Italians secure if we don't reopen factories. But how do we make factories safe to secure Italians?\"\n\nIt's a tough sell, given Lombardy is still adding an average of 950 infections daily, while other regions add from a few dozen to 500 apiece, with most new cases registered in nursing homes. Italy is set to begin a gradual reopening May 4, leading with regions farther south where the outbreak is more under control.\n\nLombardy probably will be last to fully open, with its 72,000 confirmed cases, 70% of Italy's total, and estimates that the real number could be 10 times that.\n\nA COSTLY FIELD HOSPITAL\n\nPerhaps no initiative better illustrates Italy's confused coronavirus response than the 200-bed field hospital built in less than two weeks on the grounds of Milan's convention center.\n\nThe hospital was unveiled to great fanfare on March 31, the fruit of a 21 million euro ($23 million) fundraising campaign headed by Lombardy's governor, a member of the right-wing League party, to try to ease pressure on regional ICUs, which on that date were near capacity at 1,324 patients.\n\nThe national civil protection agency opposed the plan, arguing it could never equip it with ventilators or personnel in time. Instead, the agency, which reports to the rival 5-Star-Democratic government in Rome, preferred smaller field units set up outside hospitals and a program to move critical patients elsewhere.\n\nIn the end, the Milan field hospital was barely used, treating only a few dozen patients. Since it opened, Lombardy has seen pressure on its ICUs fall considerably, with just over 700 people needing intensive care today.\n\nFontana, the governor, defended the decision and said he would do it again, telling Radio 24: \"We had to ... prepare a dam in case the epidemic overcame the embankment.\"\n\nNURSING HOME 'MASSACRE'\n\nWhile the regional government was focused on building the field hospital and scrambling to find ICU beds, its testing capacity lagged and Lombardy's nursing homes were in many ways left to fend for themselves.\n\nHundreds of elderly have died in Lombardy and across Italy in what one WHO official has termed a \"massacre\" of those most vulnerable to the virus. Prosecutors are investigating dozens of nursing homes, as well as measures taken by local health authorities and the regional governments that may have worsened the problem.\n\nLombardy has more nursing homes than any other region, housing at least 24,000 elderly, and it registered more dead at those facilities than others too. Of the 3,045 dead from Feb. 1 to April 15 in the region, 1,625 were either positive for the virus or showed its symptoms, according to preliminary results from a survey by the Superior Institute of Health.\n\nOf particular attention to prosecutors was the March 8 decision by the regional government to allow recovering COVID-19 patients to be put in nursing homes to free up hospital beds. The region says it required the homes guarantee the patients would be isolated, but it's not clear who was responsible to ensure that or whether anyone checked.\n\nEven before that, staff at some homes said management prevented them from wearing masks for fear of scaring residents.\n\nA March 30 regional decree, again aimed at easing pressure on Lombardy's ICUs, told nursing home directors to not hospitalize sick residents over 75 if they had other health problems. The decree said it was \"opportune to treat them in the same facility to avoid further risks of decline in transport or during the wait in the emergency room.\"\n\nFor the elderly at a nursing home in Nembro, one of the hardest-hit towns in Bergamo province, the decree amounted to a death warrant. But it wasn't the first or only one that gave the home's managers the sense that they were being abandoned.\n\nWhen management proactively barred visitors on Feb. 24 to try to protect residents and staff from infection, local health authorities responded by threatening sanctions and a loss of accreditation for cutting off family visits, said the facility's new director, Valerio Poloni.\n\nIn the end, 37 of the 87 residents died in February and March. Its doctor, as well as Poloni's predecessor as director, also tested positive, were hospitalized and died. A nursing home resident couldn't get admitted to the hospital in late February because the ER was too crowded.\n\nThe facility's health director, Barbara Codalli, said she was told to use her existing resources to treat the sick. \"The patient returned a few hours later, and a few days later the patient died,\" she told La7 television.\n\nTo date, none of the surviving residents has been tested. Poloni said tests were expected to begin in a few days. Two more residents died so far in April, but the situation seems under control.\n\nA previous version of this story corrected the spelling of Attilio Fontana.\n\nColleen Barry in Soave, Italy, contributed to this report.\n\nFollow AP coverage of the pandemic at http://apnews.com/VirusOutbreak and https://apnews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak",

    "Masks to become part of life in California, but rules vary": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "LOS ANGELES -- For Californians venturing outside, donning a mask will be as common as putting on a cap or sunglasses when the state begins gradually easing stay-at-home orders on Friday. But rules about face coverings vary from county to county, and it's unclear what enforcement might look like.\n\nMasks have been ubiquitous at essential businesses like grocery stores and medical clinics since the early days of the coronavirus pandemic. On the sidewalks of dense cities like Los Angeles and San Francisco, people have been wearing masks for weeks, giving wide berth to the small number of others whose faces aren't covered.\n\nNow masks will be required for customers and employees at certain retailers reopening under new guidelines that also include contact-free transactions, Gov. Gavin Newsom announced Thursday.\n\nAt Sam's, a corner store near San Francisco's City Hall, there are multiple signs reminding patrons to cover their faces, and the clerks have been known to kick out people who don't do so. Some customers will simply lift their T-shirts over their nose and mouth while running in to grab something quick.\n\nMayor London Breed announced city residents must continue to wear face coverings and follow social distance requirements when waiting in line at newly opened businesses like florists or bookstores.\n\nDannie Holzer said she wears a cloth mask most of the time but took it off while eating her lunch at nearby Alamo Square Park, where she was able to keep the required six feet from others.\n\n\"I wear it because I respect other people, and I don't know what immune deficiencies they may have,\" Holzer said. She got used to wearing masks because she rides public buses, where they are required, on her way to and from her job at a marijuana dispensary.\n\nHolzer said she gets frustrated when she is indoors at a store and sees people with their faces uncovered.\n\n\"I usually think, 'I'm doing this for your benefit, so it would be nice if you did the same,' \" Holzer said.\n\nHealth officials in most of the San Francisco Bay Area -- including Alameda, Contra Costa, Marin, San Mateo and Sonoma counties -- have required that residents wear masks when they leave their homes. After previously only strongly urging facing coverings, officials in nearby Napa County on Thursday said they would mandate them.\n\nBay Area residents are generally amenable to new rules instituted during the COVID-19 crisis, and deputies have issued very few citations for non-compliance, said Sgt. Ray Kelly of the Alameda County Sheriff's Office.\n\n\"It's really hard to write someone a ticket when they just lost their job, when they're living through a time of crisis,\" he said. \"But if it's egregious, and you've talked to yourself into a ticket, then we have no choice.\"\n\nSimilarly in Los Angeles County, authorities hoped \"kindness and compassion\" would be enough to convince the \"tiny group\" of people who aren't complying to don masks, Department of Public Health Director Barbara Ferrer said. She urged shop owners to politely refuse service to people without face coverings.\n\nOn trails around Los Angeles, county employees will be on hand to make sure hikers are wearing masks and maintaining appropriate distance, officials said.\n\nTo the south in Orange County, masks are recommended but not required. At a strip mall in the city of Westminster, a member of a grocery store cleaning crew had a mask dangling around her neck, not over her mouth and nose, as she offered a shopping cart to a man passing by on Thursday. He also had a mask dangling around his neck.\n\nIn Northern California, three counties with few confirmed COVID-19 cases allowed a variety of businesses to reopen earlier this week. Not all shoppers wore masks Wednesday at Yuba Sutter Mall, where about 18 of the roughly 50 stores were open.\n\nYuba-Sutter Health Officer Dr. Phuong Luu issued a public warning to businesses to make sure their employees and customers were practicing social distancing and wearing face coverings, as required by the local orders.\n\n\"I understand that some of your customers may strongly object to a facial covering requirement, but the long-term safety of our community is at stake,\" Luu wrote.\n\nThe national Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends wearing face coverings that cover the nose and mouth, like T-shirts, bandannas and non-medical masks because the infection can spread from an asymptomatic person simply by speaking.\n\n\"A simple cloth mask is a way to contain respiratory secretions right at the source and not put other people at risk,\" the CDC said in an April statement. \"The mask traps the droplets before they spread into the environment.\"\n\nAt the park in San Francisco, Dannie Holzer said while non-mask-wearers frustrate her, she stops short of calling people out.\n\n\"I can't be the person who tells people what to do,\" she said.\n\nFor most people, the new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia, and death. The vast majority of people recover.\n\nAssociated Press writers Olga R. Rodriguez in San Francisco and Amy Taxin in Westminster, California, contributed to this report.",

One child has died.\n\nChildren elsewhere in the U.S. and in Europe also have been hospitalized with the condition, known as pediatric multi-system inflammatory syndrome. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced last week that New York is helping develop national criteria for identifying and responding to the syndrome at the request of the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nDe Blasio urged parents to call their pediatricians if their children exhibit symptoms including persistent fever, rash, abdominal pain and vomiting.\n\n\"It's sobering, it's bluntly frightening,\" de Blasio said, \"and I want to say to parents out there, if you're hearing this information about pediatric multi-system inflammatory syndrome and it sounds scary, it does sound scary.\"\n\nDe Blasio said the first 535 hires for the city's coronavirus contact tracing initiative are being trained using the Johns Hopkins University training program sponsored by Bloomberg Philanthropies, with the goal of having 2,500 contact tracers in place by early June.\n\nAdditionally, some 1,200 hotel rooms are being readied for people infected with the virus to self-isolate away from their families, de Blasio said.\n\nTwelve new coronavirus testing sites will open in the coming weeks, the mayor said. He said about 14,000 coronavirus tests are conducted daily in the city now, and that he hopes to be able to test 50,000 a day within a few months.",

    "Meatpacking safety recommendations are largely unenforceable": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "MINNEAPOLIS -- Federal recommendations meant to keep meatpacking workers safe as they return to plants that were shuttered by the coronavirus have little enforcement muscle behind them, fueling anxiety that working conditions could put employees' lives at risk.\n\nExtensive guidance issued last month by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that meatpacking companies erect physical barriers, enforce social distancing and install more hand-sanitizing stations, among other steps. But the guidance is not mandatory.\n\n\"It's like, 'Here's what we'd like you to do. But if you don't want to do it, you don't have to,'\" said Mark Lauritsen, international vice president and director of the food processing and meatpacking division for the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union.\n\nThe pandemic is \"the most massive workers' safety crisis in many decades, and OSHA is in the closet. OSHA is hiding,\" said David Michaels, an epidemiologist who was the agency's assistant secretary of labor under President Barack Obama. Michaels called on OSHA to make the guidelines mandatory and enforceable, which would include the threat of fines.\n\nOSHA's general guidance plainly says the recommendations are advisory and \"not a standard or regulation,\" and they create \"no new legal obligations.\"\n\nBut the guidance also says employers must follow a law known as the general duty clause, which requires companies to provide a workplace free of recognized hazards. Critics say that rule is unlikely to be enforced, especially after President Donald Trump signed an executive order in April aimed at keeping meat plants open.\n\nAlready, examples have emerged of questionable enforcement efforts and pressure to keeping plants running:\n\n-- Shortly before Trump's order, state regulators in Iowa declined to inspect a Tyson Foods pork plant despite a complaint alleging workers had been exposed to the virus in crowded conditions. Documents obtained by The Associated Press show it took the Iowa division of OSHA nine days to seek a response from Tyson and eight more to get a reply. The state agency ultimately found Tyson's voluntary efforts to improve social distancing at the Perry plant were \"satisfactory\" and closed the case without an inspection. A week later, 730 workers -- almost 60% of the workforce -- had tested positive.\n\n-- In Kansas, the state softened its quarantine guidelines after industry executives pushed to allow potentially exposed employees to continue going to work, according to emails and text messages obtained by The Kansas City Star and The Wichita Eagle. The state had previously advised such employees to quarantine for two weeks, before conforming to the more lenient CDC guideline, which allows employees to continue working if they have no symptoms and use precautions. The move came after Tyson raised a concern with the state of rising worker absenteeism.\n\nAfter Trump's executive order -- developed with input from the industry -- the Labor Department and OSHA said OSHA would use discretion and consider \"good faith attempts\" to follow safety recommendations. Employers would be given a chance to explain if some are not met. Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue made clear in letters earlier this month that the Department of Agriculture expected state and local officials to work with meat plants to keep them running. And he said any closed plants without a timetable to reopen had to submit protocols to the USDA.\n\nThe USDA did not respond to repeated requests to provide those company plans to the AP. When asked how guidelines would be enforced, a USDA spokesperson said enforcement was up to OSHA.\n\nMajor meatpackers JBS, Smithfield and Tyson have said worker safety is their highest priority. They provided the AP with summaries of their efforts to improve safety, but the plans themselves have not been made public. Tyson said because the temporary suspension of its operations was voluntary and the company was already meeting or exceeding federal guidance, it was not required to submit a reopening plan to the USDA.\n\nOne plan obtained by the AP, for the reopening of a JBS pork plant in Worthington, Minnesota, details multiple safety improvements, including installing physical barriers, increasing spacing between workers and requiring protective equipment. The plan includes photos. It says employees will be screened for health issues, but it makes no mention of requiring testing.\n\nJBS spokesman Cameron Bruett said the plan \"demonstrates the extraordinary measures\" the plant has taken \"to keep our team members safe as they provide food for the country.\"\n\nIn an emailed response to questions about how guidance would be enforced and what role OSHA would play in protecting workers, the Department of Labor said OSHA received 55 complaints in the animal-processing industry and opened 22 inspections since Feb. 1.\n\nEchoing language from the general duty clause, the agency also noted longstanding rules that require employers to provide a safe workplace.\n\n\"OSHA's standards remain in place and enforceable, and they will continue to be as workers return to their workplaces,\" a labor spokesperson said.\n\nMichaels, the former OSHA official, said the clause has no preventive effect and is generally enforced only after a worker is injured. He said it's effective only in cases in which OSHA conducts an inspection and issues citations and the employer agrees to fix the problem -- so any impact is felt months or years later.\n\nMichaels said OSHA will not issue citations if employers are doing their best to eliminate a hazard but find it's not feasible.\n\nJeffrey Lancaster, founder and CEO of Lancaster Safety Consulting in Wexford, Pennsylvania, said violations of the general duty clause can get expensive, especially if companies are found to be repeat violators, have a willful violation, or fail to fix an issue.\n\n\"The laws have been in place,\" he said. \"It's just a new ballgame - a new hazard.\"\n\nMinnesota is one of 22 states or territories with worker-protection agencies that cover private and government workers, and the state OSHA has the power to enforce the CDC and state Department of Health's COVID-19 safety guidelines under the general duty clause, spokesman James Honerman said.\n\nThe agency has two open investigations into the meatpacking businesses -- one at a JBS plant in Worthington and one at a Pilgrim's Pride plant in Cold Spring, said Honerman, who could not discuss the investigations because they are pending.\n\nLauritsen, with the food workers' union, said OSHA has not done enough to hold employers accountable. The union is advocating for access to daily testing for all meat-production workers, personal protective equipment if necessary and paid sick leave.\n\n\"By and large, if our members are healthy enough, if they are not sick or on quarantine, they are going to show up to do their job,\" Lauritsen said. \"But that doesn't mean that they're not anxious or not nervous.\"",

The institute republished a Tweet from her account, saying she was self-isolating after testing positive for COVID-19.\n\nIn late April, Zepeda appeared at the government's daily coronavirus press briefing. She said that, at the time, fellow nurses had suffered 21 attacks or instances of abuse since the pandemic began, apparently because of fears they would spread the virus.\n\nZepeda's voice broke as she described how nurses have been told not to wear their uniforms on the street to avoid being the target of abuse or discrimination.\n\n\"These attacks have hit my profession hard,\" Zepeda said. \"We are giving our lives in the hospitals.\"\n\nThe institute wrote in its Twitter account Tuesday that \"we know that soon she will show that her greatest strength is never giving up, and we await her return to direct the army of nurses who form the heart of Social Security.\"\n\nThe novel coronavirus has killed 111 medical personnel in Mexico and the virus has infected between 8,500 and 15,000 hospital staffers. Assistant Health Secretary Hugo L\u00f3pez-Gatell said the dead included 66 doctors, 16 nurses and 29 other hospital staff, including support personnel, dentists and lab techs.\n\nThere are 8,544 confirmed COVID-19 cases among health professionals in Mexico, and another 6,747 suspected cases, many of which are awaiting test results.\n\nThe country's total coronavirus case load has increased to 38,324 cases, with 3,926 deaths, though officials have acknowledged the true number is probably much higher.\n\nFor most people, the new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia and death.",

        "body": "MEXICO CITY -- Authorities said at least 35 people died after drinking methanol in two states in central Mexico, the latest in a series of mass bad-alcohol poisonings since coronavirus lockdowns began and many towns banned legitimate alcohol sales.\n\nOn Tuesday, the government of Puebla state said \"at least\" 20 people died in the town of Chiconcuautla of presumed methanol poisoning. The state said it had closed the stores where the suspect liquor had been sold, and seized about 50 gallons (200 liters) of it.\n\nAnd in Morelos state, south of Mexico City, inspectors seized four five-gallon (20-liter) jugs of unlabeled alcohol that was believed to be the cause of 15 poisoning deaths in the hamlet of Telixtac. The dead were 14 men and one woman.\n\nIn late April, 25 people died in the state of Jalisco after drinking a cheap brand of cane alcohol known as \"El Chorrito.\" And local media reported another seven people died of methanol poisoning recently in the Yucatan village of Acanceh, but authorities did not immediately respond to requests for information to confirm that incident.\n\nIt is unclear if the poisonings are related to the new coronavirus lockdowns. Authorities have not said whether people drank the adulterated booze because legitimate liquor was unavailable or whether the economic effects of the lockdown have forced people to turn to cheaper bootleg versions.\n\nMethanol is a poisonous cousin of the ethanol alcohol present in normal liquors and cannot be smelled or tasted in drinks. It causes delayed organ and brain damage, and its symptoms include chest pain, nausea, hyperventilation, blindness and even coma.",

        "body": "MINNEAPOLIS -- A suburban Minneapolis nursing home said 47 residents have died from complications of COVID-19, the most at any long-term care facility in Minnesota.\n\nSt. Therese of New Hope also said Wednesday that 130 residents have tested positive for the coronavirus, while 65 staff members have shown symptoms or been exposed.\n\nA veterans home in Massachusetts where 70 people have died is the deadliest known coronavirus outbreak at a long-term care facility in the U.S. At least three care facilities in New York and New Jersey have had more than 50 deaths.\n\nMost of Minnesota's 343 confirmed deaths from the coronavirus have been in nursing homes. The St. Therese death toll would amount to nearly 15% of the 271 that occurred in nursing homes, according to the Star Tribune's analysis of death records. KARE-TV, which also analyzed death records, reported that the state's second-highest number of deaths in a nursing home was 13.\n\nSt. Therese, which has a 258-bed capacity, said all residents have been tested. Of those who have tested positive, about one-third were asymptomatic, living with a roommate and unknowingly spread the virus.\n\n\"This has been devastating to a community that prides itself on providing quality, loving care,\" St. Therese President and CEO Barb Rode said in a statement. She said the disease spread rapidly at the facility, which has two residents per room and four sharing a bathroom.\n\nThe first resident tested positive April 5, and the first two deaths were the next day. All residents testing positive moved into one unit to prevent more infections, Rode said.\n\nSome family members have complained they weren't advised of problems quickly enough.\n\n\"We were kept completely in the dark until it was too late to act,\" Holly Doughty, of Mendota Heights, whose 95-year-old mother lives at St. Therese, told the Star Tribune.\n\nDoughty said she first asked about the coronavirus during a conference call with St. Therese staff on April 7, and was reassured the facility was taking precautions. She said no one mentioned positive cases or deaths. She said family members were unable to reach their mother, who has severe dementia and can't answer the phone, after that. Doughty said St. Therese staff didn't return numerous calls.\n\nDoughty is now waiting to hear whether her mother has the virus.\n\nRode said reports that the outbreak was hidden or that care was substandard are \"unfair and untrue.\" She said families, guardians and responsible physicians were informed as soon as positive test results were received, and were advised of \"the massive movements\" within the facility.\n\nRode's statement said the Minnesota Department of Health audited the facility twice since March 31 and it was found to be in compliance with its license. Spokesman Doug Schultz confirmed that the agency has been on site making recommendations.",

    "Money for meals for California seniors could end in 2 weeks": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "LOS ANGELES -- California Gov. Gavin Newsom's first-in-the-nation plan to pay for and deliver three meals a day to vulnerable seniors during the coronavirus crisis has less than two weeks to launch before federal funding runs out, government documents show.\n\nIt wasn't clear how many, if any, cities and counties would be delivering meals in substantial numbers by May 10, when money from the Federal Emergency Management Agency is set to end. Also unclear is how much FEMA has budgeted for the program, though it told The Associated Press there is no preset limit.\n\nFEMA says it will cover three-quarters of the cost of preparing and delivering the food made by local restaurants, which could quickly soar into tens or even hundreds of millions of dollars in the nation's most populous state, which has 5.7 million seniors. The state, cities and counties would pick up the rest of the cost, but local governments would also get an infusion of cash from sales taxes they collect on the meals.\n\nTo keep the federal money flowing, the Newsom administration must give a \"detailed justification\" for continuing the so-called emergency feeding program, FEMA said in an April 10 letter.\n\n\"While it is anticipated that, upon successful program execution, the state will request an extension, there is no guarantee it will be granted,\" the Governor's Office of Emergency Services acknowledged in a planning document.\n\nWithout an extension, FEMA said it would cover costs \"necessary to end these services in an orderly manner\" for 15 days beyond May 10.\n\nBrian Ferguson, a spokesman for the Governor's Office of Emergency Services, said the state had not submitted a request for an extension and would review the program before deciding.\n\n\"The number of meals served will depend on the number of counties that decide to participate,\" he said in an email.\n\nCalifornia requested the program in a letter to FEMA on April 1 and got approval nine days later. Newsom didn't announce it and provide details on its scope until two weeks later.\n\nNewsom gave no hint of the tight timeframe for financing when he unveiled the program Friday. Also, while predicting that over a million seniors could benefit, he didn't illuminate a key element for qualifying for $66-a-day meals: Recipients must be unable to purchase groceries and cook themselves.\n\nIt isn't clear how cities and counties could quickly determine who fits that criteria. They also are just beginning to figure out what restaurants would cook the meals and how they would be delivered.\n\nLos Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti spoke hopefully Monday of having the first meals delivered by taxis next week, building off an existing food-delivery program. He didn't estimate how many people could be served.\n\nLos Angeles County, the nation's largest with 10 million residents, and neighboring San Bernardino County are developing plans, with no estimate for when they might be ready.\n\nCalifornia Pizza Kitchen was among the restaurants hoping to get a chance at preparing the meals, calling it \"exciting.\" But it said it was waiting for more details to determine if it would apply.\n\nAt Nightbird in San Francisco, owner Kim Alter said in an email that the restaurant is \"working to be a part of this.\"\n\n\"No word yet as to how it will play out,\" Alter said.\n\nThe meal plan was announced as Newsom and other state officials have started discussing easing stay-at-home orders imposed last month to deter the spread of the virus.\n\nNewsom has said the restrictions will likely last longer for people 65 and older because they are at greater risk of more severe illness, including pneumonia and death. For most people, the coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough.\n\nTo be eligible for the meal program, seniors must either live alone or with one other person who is eligible. They can't earn more than $74,940 per year, or $101,460 for a household of two, and they must have documented exposure to the coronavirus or be at high risk of exposure. Anyone already getting money from other federal food programs would be ineligible.\n\nAlong with getting isolated seniors free, nutritious food, the intent was to generate income for cities and counties and steer business to restaurants devastated after sit-down dining rooms shuttered. The meals can't include sugary drinks or high-salt options.\n\nJot Condie, who heads the California Restaurant Association, predicted that virtually any restaurant could qualify, from high-end steakhouses to small mom-and-pop diners. The group previously said as many as one-third of the state's restaurants might never reopen.\n\n\"For a restaurant that qualifies this will be ... the only predictable business that they have,\" Condie said. \"It's three meals a day to a set population.\"\n\nChris Hoene, executive director of the nonprofit California Budget & Policy Center, which advocates for low-income people, said that even if it takes a few months to get the meals to vulnerable seniors, \"the need is still going to be there.\"\n\n\"We are a big state. And whenever we put new systems in place, it always takes more time,\" he said.",

        "authors": [],
        "body": "BIRMINGHAM, England -- The holy month of Ramadan is underway, and the Central Jamia Mosque Ghamkol Sharif in Birmingham should be full of worshippers. But this year, the main arrivals are the dead.\n\nWhile the mosque in the central England city has been closed in response to the coronavirus pandemic, its parking lot has been transformed into a temporary morgue with room for 150 bodies.\n\nThe volunteer-run mortuary, with its white tents, industrial refrigerators and neat stacks of coffins, is evidence of the toll the virus is taking on Britain's Muslim and ethnic-minority communities. The two most diverse regions of the U.K. -- London and the Midlands area centered in Birmingham -- have seen the largest number of deaths in the outbreak.\n\nMohammed Zahid, a mosque trustee who helped set up the mortuary with a firm of Muslim funeral directors, said the mosque in Birmingham's predominantly South Asian Small Heath district normally holds one or two funerals a week.\n\nIn the last few weeks, \"we were doing five to six a day,\" he said.\n\n\"You can see how the families were grieving,\" said 44-year-old Zahid, who wears a mask, coveralls and gloves as he moves among the coffins.\n\nLocal government social-distancing rules allow only six people to attend each burial.\n\n\"Especially when they can't get their own cousins and brothers and sisters around them -- it's made it really hard for the people who've lost their loved ones,\" said Zahid, who has lost two aunts to COVID-19. \"What do you say to a family who's got five sons or daughters, and some of them have to stay home?\"\n\nIt's a similar story at the nearby Green Lane Mosque, where coffins lie stacked up inside the prayer hall. Usually the mosque holds about 25 funerals a year. For the past three weeks it has seen five a day.\n\n\"Everybody's worrying about whether it will be their family members next, their loved ones,\" said Saleem Ahmed, the mosque's head of welfare and services.\n\nBritain has recorded more than 20,700 hospital deaths of people with coronavirus. Thousands more are likely to have died in nursing homes.\n\nThe virus has hit people of all ages and backgrounds, including Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who spent three nights in intensive care. But evidence suggests that ethnic-minority Britons are feeling a disproportionate impact.\n\nStatistics show that 16% of those who died in Britain with the coronavirus up to April 17 were from black, Asian or minority ethnic (BAME) backgrounds. About 14% of the U.K. population comes from those backgrounds.\n\nEven more starkly, data from Intensive Care National Audit and Research shows that a third of people in intensive care with COVID-19 in the U.K. are non-white. And many of the over 100 health care workers who have died in the outbreak were from BAME backgrounds.\n\nThe government has asked public health officials to investigate the virus' heavy impact on minorities.\n\nA similar trend has been seen in countries including the United States, where an Associated Press analysis found that about 42% of Americans who have died from COVID-19 were black, while African Americans account for roughly 21% of the population in the areas analyzed.\n\nIn France, the poor and largely immigrant neighborhoods on the fringes of Paris have seen some of the highest increases in mortality since the outbreak began.\n\nKamlesh Khunti, a professor of primary care, diabetes and vascular medicine at the University of Leicester, said complex factors may be involved. While black Americans often have worse access to medical care than white Americans, \" in the U.K. we have a free health care service, so we can't put it down to just inequalities in care,\" he said.\n\nKhunti said ethnic-minority Britons are more likely to live in large, multi-generational families and cramped housing. Many hold jobs with a high risk of infection: doctors, nurses, taxi drivers and transit workers.\n\nBlack and South Asian people, in Britain and elsewhere, also have higher rates of cardiovascular disease, diabetes and hypertension, conditions that have been be linked to more severe COVID-19 symptoms.\n\nOthers argue that racism is a factor. Gurch Randhawa, professor of diversity in public health at the University of Bedfordshire, said extensive research shows that minority nurses and health care assistants \"often receive poorer treatment than their colleagues.\"\n\n\"In the context of the present crisis, this means they may have worse access to (personal protective equipment), more trying shift patterns and greater exposure to COVID-19 patients,\" he said.\n\nIn Birmingham's Muslim community, everyone seems to know someone who has died. Haly Bano lost her uncle, a taxi driver who likely caught the virus from a customer.\n\n\"It is really hard for mum, because she can't go to pay respects to the family or anything,\" she said. \"So we just called on the phone and FaceTimed and that's all we could do.\"\n\nPicking up meat for a Ramadan meal in the predominantly South Asian Sparkbrook neighborhood, Bano said she was shocked at the number of people thronging the supermarkets and butcher shops. Some wore masks but few were following government instructions to remain two meters (over 6 feet) apart.\n\n\"People are not listening,\" she said. \"It is really scary and dangerous.\"\n\nAt the Ghamkol Sharif mosque, Zahid is thankful that the temporary morgue hasn't reached its capacity. It was set up amid fears that without sufficient refrigerated storage, bodies would have to be cremated, counter to Muslim custom. But everyone who has been brought here has had a proper burial.\n\n\"We just make sure they get their final rites,\" Zahid said.\n\nScientists say Britain has likely passed the peak of its outbreak. The number of people hospitalized is declining, and the increase in the number of deaths has slowed, even though hundreds with COVID-19 are still dying each day.\n\nZahid said in the past week the number of bodies arriving at the mosque has ebbed but the anxiety has not.\n\n\"There is fear in people about the corona, there's no doubt about that,\" Zahid said.\n\n\"Whatever comes, comes from God,\" he added. \"We just have to carry on doing what we're doing.\"\n\nFollow AP news coverage of the coronavirus pandemic at https://apnews.com/VirusOutbreak and https://apnews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak",

    "Most California Health Corps volunteers not eligible to join": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- For days after Gov. Gavin Newsom announced the all-volunteer California Health Corps, he provided updates on how many retired medical workers had signed up and marveled at the numbers -- 34,000 in the first 48 hours, 82,000 a week later.\n\nNewsom said the state would move quickly to get them into the work force to assist with the expected crush of coronavirus cases.\n\nIn the month since the corps was announced, the sign-ups continued, reaching 93,000, but the wave Newsom worried would overwhelm hospitals hasn't arrived. And the ranks of those in line to join the corps have fallen precipitously.\n\nThe state's initial vetting revealed two-thirds -- 60,000 volunteers -- didn't have the most basic requirement: a valid license to practice their specialty. And about 20,000 of those remaining have not filled out an application, despite being sent a reminder.\n\nState data requested by The Associated Press shows about 10,500 people are in a final review and of those, 4,900 or about 5% of those who initially volunteered are cleared to participate.\n\nWith hospitals able to handle their caseload, there isn't a clearly defined role for the corps, but that hasn't stopped the first deployment -- 233 doctors, nurses, respiratory specialists and support staff have been working for more than a week at the emergency hospital at Sleep Train Arena in Sacramento.\n\nThey are being paid even though there are no patients to care for.\n\n\"Staff are standing by to support patients if needed. They are also continuing to vet processes and standardize operations,\" California Health and Human Services Agency spokesman Rodger Butler said in an email Thursday.\n\nProfessor Joanne Spetz, the associate director of research at the Healthforce Center at the University of California, San Francisco, described the Sleep Train situation as \"All dressed up and where's your prom date?\"\n\n\"But it's kind of a good thing there is no prom date,\" said Spetz, whose center researches issues related to health care workers and services.\n\nStephanie Roberson, California Nurses Association government relations director, is supportive of the corps. But she said it's more important the governor ensure all existing health care workers have protective gear than \"grandstanding\" about how many people signed up for the corps.\n\nEven so, Roberson agreed with Spetz that it's wise for California to have the medical workers ready to go if there is a second pandemic wave. Newsom has said ensuring the state has adequate resources to handle a sudden surge is a prerequisite for easing his stay-at-home order.\n\nNew York State also established a reserve corps and had a similar flood of volunteers. They initially went unused even as Gov. Andrew Cuomo pleaded for medical workers from other states to aid the beleaguered medical system in and around New York City, the epicenter of the U.S. outbreak.\n\nCuomo's administration said Thursday that 96,000 people signed up and more than 12,000 have been connected to hospitals, nursing homes and other care facilities. New York allows facilities to pick directly from the list and officials couldn't say how many are actually being used. That's a different approach from California's system of deploying them directly.\n\nThe original plan in California was to use corps members to staff an anticipated 66,000 makeshift hospital beds that could be needed when cases peaked in May. The staggering total included tents, shuttered state facilities and places like Sleep Train Arena and the Los Angeles Convention Center.\n\nBut California's early and aggressive social distancing helped limit hospitalizations. Newsom is confident enough that traditional hospitals have ample space that last week he said they could resume scheduling elective surgeries.\n\nStill, the vetting of corps candidates continues.\n\nNearly two-thirds of those admitted to the corps so far are nurses, whose monthly state pay scale ranges from about $4,000 for a licensed vocational nurse to $6,600 for a registered nurse.\n\nAnother 417 are doctors, with pay ranging from about $10,000 to $13,000 a month, depending on experience, knowledge and skill. About one-fifth are assorted medical support personnel and the remainder are respiratory and behavioral professionals.\n\nNone are paid until they are deployed.\n\nThe split of those deployed to Sleep Train Arena is similar, with a preponderance of nurses and support personnel, and fewer doctors and respiratory specialists on stand-by there since April 20. The state is paying $500,000 a month to lease the facility, but expects the federal government to eventually reimburse 75% of its costs.\n\nWith no patients yet, \"California is actively evaluating additional opportunities for the California Health Corps to support California's response to COVID-19,\" Butler said.\n\nHe said alternate care sites like the Sleep Train Arena could take in \"low acuity\" patients from skilled nursing facilities, which have been especially hard hit by the virus. His agency last week published two guides for transferring patients between such sites and nursing facilities.\n\nPatricia McGinnis, California Advocates for Nursing Home Reform executive director, wouldn't object to using the facilities to ease the crisis at nursing homes. The problem, she said, is \"I don't know what a low acuity nursing home patient who has COVID looks like.\"\n\nNursing home patients generally are elderly and have underlying health conditions that make them far more vulnerable to life-threatening complications if they contract the virus. About one-third of the state's roughly 2,000 coronavirus deaths are nursing home patients.\n\nFor most people, the virus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough, that clear up in two to three weeks. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia and death.\n\nAside from Sleep Train Arena, there are few patients in the other makeshift hospitals.\n\n\"A lot of people are going to be wondering, did we over-prepare?\" Spetz said. She, like Newsom, concluded \"over-preparing is better than under-preparing.\"\n\nAssociated Press writer Marina Villeneuve contributed to this story from Albany, N.Y.",

    "Musk threatens to exit California over virus restrictions": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "Tesla CEO Elon Musk threatened Saturday to pull the company's factory and headquarters out of California and sued local officials who have stopped the company from reopening its electric vehicle factory.\n\nIn a lawsuit filed in federal court, Tesla accused the Alameda County Health Department of overstepping federal and state coronavirus restrictions when it stopped Tesla from restarting production at its factory in Fremont. The lawsuit contends Tesla factory workers are allowed to work during California's stay-at-home order because the facility is considered \"critical infrastructure.\"\n\n\"Frankly, this is the final straw,\" Musk tweeted. \"Tesla will now move its HQ and future programs to Texas/Nevada immediately.\"\n\nHe wrote that whether the company keeps any manufacturing in Fremont depends on how Tesla is treated in the future.\n\nMusk has been ranting about the stay-home order since the company's April 29 first-quarter earnings were released, calling the restrictions fascist and urging governments to stop taking people's freedom.\n\nAn order in the six-county San Francisco Bay Area forced Tesla to close the plant starting March 23 to help prevent the virus' spread, and it was extended until the end of May. Public health experts say the orders have reduced the number of new coronavirus cases nationwide. California Gov. Gavin Newsom allowed the Bay Area counties to continue restrictions while easing them in other areas of the state.\n\nIn a statement Saturday, Alameda County's Health Department said it has been working with Tesla to develop a safety plan allowing the Fremont plant to reopen while protecting workers. \"We look forward to coming to an agreement on an appropriate safety plan very soon,\" the statement said.\n\nBut the statement also said residents and businesses have made sacrifices to protect the health of people in the region. \"It is our collective responsibility to move through the phases of reopening and loosening the restrictions of the shelter-in-place order in the safest way possible, guided by data and science,\" the department said.\n\nFremont Mayor Lily Mei wrote in a statement that she is growing concerned about the regional economy without provisions for major manufacturing to resume operations. \"We know many essential businesses have proven they can successfully operate using strict safety and social distancing practices,\" the statement said.\n\nEmails seeking comment from Newsom have not been returned.\n\nDespite Musk's threat, it would be costly and difficult to quickly shift production from Fremont to Texas or Nevada. The Fremont facility, which was formerly run jointly by General Motors and Toyota, currently is Tesla's only U.S. vehicle assembly plant, and the company would lose critical production if it shut down the plant to move equipment.\n\n\"Moving away from Fremont would take at least 12 to 18 months and could add risk to the manufacturing and logistics process in the meantime,\" Wedbush Securities analyst Daniel Ives wrote in a note to investors.\n\nBut Musk plans another U.S. factory to increase output, possibly in Texas, and could move production once that plant is up and running.\n\nThe lack of production in Fremont cuts off Tesla's revenue and is a big financial strain. On a conference call last month, Musk said the company only has assembly plants in Fremont and Shanghai, and the Fremont facility produces the majority of its vehicles. He called the closure of Fremont a \"serious risk.\"\n\nThe coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms for most people. But it has killed more than 78,000 people in the U.S., with the death toll rising.\n\nIves wrote that there's now a high-stakes poker game between Musk and county officials -- and Musk showed his cards. \"Now all eyes move to the courts and the response from Alameda County and potentially California state officials.\"\n\nMusk's tweets come as competing automakers are starting to reopen factories in the U.S. Toyota will restart production on Monday, while General Motors, Ford and Fiat Chrysler all plan to restart their plants gradually on May 18. Tesla is the only major automaker with a factory in California.\n\nMusk's threats came after a series of bizarre tweets earlier this month, including one that said Tesla's stock price was too high. Musk also posted parts of the U.S. national anthem and wrote that he would sell his houses and other possessions.\n\nAssociated Press reporters Michael Liedtke and Daisy Nguyen in San Francisco contributed to this report.",

        "authors": [],
        "body": "JERUSALEM -- Muslims in Jerusalem are praying outside in small groups during the holy month of Ramadan as measures aimed at curbing the coronavirus pandemic remain in place, including a halt to prayers at the Al-Aqsa mosque compound, the third holiest site in Islam.\n\nPrayers at Jerusalem's world-famous religious sites, sacred to Muslims, Christians and Jews, were halted or heavily restricted last month as Israel and the Palestinian Authority imposed sweeping lockdowns to prevent the spread of the virus.\n\nSome regulations have been lifted in recent days, allowing many non-essential businesses to reopen. But the ban on large gatherings remains in place. Group prayers can only be held outside by up to 19 people standing at least two meters (yards) apart.\n\nRamadan usually brings tens of thousands of worshippers to the Al-Aqsa mosque and the adjacent Dome of the Rock for evening prayers known as \"taraweeh.\" The site is administered by an Islamic endowment, which halted prayers there several weeks ago.\n\nAl-Aqsa is the third holiest site in Islam, after Mecca and Medina. The sprawling esplanade is the holiest site for Jews, who refer to it as the Temple Mount because it was the location of the ancient Jewish temples.\n\nShops in Muslim-majority areas are required to close at 6 p.m. every night but can make deliveries. The measure is aimed at preventing people from gathering after the daily dawn-to-dusk fast. After nightfall, Muslims traditionally feast with family and friends.\n\nIsrael imposed similar measures to prevent gatherings during recent Jewish and national holidays. The Palestinian Authority, which governs parts of the occupied West Bank, has also heavily restricted movement over the last six weeks.\n\nThe virus causes mild to moderate symptoms in most patients, who recover within a few weeks, but it can cause severe illness or death, particularly older people and those with underlying health problems.\n\nIsrael has reported more than 16,000 cases and 223 deaths. More than half of those infected in Israel have recovered. The Palestinian Authority has reported nearly 330 cases and two fatalities.",

    "Muted and vacant, Las Vegas struggles to survive shutdown": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "LAS VEGAS -- Slot machines are powered down, casinos boarded up and barricaded.\n\nSidewalks are largely deserted and electronic marquees that once flashed neon calls for nightclubs, magic shows and topless revues instead beam somber messages of safety.\n\nThe famous fountains of the Bellagio casino, where water choreographed to lights and music shoots hundreds of feet in the air, are still. Throngs of visitors who made it tough to maneuver on sidewalks have been replaced by the occasional jogger or skateboarder.\n\nOn the always busy, always noisy, never sleeping Las Vegas strip, you can now hear birds chirping.\n\n\"It's crazy,\" said Chris Morehouse, a 70-year-old Elvis impersonator who spent a recent afternoon sipping Miller High Life and posing with a few locals who took advantage of the eerie silence to take photos at the neon-bedecked welcome sign on the Las Vegas Strip. \"It's like the end of the world.\"\n\nInstead of hosting throngs of visitors for one of the busiest seasons of the year, with March Madness drawing swarms to sportsbooks, or the now-scuttled plan to host the NFL draft this weekend, ferrying players in boats to a red carpet stage on the Bellagio lake, Las Vegas is trying to survive.\n\nNevada's tourism, leisure, hospitality and gambling industry accounts for one in three jobs in the state - making the state more dependent on tourism than Alaska on oil.\n\nWorkers are expected to lose $7.7 billion in wages and salaries over the next 18 months if the tourism industry is shuttered between 30 and 90 days, according to a study from the Nevada Resort Association.\n\nWith the industry effectively closed for more than five weeks now, more than 343,000 residents have filed for unemployment, and state and local governments could lose more than $1 billion in tax revenues.\n\nThe politically independent mayor of Las Vegas, Carolyn Goodman, has issued public pleas calling for the Democratic Gov. Steve Sisolak to end the statewide shutdown of casinos and non-essential businesses, which she calls \"total insanity.\"\n\n\"For heaven's sake,\" Goodman said at an April city council meeting, \"being closed is killing us already, and killing Las Vegas, our industry, our convention and tourism business that we have all worked so hard to build.\"\n\nSisolak has declined to give a date for when he'll start easing restrictions, saying the state has to see at least two weeks of declines in deaths and new cases, along with more widespread testing and tracking, with before he will start gradually easing rules.\n\nSisolak said in an interview on CNN Wednesday night that he didn't want workers to have to choose between their paycheck and their life and noted that the casino workers' union has reported 11 deaths among its ranks due to the virus.\n\n\"We will rebuild our economy. Las Vegas will continue to thrive. But I can't do that if I lose more people,\" he said.\n\nFor most people, the coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia, and death. The vast majority of people recover.\n\nSo far, the casino closures are expected to extend at least into May, leaving workers like Kimberly Ireland struggling to find a way to hang on.\n\nThe 49-year-old was laid off from her job as a bell desk dispatcher at the Mirage casino-resort, where she worked for a decade.\n\nShe's living off her savings and the unemployment, and also supporting her adult daughter, who is on an unpaid maternity leave, and a new grandson, who was born days after the casinos were shuttered.\n\n\"Money is running out. It's getting low for the majority of us,\" she said.\n\nIreland said workers at her casino weren't given any guidance about when they'd be back or what it might be like then they return. For now, she doesn't think Las Vegas is ready.\n\n\"Everybody wants to get back to business. Everybody wants to get back to semi-normal,\" she said. \"I just don't think it's safe.\"\n\nVictor Chicas, a restaurant server in the Mandalay Bay casino-hotel, was facing foreclosure on his home before the virus shut down the city and the 54-year-old was laid off.\n\nHe immediately ended his cable and internet service to cut his expenses and drained his swimming pool to trim his electric bill. He's still waiting to find out if his home loan modification will be approved and if he'll get a chance to try to keep his house, while also supporting his sister and her two children, who immigrated to the U.S. from Guatemala.\n\n\"Now when we come back,\" he said, \"I'm going to be underwater.\"\n\nLike Ireland, said he wishes his employer would pay him through the shutdown but disagrees with the mayor's call to reopen Las Vegas.\n\n\"Life is more important than anything else,\" he said. \"You're not going to buy life with money.\"\n\nWhile about 24% of the state's workforce has filed for unemployment benefits since March 21, that doesn't include waves of others who haven't been able to get through the overburdened system. Nor does it include the self-employed and gig workers, who are newly eligible for benefits under a federal aid package that the state is scrambling to accommodate. Nevada officials say the state may not have a website ready for them to seek benefits until mid-May.\n\nThose who rely on the amusements of Las Vegas in non-traditional ways are trying to find a way to endure.\n\nWearing a white, rhinestone-studded jumpsuit, a thick black wig, a gold chain shining on his bare chest and sunglasses to match, Morehouse, the Elvis impersonator, has seized on the sunny weather and the restless locals visiting one of the few tourist attractions still open amid the COVID-19 outbreak--the iconic \"Welcome to Fabulous Las Vegas\" sign. He's brought a speaker to perform karaoke and a few cans of beer, which he sips as he sings and sways in the open-air park as people in groups of twos and threes still come up to take a photo with the sign.\n\nWhile foot traffic is light, Morehouse hopes he might lure curious drivers to pullover.\n\n\"They see an Elvis here. They think something's going on,\" he said. \"I'm like the sign.\"\n\nAt dusk falls and dim lights start glow, many locals slowly drive several miles of the Strip, with their car windows rolled down and phones raised to photograph and film America's most flamboyant party reduced to a vacant, muted spectacle, a post-apocalyptic remnant of a time before social distancing and stay-at-home orders, when excess and wild attractions were the main draw.\n\nBrandy Little, a 35-year-old economist and Las Vegas native, said she cried the first time she drove the empty Strip during the shutdown, knowing how devastating it is for the city.\n\n\"It wouldn't have been bad if we were only briefly in it,\" she said of the coronravirus. \"But the whole world is really being hit by it, and we rely on the world to come here and play. If they're hurting, they might not come and play.\"",

Everything has been on (Zoom) team meetings,\" said Knaus, a seven-time championship winning crew chief. \"That's the recommendation by NASCAR for the traveling teams to stay as isolated as they can and try to keep everybody at the race track as healthy as we can. That's the protocol we put into place and that's what we've been abiding by.\"\n\nNot others.\n\nBusch dropped by the Ganassi shop Thursday. He wanted a face-to-face meeting with crew chief Matt McCall before Darlington after two months of communicating via phone or computer.\n\n\"Just him and I, separated from the group,\" Busch said. \"There's a shift change where the shop is empty for an hour, so it will be just him and I following (social) distancing.\"\n\nXfinity Series driver Ryan Sieg posted a video of an Atlanta news station visiting his Georgia-based team Thursday that showed three crew members standing side-by-side. None wore face masks or other protective equipment.\n\nNASCAR reiterated its guidelines when asked for clarification.\n\n\"For a team to submit a participant to a roster, they must be symptom free for five days and not have been directly exposed to anyone with COVID-19,\" NASCAR said. \"We have made strong recommendations about operations in shops and responsible travel to the event.\"\n\nTeams are limited to 16 employees per car Sunday and that includes the driver, spotter and owner. More than half the team owners at the Cup Series level are over 65 years old and aren't expected to attend because they are considered at risk for the coronavirus.\n\nHall of Famer Richard Petty told his son, Kyle, in an NBC Sports interview he will miss a Darlington race for the first time since 1950 when \"my dad wouldn't let me off school; school was starting the same day.\"\n\nDrivers were told to be at the track four hours ahead of the green flag Sunday. They will undergo a heath check including a temperature check, but no COVID-19 testing -- a decision reached to ensure tests go elsehwere, not to NASCAR. The timing allows a backup driver to make the two-hour trip from the Charlotte area to Darlington if needed.\n\nOnce inside, drivers will be isolated in their motorhomes, away from their team, and wait to be called to the cars. Everyone will be required to wear a face mask, crews must maintain social distancing and high-fives, hugs and human contact are barred.\n\nNASCAR has warned of fines as high as $50,000 for not following the rules at the track, where competitors are subject to random health screenings.\n\nNASCAR has recommended anyone that travels to the track not return to their shop to work and not interact with other groups. It is designed to help NASCAR track details in the potential case of a positive test.\n\nUFC, which returned last weekend in Florida without spectators, tested every fighter, judge, referee and other employees. One fighter and his two cornermen tested positive.\n\nUFC prior to the fights put all the fighters and employees in one hotel in an attempt to quarantine them, but NASCAR does not have that ability.\n\nSeries points leader Kevin Harvick owns a management company that represents UFC fighter Donald Cerronne, who competed in Florida last week. Harvick is comfortable going back to the track, where drivers will be isolated in their cockpits and crews are already clad in firesuits, gloves, helmets and now a required face sock.\n\n\"Well, I'm not going to get punched in the face by anybody else or be put in a headlock or be directly in contact with any of my other competitors,\" Harvick said. \"When you look at the guidelines of entry and exit and temperature checks during the week and all the logs and things of where people are and who they have interaction with, I think we have done what we need to do from what fits our sport the best.\"\n\nNASCAR will use both of Darlington's garages and and an infield that will be missing thousands of fans to spread teams out and still create a tight footprint for essential personnel. NASCAR said representatives from IndyCar, the NFL's Carolina Panthers and possibly other teams planned to observe some of the procedures.\n\nNASCAR cannot afford a misstep as it starts up its three series, with 20 races scheduled through June, all in Southern states and all without spectators. The industry is desperate to restart its revenue flow, but does not want to jeopardize the return of other professional leagues.\n\n\"We've been really transparent with what we're doing with the other leagues, and by the same token the other leagues have been the same,\" NASCAR executive Steve O'Donnell told NBC Sports. \"We all want to be back. We all want to be back in a way that's safe, so if we can share and learn from each other, I think that's what we've done.\"",

        "authors": [],
        "body": "Dr. Priya Sampathkumar gets asked by her two teen-aged sons every day when they can expect to see NBA games again.\n\nShe's among the doctors desperately trying to answer that question -- and the NBA is now trying to help.\n\nSampathkumar is on the staff at the Mayo Clinic, which is starting to get support from the NBA and its players for a study that will aim to shed more light on how antibody testing can help the medical world further understand COVID-19. NBA teams were told this week about the study through an invitation for players and staff to volunteer to take part.\n\n\"I think this is one step towards understanding when we might be able to open things back up,\" said Sampathkumar, the Mayo Clinic's Chair of the Immunization and the Infection Prevention and Control Specialty Councils. \"It's certainly not that at the end of the study, we're not going to be able to say, 'OK, on X, Y and Z date everything can open up again.'\"\n\nBut every little bit helps right now, which is why the NBA asked teams to assist, if possible. Teams were told that the study would also help doctors understand the prevalence of COVID-19 among infected individuals who were asymptomatic or experienced only mild symptoms.\n\n\"From a team perspective, and saying this broadly across all teams, participation across the NBA allows for more robust information from the community at large in providing prevalence data,\" said Dr. Jimmie Mancell, the team physician for the Memphis Grizzlies.\n\nIt's a relatively simple process: Teams will receive materials from researchers, then have phlebotomists collect specimens that will be shipped back to the Mayo Clinic. Participants will also have to fill out a survey to gauge their level of potential exposure. Within two days, test results will be known -- and because this is about antibodies, it will not take resources away from those doing other testing to identify those who are sick with the virus.\n\nAdditional goals of the study include being able to identify more patients who could donate plasma and improve care for patients who are dealing with the coronavirus, plus potentially move researchers closer to a vaccine.\n\n\"It really has a couple of different potential goals in the sense that one is that it does help to assess the prevalence of antibodies within society in general and certainly for those players who participate with the NBA in terms of exposure,\" said Dr. John DiFiori, the NBA's director of sports medicine. \"But it also is a study that is attempting to do sort of a higher-level validation of a tool that will be more easy at point of care or at home. So, it has two parts to it.\"\n\nThe virus has infected more than 3.6 million people worldwide and killed over a quarter-million, according to a tally through Wednesday by Johns Hopkins University. Experts believe the actual number of infections and deaths are higher than what has been officially reported by government agencies.\n\nThe NBA has not played since March 11. Some teams are reopening facilities on Friday for voluntary workouts, though most are waiting until next week or beyond. And there is no plan to end the shutdown anytime soon.\n\n\"Obviously, the goal here is to help support research,\" DiFiori said. \"And the more participation that we have, the better we're able to achieve that.\"\n\nMore AP NBA: https://apnews.com/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP -- Sports",

    "NY nursing home reports 98 deaths linked to coronavirus": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "NEW YORK -- A New York City nursing home on Friday reported the deaths of 98 residents believed to have had the coronavirus -- a staggering death toll that shocked public officials.\n\n\"It's absolutely horrifying,\" Mayor Bill de Blasio said. \"It's inestimable loss, and it's just impossible to imagine so many people lost in one place.\"\n\nIt is hard to say whether the spate of deaths at the Isabella Geriatric Center, in Manhattan, is the worst nursing home outbreak yet in the U.S., because even within the city facilities have chosen to report fatalities in different ways. An official state tally of nursing home deaths listed only 13 at the home as of Friday.\n\nBut officials at the 705-bed center confirmed that through Wednesday 46 residents who tested positive for COVID-19 had died as well as an additional 52 people \"suspected\" to have the virus. Some died at the nursing home and some died after being treated at hospitals.\n\nThe number of bodies became so overwhelming the home ordered a refrigerator truck to store them because funeral homes have been taking days to pick up the deceased.\n\n\"Isabella, like all other nursing homes in New York City, initially had limited access to widespread and consistent in-house testing to quickly diagnose our residents and staff,\" Audrey Waters, a spokeswoman for the nursing home, wrote in an email. \"This hampered our ability to identify those who were infected and asymptomatic, despite our efforts to swiftly separate anyone who presented symptoms.\"\n\nIsabella also encountered staffing shortages, prompting it to hire from outside agencies and early challenges securing personal protective equipment for employees. Waters said the home finally is \"getting more access to testing\" now.\n\nThe nursing home's death toll was first reported by local cable news station NY1.\n\nNursing homes have been known since the earliest days of the outbreak as a trouble spot. They have been particularly hard hit in New York, which has had at least 3,043 nursing home deaths -- by far the most in the nation -- as of Wednesday, according to an Associated Press count.\n\nThe state Department of Health said it has received \"outbreak reports\" from 239 nursing homes, including at least six facilities with death tolls of 40 patients or more.\n\n\"The one thing we now know about the nursing homes is the status quo cannot continue to say the least,\" de Blasio said. \"Something very different has to happen.\"\n\nCity officials are \"trying to provide help in every way we can,\" the mayor added, saying the city had delivered thousands of respirator masks to the Washington Heights facility.\n\nThe nursing home said it \"could not speculate\" as to why a state survey previously listed only 13 COVID-19 deaths at its facility. It sent a lengthy statement to AP on Friday insisting it \"truthfully and accurately reported\" its death toll to state officials.\n\nThe nursing home also said it kept family members in the loop about changes in their loved ones' conditions despite the circumstances.\n\n\"When we believe their loved one is nearing death, we do reach out to a resident's primary contact and ask if they would like to say goodbye in person or via phone or an app,\" Waters said. \"In-person goodbye visits were never interrupted and continue to happen.\"\n\n-- --\n\nAssociated Press writer Marina Villeneuve and investigative researcher Randy Herschaft contributed to this report.",

    "NY's Cuomo criticized over highest nursing home death toll": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "NEW YORK -- New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who has won bipartisan praise for rallying supplies for his ravaged hospitals and helping slow the coronavirus, is coming under increasing criticism for not bringing that same level of commitment to a problem that has so far stymied him: nursing homes.\n\nIn part-lecture, part-cheerleading briefings that have made him a Democratic counter to President Donald Trump, Cuomo has often seemed dismissive and resigned to defeat when asked about his state leading the nation in nursing home deaths.\n\n\"We've tried everything to keep it out of a nursing home, but it's virtually impossible,\" Cuomo told reporters. \"Now is not the best time to put your mother in a nursing home. That is a fact.\"\n\nResidents' relatives, health care watchdogs and lawmakers from both parties cite problems with testing and transparency that have prevented officials -- and the public -- from grasping the full scale of the catastrophe.\n\nAnd they are second-guessing a state directive that requires nursing homes take on new patients infected with COVID-19 -- an order they say accelerated outbreaks in facilities that are prime breeding grounds for infectious diseases.\n\n\"The way this has been handled by the state is totally irresponsible, negligent and stupid,\" said Elaine Mazzotta, a nurse whose mother died last month of suspected COVID-19 at a Long Island nursing home. \"They knew better. They shouldn't have sent these people into nursing homes.\"\n\nOf the nation's more than 25,000 coronavirus deaths in nursing homes and long-term care facilities, more than a fifth of them -- about 5,300 -- are in New York, according to a count by The Associated Press, and the toll has been increasing by an average of 20 to 25 deaths a day for the past few weeks.\n\n\"The numbers, the deaths keep ticking up,\" said MaryDel Wypych, an advocate for older adults in the Rochester area. \"It's just very frustrating.\"\n\nCuomo faced criticism at a recent briefing for saying that providing masks and gowns to nursing homes is \"not our job\" because the homes are privately owned.\n\n\"It was such an insensitive thing to say,\" said state Assemblyman Ron Kim, a Queens Democrat who noted that it wasn't until just this past week that New York and neighboring states announced a plan to combine forces to buy protective gear and medical supplies for nursing homes.\n\n\"If we had focused on that early on,\" he said, \"we could have saved a lot of lives.\"\n\nCuomo's administration defended its response to the crisis, saying it has provided more than 10 million pieces of protective equipment to nursing homes and created a database of 95,000 workers who have helped out in hundreds of New York homes.\n\n\"This was an overwhelming situation for everyone,\" said Jim Malatras, who serves on the governor's COVID-19 task force. \"There were deaths and it's unfortunate. But it doesn't mean we weren't aggressive.\"\n\nOne key criticism is that New York took weeks after the first known care home outbreaks to begin publicly reporting the number of deaths in individual homes -- and still doesn't report the number of cases. By the time New York began disclosing the deaths in the middle of last month, the state had several major outbreaks with at least 40 deaths each, most of which were a surprise to the surrounding communities and even some family members.\n\n\"They should have announced to the public: 'We have a problem in nursing homes. We're going to help them, but you need to know where it is,'\" said former New York Lt. Gov. Betsy McCaughey, a Republican who now heads the nonprofit Committee to Reduce Infection Deaths. \"Instead, they took the opposite tack: They hid it.\"\n\nFurther, there has been a lack of testing in several recent New York outbreaks, including one that killed 98 residents, many of whom died with COVID-19 symptoms without ever being tested.\n\nUnlike West Virginia, New York has not mandated testing in its more than 1,150 nursing homes and long-term care facilities. Nor has Cuomo followed the lead of such states as Maryland, Florida, Tennessee and Wisconsin in dispatching National Guard teams to homes to conduct testing, triage and some care.\n\nTo be sure, it's difficult to gauge the impact of such actions. While those states reported fewer nursing home deaths than New York, several have a larger share of nursing home deaths out of their state's totals than New York's 25 percent.\n\n\"No state is doing even close to an adequate job,\" said Elaine Ryan, AARP's vice president for state advocacy.\n\nNew York has faced particular scrutiny for a March 25 state health department directive requiring nursing homes to take recovering coronavirus patients.\n\n\"A number of nursing homes have felt constrained by the order and admitted hospital discharged patients without knowing what their COVID status was,\" said Chris Laxton, executive director of the Society for Post-Acute and Long-Term Care Medicine. \"This order made an already difficult situation almost impossible.\"\n\nThe order, similar to one in neighboring New Jersey, was intended to help free up hospital beds for the sickest patients as cases surged. But critics have suggested nursing homes were already overwhelmed and a better solution might have been sending them to the virtually empty Jacob K. Javits Convention Center, which was retrofitted to treat COVID-19 patients, or an even less utilized Navy hospital ship that has since left Manhattan.\n\nAs the virus was racing through his nursing home, the head of Brooklyn's Cobble Hill Health Center frantically emailed state health officials April 9 asking just that.\n\n\"Is there a way for us to send our suspected covid cases to the Javitz center or the ship?\" Donny Tuchman wrote.\n\nTuchman said he was denied permission. Eventually, more than 50 residents at his home would die.\n\nAdded the lawmaker Kim: \"We could have figured out how to isolate these folks. We failed to do that.\"\n\nRich Azzopardi, a senior advisor to Cuomo, said controversy over use of the convention center and the hospital ship is a \"red herring\" because patients discharged to nursing homes were \"outside of what the feds would accept\" at those facilities.\n\nA state Health Department spokeswoman added the state is not tracking how many COVID-infected patients were admitted to nursing homes under the directive but homes should not take on new patients if they are \"not medically prepared\" to meet their needs.\n\n\"Throwing in new residents who may or may not have been stable at that point could not possibly have been to the benefit of any facility,\" said Dr. Roy Goldberg, medical director of the Kings Harbor Multicare Center, a nursing home in the Bronx that has seen 56 deaths.\n\n-- --\n\nAssociated Press reporter Candice Choi and investigative news researcher Randy Herschaft contributed to this report from New York.",

        "authors": [],
        "body": "New York City-run health clinics will soon take a new tack on coronavirus testing, using a procedure that lets people collect samples themselves at a health care worker's direction, Mayor Bill de Blasio announced Monday.\n\nHe said the \"self-swab\" tests would allow for more and easier testing and make it safer for test-seekers and health care workers alike.\n\n\"This is something we're going to start using aggressively because it will be better for everyone,\" the Democrat said.\n\nUp to this point, testing has mainly been done by health care workers inserting a swab deep into a person's nostrils. The feeling often makes someone sneeze or cough while the health care professional is right there, city Health and Hospitals President Dr. Mitchell Katz said.\n\nThe new method is set to start within the next few days at eight community testing sites around the city. The process will work like this: A health care worker will explain how to administer the test, and then the person would go into another area, take a nasal swab and spit into a cup for a second sample for cross-checking. The samples will then be given to a health care worker and tested.\n\nDe Blasio said the method would allow health care workers and test-seekers to keep more distance; reduce the need to devote health care workers to administering tests, and allow the clinics to administer as many as 20 tests and hour, instead of 15.\n\nSo far, more than 5,000 people have been tested at the city-run community sites since April 17.\n\nThe new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms for most people. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness or death.",

        "authors": [],
        "body": "NEW YORK -- New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio oversaw the dispersal of a large, tightly packed Hasidic Jewish funeral and lashed out at the mourners who had gathered in defiance of social distancing rules intended to curb the spread of the coronavirus.\n\n\"My message to the Jewish community, and all communities, is this simple: the time for warnings has passed,\" de Blasio tweeted Tuesday after police dispersed the funeral in the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn.\n\nIn another tweet, de Blasio said, \"Something absolutely unacceptable happened in Williamsburg tonite: a large funeral gathering in the middle of this pandemic.\" He said he went there to ensure that the crowd was broken up and added, \"what I saw WILL NOT be tolerated so long as we are fighting the Coronavirus.\"\n\nImages posted on social media show hundreds of people on the street for what was reportedly a funeral for a rabbi who had died of COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus. Some but not all of the mourners wore face coverings.\n\nA police spokesman said Wednesday that the crowd was dispersed without arrests.\n\nCritics accused de Blasio of singling out the Orthodox Jewish community for censure when others have violated social distancing rules as well.\n\n\"This has to be a joke,\" City Councilman Chaim Deutsch, who represents a large Orthodox Jewish constituency, tweeted. \"Did the Mayor of NYC really just single out one specific ethnic community (a community that has been the target of increasing hate crimes in HIS city) being noncompliant??\"\n\nAnti-Defamation League CEO Jonathan Greenblatt tweeted that generalizing about the whole Jewish population of New York City \"is outrageous especially when so many are scapegoating Jews.\"\n\nOthers noted the crowds that gathered earlier Tuesday to watch a flyover by the Navy's Blue Angels and the Air Force's Thunderbirds to honor health-care workers.\n\n\"Only bigots have a problem when a few 100 Hasidim do what thousands of people in the same city have done the same day (not social distance).\" the Orthodox Jewish Public Affairs Council tweeted.\n\nThe coronavirus causes only mild symptoms in many, but it can cause serious illness or death for some, particularly older adults and those with certain health conditions.\n\nIn the months since the virus began spreading across the world, adherence to social distancing guidelines has been a challenge in some Orthodox Jewish communities, where large families often live in crowded neighborhoods and trust in secular authorities is low.\n\nLeaders of several U.S. Orthodox organizations issued a statement last month urging their members to heed social distancing rules after the Fire Department had to break up a large Orthodox wedding in Brooklyn. That effort was an unusual step among disparate groups to help shut down multiple daily prayers and other traditional practices that are central to many Orthodox Jews' daily lives.\n\nHowever, the New York \"Jewish community\" that de Blasio addressed in his tweets is significantly larger than the Hasidic groups that live and pray in large numbers in Williamsburg as well as the Crown Heights and Boro Park neighborhoods of Brooklyn.\n\nNew York's Jewish population is estimated at 1 million-plus, including non-observant Jews. Among American Jews, 10% identify as Orthodox, according to a 2013 study by the nonpartisan Pew Research Center. The majority of Jews identify with the Reform Jewish movement or do not identify with any specific Jewish group.\n\nThe Israeli city of Bnei Brak became a coronavirus hot spot after some ultra-Orthodox community members flouted orders to stay home.\n\nAssociated Press correspondent Elana Schor contributed to this report.",

        "body": "NEW YORK -- New York City will offer free coronavirus tests at the city's 169 nursing homes and will provide staff to replace nursing home employees who test positive for the virus, Mayor Bill de Blasio said Wednesday.\n\n\"To me this comes down to, the seniors in our lives, what they have given us, what they mean to us, and what we owe to them, what we owe to them in terms of making sure they are healthy, making sure they are safe, always being there for them,\" de Blasio said.\n\nThe announcement comes after some 3,000 residents of nursing homes in the city have died of COVID-19, including those confirmed whose diagnoses were by lab tests and those for whom COVID-19 was the presumed cause based on symptoms.\n\nDe Blasio noted that the state is in charge of regulating nursing homes, but said the city would start a \"two-week blitz\" to provide up to 3,000 tests a day to residents and employees at the facilities.\n\nHe said the city already has sent 240 fill-in staff members to replace nursing home employees who tested positive for the virus and must stay home for two weeks. The city will fulfill additional staffing requests by the end of next week, he said.\n\nAdditionally, 10 \"outbreak response teams\" will be available to assist nursing homes and adult care facilities that are experiencing coronavirus flareups, de Blasio said.\n\nNew York Gov. Andrew Cuomo on May 10 ordered twice-weekly testing for all staffers at nursing homes and other adult care facilities. The order doesn't apply to residents.\n\nNew York will allow small religious gatherings starting Thursday as the state gradually loosens restrictions, Gov. Andrew Cuomo said.\n\nReligious gatherings of up to 10 people will be allowed statewide as long as participants wear masks and practice social distancing. The state also is allowing drive-in and parking lot services.\n\nThe state will work with an Interfaith Advisory Council to discuss proposals to safely bring back religious services. The council consists of dozens of religious leaders, including Cardinal Timothy Dolan and Rev. Dr. Calvin Butts.\n\n\"I understand their desire to get to religious ceremonies as soon as possible. As a former altar boy, I get it,\" Cuomo said. \"But we need to find out how to do it and do it safely and do it smartly. The last thing we want to do is have a religious ceremony that winds up having more people infected.\"\n\nThe Bronx has been hit harder by the coronavirus than any other place in the New York City metropolitan area.\n\nAnd within the Bronx, almost no place has been hit as hard as Co-op City. Data released by city health officials Monday revealed that the virus has killed at least 155 people living in the zip code that covers the complex.",

        "body": "NEW YORK -- After an outcry over racial disparities in New York City's enforcement of social distancing, the mayor planned Sunday to double the ranks of non-police workers trying to persuade people to comply with the policy.\n\nThe number of city workers deployed as \"social distancing ambassadors\" will soon grow from around 1,000 to 2,300, Mayor Bill de Blasio said.\n\n\"More and more, the emphasis will be on a communicative\" approach, the Democrat said. \"The last thing we want to see is enforcement if there's any other way to get the job done.\"\n\nThe city didn't immediately have information on social distancing arrests or summonses, if any, over the weekend. De Blasio reiterated there have been relatively few but that they need to be issued \"fairly and consistently in all communities.\"\n\nCriticism has arisen along with videos of violent arrests -- including scenes of a police officer running at a black man and throwing him to the ground for mouthing off and an officer punching a man in the head as he lay pinned to a sidewalk -- and statistics on the racial breakdown of police action taken in the name of curbing the spread of the COVID-19 virus.\n\nNew York City police department data released Friday showed that of the 374 summonses issued through May 5 for violating distancing orders, 52% were given to black people and 30% to Hispanic people.\n\nThe mayor on Friday called those statistics \"an indicator that something's wrong we need to fix.\" He pledged more training and clearer protocols for officers.\n\nCiting such numbers, police reform advocates have pressed the city to stop using police to enforce rules that require people to wear masks and stay 6 feet (2 meters) apart from anyone who doesn't live in their own household.\n\nDe Blasio said Friday that police officers would start limiting access to three New York City parks where passers-by have captured -- and shared -- images of predominantly white, young people gathering without masks.\n\nThe city's social distancing enforcement has also brought complaints from some Hasidic Jews after police broke up large public funerals in Brooklyn. And civil rights advocates raised questions after police issued at least one social distancing summons at a small protest organized by an LGBT group outside a Manhattan hospital last weekend.\n\nFor most people, the new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness and lead to death.",

        "authors": [],
        "body": "FLAGSTAFF, Ariz. -- Residents of the Navajo Nation will be under the strictest weekend lockdown yet, with grocery stores and gas stations closed, and even essential workers ordered to stay home.\n\nNavajo President Jonathan Nez made the announcement after a spike in deaths that he attributed to shifting traffic patterns after the city of Gallup recently shut down to outside visitors. That lockdown in northwestern New Mexico has since ended.\n\nOn the Navajo Nation, residents will face citations, with potential fines and jail time, if they leave their homes during the lockdown, which starts Friday night and ends Monday around dawn. Nez urged people to listen and not pack their bags to head out of town during the lockdown.\n\n\"Stay home, that's the bottom line. There's nothing wrong with staying home and taking care of your home, taking care of your family members,\" a frustrated Nez said Thursday. \"We need to be able to recognize that what you do affects everybody.\"\n\nWhile the state of Arizona has loosened its restrictions on residents and businesses, the Navajo Nation has clamped down. The tribe already has daily nighttime curfews and requires people to wear masks when out in public. Government offices are closed or have limited services. The tribe's stay-at-home order has been extended to June 7, while Arizona's expired Friday.\n\nAs of Thursday, the tribe reported 127 deaths and 3,632 positive coronavirus cases since it first began tracking the figures. More than 500 people have recovered, tribal health officials said.\n\nLoretta Christensen, the chief medical officer for the Navajo-area Indian Health Service, said the reservation's three largest hospitals hit capacity last week -- in line with expected predictions -- and a significant number of patients were transferred off the reservation.\n\n\"We're still getting cases across the area, but not at the velocity we did before,\" she said in a call with reporters Thursday.\n\nPeople who have tested positive but no longer need to be hospitalized are being encouraged to stay in one of three isolation centers set up in basketball gyms on and off the reservation to protect their families. Isolation tents also are available for those who would rather not leave their property, Christensen said.\n\nFor most people, the new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia, and death.\n\nMcKinley County, which includes Gallup, had been the hot spot on the reservation because of a recent outbreak at a detox center. Apache County in Arizona surpassed it with the most COVID-19 cases on the reservation, according to the Thursday figures.\n\nApache County had 948 positive cases, while McKinley County had 928, tribal officials said. Navajo County in Arizona had 757 cases, and San Juan County in New Mexico had 428. Six other counties in Arizona, New Mexico and Utah had smaller numbers.\n\nThe Navajo Nation's total cases include 99 that previously weren't included because they took longer than usual to verify. Tribal officials also cited jurisdictional challenges.",

        "body": "SAN DIEGO -- Navy SEAL recruits and their instructors are being tested for the coronavirus as the candidates in one of the military's most grueling programs return to training with new social distancing guidelines, a top official said Tuesday.\n\nEveryone in the first phase of training will be tested to try to detect if anyone is infected but asymptomatic, Capt. Bart Randall said. The rapid tests to be administered this week to 170 recruits and instructors are part of a defense department pilot project.\n\n\"Ideally we'll get any asymptomatic shedders out of the population to help keep the rest of the guys safe,\" said Randall, the Naval Special Warfare Center's commodore.\n\nThe recruits returned to training Monday after classes were paused March 16 as leaders established safety standards amid the pandemic.\n\nThere are noticeable differences.\n\nEach recruit is checked daily for symptoms of the virus. Instructors are wearing masks and surgical gloves and shouting into megaphones rather than recruits' faces. Only a limited number of SEAL trainees are allowed into classrooms at a time or during swims and runs.\n\nNo positive cases have been found so far at the training school for the SEAL recruits or candidates for special warfare boat operators, Randall said.\n\nAnyone showing symptoms of the virus will be immediately pulled from training and evaluated by a medical team and placed into quarantine if determined to be a potential case, Randall said.\n\nThe basic SEAL training program in Coronado, across the bay from San Diego, tests participants' physical and psychological strength along with water competency and leadership skills.\n\nThe program is the first in-person evaluation of a candidate who desires to become a Navy SEAL officer, and it allows sailors to compete against peers in an equitable training environment.\n\nThe 65-week program is so grueling that 75% of candidates drop out by the end of the first month. That's when trainees undergo what is known as Hell Week when recruits are pushed to the limit with little sleep.\n\nMedical crews will be watching closely this year to ensure any coughs or other flu-like symptoms that often are produced by the strenuous workouts are not a sign of the coronavirus, Randall said.\n\nFor most people, the coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks.

        "authors": [],
        "body": "The acting Navy secretary said Wednesday he has ordered a broader investigation into the circumstances of the spread of the novel coronavirus aboard the aircraft carrier USS Theodore Roosevelt, effectively delaying a decision on the Navy's recommendation that Capt. Brett Crozier be reinstated as the ship's commander.\n\nThe announcement of a broader investigation comes days after the Navy's top leadership had recommended the unprecedented step of reinstating Crozier to command of his ship, and Defense Secretary Mark Esper requested the written results of the Navy's initial inquiry.\n\n\"After carefully reviewing the preliminary inquiry into the events surrounding the COVID-19 outbreak aboard USS Theodore Roosevelt (CVN 71), the Chief of Naval Operations, Adm. Mike Gilday, provided me with his recommendations,\" said James McPherson, the acting Secretary of the Navy in a statement.\n\nTune into ABC at 1 p.m. ET and ABC\n\nLive at 4 p.m. ET every weekday for special coverage of the novel coronavirus with the full ABC News team, including the latest news, context and analysis.\n\n\"Following our discussion, I have unanswered questions that the preliminary inquiry has identified and that can only be answered by a deeper review,\" said McPherson..\n\n\"Therefore, I am directing Adm. Gilday to conduct a follow-on command investigation,\" he said. \"This investigation will build on the good work of the initial inquiry to provide a more fulsome understanding of the sequence of events, actions, and decisions of the chain of command surrounding the COVID-19 outbreak aboard USS Theodore Roosevelt.\"\n\nThe announcement means there will be a delay on any decision regarding Crozier's future as well as any other potential actions that might result from the investigation into the spread of the virus aboard the ship.\n\nNearly 1,000 sailors among the ship's crew of more than 4,800 have tested positive for COVID-19 and one sailor died from complications from the disease. On Wednesday, the Navy's Seventh Fleet announced that hundreds of sailors who had been quarantined on Guam would reboard the ship to swap out with sailors who had remained on board to disinfect the ship.\n\nThe launching of a broader investigation comes after a meeting on Friday where McPherson and Gilday met with Esper to discuss the results of the Navy's initial inquiry.\n\nA U.S. official told ABC News that at the meeting Gilday had recommended to Esper that Crozier be reinstated to the command he lost a few weeks ago after writing a letter to Navy leadership requesting more help in stemming the spread of coronavirus aboard his ship, but no final decisions resulted from the meeting.\n\nThrough a spokesman Esper later announced that he would review a written copy of the Navy's inquiry before proceeding with any next steps.\n\nA senior Defense official told ABC News the Navy's inquiry is focused on more than just Crozier -- it's examining the complex timeline of communications and response efforts by Navy officers across different commands to help address the coronavirus outbreak on the carrier as it approached a scheduled port of call in Guam. Modly had criticized Crozier for leaving the impression that the Navy was not already speeding up efforts to find adequate quarantine facilities on the island for the more than 4.,800 sailors on the carrier.\n\nSpeaking of the Navy's initial review into the matter the official said \"the Secretary wants to ensure that the report is thorough and can stand up under the rightful scrutiny of Congress, the media, the families and crew of the Theodore Roosevelt, and the American people.\"\n\nShould Crozier eventually be reinstated, Navy officials believe it would be the first time a ship's commander has been reinstated to command after having beenrelieved because of a loss of confidence.\n\nCrozier was relieved of command three weeks ago by Modly, who said the ship's captain had shown \"poor judgment\" in writing a letter asking for more Navy assistance to stem an outbreak of the novel coronavirus on his ship.\n\nModly said the letter, later published in a newspaper, created unnecessary worries for the families of sailors aboard the ship and made it sound as if the Navy wasn't already making preparations to find quarantine facilities for the crew on Guam.\n\nModly resigned a day after he made controversial remarks in Guam to the crew of the aircraft carrier USS Theodore Roosevelt about their fired captain, for being \"either too na\u00efve or too stupid\" to not think his letter would have become public.\n\nEsper named Under Secretary of the Army James McPherson as Modly's temporary replacement.\n\nAccording to the Navy's latest figures, the peak number of Roosevelt crew members who tested positive for COVID-19, peaked at 955 sailors, nearly 20% of the 4,865 sailors aboard.\n\nChief Petty Officer Charles Robert Thacker Jr., 41, an aviation ordnanceman from Fort Smith, Arkansas, died from complications from the coronavirus two weeks ago.\n\nCrozier has also tested positive for the virus and remains in self-isolation on Guam after experiencing mild symptoms and remains on Guam. .\n\nIn Crozier's letter, published by the San Francisco Chronicle, he requested that 10% of the crew remain aboard the carrier to carry out essential services and that the majority should be placed in quarantine on Guam, where the ship remains in port.\n\nAs it turns out, more than 85% of the ship's crew was eventually taken off the ship and placed in quarantine, approaching the number Crozier initially requested.",

Gavin Newsom and Mayor Eric Garcetti. Both officials were making grim predictions that LA could soon look like New York City, the epicenter of the U.S. outbreak, and Garcetti noted the ship immediately became his city's largest hospital.\n\nThat day may have been the high-water mark for the Mercy, which suffered a virus outbreak among its crew and was the target of a train engineer who hijacked a locomotive and crashed it near the ship. He told investigators the vessel was part of a government plot.\n\nUltimately, Los Angeles hasn't been overrun with virus cases, and so the Mercy has not had to play its envisioned role of being a safety net in order to allow hospitals to focus on treating those infected with the virus.\n\nThe Mercy is not alone: As virus infections have slowed or fell short of worst-case predictions, the globe is dotted with unused or barely used temporary hospitals. The Navy's other hospital ship, the USNS Comfort, left New York on Thursday as the outlook improves there. It treated 182 patients.\n\nSince arriving at the end of March, the Mercy has treated just over 70 non-coronavirus patients for everything from heart and lung conditions to gastrointestinal problems. On Thursday, it had just nine patients on board. Its 750 medical crew members cycle through to provide treatment but otherwise are staying at local hotels to avoid another outbreak.\n\nEven with hundreds of empty beds, there are no plans to send the Mercy home to San Diego.\n\n\"We're encouraged by data which suggest the curve is flattening, but the threat remains,\" the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or FEMA, said in a statement. \"When appropriate, we will work with the city and state to determine if the mission is complete.\"\n\nBrian Ferguson, a spokesman for the California governor's Office of Emergency Services, said talks are ongoing about how the ship's medical workers can be used elsewhere.\n\nOfficials around the world have offered similar assessments of other temporary hospitals: Their lack of use reflected the need to over-prepare, and they could still be used in a second wave.\n\nBut the longer the Mercy stays in port with few patients, the harder it will be to justify the costs, said Bryan Clark, a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute, a conservative-leaning Washington, D.C.-based think tank.\n\n\"There was a need to reassure people that something was being done, and hospital ships are very good for that,\" said Clark, a former special assistant to the chief of naval operations.\n\nBut he warned: \"Once its need passes, it can turn from a symbol of commitment to a symbol of inefficiency.''\n\nFEMA estimates the Mercy's mission will cost it about $7.5 million, though the final bill will not be known until the assignment's been completed, the agency said in an email to The Associated Press.\n\nMilitary officials did not immediately provide a figure for costs on their end.\n\nAccording to a military briefing document to the U.S. Northern Command obtained by the AP, the defense secretary approved $3.5 million for the Mercy to help cover expenses starting April 20 for the following month.\n\nThe Mercy's Capt. John Rotruck said the ship can accept more patients. But those decisions are up to federal, state and local officials, and the health care facilities.\n\n\"We just haven't had a request,\" he said.\n\nAnd the Mercy does have limitations. It can accept only patients not infected with the coronavirus and who are mobile.\n\nThe Navy recently expanded its mission by sending 40 doctors, nurses and corpsmen, most of whom were on standby to serve on the ship, to a state-run, skilled nursing facility near Los Angeles, and more personnel are available, Rotruck said.\n\nFor most people, the new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness and lead to death, and nursing homes have been hit hard.\n\nThis is not the first time Navy hospital ships have been criticized for being underused; the Comfort was when it was deployed in 2017 to hurricane-ravaged Puerto Rico.\n\nIn the pandemic, the Comfort also took flak because it was initially not allowed to treat virus patients, even as hospitals in New York City became overrun.\n\nFollowing the outcry, the ship did end up treating COVID-19 patients.\n\nNew York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said this week federal \"protocol\" also prevented the ship from accepting residents of a Brooklyn nursing home that lost 55 people to the virus.\n\nNonetheless, Cuomo said the ship had saved lives.\n\nThe 894-foot-long (272 meter-long) converted supertankers are the largest military hospital ships in the world. They were built in the 1980s to treat war casualties; they have assisted after major natural disasters.\n\nWhile their capabilities run the gambit from treating bomb injuries to replacing pacemakers, the ships' wide-open treatment bays are not designed to handle highly infectious diseases that require keeping patients far apart.\n\nStill, President Donald Trump said the ships were proving so valuable that the government was looking to build two more of a similar size. Experts believe smaller, faster ships would better serve today's needs.\n\nThe Mercy, meanwhile, has been reconfigured as nine crew members recovered from the outbreak.\n\nAbout 300 to 400 crew members come on board daily to staff 250 beds, staggered over three shifts. While not on board, some crew drive vans to pick up doctors at hospitals or do in-take when new patients are transferred, Rotruck said.\n\nSome are taking time off, having worked long hours when the ship was treating about 20 patients a day, Rotruck said.\n\n\"We were able to be a relief valve in anticipation of something that didn't quite get as bad as anybody thought that it might,\" he said.\n\nAssociated Press writers Michael R. Sisak in New York and James LaPorta in Florida contributed to this report.",

    "Nazi slogan sign displayed at 're-open Illinois' rally ripped by Auschwitz Memorial, Gov. J.B. Pritzker": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "A sign displayed by an anti-lockdown protester at a demonstration in Chicago was blasted by the Auschwitz Museum and Memorial, and the governor of Illinois as a slogan of hate once used in Nazi death camps.\n\nThe protest drew hundreds of people to downtown Chicago, most waving American flags and holding signs calling for Gov. J.B. Pritzker to end his coronavirus stay-at-home orders and jump-start the economy. But one unidentified protester was singled out as stepping over an anti-Semitic line by holding a handwritten sign reading, \"Arbeit macht frei,JB.\" In German, the phrase \"Arbeit macht frei\" means \"work sets you free\" and was used by the Nazis to get concentration camp prisoners to work under the false belief they would be spared from death.\n\nA photo of the sign shot by a registered nurse, Dennis Kosuth, who was participating in a counterprotest, quickly went viral and got the attention of the Auschwitz Museum and Memorial in Poland.\n\n\"'Arbeit macht frei' was a false, cynical illusion the SS gave to prisoners of #Auschwitz. Those words became one of the icons of human hatred. It's painful to see this symbol instrumentalized & used again to spread hate. It's a symptom of moral & intellectual degeneration,\" reads the tweet from the museum and memorial.\n\nThe Nazis even placed the words on the gates of the Auschwitz concentration camp and other death camps.\n\nPritzker, who is of Jewish descent, denounced the protester for carrying the sign at Friday's rally in front of the governor's office at the James R. Thompson Center in Chicago as well as several other demonstrators he said carried signs containing swastikas, including one referring to the governor \"Heil Pritzker.\"\n\n''The people who were protesting -- there were quite a number of people who seem to have been carrying signs filled with hate,\" Pritzker said in a tweet on Saturday. \"There were people carrying signs with swastikas on them. The meaning of that swastika is apparently unknown to the people who are carrying it, or if it is known, it is a demonstration of the hate that is among us.\"\n\nPritzker also took to Twitter to condemn such Nazi symbols being used at what organizers had billed as a peaceful protest.\n\n\"I've spent decades of my life fighting against bigotry & hatred,\" Pritzker tweeted, adding that he worked with Holocaust survivors to help raise money for a Holocaust museum in Chicago that was dedicated in 2017.\n\nDuring a coronavirus press briefing on Saturday, Pritzker noted that only a few of the several hundred protesters displayed messages of hate.\n\nThe demonstration, one of several protests throughout the state this weekend against Pritzker's stay-at-home orders, came as the number of coronavirus cases in Illinois climbed to 58,505, with 2,559 deaths, according to the latest data released Saturday by the Illinois Department of Public Health.\n\nWhile Pritzker said he understands the frustration of the protesters, many who have had to go on unemployment due to nonessential businesses being closed, he added that the drastic measures he's taken are to keep people safe and prevent the virus, formally known as COVID-19, from spreading.\n\n\"I'll defend to the death their right to be wrong and to say it out loud, but the fact is that if they look at the facts the experts are trying to protect them, and the elected officials that stand on the right side of this are trying to protect them,\" Pritzker said.\n\nBut protesters say that the stay-at-home orders have gone on too long and Pritzker has overstepped his authority.\n\n\"The governor has gone beyond his legal authority to order citizens of the state to do anything,\" protester Ben Bierly, a Republican candidate for the Illinois state Senate, told reporters at the rally.\n\nAnother protester, Tony Peraicam, a former Cook County commissioner, added: \"We are still the land of the free. We are still independent people who can think for themselves.\"\n\nSimilar anti-lockdown protests have occurred throughout the country, including large demonstrations drawing several thousand people in Michigan, Pennsylvania, California, Oregon and Arizona.",

    "New Jersey, other states, work to fight virus misinformation": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "TRENTON, N.J. -- New Jersey's top homeland security official received nearly nonstop calls in early March from grocery chains, trucking companies and other logistics firms wanting to know if rumors of an impending national lockdown were true.\n\nThey weren't, and Jared Maples soon learned the companies were reacting to misinformation stemming from text messages shared widely across the country.\n\nFederal officials debunked the messages, but Maples said the whole episode was a \"whoa\" moment for him and other state officials. Weeks later, New Jersey launched a website aimed at debunking misinformation and rumors about COVID-19.\n\n\"Misinformation is out there. You can't take everything at face value,\" Maples, director of the state's homeland security and preparedness office, told The Associated Press in an interview. \"If you hear a rumor, we want people to realize that there's a place to go (to check it out.)\"\n\nNew Jersey's effort mirrors a rumor-control site set up by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, and is part of efforts underway in other states to combat conspiracy theories, hoaxes and bogus treatment claims that have erupted during the pandemic.\n\nWashington state, for example, created an online guide to identifying and avoiding coronavirus misinformation. Other states and municipalities have set up hotlines that offer information about symptoms and testing, while also dispelling rumors and false claims.\n\n\"The next time your friend texts you, or you see something up on Facebook, you can point them to the truth,\" Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti said last month when his city announced two new websites designed to offer accurate information about the outbreak.\n\nThe many still unanswered questions about the coronavirus and its origins have fueled a number of misleading and false claims about the outbreak and the government's response to it, state leaders and misinformation experts say.\n\n\"We have a unique moment in time when everyone is thinking about the same thing,\" said Gordon Pennycook, an assistant professor of behavioral science at the University of Regina in Canada. \"It's the sort of thing that breeds falsehoods....People's lives are being disrupted. You can create things that people want to believe. ... so there's a lot working towards a market for (misinformation).\"\n\nThe text messages that led to confusion in New Jersey and other states warned of a national lockdown or military takeover. They claimed to be from a \"friend of a friend,\" and said that within 48 to 72 hours the president would order a two-week mandatory quarantine overseen by the National Guard. \"Stock up on whatever you guys need to make sure you have a two week supply of everything. Please forward to your network,\" said one.\n\nThere's no indication of who created the texts, though State Department officials have said individuals linked to the Chinese government helped spread them.\n\nAt times, President Donald Trump himself has helped circulate false claims about the virus. He's suggested untested treatments, musing aloud about the idea of injecting disinfectants, overstated the availability of tests and contradicted his administration's own experts.\n\nThe lack of consistent, accurate information from the White House has put further pressure on state leaders to confront what misinformation experts have termed \"an infodemic\" surrounding the outbreak.\n\n\"We need transparency and fact-based communications from our elected officials and from officials across government,\" Nina Jankowicz, a misinformation expert at the Wilson Center, a Washington D.C.-based think tank, said at a recent Congressional panel on virus misinformation. \"I fear that it's all being undermined when we have this inconsistent messaging and disregard for the facts coming from certain parts of government.\"\n\nMisinformation about a public health emergency can be especially dangerous if it causes people to try sham cures or ignore guidance from health experts. Following Trump's comments at a White House briefing about the possible curative effects of disinfectants, Maryland's emergency hotline received hundreds of calls from people asking if it was safe to drink bleach.\n\nThe state was forced to issue a warning against the idea, and Republican Gov. Larry Hogan urged Trump to \"make sure these press conferences are fact-based.\"\n\n\"They listen when the governor holds a press conference, and they certainly pay attention when the president of the United States is standing there giving a press conference about something as serious as this worldwide pandemic,\" Hogan said on ABC News. \"And I think when misinformation comes out or you just say something that pops in your head, it does send a wrong message.\"\n\nCompanies like Facebook, Google and Twitter have implemented new algorithms, rules and warnings in an effort to knock down harmful claims. New Jersey's new anti-misinformation website has a similar goal: debunking misinformation that could have an impact on the actions people take.\n\n\"We'll continue to publish only accurate and timely information,\" Maples says in a video clip on the state's website. \"Because that's how we're all going to get through this together.\"",

    "New Mexico extends lockdown for town that's a US hot spot": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "GALLUP, N.M. -- Traffic was almost nonexistent in this small New Mexico city, and just a handful of people waited their turn to get into grocery stores and other essential businesses. This place where rural residents from the largest American Indian reservation come to stock up on supplies is one of the nation's worst coronavirus hot spots, and the governor extended a lockdown Thursday to try to stem the spread.\n\nThe emergency declaration for Gallup, a gateway to the Navajo Nation, runs through noon Sunday. Patients have filled intensive care beds as COVID-19 infection rates here and in the surrounding county make the area one of the hardest hit by the pandemic. Health officials say per capita infections are 12 times that of New Mexico's largest city, Albuquerque.\n\nBusinesses will be closed from 8 p.m. to 8 a.m. Residents must stay at home except for emergencies. If they go out, they must wear face coverings to any essential business or government building.\n\nBut restrictions that blocked roadways into Gallup and prevented visitors from coming in are set to expire Friday evening.\n\nThe mayor asked Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham to extend the emergency declaration -- instituted under the state Riot Control Act -- to help turn the tide in the community. Its surge has pushed the statewide number of cases higher each day.\n\nHealth officials fear Gallup, a popular supply stop for rural residents of the nearby Navajo Nation, became a vector for transmission at stores, restaurants and water fill-up stations used by people from the surrounding areas. When first imposing the restrictions May 1, the governor said physical distancing was not being maintained.\n\nFederal health officials also linked the severity of the problem in Gallup to an early outbreak at a detox center, which was followed by infections among homeless people and nursing homes.\n\nAs of Thursday, McKinley County, where Gallup is located, had 1,402 confirmed coronavirus infections and 30 deaths. Intensive care beds are full at two hospitals, and patients with acute respiratory symptoms are being sent to Albuquerque.\n\nOfficers have blocked roads leading in and out of the city for the past week to restrict travel and business to emergency services and supplies, and only two people have been allowed per vehicle. On the north end of the city, vehicles lined up for more than a mile Thursday as drivers hoped to get through the checkpoint without realizing the emergency order had been extended.\n\nResidents had mixed feelings about the lockdown. Still, most people getting groceries or running other errands Thursday wore masks. More than a dozen cars lined up outside one of the city's hospitals awaiting COVID-19 testing.\n\nTom Gorman, a retired veteran who cares for his elderly mother, was waiting his turn to get groceries. He had no issues with the lockdown and thought officials should do more.\n\n\"I think people should be more careful and listen and comply. Otherwise we're just prolonging the issue,\" he said.\n\nKylor Davidson, 24, said he's been stressed about the outbreak because he lives with his grandparents, who are in their 80s, and he's considered an essential worker. He drives a couple dozen miles a day into Gallup to work at a pizza parlor. Working and helping his family has been tough, he said.\n\n\"I come home and I literally have to tell them not to touch me,\" Davidson said.\n\nMayor Louie Bonaguidi said the pace of infections has not fallen, though delays in test results make it hard to determine the success of the lockdown.\n\n\"Our concern was all of these people coming into town, that we're going to spread it,\" he said Wednesday. \"We don't want them taking it home to their families.\"\n\nHealth officials reported two new COVID-19 deaths in McKinley County on Thursday and 65 new infections -- the highest tallies among New Mexico's 33 counties.\n\nThe county is home to about 72,000 residents, including indigenous Zuni Pueblo and parts of the Navajo Nation.",

    "New coronavirus test is imperfect step toward mass screening": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "WASHINGTON -- A new type of coronavirus test offers a cheaper, quicker way to screen for infections, moving the U.S. toward the kind of mass screening that experts say is essential to returning millions of Americans to school and work.\n\nBut the first so-called antigen test -- announced Saturday by the Food and Drug Administration -- is not quite the kind sought by top government health officials. It is less accurate than the current gold standard for testing and can only be run on specialized equipment.\n\n\"It is too early to tell,\" said lab researcher Patricia Simner of Johns Hopkins University, assessing the test's impact. \"It certainly has the potential to aid in more widespread testing.\"\n\nThe new test screens for new infections but in a different way. The test from Quidel Corp. looks for protein traces of the virus -- known as antigens. The same approach is used in rapid tests for flu, strep throat and other infections that are run at the hospital or doctor's office. They represent a trade-off, sacrificing some of the accuracy of more rigorous tests for quicker results at a lower cost.\n\n\"They allow you to dramatically expand testing and they're very cheap,\" said Dr. Scott Gottlieb, the former FDA commissioner, in an interview Sunday with CBS. But he acknowledged antigen testing's reduced accuracy: \"They're going to miss some patients who have COVID.\"\n\nPreviously, the only way to diagnose active infections was a test that detects the genetic material of the virus. While highly accurate, most of those tests take hours to develop on machines mainly found at commercial labs, hospitals or universities. Abbott Laboratories makes a 15-minute version of the genetic test that runs on its portable machine, but it only does one sample at a time.\n\nWHY IS ANTIGEN TESTING IMPORTANT?\n\nThe U.S. is still struggling to increase testing to the levels that most public health experts say are essential. Harvard researchers have projected that the nation needs to be able to do 900,000 daily tests to be able to track new cases and contain new outbreaks as the country reopens. That's more than three times the country's current daily testing rate of about 275,000.\n\nWhite House adviser Dr. Deborah Birx and other federal officials have said a \"breakthrough\" in antigen testing could open the way to daily testing before going to back to work or school.\n\nThe National Institutes of Health is pouring $1.5 billion into efforts to develop highly accurate, easy-to-use tests that could be performed without professional oversight or special equipment. While an important stepping stone, the Quidel test isn't there yet.\n\nHOW DOES IT WORK?\n\nThe new test uses a nasal swab like other screening tests, and delivers results in about 15 minutes.\n\nThe sample is put in a tube with testing chemicals and then into a cassette that goes into the company's electronic reading device. There, it's exposed to a testing strip embedded with laboratory-made antibodies, the specific blood proteins made by the body's immune system when it detects an infection. If the antigens and antibodies interact, the test is positive.\n\nHOW ACCURATE IS THE TEST?\n\nThe new test is expected to detect about 80% of active COVID-19 infections, according to the FDA. That accuracy rate is similar to other rapid antigen tests for seasonal flu.\n\n\"They are going to pick up fewer people that are infected,\" said Simner of Johns Hopkins. \"So that's where you see a lot of skepticism around using antigen tests for the diagnosis of COVID-19.''\n\nFor now, Simner and other experts say negative test results for people showing symptoms should be confirmed with the more accurate genetic test.\n\n\"But as you might imagine, that's not a perfect scenario because you have to do twice as many tests when the result isn't positive,\" said Dr. Robin Patel of the Mayo Clinic.\n\nWHAT'S NEXT?\n\nMany companies are working on versions that would be more accurate, easier to use and more suitable for mass screenings.\n\nOraSure Technologies has a $700 million federal contract to develop a saliva-based antigen test that wouldn't require specialized equipment or professional supervision. The company has similar tests for other viruses -- including HIV and Ebola -- and those have accuracy rates of over 95%. Along with accuracy, the company is focused on speed, aiming to delivers results in 20 to 30 minutes.\n\n\"If you are going to test people coming into work you can't make them line up at 3 a.m.\" OraSure CEO Stephen Tang said. \"You need to be able to get their results quickly.\"\n\nFollow Matthew Perrone on Twitter: www.twitter.com/AP -- FDAwriter\n\n-- --\n\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute's Department of Science Education.

        "body": "MANAGUA, Nicaragua -- Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega blamed new coronavirus-related health monitoring measures taken by neighboring Costa Rica for his country's decision Monday to close their two border crossings.\n\nIn a nationally televised address, Ortega said more than 1,000 trucks were stranded on Nicaraguan highways. The dispute boiled over after Costa Rica on May 8 began testing all truck drivers entering the country for COVID-19.\n\nCosta Rica said 61 truckers had so far tested positive, most trying to enter from Nicaragua though some were also entering from Panama. The truckers are tested at the border before being allowed to continue. Those who test positive are forced to turn around. Those showing symptoms are rejected without a test.\n\n\"It isn't Nicaragua that has closed the border,\" Ortega said. \"It is Costa Rica (that has) with measures it began to take, to demand, to establish.\" He called the testing \"a pretext\" used by Costa Rican authorities.\n\nAt Costa Rica's southern border with Panama, truckers blocked traffic Monday to also protest the measures.\n\nCosta Rica's COVID-19 border testing policy was not only affecting regional trade and costing Nicaraguan businesses money, but the positive test results have been another piece of evidence suggesting the Ortega government's paltry reporting of COVID-19 cases lacks transparency.\n\nNicaragua has reported only 25 confirmed cases of the disease and eight related deaths. Those numbers have become more difficult to defend as more Nicaraguans speak out about the deaths of their relatives.\n\nOrtega's government has not implemented social distancing measures used elsewhere and continues to promote mass gatherings. Schools remain open and professional sporting events still draw fans.\n\nThe lack of action in neighboring Nicaragua has concerned Costa Rican officials who have so far demurred when asked about the public health threat the country poses.\n\nCosta Rica appears to have triggered Ortega's response by saying Friday that truckers bringing cargo to Costa Rica could leave it at the border and have Costa Rican drivers take it to the final destination. Those drivers transiting the country could still do so, but only after testing negative and with a police escort.\n\nThe Central American Council of Economic Integration Ministers discussed the measures Monday and asked Costa Rica to suspend its latest ones. Costa Rica proposed creating a regional protocol including bio-security measures and a working group to make sure commerce continues to flow freely.\n\nCosta Rica Foreign Trade Secretary Dyal\u00e1 Jim\u00e9nez said the other regional members complained that the measures were not approved by the regional body and therefore lacked legal standing.\n\n\"This situation complicated the possibility of arriving at regional agreements to quickly allow us to address the situation at our borders,\" she said.\n\nCosta Rican business groups have also complained about the effects of the measures on commerce. The Costa Rica Exporters Chamber said the government's actions Friday had a negative impact on more than 1,000 Costa Rica exporters.\n\nCosta Rica has 866 confirmed cases of the new coronavirus and 10 deaths.\n\nOrtega said he was willing to talk to his Costa Rican counterparts to find a solution, \"but it depends on Costa Rica.\"",

        "body": "MANAGUA, Nicaragua -- Nicaragua released more than 2,800 prisoners Wednesday, one day after the death of an inmate who reportedly had suffered from respiratory problems and while the government maintained there was no local spread of the coronavirus in the country.\n\nLoyda Valle, a friend of inmate Silvio P\u00e9rez's family, said his relatives were still awaiting his death certificate.\n\nThe government said in a statement that it was releasing the prisoners to house arrest as a gesture for upcoming Mother's Day, but also mentioned that the release included elderly inmates and those with chronic illnesses. It made no reference to COVID-19, which has emerged in prison populations around the world and poses a greater risk to people in those categories.\n\nValle, a member of an opposition coalition, said relatives had spoken to the 60-year-old P\u00e9rez a day before his death and he had told them he was starting to feel better. The government has not confirmed the death of P\u00e9rez, who was serving a sentence for drug trafficking.\n\nYonarqui Mart\u00ednez, a lawyer who did not represent P\u00e9rez but closely monitors prisoners, confirmed that the man was quickly buried Tuesday. He died in a Managua hospital that has become Nicaragua's primary care center for suspected COVID-19 cases.\n\nMartinez said at least 26 political prisoners have been reported to be suffering from symptoms of COVID-19.\n\n\"They have fever and severe respiratory problems, but they haven't taken them to the hospital or tested them for the coronavirus,\" she said.\n\nRelatives of political prisoner Uriel Jos\u00e9 P\u00e9rez reported to the Permanent Commission on Human Rights, a nongovernmental group, that the 29-year-old had been removed from the same prison in Tipitapa and hospitalized with severe pneumonia. They said he was in intensive care and on a ventilator.\n\nMart\u00ednez had requested release or change of detention conditions for 15 prisoners with chronic health conditions, but said 12 were rejected and three had not been answered.\n\nNearly half of the prisoners released Wednesday came from the Modelo prison in Tipitapa, where Mart\u00ednez said most of the ill political prisoners are held. None of the approximately 90 political prisoners detained and still held following anti-government protests that began in April 2018 was believed to have been included in the release.\n\nThe Nicaraguan government has only reported 25 confirmed COVID-19 cases and eight deaths, far lower than other countries in the region. Reports have emerged of \"express burials\" carried out by public hospitals without families being present and growing numbers of deaths classified as atypical pneumonia.",

    "Outbreak on edge of Navajo Nation overwhelms rural hospital": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "GALLUP, N.M. -- On the eve of New Mexico's shutdown of bars and restaurants to stem the spread of the coronavirus, the city of Gallup came alive for one last night of revelry.\n\nBefore the night was out in the desert oasis on the fringes of the Navajo Nation, 98 people were detained for public intoxication and sent to sober up at a detox center. Several homeless people also sought refuge in the same cinder block building, which doubles as a shelter. Somewhere in the mix, lurked the virus.\n\nThe outbreak seeded at the Na'Nizhoozhi Center would combine with the small, local hospital's ill-fated staffing decisions and its well-intentioned but potentially overambitious treatment plans to create a perfect storm that has overwhelmed doctors and nurses and paralyzed this community in the state's hard-hit northwest.\n\nIn all, 22 people infected with the coronavirus were transferred from the detox center to Rehoboth McKinley Christian Hospital, the only acute care medical center for the general public within 110 miles (180 kilometers) of Gallup.\n\n\"They were putting multiple cots in one room to accommodate them,\" said pulmonologist Rajiv Patel, who helped lead the hospital's initial response.\n\nTo care for that influx, any available doctor was pressed into service, including those who normally don't handle critically ill patients, Patel said.\n\n\"That's right when we overloaded,\" said hospital CEO David Conejo. \"Now we've got too many patients, and too few (staff) to help.\"\n\nRehoboth's eight intensive care beds are full, and now it has to transfer all coronavirus patients with severe breathing problems away from the facility and the adjacent Gallup Indian Medical Center, which attends exclusively to the Native American community.\n\nOf about 500 medical and support staff, at least 32 hospital workers have become infected, and doctors and nurses say that they all live with the fear of spreading the virus to their colleagues and relatives.\n\nConejo blames Patel for the fact that the hospital became overwhelmed, saying the doctor took on more COVID-19 patients than the staff could handle because of his ambition but also good intentions.\n\nBut Patel -- who arrived at Rehoboth in March from an Army reserve stint in Kuwait -- said the hospital simply didn't have enough staff with the experience to provide the right care and struggled to train more quickly. Patel has since left to work at Flagstaff Medical Center in Arizona.\n\nTwice, the doctor said, alarms went off during the night on breathing machines -- only to be misinterpreted by overnight staff. Within two days of those missteps, he and colleagues decided that severely ill coronavirus patients would have to go elsewhere -- a heart-wrenching decision that meant sick people would be treated far from family and one that underscored the consequences of not having adequate care in the region.\n\n\"It was an easy decision because it was the right thing to do for patients,\" said Patel, whose wife is Navajo. \"It was very saddening for me personally because my heart and soul are completely invested in the health situation on the reservation.\"\n\nMany nurses and doctors, meanwhile, say staffing at the hospital was inadequate because of Conejo's move to cut back on nurses in the first week of March to offset declining hospital revenues after elective surgeries were suspended. They voiced their discontent at a recent protest calling for his resignation.\n\n\"We knew it was coming to McKinley County, there wasn't any ifs, ands or buts. I was directed that I had to let go of 17 agency nurses,\" said Felicia Adams, chief nursing officer who has recovered from COVID-19. \"We want to take care of our patients, we don't want to have to send them away.\"\n\nConejo defended his oversight, noting that he deferred to the hospital's board of trustees and a team of nurses and physicians on final decisions. He also said the hospital couldn't afford not to cut staff in March and that the facility wanted to reduce overall employment to qualify for small-business assistance. But Adams and others believe Conejo put profits ahead of care.\n\nPhysician Caleb Lauber said that, as experienced contract nurses were let go in March, unfamiliar responsibilities were thrust upon other nurses given only on-the-fly training.\n\nNew Mexico's state auditor is seeking more information about the county-owned hospital's finances from its private operators. State health officials and philanthropists, meanwhile, are recruiting more than a dozen volunteer medical professionals and have hired a new critical care physician for the hospital.\n\nWhile much of New Mexico is showing signs of emerging from the initial wave of the pandemic, stubbornly high rates of infection and death persist in the state's northwest corner -- including in the Navajo Nation that extends into Arizona and Utah. More than half of New Mexico's roughly 6,100 confirmed infections are in Native Americans.\n\nFor most people, the coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness and lead to death.\n\nAs the Navajo have suffered in this pandemic, so, too has Gallup, whose fate has long been tied to the neighboring Navajo Nation. In normal times, the city's population of 22,000 can quickly quadruple in size since it is a crucial source of supplies and water for faraway Navajo households, many of which lack full plumbing.\n\nThe city is also a destination for many of the most marginalized Navajo, those who have left home and ended up on Gallup's streets, often as they grapple with alcohol addiction. Officials suspect that the coronavirus whipped through the homeless population, and some passed through the Na'Nizhoozhi Center, putting the liquor-tax funded shelter and detox center at the heart of the city's outbreak.\n\nThe city and its rural outskirts account for about 30% of COVID-19 infections statewide, with 78 related deaths as of Monday.\n\nTo stem the spread, Gallup was subject to an extreme 10-day lockdown this month -- cutting the city off from many of those who depend on it for supplies. Authorities have now set up free water stations and deliveries -- to avoid the risk of transmission posed by coin-operated water stations, where hand after hand scooped out returned change.\n\nNow, the Na'Nizhoozhi Center is also part of the response as it steers destitute people infected by the coronavirus toward isolation in rooms at four otherwise unoccupied motel buildings. Some 140 people are currently participating in the impromptu system, and officials hope it will interrupt a treadmill of infections among Gallup's homeless population.\n\nBut the virus has also taken its toll on the center. In addition to the 22 residents who became infected, several staff have been sickened by the virus and some simply stopped showing up, said Kevin Foley, executive director of the center. Six jobs now are open at a rate of $10 and hour, with just one application, he said.\n\nHe yearns for a Hollywood ending.\n\n\"I wish that all those people would come over in those space suits and just clean the place for good,\" he said, \"but it's not like that.\"\n\nAssociated Press writer Felicia Fonseca contributed to this report from Flagstaff, Arizona.",

        "body": "SAN FRANCISCO -- More than 180 people in a rural Northern California county were asked to self-quarantine after they were exposed to the coronavirus during a Mother's Day church service attended by an infected person, health officials said.\n\nThe infected person received their positive COVID-19 diagnosis the day after they attended service at a church in the town of Palermo and is now isolating at home, Butte County Public Health said in a news release Friday.\n\nHealth officials have contacted those who attended the service and given them instructions to self-quarantine and information about how to monitor themselves for symptoms and how to contact the public health office if they become sick, the statement said.\n\nEveryone who was at the service will be tested, officials said.\n\nButte County Public Health did not name the church but said its decision hold a service could cause a major setback and require the county to revert back to more restrictive measures.\n\n\"We implore everyone to follow the State order and our reopening plan to help combat the potential spread of Covid-19,\" said Danette York, director of Butte County Public Health.\n\nButte County is one of 23 counties that have been given the green light by state officials to reopen more businesses but gatherings of any size are still banned.\n\nAs of Sunday, Butte County has had 22 positive COVID-19 cases reported and no deaths.\n\nFor most people, the new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks. But for some -- especially older adults and people with existing health problems -- it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia, and death.\n\nPastor Mike Jacobsen of Palermo Bible Family Church, also known as PBFC, said during a virtual church service on Facebook Sunday that it was his church that held the service and that the person who tested positive didn't have any symptoms when they attended their Mother's Day service.\n\n\"They didn't do it intentionally, they didn't come to the church intentionally, and it was never my heart to put our church in harm's way. That's never been my desire,\" he said.\n\nJacobsen said he is in self-quarantine and only left his house on Sunday to go to church and host the livestream. He didn't return a message Monday from The Associated Press seeking comment.\n\nAnother Mother's Day church service is to blame for a coronavirus outbreak of three people, health officials in Mendocino County said in a statement.\n\nAn elderly Ukiah Valley man who tested positive for the coronavirus came in contact with two residents of neighboring Lake County who also recently tested positive. The three participated in the production of a May 10 church service at an inland Mendocino County church that was broadcast live online. Two of them sang during the service, officials said.\n\nThe church was not identified, but county officials urged church leaders to identify themselves and encourage members of the church to seek testing for COVID-19 and medical attention if needed.\n\nOne of the Lake County residents who participated in the Mother's Day church service at the venue was taken Saturday to Adventist Health Ukiah Valley. The other two men are in stable condition and isolating at home, officials said.\n\nMendocino County has reported 14 COVID-19 cases and zero deaths. Lake County now has 10 confirmed COVID-19 cases and zero deaths.",

        "authors": [],
        "body": "JERUSALEM -- As the coronavirus pandemic gathered strength last month, community leaders in a Palestinian neighborhood on the outskirts of Jerusalem tried to impose lockdown and quarantine measures to protect residents.\n\nThe problem: there were no police to enforce the measures.\n\nKufr Aqab is within the Israeli-drawn municipal boundary of Jerusalem, which Israel views as its unified capital. It is therefore off-limits to the Palestinian Authority, which is headquartered in the nearby city of Ramallah and governs parts of the occupied West Bank.\n\nBut the neighborhood is on the opposite side of the separation barrier Israel built in the mid-2000s, so the Israeli police don't go there either.\n\n\"This is no man's land,\" said Mayor Raed Hamdan.\n\nWhen the neighborhood council set up checkpoints to restrict movement in or out, it had to rely on local volunteers. When it ordered businesses to close and people to stay home, they refused.\n\nNow the town has at least 21 confirmed coronavirus cases, according to Sameh Abu Rumaila, the head of a local health committee that, like everything else, is run by volunteers. The committee estimates that another 500 people in the densely populated neighborhood have been in contact with those who were infected, but is powerless to isolate them.\n\n\"No one can control those people and put them into quarantine,\" he said. Most have Jerusalem residency, allowing them to travel more or less freely in the West Bank, Jerusalem and Israel. Rumaila says the town is a \"ticking bomb.\"\n\nThe virus causes mild to moderate flu-like symptoms in most patients, who recover within a few weeks. But it is highly contagious and can cause severe illness or death, particularly in older individuals or those with underlying health problems.\n\nIsrael has reported more than 16,200 cases and at least 235 deaths, while the Palestinian Authority has reported more than 330 cases and two fatalities. Both imposed heavy restrictions several weeks ago to contain the outbreak, and are now starting to lift them as the rate of new infections slows.\n\nBut an estimated 120,000 people live in Kufr Aqab and other similarly ungoverned areas on the outskirts of the city. That could give rise to new outbreaks.\n\nNadav Matzner, the deputy spokesman for Magen David Adom, Israel's emergency service, said it set up a testing center at a checkpoint near Kufr Aqab on April 23 and has carried out more than 160 tests. He said it normally does not operate beyond the barrier but has sent medics who are from those neighborhoods inside to conduct testing.\n\nOfficials from the Jerusalem municipality did not respond to multiple requests for comment.\n\nHaneen, an 18-year-old resident, tested positive on April 19, along with her mother and four sisters. Her mother and one of her sisters have been hospitalized, while the others were quarantined in a hotel in Ramallah. She declined to give her last name out of privacy concerns.\n\nHaneen and the sister who is hospitalized work inside Israel, but they were home during the two-week-long Passover holiday in early April, when much of Israel was shut down. They believe they were infected in Kufr Aqab.\n\n\"The town is open, all the shops are open, and we all go out and buy from the shops and contact other people,\" she said. \"There are no police to impose law and order, only local volunteers blocking the roads to Ramallah and Jerusalem.\"\n\n\"They let you pass if you argue with them,\" she said.\n\nThe volunteers have reason to be wary. In March, an argument at a checkpoint near Kufr Aqab led to an exchange of gunfire. Israel allowed Palestinian security forces to enter and restore order, but then they had to withdraw.\n\nIsrael captured east Jerusalem in the 1967 war and annexed it in a move not recognized internationally. It unilaterally expanded the city's borders to take in large tracts of land -- where it later built Jewish settlements -- as well as areas like Kufr Aqab, which at the time were small Palestinian villages.\n\nThe Palestinians, who want east Jerusalem to be the capital of their future state, view the separation barrier as part of a larger plan to cut them off from the city and change its demographics.\n\nAviv Tatarsky, a researcher for Ir Amim, an Israeli rights group focused on Jerusalem, said Israel appears to be planning to redraw the city's boundaries to exclude Kufr Aqab and other peripheral communities. That would reduce Jerusalem's Palestinian population by more than a third, from around 330,000 to just 200,000.\n\nPresident Donald Trump's Middle East plan, which Israel has eagerly embraced and the Palestinians have rejected, would also remove those neighborhoods from Jerusalem.\n\n\"Israel built the separation barrier in a way that disconnects Kufr Aqab, with an explicit intention to get rid of Palestinians from Jerusalem,\" he said.\n\nIsrael says the barrier was built in response to a wave of Palestinian suicide bombings and other attacks during the 2000-2005 uprising and that it's essential for Israel's security.\n\nKufr Aqab and other nearby neighborhoods have been plagued by a lack of law and order since the barrier went up. Criminal gangs enjoy free reign, and the lax enforcement of building codes has led to the rapid construction of apartment towers -- some up to 18 stories high -- that many fear are unsafe.\n\n\"We live in great anxiety here,\" Naela Namour, a housewife and mother of two, said. People in the apartment towers pack into elevators, their children play together in small vacant lots and the local markets are as busy as ever.\n\n\"There are no rules,\" she said. \"People move, work, buy and sell without any restrictions.\"",

    "Pandemic brings fortunes to Amazon - and headaches too": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "Amazon has spent years honing the business of packing, shipping and delivering millions of products to doorsteps around the world.\n\nNow it has a captive audience.\n\nWith much of the globe in various stages of a lockdown because of the coronavirus pandemic, the world's largest online retailer has become a lifeline to many shoppers. But it is also grappling with delivery delays and mounting complaints from workers who worry about contagion while on the job.\n\nThe company's website hit 2.54 billion visitors for the entire month of March, according to online research company Comscore. That marks a 65% jump from the same period last year. Amazon will report quarterly earnings on Thursday, providing a first glimpse into its financial performance during the pandemic.\n\nDiscounters like Walmart and Dollar General that sell essential products have seen their shares soar 8% and 15% respectively. But Amazon has been a standout, with its stock up 22% so far this year. That's in contrast to the S&P, which has slid 11%. Amazon is also hiring 175,000 more workers at a time when many businesses have cut back and are seeking federal aid.\n\nAt the same time, Amazon's vast empire is showing cracks. Deliveries that used to take just hours to arrive can instead take weeks or even months. High demand items like toilet paper and paper towels are frustratingly out of stock.\n\nProbably the biggest issue facing the $1.1 trillion company is persistent complaints by warehouse workers of grueling hours of backbreaking work with little protection against catching the coronavirus. A growing number of infections has increased pressure on the company to take steps that could further slow down operations, including shutting down some of its warehouses and easing productivity quotas.\n\n\"Amazon has gone from a nice-to-have to a necessity,\" said Jon Reily of Isobar, a global digital agency. \"It's becoming a public utility like the electric company or the water company. But they're putting pressure on workers. And workers are scared.\"\n\nThe most dramatic fallout came in France when a court ordered Amazon last week to stop delivering non-essential products for a month while it works out better worker safety measures. An appeals court upheld the ruling, although it expanded the number of products the company is allowed sell. Amazon responded by closing all its French warehouses, saying it is too complicated to separate out its activities.\n\nSmall groups of workers have staged walkouts at Amazon warehouses in New York, Chicago and Detroit, demanding that the facilities be closed for deep cleaning after workers there tested positive for the virus. Kentucky's governor ordered a warehouse in Shepherdsville closed for several days last month after workers there got infected.\n\nAmazon has refused to say how many workers have fallen ill. It says it has stepped up protection measures, ramping up cleaning, implementing temperature checks, racing to distribute masks, staggering shifts and spreading out tables in break rooms. It is also allowing any worker who feels unsafe to stay home without pay through April, while offering a $2 hourly pay bump for those who stay on the job.\n\nAmazon also says it's developing an internal lab that could potentially provide coronavirus tests for all employees, even those without symptoms.\n\nIt's unclear how many of Amazon's workers are staying home without pay or how many have been put into isolation because of contact with infected workers. But employees at some warehouses say absences are common.\n\nGuiselle Diaz, 23, said she has not reported to her job at the Staten Island warehouse for weeks because she worries her asthma makes her vulnerable and she fears passing the virus to her 81-year-old grandmother, who lives with her.\n\n\"A lot of people are afraid, and a lot of people have conditions that stop them from going,\" Diaz said.\n\nAmazon's competitors have faced similar challenges with delays, product scarcity and worker discontent. Walmart faced calls to step up safety measures after two workers from the same store contracted the virus and died. Some workers at grocery delivery services Instacart and Shipt, which is owned by Target, have walked off their jobs to demand greater safeguards against the virus.\n\nMany shoppers have been forgiving of Amazon, in large part because there are few better alternatives for getting essentials online.\n\n\"That's the only place you can shop for most everything you need,\" said Marlina Fol, a caregiver in Manhattan, who said she was able to buy masks and hand sanitizer from Amazon in early March but now struggles to get a window for grocery delivery from Whole Foods, which Amazon acquired two years ago.\n\nAmazon accounts for about 40% of online sales in the U.S., according to eMarketer, an online research firm. It has developed fierce loyalty among its more than 110 million U.S. Prime members, who pay $129 a year to get practically anything shipped to them in up to two days. That accounts for half of American households. Many experts believes Amazon is only picking up more subscribers during the pandemic and expect its dominance to grow further.\n\nThe company is also providing essential cash flow to third-party sellers who've seen their physical stores closed because of lockdowns. Aaron Krahling, whose vitamin store in Waldorf, Maryland, has been shuttered since mid-March, has been able to pay the rent for his business and other bills because of income he's received from selling home accessories on Amazon.\n\n\"Everything would have come down to a screeching halt,\" Krahling said. \"It's helped me cover all overhead without freaking out.\"\n\nCraig Johnson, president of retail consultancy Customer Growth Partners, says Amazon has a \"high class problem\" considering how many other stores have gone dark.\n\n\"Given all that is going on, they have done remarkably well,\" Johnson said. \"Yes, there are glitches. But there are glitches all over. We have never been through this.\"\n\n-- -- -- --\n\nCORRECTS: This story was first published on April 29, 2020. It was updated on April 30, 2020, to correct the name of the retail consultancy headed by Craig Johnson. It is Customer Growth Partners, not Consumer Growth Partners.",

    "Pandemic knocks out large sections of Hawaii's economy": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "HONOLULU -- In normal times, Roland Chang and his three sons start their day at dawn, picking up tourists in Waikiki and driving them to the ocean for a boat ride to see dolphins and turtles swimming in clear blue waters. Four nights a week, the family's band performs Hawaiian music and popular songs at a hotel.\n\nTheir friends call them workaholics. To them, it's a routine. Or was until the coronavirus pandemic landed in Hawaii.\n\nLike many businesses in tourism-dependent Hawaii, the Changs' company has had no income for two months. And they don't know if it will survive to see a post-COVID-19 world. But they agree with the restrictions imposed in the name of public health. And the family, who is Native Hawaiian, believes there will be rebirth afterward. Roland Chang's sister NJ compared the wreckage to the way the fire goddess lays waste when a volcano erupts and lava flows across the land.\n\n\"Madam Pele has always cleaned out. I think that's what we're going through,\" said NJ Chang, a school teacher and band vocalist and guitar player. \"This is a cleaning out process, I believe, for us to all heal.\"\n\nMuch healing will be required.\n\nA University of Hawaii survey of 623 businesses conducted with the Chamber of Commerce Hawaii showed 34% had no revenue last month. In Maui County -- which is even more heavily reliant on tourism than the rest of the state -- that number was 61%.\n\nAmong arts, entertainment and recreation companies -- which include tours like the Changs' -- employment has declined 82% compared to January. Revenues in 2020 are forecast to sink 65% from last year.\n\nThe numbers are similarly ugly for hotels and almost as bad for restaurants and retailers. Statewide, the unemployment rate is estimated to be between 25% and 35%. Food distribution events run by the Salvation Army and other nonprofits draw lines of cars that stretch for miles.\n\nThe Changs are living on savings. Their company, EO Waianae Tours, which has four full-time employees, applied for a Paycheck Protection Program loan for small businesses to help them get through the crisis. They're not applying for unemployment benefits.\n\nThey have some investment funds they were thinking about using to expand their business but they may now hold off because the future is so uncertain. Their tour business may even have to close.\n\n\"I think there are a lot more questions than answers,\" Roland Chang said. \"I've got to guarantee that everyone on my boat won't get the virus. How do I protect them?\"\n\nAmong the unknowns: Do they reduce the number of people on their boat (it can hold up to 26 passengers and four crew) so everyone can practice social distancing? Will they have to raise their tour rates to break even as a result? Will they need disposable snorkel gear for clients instead of lending them gear as in the past? Will travelers even come?\n\n\"On the totem pole of life right now, people are just trying to put food on the table. Until that gets rectified, it's going to be hard to say how many people are going to actively, consistently keep the tour business open,\" he said.\n\nTo slow the spread of the virus, Hawaii Gov. David Ige issued a stay-at-home order in late March and mandated that all travelers adhere to a strict 14-day quarantine when they arrive in the islands. The number of tourists has slowed to a trickle of about 200 per day, down from 30,000 before the pandemic.\n\nRoland Chang said he supports these moves, given they are so important to protect the elderly who are more vulnerable to the disease.\n\n\"They're at the higher risk level. Without them, we don't have a future. So let's keep them going. Tourism will heal itself,\" he said.\n\nJust like the plants that sprout from lava fields years after molten rock covers the land, he said.\n\nFor most people, the new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia, and death.\n\nFor now, the family's band, Kanilau, streams an hour-long show on Facebook from Roland's living room once a week. The hotel they normally would be performing at -- Embassy Suites in Waikiki, has been closed since late March but it posts the session on its Facebook page. Repeat guests who have listened to them for years leave comments like \"Aloha from Minnesota!\" and \"Canada loves you guys.\"\n\nThey don't get paid for their livestream. But the songs keep them going emotionally. Even if the tour business doesn't survive, they vow the band will.",

        "authors": [],
        "body": "JAKARTA, Indonesia -- In Indonesia's easternmost province, felled trees are stacked to block a road that leads to Papuan villages. On the Thai-Myanmar border, the Karen people have also made makeshift barricades and marked them with signs warning visitors away.\n\nAcross the globe, the coronavirus pandemic has left indigenous peoples at particular risk because so many have poorer health and less access to health care than their non-indigenous peers.\n\nWhile there are, of course, vast differences among indigenous groups, including lifestyle and socioeconomic factors, the United Nations estimates that the life expectancy of indigenous people can be up to 20 years lower than that of their counterparts. A recommendation from the Australian government underscored the disparities. A message sent in March warned: \"People over aged 70, ages over 60 with preexisting conditions, or Indigenous people aged over 50 should stay home whenever possible for their own protection.\"\n\nThe more stringent recommendation for indigenous people is likely because so many have the kinds of health problems that experts say can result in more serious consequences if they contract the coronavirus.\n\nAccording to U.N. data, more than half of indigenous adults over 35 worldwide have Type 2 diabetes. Indigenous people also experience \"disproportionately high levels\" of cardiovascular disease, HIV/AIDS and illnesses such as tuberculosis.\n\nFor most people, the virus causes mild or moderate symptoms. But for some, especially those with health problems and older people, it can cause more severe illness and lead to death.\n\nGenetics may play a part in poorer health among indigenous people, Mason Durie, a professor of M\u0101ori Studies at Massey University who is himself M\u0101ori, but social factors are generally considered more important.\n\nAware of the added risks, many indigenous people -- especially those living near or in urban centers -- are seeking isolation, said Rudolph R\u00ffser, an indigenous activist and executive director of the Center for World Indigenous Studies.\n\n\"Many people that are able to are simply running back into the forest, running back up the mountain, trying to get away from the urban settings to get away from potential vectors,\" he said. \"They simply closed down, put up obstacles, and block the roads going into their territories.\"\n\nThat has raised the possibility that members who don't typically live in traditional villages could bring the disease back with them. And some communities, like aboriginal ones in Australia, may be ill equipped to keep people safe because of poor infrastructure and crowding in homes, said Dr. Mark Wenitong, an aboriginal general practitioner and adviser to aboriginal health councils in Australia.\n\nSome indigenous communities are practicing social distancing that closely resembles what's happening outside them. In Indonesia, groups including Papuans and the Buntao' in South Sulawesi province are blocking access to their villages. Elsewhere, others, like the Karen people, are also adding in traditional practices, such as performing rituals to remove bad luck or marking village entrances with culturally significant symbols.\n\nWhile many marginalized groups are finding themselves at risk, the stakes may be even higher for indigenous people who were already struggling to maintain their traditions and keep the world at bay, like those in the Amazon rainforest who have long contended with encroachment on their lands by loggers, miners and farmers.\n\nThe disease poses a serious risk, but restrictions to curtail the pandemic are also threatening the way of life of some groups and disrupting important cultural practices for others.\n\nIn Uganda, the military is trying to prevent the Batwa, who are going hungry under lockdown, from slipping across the border into Rwanda to get food from relatives, said Faith Tushabe, who works with a local NGO. Long evicted from their forest homes, the Batwa usually trade labor for food -- and can't right now.\n\nRestrictions on movement have also made it difficult for some of the Mbororo -- semi-nomadic pastoralists in Cameroon -- to survive, said Sali Django, a program coordinator for Mboscuda, a non-governmental group that supports the Mbororo.\n\n\"They need to look for food to eat,\" he said.\n\nThe Maasai, a semi-nomadic indigenous group in Kenya and Tanzania, meanwhile, have been forced to halt important rituals that bring clans together, including the graduation of warriors into young men who can marry and own property.\n\nThe outbreak is forcing major changes, said Benyamin Timaiyio, a Maasai youth leader.\n\n\"It will totally interfere with culture and tradition -- and we are living through culture and tradition,\" he said.\n\nWhile some countries have earmarked emergency funds to help indigenous peoples, the virus still poses a major threat, said Rukka Sombolinggi, general secretary of the Indigenous People Alliance of the Archipelago (AMAN) in Indonesia.\n\n\"They could become extinct,\" she said. \"Not only the people, but also their culture.\"\n\nAssociated Press journalists Cara Anna in Johannesburg, Edna Tarigan in Jakarta, Indonesia, and Khaled Kazziha in Nairobi, Kenya, contributed to this report.\n\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute's Department of Science Education.

        "authors": [],
        "body": "When Fred and Marlene Kantrow of Long Island, New York, boarded the Celebrity Eclipse on Feb. 29 in South America \"getting sick was the furthest thing from (their) minds.\"\n\nHowever, Fred Kantrow was hospitalized with the novel coronavirus just a few days after disembarking. Now, the once self-proclaimed \"big Celebrity cruise fans\" are now suing the cruise line for \"negligently expos(ing)\" them and \"thousands of passengers aboard the Eclipse to COVID-19.\"\n\nThe lawsuit claims that Celebrity became aware that someone aboard the vessel was displaying symptoms \"consistent with a positive COVID-19 diagnosis\" at the beginning of the voyage, but that Celebrity still allowed a \"full schedule of entertainment activities and dining options,\" including buffet-style meals.\n\nDuring their trip, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued a no-sail order because \"the CDC Director (had) reason to believe that cruise ship travel may continue to introduce, transmit, or spread COVID-19.\"\n\nThe Kantrows said they didn't know something was wrong until a day after the no-sail order was issued, when their ship was forced to head to San Diego after being denied the ability to dock in Chile on March 15.\n\n\"We hit all the stops that we were supposed to hit along the way,\" Marlene Kantrow told ABC News. \"It was a beautiful cruise, until we got back to Santiago.\"\n\nGuests were still encouraged by Celebrity to enjoy free alcohol, internet and free bar service, according to the Kantrows.\n\n\"Our joke was it's Groundhog's Day,\" Fred Kantrow said. \"You'd wake up, you'd look outside and there was just water.\"\n\nCelebrity shipboard management personnel even allegedly held a gathering of passengers and crew members to honor health care workers responding to the pandemic.\n\n\"Everybody on the ship was right next to each other,\" Marlene Kantrow said. \"The crew was out, everybody was applauding.\"\n\nOn their second-to-last day on the Eclipse, the Kantrows said Celebrity threw a \"Mexican Fiesta.\"\n\n\"They crammed the buffet area with everybody,\" Marlene Kantrow said. \"Everybody was touching each other.\"\n\nAt the time of the cruise, Celebrity was barring individuals from cruising who had had traveled in China, Hong Kong or Macau within 15 days of departure. The cruise line also said anyone who held a passport from China, Hong Kong or Macau would undergo \"extra screenings\" at the cruise terminal. In mid-February, the Department of Homeland Security had announced they would conduct enhanced entry screening at 11 major airports and at other airport and land port locations, U.S. Customs and Border Patrol officers would \"remain alert\" and notify the CDC and other public health officials when encountering passengers exhibiting signs of overt illness.\n\nAfter spending a month at sea, the Kantrows were finally able to disembark in San Diego on March 30.\n\nAccording to the Kantrows, Celebrity did not inform them of any positive COVID-19 cases until about one or two days after they got off the ship.\n\nFred then started running a fever and \"just didn't feel right\" so he decided to go to the hospital.\n\nThe lawsuit claims Celebrity's \"egregious failure to protect its passengers\" has already resulted in at least 45 passengers and crew who tested positive, and at least two COVID-19 related deaths.\n\nTune into ABC at 1 p.m. ET and ABC News Live at 4 p.m. ET every weekday for special coverage of the novel coronavirus with the full ABC News team, including the latest news, context and analysis.\n\nIn late March, the CDC said outbreaks on three cruise voyages had caused more than 800 confirmed cases of coronavirus in the United States among passengers and crew, including 10 deaths.\n\nThe CDC confirmed they were notified about COVID-19-positive travelers on the Celebrity Eclipse who had symptoms while on board these ships. The agency also has extended its no-sail order until late July.\n\nLast month another lawsuit was filed against Celebrity, but on behalf of employees, alleging the company failed to protect its crew members working aboard ships amid the novel coronavirus outbreak. At the time, Celebrity said, it \"does not comment on pending litigation.\"\n\nEven though there are no passengers, there are still a a significant number of crew members stuck onboard cruise ships around the globe.\n\nIn U.S. waters alone there are still 85 cruise ships with over 54,000 crew members on board.\n\nCelebrity did not respond to ABC News' request for comment about the Kantrows' lawsuit.",

        "authors": [],
        "body": "IOWA CITY, Iowa -- Vice President Mike Pence has called Iowa's response to the coronavirus pandemic \"a success story\" but he may find a less rosy reality when he arrives Friday.\n\nPence is expected to visit the Des Moines metropolitan area, where a recent rise in confirmed infections has alarmed the mayor and medical officials. Even the federal coronavirus task force Pence leads has expressed concern.\n\nPence is scheduled to meet faith leaders to encourage them to resume in-person church services in a responsible fashion, though many have said they'll refrain for now to stop the virus's spread. He's also expected to discuss food supply with grocery and agriculture leaders, which has been stressed by outbreaks at meatpacking plants that have slowed production.\n\nMore than 100 patients with COVID-19 are hospitalized in Polk County, which includes Des Moines, and the president of a major hospital system told his staff Tuesday that Iowa's estimated rate of transmission for the virus remains among the highest in the nation.\n\n\"Our community spread of the virus remains high,\" said Karl Keeler, of MercyOne Central Iowa. \"We have a lot of work to do.\"\n\nPence will be about 30 miles from a Tyson Foods pork plant in Perry where 730 employees -- nearly 60% of its workforce -- have tested positive for the coronavirus. Jorge Soto, 23, said his aunt is one of them and has been hospitalized this week.\n\n\"What's a little heartbreaking is I can't hold a conversation with her. After every fifth word she has shortness of breath and starts coughing,\" Soto said of the longtime plant worker who is in her 50s and has two children.\n\nRossanna Rosa, a Des Moines infectious disease doctor, called the situation at the Perry plant \"a scandal\" that has sickened many immigrants and refugees.\n\nRosa said she often feels \"hopeless\" and \"helpless\" offering care for patients when no vaccine or reliable treatment is available. She said hospitals are admitting new patients while treating others who have been there for weeks.\n\n\"That is very worrisome in terms of resource utilization,\" she said. \"At what point do we max out?\"\n\nAt the White House on Wednesday, Pence praised Gov. Kim Reynolds and said Iowa has been \"leading the pack.\" Hours later, Reynolds signed an order to allow malls, retailers and gyms in Des Moines and other cities to reopen Friday.\n\nDes Moines Mayor Frank Cownie said he worried the state was reopening too quickly without adequate testing in place and potentially two to four weeks before the virus hits a peak in the state.\n\nCownie announced that he would keep city buildings closed and not allow the Des Moines Farmers Market or any festivals until July 1. His moves came after what he called a surprising and significant outbreak over a one-week period that more than doubled Polk County's confirmed cases, which exceed 2,000.\n\n\"My biggest worry is that if we don't do this strategically and incrementally and responsibly, we're going to see a further spread that would overwhelm our health care facilities,\" Cownie said. \"We can see an economic recovery but if you lose your life because of some wrong decisions, there is no tomorrow.\"\n\nCownie said the city is losing $10 million per month in revenue due to the pandemic-driven slowdown, and would like federal funding to maintain critical services. He said a major increase in testing needs to happen to get the economy back on track.\n\nThe governor says Iowa has been averaging 2,900 tests daily, a substantial increase from a month ago. Still, that's short of what experts say is needed for Iowa to reopen safely, and many people say they are unable to get tested.\n\nThat includes Linda Bennett, 59, of Des Moines, who signed up for the TestIowa program on April 21, the day Reynolds announced it. Her online assessment said her symptoms make her eligible for a test but that no appointments are available. Her husband and son have also had no luck.",

    "Pence to visit Mayo Clinic to learn about testing 'moonshot'": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "MINNEAPOLIS -- Vice President Mike Pence has an appointment Tuesday at Minnesota's Mayo Clinic to learn about a new coronavirus testing \"moonshot\" that has the famed clinic partnering with the state and its flagship university to quickly boost the state's capacity to 20,000 tests a day.\n\nIt's an approach that leverages a health care infrastructure not all states can match. And it should help Minnesota become one of the most aggressive states at testing on the scale experts say is necessary to safely reopen the economy. Minnesota is one of several states that have quit waiting for the federal government for help.\n\nDemocratic Gov. Tim Walz unveiled the state's partnership with the University of Minnesota and Mayo last Wednesday, promising that every resident with symptoms of the coronavirus can get tested once the plan ramps up in the next few weeks.\n\n\"This is not a state that's just going to get through COVID-19; this is a state that's going to lead this nation and the world out of this,\" Walz vowed of his \"moonshot.\"\n\nPence recognized Walz's efforts at a White House briefing Thursday, where he also praised Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine for an initiative to boost his state's testing capacity to 22,000 per day through a partnership with reagent manufacturer Thermo Fisher. The vice president also cited Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds for a partnership with Utah-based startup Nomi Health aimed at increasing her state's lagging testing capacity by 3,000 per day from its current 1,000-2,000.\n\n\"This is the kind of approach and commitment that we need, and I'm glad the vice president is shining a light on promising efforts. We need more,\" Jennifer Nuzzo, an epidemiologist at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, said of Pence's visit to Mayo. \"Kudos to Minnesota for being a part of that.\"\n\nMinnesota has one of the lowest confirmed cases per-capita in the country, but its testing has lagged behind what the Walz administration says is needed. An Associated Press analysis of data from the COVID Tracking Project shows that Minnesota now ranks among the lowest states in per-capita testing, sixth from the bottom at 10.51 per 100,000 residents, with Kansas last at 9.01. Rhode Island is the highest at 50.51. while New York, the hardest hit state, ranks second at 41.21.\n\n\"Minnesota is probably low in terms of tests per thousand compared with other states, but the good news for Minnesota is the testing that it's doing relative to the cases it's finding is relatively high ...,\" Nuzzo said. \"You don't want the majority of your tests resulting in cases because that suggests there's many cases out there you're not finding.\"\n\nMinnesota's death toll from the coronavirus rose by 14 to 286 as of Monday, while 214 new confirmed cases raised the statewide total to 3,816. State and private labs had conducted 61,268 tests as of Monday,\n\nThere is huge variation across the country on how aggressive states have been about testing, said Dr. Joel Shalowitz, an adjunct professor at the Feinberg School of Medicine at Northwestern University. That's partly because some states that do a lot of testing, such as New York and New Jersey, are among the hardest hit states, while some states that do less testing also have fewer cases. So a lot of testing is driven by the need to test, or the alleged need, he said,\n\nWhile the University of Minnesota and Mayo Clinic are \"absolutely world-class institutions,\" Shalowitz said, much will depend on how accurate their testing proves to be. False positives can force healthy patients into isolation, while false negatives can lead to infected people spreading the virus. Accuracy among other institutions varies widely, he said.\n\n\"If Minnesota can increase its capacity to 20,000 tests per day, that would be a very meaningful increase in its testing capacity,\" said Dr. Thomas Tsai, a health policy researcher at the Harvard Global Health Institute.\n\nBeing home to both the University of Minnesota and the Mayo Clinic \"does increase the tools in the toolbox for being able to perform tests,\" he said. But test numbers aren't the whole answer, he cautioned.\n\n\"Testing capacity is one part of the puzzle,\" Tsai said \"The most important piece is the strategy around testing -- not waiting for people to show up. You have to do active contact tracing and active outreach into the community.\"",

    "Pence's wife says he was unaware of mask policy during visit": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "WASHINGTON -- Karen Pence, the wife of Vice President Mike Pence, is defending his decision to not wear a mask during a recent visit to the Mayo Clinic, saying he was unaware of the hospital's coronavirus policy until after he left.\n\nIn an appearance on Fox News Channel on Thursday morning, Mrs. Pence said the vice president was following the advice of medical experts and hadn't intended to offend anyone. Pence, like other senior White House staff, is tested for the virus at least once a week.\n\n\"As our medical experts have told us, wearing a mask prevents you from spreading the disease. And knowing that he doesn't have COVID-19, he didn't wear one,\" Mrs. Pence said, adding that it \"was actually after he left Mayo Clinic that he found out that they had a policy of asking everyone to wear a mask.\"\n\n\"So, you know, someone who's worked on this whole task force for over two months is not someone who would have done anything to offend anyone or hurt anyone or scare anyone,\" she said.\n\nThe Mayo Clinic had tweeted -- then deleted -- that it had informed the vice president of its \"masking policy prior to his arrival.\"\n\n\"Mayo shared the masking policy with the VP's office,\" the health care system later said in its response.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that Americans wear cloth face coverings in public settings where other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain, such as in supermarkets, especially in areas of significant community-based transmission.\n\nPence toured the Mayo Clinic, in Rochester, Minnesota, on Tuesday. Footage of the visit showed him mask-less as he met with an employee who had recovered from the virus, visited a lab where Mayo conducts coronavirus tests and during a roundtable discussion on Mayo's coronavirus testing and research programs.\n\nPence explained his decision that day by stressing that he has been frequently tested for the virus.\n\n\"As vice president of the United States I'm tested for the coronavirus on a regular basis, and everyone who is around me is tested for the coronavirus,\" Pence said. \"And since I don't have the coronavirus, I thought it'd be a good opportunity for me to be here, to be able to speak to these researchers, these incredible health care personnel, and look them in the eye and say 'thank you.'\"\n\nBut even with a mask, Pence would have been able to look health care workers in the eye because one only covers the nose and mouth.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has repeatedly expressed discomfort about mask-wearing, saying he did not intend to wear one when the CDC's recommendations were unveiled. And most senior staff have followed his lead, at least when they're in the White House.\n\nPeople who enter the White House complex have their temperature taken, and those who will be in close proximity to the president and the vice president are given rapid COVID-19 tests to ensure they're not infectious.\n\nSenior staff also are given tests on a rolling basis, so that infections are quickly detected.\n\nFor most people, the virus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia, or death. It has infected more than 1 million people in the United States, and more than 60,000 have died, according to figures compiled by Johns Hopkins University.",

    "Pence, task force members isolate after virus exposure": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "WASHINGTON -- Vice President Mike Pence is self-isolating after an aide tested positive for the coronavirus last week, joining three of the nation's top scientists in taking protective steps after possible exposure, in another stark reminder that not even one of the nation's most secure buildings is immune from the virus.\n\nAn administration official said Pence is voluntarily limiting his exposure to other people. He has repeatedly tested negative for COVID-19 since his exposure but is following the advice of medical officials.\n\n\"Vice President Pence will continue to follow the advice of the White House Medical Unit and is not in quarantine,\" said spokesman Devin O'Malley. \"Additionally, Vice President Pence has tested negative every single day and plans to be at the White House tomorrow.\"\n\nDr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and a leading member of the White House coronavirus task force, placed himself in quarantine over the weekend, along with Dr. Robert Redfield, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, Dr. Stephen Hahn.\n\nPence's press secretary tested positive for the coronavirus on Friday, making her the second person who works at the White House complex known to test positive for the virus this week. Pence has led the White House coronavirus task force for more than two months. White House officials had confirmed Thursday that a member of the military serving as one of Trump's valets had tested positive for COVID-19 on Wednesday.\n\nPresident Donald Trump, who publicly identified the affected Pence aide as spokeswoman Katie Miller, said he was \"not worried\" about the virus spreading in the White House. Nonetheless, officials said they were stepping up safety protocols for the complex.\n\nPence was informed of the positive test Friday morning before he left Washington for a day-trip to Iowa.\n\nFauci's institute said that he has tested negative for COVID-19 and will continue to be tested regularly. It added that he is considered at \"relatively low risk\" based on the degree of his exposure, and that he would be \"taking appropriate precautions\" to mitigate the risk to personal contacts while still carrying out his duties. While he will stay at home and telework, Fauci will go to the White House if called and take every precaution, the institute said.\n\nRedfield will be \"teleworking for the next two weeks\" after it was determined he had a \"low risk exposure\" to a person at the White House, the CDC said in a statement Saturday evening. The statement said he felt fine and has no symptoms.\n\nJust a few hours earlier, the Food and Drug Administration confirmed that Hahn had come in contact with someone who tested positive and was in self-quarantine for the next two weeks. He tested negative for the virus.\n\nAll three men are scheduled to testify before a Senate committee on Tuesday. Sen. Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn., the chairman of the panel, said the White House will allow Redfield and Hahn to testify by videoconference, a one-time exception to the administration's policies on hearing testimony. The statement was issued before Fauci's quarantine was announced.\n\nMiller had been in recent contact with Pence but not with the president and had tested negative a day earlier. She is married to Stephen Miller, a top Trump adviser. The White House had no immediate comment on whether Stephen Miller had been tested or if he was still working in the White House.\n\nThe CDC and FDA would not disclose the identity of the person who had tested positive and with whom the agency leaders had come in contact.\n\nRedfield sought to use the exposure as a teachable moment. The CDC statement said if he must go to the White House to fulfill any responsibilities as part of the coronavirus task force, he will follow CDC practices for critical infrastructure workers. Those guidelines call for Redfield and anyone working on the task force to have their temperature taken and screened for symptoms each day, wear a face covering, and distance themselves from others.\n\nTrump has resisted wearing a mask, and in a meeting with the nation's top military leaders Saturday evening, he did not wear a mask during the brief portion that reporters were allowed to view. The generals around Trump also did not wear a mask, but participants did sit a few feet away from each other.\n\nFDA spokeswoman Stephanie Caccomo said Hahn tested negative for the virus after he learned of the contact. He wrote a note to staff on Friday to alert them.\n\nSix people who had been in contact with Miller were scheduled to fly with Pence on Friday to Des Moines, Iowa, on Air Force Two. They were removed from the flight just before it took off, according to a senior administration official.\n\nNone of those people was exhibiting symptoms, but all were asked to deplane so they could be tested \"out of an abundance of caution,\" a senior administration official told reporters traveling with Pence. All six later tested negative, the White House said.\n\nThe official said staff in the West Wing are tested regularly but much of Pence's staff -- which works next door in the Executive Office Building -- are tested less frequently. Katie Miller was not on the plane and had not been scheduled to be on the trip.\n\nPence, who is tested on a regular basis, was tested Friday. Miller tweeted she was \"doing well\" and looked forward to getting back to work.\n\nWhite House chief of staff Mark Meadows said the administration was stepping up mitigation efforts already recommended by public health experts and taking other unspecified precautions to ensure the safety of the president. He said the White House was \"probably the safest place that you can come,\" but the he was reviewing further steps to keep Trump and Pence safe.\n\nThe White House requires daily temperature checks of anyone who enters the White House complex and has encouraged social distancing among those working in the building. The administration has also directed regular deep cleaning of all work spaces. Anyone who comes in close proximity to the president and vice president is tested daily for COVID-19.\n\nTrump's valet's case marked the first known instance where a person who has come in close proximity to the president has tested positive since several people present at his private Florida club were diagnosed with COVID-19 in early March.\n\nAssociated Press writers Darlene Superville and Lauran Neergaard in Washington and Aamer Madhani in Chicago contributed to this report.",

        "authors": [],
        "body": "WASHINGTON -- As states gear up to reopen, a poll finds a potential obstacle to controlling coronavirus: nearly 1 in 10 adults say cost would keep them from seeking help if they thought they were infected.\n\nThe Gallup-West Health Healthcare Costs Survey out Tuesday finds that 9% of those age 18 and over would avoid seeking treatment because of concerns about the cost of care, even if they thought they were infected with the coronavirus.\n\nA significantly higher number -- 14% -- would avoid seeking treatment because of pocketbook worries if they had fever and a dry cough, two widely publicized symptoms of COVID-19.\n\nAlthough Congress and President Donald Trump have made coronavirus testing free to patients, and some insurers are waiving copays and deductibles for treatment within their networks, the survey suggests such messages may not be getting to the public.\n\nThe survey delivers \"important and distressing information,\" said John Auerbach, head of the nonpartisan Trust for America's Health. \"I hope that policy makers take note.\"\n\nWith so many reluctant to seek care, \"it could pose problems in testing people,\" Auerbach added. \"Without widespread testing, it will be problematic to lift the restrictions.\" Auerbach's group works with government at all levels to strengthen public health, and was not involved with the poll.\n\nExperts say that to succeed, the nation's reopening has to be based on three pillars: testing, tracing those who came in contact with infected people, and treatment for those who become ill.\n\nIf people who may be sick are reluctant to come forward, that could create a blind spot for governors and public health officials trying to calibrate reopening plans to quickly contain potential virus flare-ups.\n\nThe survey found that members of minority groups, younger people, those with less than a college degree, and people making less than $40,000 a year were more likely to say they would avoid treatment for economic reasons.\n\nFourteen percent of nonwhite poll respondents said they would avoid treatment even if they suspected they had the coronavirus, compared with 6% of whites citing costs. Yet COVID-19 has proven to be more lethal among blacks and Hispanics, a grim phenomenon linked to higher rates of underlying diseases such as diabetes, and lower rates of health insurance coverage.\n\nAmong age groups, the survey found those 18-29 were the most likely to avoid treatment. Although COVID-19 claims a disproportionately high share of victims among older people, there's plenty of evidence that seemingly healthy young adults are can also get seriously sick.\n\nIn the poll 12% of those 18-29 said they would avoid treatment because of cost worries. Adults ages 50-64 were the least likely to avoid care, with only 3% citing pocketbook issues as a barrier. Surprisingly, 7% of those 65 and older said cost would be an issue for them. Virtually all U.S. seniors are covered by Medicare, and many have additional protection for out-of-pocket expenses.\n\nThe poll also found income was a dividing line in Americans' attitudes. Only 3% of those making $100,000 or more cited cost as a barrier to COVID care, compared with 14% of those earning under $40,000.\n\n\"A pretty substantial chunk of the population could remain hidden from view because of the U.S. health care cost crisis,\" said Dan Witters, research director for the poll.\n\nThe Gallup-West Health Healthcare Costs Survey was based on telephone interviews conducted April 1-14, with a random sample of 1,017 adults, ages 18 and older, living in all 50 U.S. states and Washington.\n\nFor results based on the entire sample the margin of error is plus or minus 3.7 percentage points",

        "body": "MEXICO CITY -- President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador pledged Wednesday to begin reopening Mexico's economy next week -- encouraged by U.S. officials -- even as hospitals from Mexico City to the border reeled under the pressure of the largest one-day jump in COVID-19 case numbers and the lack of testing made decision-making difficult.\n\nEconomy Secretary Graciela Marquez said the reopening would be \"gradual, orderly and cautious,\" and that by May 18, industries like construction, mining, and car and truck manufacturing would be allowed to resume.\n\nMexico's top advisory body on the coronavirus pandemic, the General Health Council, said Tuesday it had decided to classify those industries as \"essential activities\" that are allowed to continue working during a lockdown aimed at fighting the spread of the novel coronavirus.\n\nMexico has been under pressure from U.S. officials to reopen auto plants because without them, integrated supply chains would make it hard for plants in the U.S. and Canada to reopen.\n\nThe announcement came as hospitals from Mexico City to its northern border with the U.S. were nearing overload, and manufacturing workers in border cities like Ciudad Juarez had only recently been sent home following protests prompted by the wildfire spready of the coronavirus through their plants.\n\nMexican health officials on Tuesday reported its largest single-day jump in COVID-19 case numbers, with 1,997 new cases and 353 deaths, bringing the total to has over 38,000 confirmed cases and almost 4,000 deaths.\n\nOfficials have acknowleged the actual infection numbers are many times that number. Mexico has done relatively little testing, with about 120,000 coronavirus tests reported so far in a country of almost 130 million. That is equivalent to only about 0.6 people per 1,000 inhabitants tested, the lowest rate in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.\n\nThat will make it hard to judge whether the re-opening will risk a renewed upsurge in cases.\n\nSusana Prieto, a labor lawyer who advises workers at border assembly plants known as maquiladoras, said the decision showed the government was yielding to pressure from multinationals. Workers in Ciudad Juarez have staged walkouts and protests to get firms to shut down and send them home with full pay during the lockdown.\n\nNow, even though there have reportedly been dozens of deaths among maquiladora workers, the government wants to put some plants that produce car seats or wiring harnesses back to work.\n\n\"Is it safe?\" Prieto asked ironically. \"It is safe to say that the president of Mexico is a puppet of Mexican and foreign (businesses) that do not care about the lives of Mexican workers?\"\n\nU.S. officials have urged Mexico to open plants, suggesting the supply chain of the North American free trade zone could be permanently affected if they didn't resume production.\n\nChristopher Landau, the U.S. ambassador to Mexico, launched a Twitter campaign last month, writing \"There are risks everywhere, but we don't all stay at home for fear we are going to get in a car accident ... The destruction of the economy is also a health threat.\"\n\nEllen Lord, U.S. undersecretary of defense for acquisition and sustainment, recently said that Mexican plant closures were affecting U.S. companies.\n\nBut the pressure for reopening is building as well in Mexican states where the lockdown has caused huge job losses.\n\nCarlos Joaquin Gonzalez, the governor of the Caribbean coast state of Quintana Roo -- home to resorts like Cancun -- said his state has lost 22% of its jobs after about 8 million people cancelled trips to the area this year due to pandemic.\n\n\"Obviously, this requires us to think about reopening -- as soon as possible,\" Joaquin Gonzalez said.\n\nFor most people, the new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia and death.\n\nNationwide, Mexico has lost about 500,000 jobs due to the pandemic, and the auto industry appears eager to get back to work.\n\nVolkswagen de Mexico said last week it is planning to reopen its assembly plant in Puebla state and its engine factory in Guanajuato state on June 1.\n\nGeneral Motors said it hadn't fixed \"an exact date\" for reopening its plant, also in the Guanajuato city of Silao, but some workers there reported getting notices to report for work on May 18. Ford said, \"We are waiting to receive (government) approval to operate.\"\n\nOfficials also said other businesses and schools would begin to reopen. Marquez said that schools and businesses would be allowed to reopen in about one-tenth of Mexico's townships that have no recorded cases of coronavirus. There are about 269 such \"townships of hope,\" that neither have active cases in their own territory nor in adjoining townships. They are largely located in rural areas in north-central and southeastern Mexico.\n\nA new, four-color coding system will be in place by June 1 to tell people and businesses what activities are allowed. But L\u00f3pez Obrador said it would be left up to individual states to act as they say best. \"We are not going to fight,\" the president said.\n\nThe government of Mexico City, which has been hardest hit by the virus and where most of the hospitals are full, announced that manufacturing and construction can restart on June 1. Restaurants and department stores can open at one-third capacity starting June 15, and sports events can be played without spectators. Schools will re-open sometime in August.",

    "Q&A: Safety a big concern as workers return to their jobs": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "NEW YORK -- With more businesses across the country easing back to life, the new challenge will be how to keep workers safe during the pandemic.\n\nFrom temperature checks, contact tracing, social distancing and staggered schedules, a variety of new protocols are being implemented. The stakes are high since without a vaccine or treatment, an outbreak of the new coronavirus could be devastating for companies and workers alike, whether it's in a meatpacking plant or an office.\n\n\"Businesses face existential threats all the time. They are built to make decisions that will determine the life or death of the company,\" said Andrew Challenger, senior vice president of the staffing firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas. \"Choices that affect the life or death of their employees now need to be made for the first time. The stakes have never been higher.\"\n\nBrian Kuhn, a data analyst in Roxbury, New Jersey, worked in an office with about 50 people until mid-March, when they switched to remote work. His company has not asked him to come back to the office yet, but he says if they did, he would not feel comfortable, even with precautions in place.\n\n\"I don't think any of that prevents someone coming in who is asymptomatic and spreading it,\" he said. \"It poses a risk to each of us that just is not necessary at all. ... Prevention is the most important thing.\"\n\nHere are some questions and answers on what returning to work will look like:\n\nHOW ARE COMPANIES MONITORING EMPLOYEE HEALTH?\n\nCompanies are introducing a variety of new tools and techniques to monitor the health of their employees. The simplest method is temperature checks. A variety of companies make no-touch infrared forehead or camera temperature takers. U.S. automakers, for example, make employees fill out questionnaires daily to see if they have symptoms, take temperatures with no-touch thermometers before workers enter buildings, and require gloves, masks and face shields.\n\nWhile this can be somewhat effective, plenty of people could have a temperature for reasons unrelated to coronavirus, such as another illness or even rigorous exercise. In addition, people with asymptomatic coronavirus might not have a temperature and still spread the disease.\n\n\"Checking temperature doesn't necessarily correlate directly with COVID,\" said Aiha Nguyen program director of Labor Futures at Data & Society, a New York-based institute that studies the cultural impact of technological change.\n\nEmployer-led contact tracing is another tool companies will use to reopen. Contact tracing is a method of identifying people who may have come into contact with someone who has the virus in an effort to suppress transmission.\n\nMany companies are offering tech that purports to do contact tracing digitally using mobile phones or other devices. Some apps use Bluetooth or other signals to track people. Others analyze ambient signals around the device to create a digital footprint, then compare it to other phones to determine if they have been in close proximity. PriceWaterhouseCoopers is testing a contract tracing app that uses this method and plans to use it internally as well as offer it to clients.\n\nA company's human resource department can work backwards to notify people who have been in proximity with an infected employee. The data is usually anonymized. With some apps, data is sent to a remote server and others keep it on the phone.\n\nContact tracing can be done offline, with employees self reporting at the end of each work day who they have been in contact with. Then if an employee tests positive the company can contact the people they were in contact with.\n\nSocial distancing can be a challenge but some employers are getting around that by staggering employee hours and limiting the number of people in the workplace. Google, for example, plans to reopen some offices beginning in June, keeping capacity at 10% to 15%.\n\nIS IT LEGAL FOR COMPANIES TO TRACK THEIR EMPLOYEES' HEALTH?\n\nRegulations vary by state, but generally it is legal to require employees to download tracing apps, and in some cases, it could be argued that it is required, since under the Occupational Safety and Health Act employers must give workers \"employment and a place of employment, which are free from recognized hazards that are causing or are likely to cause death or serious physical harm.\"\n\nThe American Disabilities Act prohibits employers from making disability-related inquiries and requiring medical examinations of employees, except under limited circumstances. The coronavirus is one exception because it has been deemed a \"direct threat\" under ADA guidelines by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, so employers have more leeway. That means they can test employees if it is job-related and consistent with business necessity.\n\nCompanies probably couldn't test an employee isolating at home, but it becomes necessary when bringing people back to the office. They still have to comply with confidentiality rules laid out by the ADA, so temperature checks and other medical inquiries should be private. Health records should also be kept separate from employee personnel files.\n\nWHAT ABOUT EMPLOYEE PRIVACY RIGHTS?\n\nBecause contract tracing involves collecting sensitive data about people, there are some privacy concerns. Health care providers cannot disclose patient medical information to other entities because of HIPPA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act), which was enacted in 1996 and regulates what health care companies can do with health care data. However, employers and contact tracing apps aren't covered by HIPPA, said Michele Gilman, a privacy lawyer and fellow at Data & Society.\n\n\"One of the concerns here is that this will open the door to employers gathering massive amounts of health data on employees,\" she said. \"A lot of people believe health data is protected by the HIPPA statute. That law does not apply to employers. Employers have free reign over collection of this data and what they do with it.\"\n\nPwC and other app makers say they won't collect information on users. PwC, for example, says no name or personal information is associated with the data and the data goes away in 45 days. But without federal regulation, employers are left to police themselves.\n\nARE THERE ANY GUIDELINES FOR REOPENING?\n\nCompanies must comply with each state's guidelines for reopening, most of which include different requirements for screening, health checks and social distancing. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also offers a online guidance for businesses and employers on how to reopen, including recommendations to minimize risk to employees. It has also posted six one-page \"decision tool\" documents that use traffic signs and other graphics to tell organizations what they should consider before reopening.",

        "authors": [],
        "body": "LONDON -- Queen and singer Adam Lambert have a message for workers on the frontline of the COVID-19 fight: \"You Are the Champions.\"\n\nBrian May, Roger Taylor and Lambert recently gathered virtually to record a new version of the Queen classic, \"We Are the Champions.\"\n\n\"You Are the Champions\" was released early Friday on all streaming and download services, with proceeds going to the World Health Organization's COVID-19 Solidarity Response Fund.\n\n\"I thought, this is a great way to use the legacy that we have to do some good in the world,\" May said.\n\n\"You know, we don't really need to make money anymore. We don't need to be any more famous. We need to use what we have in the best possible way.\"\n\nFor May the release comes at a time of great sadness. The guitarist earlier this week lost a friend who he likened was like a brother to him, to the virus.\n\n\"That's the closest it's come to me physically,\" he said, adding it's given real meaning to the death tolls broadcast daily on television.\n\n\"Each one of those is a family tragedy,\" May said. \"Each one of those people lose a loved one.\n\n\"I think psychologically the human race is going to be very damaged.\"\n\nFor Taylor, the song also has personal significance as his daughter Rory Eleanor Taylor works as a doctor in a London hospital.\n\n\"She's actually in the video with her little cards, displaying advice about isolating, etc.\"\n\nThe music video shows caregivers and frontline workers from across the world as well as empty city scenes and the band performing in their homes.\n\nFor most people, the new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough, that clear up in two to three weeks. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe or fatal illnesses, including pneumonia.\n\nLambert, who joined the track from his Los Angeles home, thinks the song really hits a positive note that everyone is in this together.\n\n\"There's a sense of unity that's happening around the world, even though it's, you know, in a negative, scary time,\" Lambert said. \"I think that we're all understanding each other a little bit more right now. And it's sort of leveling everything out a bit.\"\n\n\"It's only through our connection and our love for each other are we going to get through it together,\" he said.\n\nThe band hopes the charity single will provide some consolation after the pandemic forced them to cancel the 27-show UK and European leg of their biggest ever tour.\n\n\"It was pretty heartbreaking to have to let it go. We have rescheduled for next year and we're all crossing our fingers. We don't know do we? We don't know if it's going to be appropriate to get thousands of people in one room, even in 12 months from now,\" May said.\n\nTaylor remains optimistic that live music will survive.\n\n\"I can't believe that festivals and live music won't come back. It's part of our ... DNA really now.\"\n\nIn the meantime, Taylor and May remain in lockdown in their respective homes in the UK. Like many, May is struggling with the loss of freedom.\n\n\"It doesn't get any easier as time gets on. It's getting worse if anything. I feel like everything that I worked for in my life has been kind of taken away and put somewhere where I can't reach it,\" he said.\n\nIt's not all bad, as Taylor noted.\n\n\"I think people have found lots of good things to do,\" he said. \"I think there's been a lot more contact within families and friends.\"",

    "Rare inflammatory condition affects some kids with COVID-19": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "Dozens of U.S. children have been hospitalized with a serious inflammatory condition possibly linked with the coronavirus and first seen in Europe.\n\nNew York authorities announced Wednesday that 64 potential cases had been reported to the state. The advisory followed an alert earlier this week about 15 cases in New York City.\n\nA few other U.S. children have been affected during the pandemic, including a 6-month-old infant in California diagnosed with COVID-19 and Kawasaki disease, a rare condition that causes swelling in blood vessels.\n\nFever, abdominal pain and skin rashes are common symptoms, while some New York children have developed heart inflammation requiring intensive care. Most had evidence of current or past coronavirus infections.\n\nMedical groups in Britain, Italy and Spain warned doctors last month to look out for the condition.\n\nSome doctors say the New York cases increase the likelihood that the syndrome is a rare complication of COVID-19 although that remains to be proven.\n\n\"It raises our antenna a bit and tells is we need to be vigilant about unusual and more severe complications of COVID-19\" in children, said Dr. Larry Kociolek, an infectious disease specialist at Lurie Children's Hospital in Chicago.\n\nIn a news release Wednesday, the American Heart Association emphasized that the condition is rare.\n\n\"We want to reassure parents -- this appears to be uncommon. While Kawasaki disease can damage the heart or blood vessels, the heart problems usually go away in five or six weeks, and most children fully recover,\" said Dr. Jane Newburger, an association member and director of the Kawasaki Program at Boston Children's Hospital.\n\nAt least 3,000 U.S. children are diagnosed with Kawasaki disease each year. It's most common in kids younger than 6 and in boys. It was first reported in Japanese children and occurs worldwide.\n\nThe unusual syndrome prompted a conference call last weekend with researchers, doctors and U.S. and international health officials, the Kawasaki Disease Foundation said in a statement Thursday. The participants concluded that affected children should be treated by specialists at hospitals where intensive care is readily available since some children with the inflammatory condition become sicker rapidly.\n\nDoctors still believe that most children with COVID-19 develop only mild illness.\n\nMost published research on the coronavirus in kids is from China and does not include mention of the inflammation syndrome.\n\nDr. Sonja Rasmussen, a former U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention specialist now at the University of Florida, said more published data are needed to clarify how COVID-19 affects U.S. children and that the possibility of severe disease should not be dismissed.\n\n''I don't think we can be complacent about COVID-19 in children,\" Rasmussen said.\n\nDr. Sean O'Leary, a member of the American Academy of Pediatrics' infectious disease committee, said scientists and doctors in the U.S. and other countries are collaborating to better understand the inflammatory condition. But he emphasized that it has not been reported in most children with the coronavirus.\n\n\"This is not something parents need to panic about,\" he said.\n\nFollow AP Medical Writer Lindsey Tanner at @LindseyTanner\n\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute's Department of Science Education.

Jerry Falwell Jr., president of the evangelical school, appeared to reference Gandy-Golden during a Fox News appearance on Wednesday.\n\n\"Even the one student who was an online student who never was on campus who tested positive, it turns out he quit school to go into the NFL draft back early in March even though he was online, but somehow that got press,\" Falwell said. \"That was crazy.\"\n\nLiberty spokesman Scott Lamb responded to an email inquiry about Gandy-Golden's diagnosis and Falwell's comments with a paragraph from the school's website that does not specifically mention the former football player. The site makes reference to a graduated student who tested positive for the coronavirus on March 24 but was not on campus during the two weeks prior.\n\n\"Prior information that the graduated student came to an on campus clinic was incorrect,\" it said. \"While the student lives in Lynchburg with family, the location of infection cannot be pinpointed, in part, because the graduated student traveled to Florida on business in the two-week period before the test.\"\n\nA Redskins spokesman said the team was unable to comment on Gandy-Golden's medical situation.\n\nWashington selected Gandy-Golden in the fourth round of the draft last month, 142nd overall.

    "Riots and fear as coronavirus hits US juvenile centers": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "Frustrations had been building inside juvenile detention centers nationwide as the number of coronavirus cases continued to climb. So when Nicole Hingle got the call from her 17-year-old son, Jace, she was not surprised. He told her nearly 40 kids had rioted inside the Bridge City facility in Louisiana where he is detained. More than a dozen youths escaped from another Louisiana lockup this month.\n\n\"It's a real mess, everything is destroyed,\" the teen told his mother, adding that youth were kicking down doors and one staff member was injured.\n\nDue to coronavirus lockdowns, it's been more than two months since Hingle has been able to visit her son. She accused administrators of keeping her in the dark as the number of positive coronavirus cases in Bridge City climbed to 10. She's grown upset by the lack of a clear plan to protect or release those held inside.\n\nAs more and more state and local officials announce the release of thousands of at-risk inmates from the nation's adult jails and prisons, parents along with children rights' groups and criminal justice experts say vulnerable youths should be allowed to serve their time at home. But demands for large-scale releases have been largely ignored, in part because decisions are often carried out county by county, with judges reviewing juvenile cases individually.\n\nSuch legal hurdles have resulted in some kids with symptoms being thrown into isolation for 23 hours a day, in what amounts to solitary confinement, according to relatives and youth advocates. They say many have been cut off from programs, counselors and school. Some have not been issued masks, social distancing is nearly impossible and they have limited access to phones. In some states, authorities have been shuttling kids between facilities, trying to make sure sick and healthy young people are kept apart.\n\nGrowing fears and frustrations have led to violence and mayhem not just in Louisiana, but at juvenile centers in other coronavirus hot spots such as New York. Sheriff's deputies responded to a facility in Portland, Oregon, this month after a \"disturbance\" broke out, but no injuries were reported.\n\n\"If this storm is coming in your direction, don't wait until you have 100 mile-an-hour winds to put the boards up on the windows,\" Vincent Schiraldi, co-director at Columbia University Justice Lab and a former correctional administrator, warned other juvenile facilities nationwide. \"Deal with it now.\"\n\nAs of Sunday, 150 juveniles and 283 staff at facilities nationwide had tested positive for COVID-19, according to an unofficial log kept by Josh Rovner at the Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit The Sentencing Project, though he believes the real number is likely \"much higher.\"\n\nNew York is one of the few cities that operates two juvenile facilities. At the first sign of illness there, the city agency that oversees the sites put healthy kids at the Crossroads Juvenile Center in Brooklyn and moved the infected residents to the Horizon Juvenile Center in the Bronx. A fight that broke out there two weeks ago was only quieted after dozens of police were deployed.\n\nThe city's Administration for Children's Services said some staff suffered minor injuries, including one who needed offsite medical treatment.\n\nA similar situation occurred at two branches of the Swanson Center for Youth in Louisiana, where 17 kids have tested positive. It was reserving one facility for healthy kids and another for the infected. Tensions built as kids were transferred back and forth. More than a dozen youth briefly escaped in two separate incidents, according to a statement from the Louisiana Office of Juvenile Justice\n\nOn Monday, officials in Tennessee said 26 youths tested positive at Memphis Center for Success and Independence after mass testing was conducted.\n\nHowever, many facilities only test those with symptoms. And some juvenile justice agencies, citing privacy concerns, have been slow to release even basic information, including the number of infected.\n\nThe same number have tested positive in Virginia at the Bon Air Juvenile Correctional Center outside Richmond. Valerie Boykin, director of the Department of Juvenile Justice, said parents and loved ones are kept informed in a timely manner.\n\nBut Rachael Deane of the Legal Aid Justice Center's Just Children Program accused the department of not providing proper medical care to youth at the facility. She said in a letter that a client with symptoms was not tested and another whose test came back positive was never examined by a doctor. She added that youths were being kept in their rooms for at least 23 hours a day and that the department was not communicating with parents when their kids became infected.\n\nThe coronavirus does not typically hit most young people hard, but it has been shown to attack anyone with underlying health problems. Locked-up children face much higher rates of asthma and other respiratory ailments along with substance abuse issues.\n\nMore than 2.2 million people are incarcerated in the United States -- more than anywhere else in the world. The juvenile population behind bars has been decreasing over the past couple of decades and stood at around 43,000 in 2017, the last available count. Roughly 70% were accused of low-level crimes.\n\nNate Balis, of the Baltimore-based Annie E. Casey Foundation, said while a new study shows a drop in the number of youths at local secure detention centers -- where they are held until a court decides whether to confine them until their hearing or allow them to wait at home -- many more could be released to home confinement to prevent the spread of COVID-19.\n\n\"Whether or not kids are being released has to do with who's calling the shots and that is very different from state to state,\" he said.\n\nThe Pennsylvania Supreme Court denied a petition earlier this month that would limit new admissions and allow for the immediate release of some youth already detained in order to prevent the spread of the virus in juvenile facilities.\n\nMaryland's Court of Appeals denied a similar petition but offered guidance to administrative judges, saying the health and well-being of the juveniles should be taken into consideration during the public health crisis.",

        "body": "Nicole Hingle wasn't surprised when the call came. Frustrations had been building inside juvenile detention centers nationwide as the number of coronavirus cases continued to climb. Now, her 17-year-old son Jace, was on the phone telling her around 40 kids had rioted at his facility in Louisiana -- the same state where more than a dozen youths escaped during two breakouts at another site this month.\n\nHingle said her son described whirring helicopters above the Bridge City facility just outside New Orleans. Juveniles kicked down their doors, a SWAT team swarmed in, kids were pepper-sprayed and a staffer was injured during the melee.\n\n\"It's a real mess,\" the teen told his mother. \"Everything is destroyed.\"\n\nDue to coronavirus lockdown measures, it's been more than two months since Hingle has been able to visit her son. She has accused administrators of keeping her in the dark, and said she was growing increasingly upset by the lack of a clear plan to protect or release those held inside. Ten youths have tested positive at Bridge City in recent weeks.\n\n\"This could be life or death for my child,\" said Hingle, adding that her son was among a group transferred to the Acadiana Center for Youth after the brawl, where they were pepper-sprayed twice over the weekend by parole officers brought in to help due to short staffing.\n\n\"I don't want condolences from the state. I don't want condolences from the governor,\" she said. \"I do not want sympathy. I want them to do what is right on behalf of our kids because they cannot save themselves nor can we save them without the help of these politicians.\"\n\nAs more and more state and local officials announce the release of thousands of at-risk inmates from the nation's adult jails and prisons, parents along with children rights' groups and criminal justice experts say vulnerable youths should be allowed to serve their time at home. But they say demands for large-scale releases have been largely ignored. Decisions are often not made at the state level, but instead carried out county by county, with individual judges reviewing juvenile cases one by one.\n\nSuch legal hurdles have resulted in some kids with symptoms being thrown into isolation for 23 hours a day, in what amounts to solitary confinement, according to relatives and youth advocates. They say many have been cut off from programs, counselors and school. Some have not been issued masks, social distancing is nearly impossible and they have been given limited access to phone calls home. One mother reported that her daughter was so cut off from the outside world -- with no TV and staff not wearing any protective gear -- that the girl had no idea a deadly virus was even circulating in America. In some states, authorities have been shuttling kids between facilities, trying to make sure sick and healthy young people are kept apart.\n\nGrowing fears and frustrations have led to violence and mayhem not just in Louisiana, but at juvenile centers in other coronavirus hot spots such as New York. Young people are calling their parents to say they're scared and desperate to escape. Sheriff's deputies responded to a facility in Portland, Oregon, this month after a \"disturbance\" broke out, but no injuries were reported.\n\n\"The department has maintained essential staff at the juvenile detention center in accordance with national standards throughout the COVID-19 outbreak, and is working hard to balance the social and emotional needs of youth in our care during this extraordinary time,\" the Multnomah County Juvenile Services Division said in a statement.\n\nVincent Schiraldi, co-director at Columbia University Justice Lab and a former correctional administrator, said he hoped these problems would serve as a warning to other juvenile facilities, especially those that have not yet been hit by the virus.\n\n\"If this storm is coming in your direction, don't wait until you have 100 mile-an-hour winds to put the boards up on the windows,\" he said. \"Deal with it now. Come up with your COVID plan now. Get everybody out of your facility that can be gotten out, start training your staff, start developing your lines of communication, so that if people start getting sick and staff start calling in sick, then you can manage it as best you can.\"\n\nAs of Sunday, 150 juveniles and 283 staff had tested positive for COVID-19 at facilities nationwide, according to an unofficial log being kept by Josh Rovner at the Washington DC-based nonprofit The Sentencing Project. He said because testing has been so limited, it's likely the real numbers are \"much, much higher.\"\n\nNew York is one of the few cities that operates two juvenile facilities. At the first sign of illness there, the city agency that oversees the sites decided to put healthy kids at the Crossroads Juvenile Center in Brooklyn, while moving all of the infected residents to the Horizon Juvenile Center in the Bronx.\n\nFernando Cabrera, a Bronx council member, said he saw the potential danger of suddenly ripping kids away from familiar staff and routines, especially during a time of crisis.\n\n\"You transfer all these kids to another borough, they are going to be anxious,\" he said after dozens of police responded when a fight broke out in Crossroads about two weeks ago. \"They are in self-preservation mode.\"\n\nThe city's Administration for Children's Services provided few details about the brawl, but said some staff suffered minor injuries, including one who needed offsite medical treatment.\n\nA similar situation occurred at two branches of the Swanson Center for Youth in Louisiana. Its facility in Columbia had been designated for healthy youths, while its Monroe site was reserved for the infected, resulting in kids being transferred back and forth. So far, at least 17 have tested positive for the coronavirus in the two facilities, according to The Sentencing Project. In addition, two escapes occurred this month at Monroe involving 13 youths, according to a statement from the Louisiana Office of Juvenile Justice.\n\nOne of the main obstacles to monitoring the spread of the coronavirus in youth lockups is that so few tests are being administered. In addition, some juvenile justice agencies, citing privacy concerns, have refused to release even basic information, including the number of people infected.\n\nVirginia's Department of Juvenile Justice initially didn't release figures. But on April 17, it revealed that more than two dozen kids had tested positive at the Bon Air Juvenile Correctional Center outside Richmond, accounting for a quarter of all reported cases at youth facilities nationwide at that time, according to The Sentencing Project. On Monday, the Tennessee Department of Children's Services said 26 youths have tested positive at the Memphis Center for Success and Independence.\n\nNo severe cases were reported at Bon Air, and the majority were asymptomatic, according to a statement from Christopher Moon, the department's chief physician.\n\nBut Rachael Deane, of the Legal Aid Justice Center's Just Children Program, accused the department in a letter of not providing proper medical care to kids housed at Bon Air. She said one client with symptoms was not tested and another whose swab came back positive was never examined by a doctor. Deane also alleged that the department wasn't communicating with parents when their kids became infected and that some clients had been denied access to counseling for weeks. She charged that legal rights were also being violated.\n\n\"Our clients report they are kept in their rooms for at least 23 hours per day. Although they are supposed to receive one hour per day outside their rooms, this is not always honored,\" the letter said. \"Even when their free hour is made available, residents are sometimes forced to choose between using it for essential activities, like taking a shower, instead of exercise and recreation.\"\n\nValerie Boykin, director of the Virginia department, said in a statement that Bon Air residents' parents and loved ones are kept informed in a timely manner.\n\nMore than 2.2 million people are incarcerated in the United States -- more than anywhere in the world. But the threat posed by COVID-19 extends well beyond the prison walls. Even though most personal visits have been stopped, hundreds of thousands of guards, wardens and other correctional facility administrators go in and out every day, potentially carrying the virus home to their families and communities.\n\nThe juvenile population behind bars has been decreasing over the past couple of decades and stood at around 43,000 in 2017, the last available count. Roughly 70% were accused of low-level crimes.\n\nIt's unclear exactly how many kids have been released due to the coronavirus, but a new survey by the Baltimore-based Annie E. Casey Foundation looked at a snapshot of juvenile justice agencies in 30 states housing more than 3,700 youths. The survey found the number of young people in local secure detention centers -- where they are held until a court decides whether to confine them until their hearings or allow them to wait at home -- dropped 24% from March to April, mostly due to fewer admissions. However, the data only represents about one-tenth of counties nationwide.\n\nNate Balis, director of the foundation's juvenile justice strategy group, said far more young people should be released to home confinement to prevent the spread of COVID-19, especially given that the overall population is only a fraction of the number of adults behind bars.\n\n\"Whether or not kids are being released has to do with who's calling the shots and that is very different from state to state,\" he said. \"We're talking about states that may have a couple hundred young people in custody or less.\"\n\nThe Pennsylvania Supreme Court denied a petition earlier this month asking it to limit new admissions and allow for the immediate release of some detained youths to prevent the spread of the virus in juvenile facilities.\n\nMaryland's Court of Appeals denied a similar petition but offered guidance to administrative judges, saying the health and well-being of the juveniles should be taken into consideration during the public health crisis.\n\nThe coronavirus doesn't typically hit young people hard, but it has been shown to attack anyone with underlying health problems. Locked-up children face much higher rates of asthma and other respiratory ailments, along with substance abuse issues.\n\nUp to 70% have mental health problems and many have learning disabilities or are illiterate, with more than half placed in a grade level below their age, according to the nonprofit Center for Prisoner Health and Human Rights.\n\nSeven youths and 11 staff have tested positive in juvenile detention centers in Connecticut.\n\nJibrelle Milner said her 17-year-old son is only getting out of his two-person room at the Manson Youth Institution in New Haven County for one or two hours a day. She said he's supposed to graduate high school this year, but he's a special education student who's only receiving learning packets to complete on his own.\n\nShe said he suffers from allergies and asthma and is still recovering from injuries after being shot twice last year. She worries about the virus but is equally concerned about his mental health.\n\n\"There's no visitation, there's no school going on,\" Milner said. \"I feel like it's incarceration on top of incarceration.\"",

    "Rural California county hums back to life, defying order": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "ALTURAS, Calif. -- At the Brass Rail, two neon signs were beaming \"OPEN\" Friday, as the town and county slowly hummed to life, the first to do so in California in defiance of Gov. Gavin Newsom's order to stay home.\n\nAbout a dozen customers were in the bar of the Basque restaurant -- the only portion open so far -- eager to be back among friends and neighbors after a six-week shutdown mandated by the Democratic governor 300 miles (480 kilometres) south in Sacramento. A few wore masks.\n\n\"It's been a long haul. We're a small community,\" said owner Jodie Larranga. \"It's not that we've been given permission, we've just had a bellyful. People are fed up.\"\n\nModoc County is a place that defies California stereotypes. It's where semi-trailers carrying logs from the nearby national forest pass on the highway and where seven in 10 voted for Donald Trump in 2016. And its residents are putting their faith in local officials, not the state.\n\n\"Tex would never say it's OK to be out in public if he didn't truly feel it in his heart,\" said Amber McCandles, 41, referring to Sheriff Tex Dowdy. He \"has done a great job keeping us healthy. He shut the town down and kept us isolated, in quarantine, and kept us COVID-free.\"\n\nWith no cases of coronavirus among 9,000 residents in the far northeastern part of the state and plenty of land to spread out on, county officials moved to reopen Friday after what they said was careful planning and with stringent limits -- businesses could only have half the patrons and customers must stay 6 feet (1.8 meters) apart.\n\nFor the vast majority of people, coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia, and death.\n\nIn Modoc County, hair salons, churches, restaurants and the county's only movie theater were also allowed to reopen. About half the functioning businesses on Alturas' main street appeared open, though a third of the storefronts were already vacant.\n\nAt Gates Gallery and Trading Post, owner Gerry Gates planned to reopen Friday with or without permission. He thinks Modoc County is \"reasonably safe\" to reopen.\n\n\"You just hope it's the right decision and we'll see. The way the economy is tanking, you've got to do something,\" he said.\n\nStill, in a county so spread out that one supervisor said they were social distancing before it was even a thing, some were wary of outsiders bringing in the virus now that businesses are open.\n\nAt a general store just across the county line from Nevada, a woman who refused to be named said she wasn't interested in talking out-of-towners and lamented that the media was \"making fun of\" its residents.\n\nLocal officials stressed the reopening followed Newsom's phased plan to reopen the whole state, albeit earlier than he's approved.\n\n\"Our residents were moving forward with or without us,\" Heather Hardwick, deputy director of emergency services, said in an email, adding that residents needed guidelines to do it safely.\n\nAt Country Hearth Restaurant and Bakery in Cedarville, manager Janet Irene said she's been following \"the guiding light\" of county officials in keeping the small eatery she's run for 35 years closed except for takeout during the lockdown.\n\nShe was relieved to reopen it Friday morning.\n\n\"People were constantly asking to be able to sit in the restaurant and it was really, really difficult during this time to deny that. It's like the hardest thing I've ever done in my life,\" she said.\n\nNewsom has declined to address Modoc County's move directly and has not responded to a demand from six other rural Northern California counties to also be allowed to reopen.\n\nHe said Friday during his daily coronavirus briefing that he is paying attention to their pleas.\n\n\"Know that and know that I'm looking forward to answering your call, addressing your anxiety, and it's not lost on me. We're not turning our back to those concerns,\" Newsom said.\n\nNot everyone waived off the concern about defying the governor.\n\n\"I'm really concerned about the governor not giving his approval,\" said Irene, at the Country Hearth. \"It could be that he would approve it anyway but he just has his plate full, I'm sure.\"\n\nThis story has been corrected to remove a reference to a lumber mill. The logs on trucks are coming from Modoc National Forest.\n\nWilliams reported from San Francisco. Associated Press writers John Antczak in Los Angeles contributed to this report.",

I'm being treated.\"\n\nPeskov, 52, has been Putin's spokesman since 2008, but started working him with in the early 2000s.\n\nRussians who have the virus but light or no symptoms of illness are allowed to stay home, and it wasn't immediately clear if Peskov's hospitalization reflects the gravity of his condition or was an extra precaution.\n\nReporters from the Kremlin pool said on Twitter that Peskov was last seen in public on April 30 \"at a meeting with Vladimir Putin.\" It was not clear whether it means the two were in the same room, as Putin has been conducting all his meetings via teleconference in recent weeks.\n\nSince early in the outbreak, the Russian president minimized meetings and switched to holding daily video calls with Cabinet members and aides.\n\nPeskov's announcement comes just a day after Putin said Russia was successful in slowing down infections and announced easing some of the nationwide lockdown restrictions.\n\nRussia has reported more than 232,000 confirmed coronavirus cases and more than 2,100 virus-related deaths, as of Tuesday. Hours before Putin made televised remarks Monday about ending the country's partial economic lockdown, health officials reported a daily record of over 11,600 new cases.\n\nRussian Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin revealed on April 30 that he had tested positive for the virus and planned to self-isolate. Putin asked the prime minister to call him after checking into a hospital.\n\nMishustin's spokesperson said Monday that the prime minister \"continues to undergo treatment in one of the state-run medical facilities\" and his health was improving, but gave no details about the severity of his condition.\n\nFollow AP coverage of the virus outbreak at https://apnews.com/VirusOutbreak and https://apnews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak",

        "body": "WASHINGTON -- Five sailors on the aircraft carrier sidelined in Guam due to a COVID-19 outbreak have tested positive for the virus for the second time and have been taken off the ship, according to the Navy.\n\nThe resurgence of the virus in the five sailors on the USS Theodore Roosevelt underscores the befuddling behavior of the highly contagious virus and raises questions about how troops that test positive can be reintegrated into the military, particularly on ships.\n\nAll five sailors had previously tested positive and had gone through at least two weeks of isolation. As part of the process, they all had to test negative twice in a row, with the tests separated by at least a day or two before they were allowed to go back to the ship.\n\nThe Roosevelt has been at port in Guam since late March after the outbreak of the virus was discovered. More than 4,000 of the 4,800 crew members have gone ashore since then for quarantine or isolation. Earlier this month hundreds of sailors began returning to the ship, in coordinated waves, to get ready to set sail again.\n\nIn a statement Friday, the Navy said that, while onboard, the five sailors self-monitored and adhered to strict social distancing protocols.\n\n\"These five Sailors developed influenza-like illness symptoms and did the right thing reporting to medical for evaluation,\" the Navy said, adding that they were immediately removed from the ship and put back in isolation. A small number of other sailors who were in contact with them were also taken off the ship.\n\nAs of Thursday, more than 2,900 sailors have reboarded the ship, and about 25% of the more than 1,000 who had tested positive have now recovered, according to the Navy.\n\nOne U.S. official familiar with the situation on the ship said commanders don't know why this is happening but suggested it could be related to questions about testing accuracy. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations, said that screening has been intensified on the ship. And, anyone who exhibits any flu-like symptoms at all is being tested and removed.\n\nThe sailors have been tested using the nasal swab. And in some cases the infection can be at such a low level that it is not detected by the test.",

        "authors": [],
        "body": "SAO PAULO -- Brazil's biggest homeless population has begun succumbing to COVID-19, and activists warn the worst is yet to come as colder weather bears down and shelters risk becoming hotbeds for infection.\n\nAt least 22 homeless people in Sao Paulo have died from COVID-19 so far, according to City Hall, and there are hundreds of suspected cases throughout the state, both on the streets and in shelters. J\u00falio Lancellotti, a 71-year-old priest, said nothing he's seen these people face in three decades compares to the hardship he expects from the new pandemic -- not economic turmoil, waves of violence nor dengue fever.\n\n\"I have the feeling this will be our biggest challenge, and the most difficult part isn't even here yet,\" Lancellotti told The Associated Press.\n\nSao Paulo's homeless population exploded in recent years, with official figures soaring to nearly 25,000 last year, up 60% from 2015. Brazil's long-lasting economic crisis and cuts to social programs pitched thousands into the streets of the country's richest city. Then came the coronavirus.\n\nOn Sunday, Lancellotti welcomed dozens of them into his parish in eastern Sao Paulo. \"These are the most vulnerable people of all. No hygiene, social isolation or access to handouts,\" he said. \"They go to shelters that have infected beds.\"\n\nCity Hall's announcement of nearly two dozen deaths among those living on the streets drew outcry, but Lancellotti and other social workers believe those figures are underestimated -- as are Brazil's figures in general. Latin America's hardest-hit nation officially counts more than 11,000 deaths by the virus.\n\nFor most people, the new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, which can include fever and cough. The risk of death is greater for older adults and people with other health problems.\n\nEight of the homeless victims had preexisting conditions and none died in shelters, local authorities said. Sao Paulo has two shelters for suspected COVID-19 cases, with 40 residents in total. There are another 10 centers for the homeless in general with more than 4,400 beds, about one quarter of which are newly installed for use during the pandemic.\n\nMarco Antonio, 45, said he won't be seeking refuge any time soon. He sells recyclables that he wheels around all day in a shopping cart and, since the outbreak began, he has been wearing gloves and a mask. And he'll share sleeping space with no more than four neighbors.\n\n\"I used to stay at a shelter, but it is too many people, 400 people together. That is not viable. It is easier to get it (coronavirus) there,\" he said.\n\nHis concern about shelters isn't unfounded. In the city of Sao Jose do Rio Preto, 270 miles (440 kilometers) north, 27 homeless people tested positive for COVID-19 at the Casa do Cirineu shelter for almost 100 residents.\n\nYet as winter draws near in the Southern Hemisphere, homeless people in Sao Paulo may have no choice but to move into shelters, said Robson Mendon\u00e7a, the head of a homeless movement. Once that happens, risk of contagion will grow substantially.\n\n\"Most of them have nothing but one change of clothing,\" Mendon\u00e7a said. \"If they clean up, they will wear the same clothes. How can they not be infected? How can they avoid infecting others?\"",

        "authors": [],
        "body": "In less than 24 hours, Children's National Hospital in Washington, D.C., has admitted several children with COVID-19 who are also experiencing a constellation of symptoms that resemble \"Kawasaki disease,\" a rare inflammatory syndrome typically affecting children under the age of 5.\n\nA representative from Children's National Hospital said the children exhibited \"Kawasaki-like characteristics,\" joining a growing number of hospitals in the U.S. and U.K. that have reported similar cases.\n\nKawasaki disease symptoms include fever, rash, eye irritation, swollen lymph nodes and/or swelling of the hands and feet.\n\nThe disease has been linked to COVID-19 in some children, but the exact cause remains a medical mystery.\n\nThese American cases are raising new concerns of a new global pattern emerging of critically ill children with COVID-19.\n\nOn Sunday, the Paediatric Intensive Care Society (PICS) in the U.K. tweeted about a rise in cases of children in critical condition. These children were manifesting a \"hyperinflammatory state\" that was \"multi-system\" and seemed to share common features with two existing rare diseases, alarming medical experts.\n\nThe link between Kawasaki syndrome and COVID-19 is still not well established. The UK Kawasaki Disease Foundation released a statement Wednesday, saying that many children with the disease tested negative for COVID-19 and \"there is no current evidence of any increased incidence or greater susceptibility to COVID-19 infection for children who had Kawasaki Disease in the past.\"\n\nNevertheless, some American physicians are taking these reports very seriously.\n\nCOVID-19 cases in children are mostly mild and infrequent -- only 5% of cases nationwide were in children. The PICS alert, however, sheds light on what could be a newly identified manifestation of the infection in children.\n\nIn U.S. hospitals, physicians are noticing varying similarities with the U.K. report and their own cases.\n\nDr. Michael Bell, the division chief for critical care at Children's National Hospital, said 10 children in the hospital's pediatric ICU have experienced \"severe inflammation,\" determined by blood tests. The children also showed evidence of multi-organ injury, pointing to the wide impact of the inflammation on their bodies.\n\nDr. Audrey John, chief of infectious diseases at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP), said the cases in the U.K. \"definitely rang a bell with some cases we have seen here.\"\n\nThe U.K. cases were similar to two specific rare diseases: toxic shock syndrome (TSS) and Kawasaki disease.\n\n\"There is overlap between Kawasaki disease and toxic shock,\" John said, adding that it would be hard to distinguish between them. The salient feature of toxic shock syndrome is severely low blood pressure as well as fever and rash, which also occur in Kawasaki disease.\n\nDr. Sunil Sood, a physician in pediatric infectious diseases at Cohen Children's Hospital of Northwell Health, also believes the children he is seeing have a Kawasaki-like illness.\n\n\"What is striking to me is the rashes on their skin,\" he said.\n\nSood is concerned because the rashes could represent COVID-19 involvement of the blood vessels, which could be a consequence of the severe inflammation hospitals are reporting. Kawasaki disease is known to cause inflammation of the blood vessels and usually follows a viral infection, although what exactly triggers this is unknown.\n\nOwing to the rarity of this severe inflammatory illness, not all children's hospitals across the U.S. are seeing cases. Dr. Michael Neely, chief of the division of infectious diseases at Children's Hospital Los Angeles, said his hospital has not seen any cases like those described in the U.K.\n\nBut Bell said these reports raise awareness and allow pediatric physicians everywhere to remain on the lookout for a wide spectrum of illnesses.\n\nNeely said there is rapid and regular email communication among pediatric infectious disease centers globally to keep all abreast of what is occurring.\n\nOverall, American hospitals are preparing for the worst, but hoping for the best.\n\n\"We are doing our best to take care of kids. We're very ready in case they get sick. We're hoping they don't,\" Bell said.",

Spain's government has its own experts who make the final decisions on health policy, taking into account the opinion of other institutions and outside experts.\n\nSpanish Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez has warned that he considers it highly probable that the virus will make comebacks until a vaccine is developed.\n\nHealth officials in Spain are carrying out a epidemiological survey to determine the extent of the contagion, including the several thousand people who have been mildly ill with cough and high fever but never been tested in a hospital. There are also believed to be thousands more who were infected but never showed symptoms. On Friday, the health ministry said that medical workers had taken blood samples from over 46,000 people over the first week of the survey. It plans to test 60,000-90,000 overall.\n\nOver 26,000 Spaniards are known to have died from the COVID-19 virus. Spain has gotten control over the outbreak which has infected a confirmed 260,177 people in the country and is now easing restrictions to activate its battered economy.\n\nSpain's army has played a major role in combating the virus under the nation's state of emergency established in mid-March. Thousands of soldiers and military medics have deployed to set up field hospitals, disinfect nursing homes and transport hubs, and transport patients between hospitals and corpses to morgues.\n\nWhen considering steps to prepare for the coming months, the army report said \"it would be extremely important\" to develop a contact tracing method using mobile phone applications. Spain so far has not done that and is relying on a local network of public health clinics to monitor future cases.\n\nFollow AP coverage of the virus outbreak at https://apnews.com/VirusOutbreak and https://apnews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak",

Players from most clubs began individual training sessions on Friday after nearly two months of confinement because of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nThe league said it will \"continue to apply the back-to-training protocol\" that was approved by government authorities to \"guarantee the maximum safety of all players, coaches and club employees.\"\n\nIt said it has \"warned\" everyone to keep following health safety measures suggested by authorities so the numbers of infected players \"remain very low.\"\n\nThe five players who tested positive for COVID-19 will remain sidelined until they fully recover. They are all without symptoms and recovering from the disease, according to the league. They will be allowed to resume practicing after testing negative in two consecutive tests.\n\nAll other players tested negative, the league said. Players, coaches and club employees involved in the training sessions are being tested daily.\n\nThe league did not name the players who tested positive. It also didn't disclose their clubs. Spanish media said three players were from first-division clubs, including Atl\u00e9tico Madrid defender Renan Lodi.\n\nAtl\u00e9tico on Saturday posted a message on an official club social media channel with a picture of the Brazilian and the message: \"Renan Lodi says hello from his home. We will see you very soon on the field, Renan!\"\n\nHe did not practice as the rest of Atl\u00e9tico players resumed their activities on Saturday. None of the players who tested positive reportedly play for Barcelona or Real Madrid.\n\nBarcelona was among the first teams to resume practicing on Friday. Real Madrid is expected to be back in action on Monday.\n\nSpain this week started loosening some of the lockdown measures that had been in place since mid-March because of the pandemic, allowing soccer players to resume training individually at the teams' base camps.\n\nThe league said the players who tested positive must remain in quarantine and continue to train individually at home. The league said it will offer to test the players' relatives as well.\n\nThe league sent clubs a detailed four-stage protocol for the return to practice. The individual training will be followed by smaller group sessions and then full squad sessions.\n\nThe league wants a total training period of about a month before it can restart. It recently said it hoped to resume sometime in June with games without fans.\n\nMore AP soccer: https://apnews.com/Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP -- Sports\n\nTales Azzoni on Twitter: http://twitter.com/tazzoni",

    "Subway closure 'outright disaster' for the homeless who have few safe shelter options, advocates say": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "Homeless New Yorkers will face an even more threatening and dangerous situation when the city shuts down the subway system from 1 a.m. to 5 a.m., according to advocates.\n\nThe shutdown was announced by New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo and Mayor Bill de Blasio in a joint press conference on Thursday.\n\nCuomo said closing the subway for those hours would allow the cars to be sanitized every 24 hours during the novel coronavirus pandemic. De Blasio said that it would also benefit any homeless people who ride the subway during that time.\n\n\"If you're not going back and forth all night on a train, then you actually are coming above ground, where outreach workers are there to help you, where NYPD officer's training in the homeless outreach are there to support homeless people and get them to a better situation,\" de Blasio said.\n\nAdvocates for the homeless felt differently.\n\n\"It's just an outright disaster,\" Joshua Goldfein, a staff attorney at the Legal Aid Society, a New York City-based nonprofit that launched the Homeless Rights Project this year, told ABC News.\n\nGoldfein said that the city is not offering people a safer place to go for shelter. Some homeless people are choosing not to enter congregate shelters out of fear that they will catch the novel coronavirus, or COVID-19, once inside, according to Goldfein.\n\nGiselle Routhier, the policy director at the NYC-based nonprofit Coalition for the Homeless, said that with the new closure, \"the situation will really only get worse.\"\n\nShe said that the outreach workers are not as helpful as de Blasio described, with many just informing the homeless people that they have to leave the train but not offering a safe option of where to go because, as Routhier put it, there are none.\n\n\"In the absence of that, by clearing people off the trains, by getting the police involved ... We're going to be pushing them further into the shadows,\" Routhier said.\n\nThe topic of homeless people on the subway was pushed forward after Cuomo showed the front page of the New York Daily News this week at one of his briefings. The photo on the front page was of a homeless person sleeping in one of the cars. Cuomo called the situation \"disgusting.\"\n\nThere are currently about 19,000 homeless people in congregate shelters across the city, according to Routhier.\n\nOf the city's homeless population, there were 794 positive cases being tracked as of April 29, according to the Department of Social Services. There had also been 61 deaths, according to the department.\n\nThe majority of the cases -- 677 of them -- were in a shelter, the department said.\n\nThe Department of Social Services said a new testing program would be in a handful of shelters across the city this week and new shelters would be added over the next two weeks.\n\nThe testing would be done for all inside the shelter, not just those who are exhibiting symptoms, according to the department.\n\nThe department said it has also implemented \"aggressive strategies to connect anyone who needs it to care or isolation.\" The agency has worked to proactively target single adults from larger shelters for transfer so that people can be more effectively isolated and social distancing can increase in the facilities.\n\nGoldfein and Routhier said the real solution is proper housing. Although de Blasio had announced that the city was opening 6,000 hotel rooms for the homeless in early April, after the crisis began, Routhier said that was a mischaracterization.\n\nThe 6,000 hotel rooms included 3,500 rooms that were already set aside in the city years before the pandemic hit, according to Routhier.\n\n\"That had nothing to do with COVID. That was the city utilizing, in some emergency circumstances, commercial hotels to provide shelter to homeless adults when they didn't have enough regular shelter space,\" Routhier said.\n\nDe Blasio's office did not respond to ABC News' request for comment regarding those 3,500 rooms.\n\nHowever, even at 6,000, both advocates said it's far too few to have a meaningful impact on the homeless population.\n\nRouthier said tens of thousands of rooms of unused hotel rooms should be opened, especially with the subway set to shutdown starting May 6. Picture the Homeless, a New York City-based nonprofit, has also called for de Blasio and Cuomo to open 30,000 hotel rooms out of what they said were hundreds of thousands of unused rooms.\n\n\"People are just going up to the streets in the rain, in the cold and are wandering around looking for a new spot to shelter, which is completely counterproductive,\" she said. \"Bad for their health, bad for public health.\"\n\nShe warned that the situation is far from resolved.\n\nThough there are few statistics for the number of homeless people living on the street in New York City, Routhier said the last estimate -- which is based off of one night -- was 4,000 people. She said she believes that is \"the floor\" and the number is not only higher, but growing.\n\n\"We've seen some increases of people on the streets because of the pandemic. Some people who were in very unstable housing to begin with, renting a room on a week-to-week basis, lost their job ... People who are leaving the shelters because they feel unsafe,\" Routhier said. \"I think it's actually kind of getting worse at this point.\"",

    "Tech-assisted COVID-19 tracking is having some issues": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "PROVIDENCE, R.I. -- Harnessing today's technology to the task of fighting the coronavirus pandemic is turning out to be more complicated than it first appeared.\n\nThe first U.S. states that rolled out smartphone apps for tracing the contacts of COVID-19 patients are dealing with technical glitches and a general lack of interest by their residents. A second wave of tech-assisted pandemic surveillance tools is on its way, this time with the imprimatur of tech giants Apple and Google. But those face their own issues, among them potential accuracy issues and the fact that they won't share any information with governments that could help track the spread of the illness.\n\nContact tracing is a pillar of infection control. It's traditionally conducted by trained public health workers who interview those who may have been exposed, then urge them to get tested and isolate themselves. Some estimates call for as many as 300,000 U.S. workers to do the work effectively, but so far those efforts have lagged.\n\nOther tech companies like Salesforce have offered database tools to assist manual tracing efforts, although those also raise privacy concerns because of the need to collect and store detailed information about people's social connections, health status and whereabouts.\n\nPrivacy advocates warn that the danger of creating new government surveillance powers for the pandemic could lead to much bigger problems in the future. In a new policy paper shared with The Associated Press, the American Civil Liberties Union is warning state governments to tread more carefully and establish stricter privacy procedures before deploying technology meant to detect and curb new coronavirus outbreaks.\n\nEven the most privacy-minded tools, such as those to be released soon by Apple and Google, require constraints so that they don't become instruments of surveillance or oppression. \"The risks of getting it wrong are enormous,\" said Neema Singh Guliani, a senior legislative counsel with the ACLU.\n\nACLU's report says the worst location-tracking technology should be rejected outright, such as apps that track individual movements via satellite-based GPS technology and feed sensitive personal data into centralized government databases. \"Good designs don't require you to gather people's location information and store that,\" Singh Guliani said.\n\nShe urged governments to set rules addressing both privacy and efficacy so that surveillance tools don't interfere with more conventional public health methods.\n\nUtah, North Dakota and South Dakota were the first U.S. states to launch voluntary phone apps that enable public health departments to track the location and connections of people who test positive for the coronavirus. But governors haven't had much luck getting the widespread participation needed for them to work effectively.\n\nThe state with the highest known rate of participation so far is South Dakota, where last week about 2% of residents had the Care19 app on their phones. Last week was also the first time it recorded a single infection. The same app is getting even less support in North Dakota.\n\n\"This is a red state,\" said Crystal Wolfrum, a paralegal in Minot, North Dakota, who says she's one of the only people among her neighbors and friends to download the app. \"They don't want to wear masks. They don't want to be told what to do. A lot of people I talk to are, like, 'Nope, you're not going to track me.'\"\n\nWolfrum said she's doubtful that the app will be useful, both because of people's wariness and its poor performance. She gave it a bad review on Google's app store after it failed to notice lengthy shopping trips she made one weekend to Walmart and Target stores.\n\nNorth Dakota is now looking at starting a second app based on the Apple-Google technology. \"It was rushed to market,\" because of the urgent need, Vern Dosch, the state's contact tracing facilitator, told KFYR-TV in Bismarck. \"We knew that it wouldn't be perfect.\"\n\nThe ACLU is taking a more measured approach to the Apple and Google method, which will use Bluetooth wireless technology to automatically notify people about potential COVID-19 exposure without revealing anyone's identity to the government.\n\nBut even if the app is described as voluntary and personal health information never leaves the phone, the ACLU says it's important for governments to set additional safeguards to ensure that businesses and public agencies don't make showing the app a condition of access to jobs, public transit, grocery stores and other services.\n\nAmong the governments experimenting with the Apple-Google approach are the state of Washington and several European countries.\n\nSwiss epidemiologist Marcel Salath\u00e9 said all COVID-19 apps so far are \"fundamentally broken\" because they collect too much irrelevant information and don't work well with Android and iPhone operating software. Salath\u00e9 authored a paper favoring the privacy-protecting approach that the tech giants have since adopted, and he considers it the best hope for a tool that could actually help isolate infected people before they show symptoms and spread the disease.\n\n\"You will remember your work colleagues but you will not remember the random person next to you on a train or really close to you at the bar,\" he said.\n\nOther U.S. governors are looking at technology designed to supplement manual contact-tracing efforts. As early as this week, Rhode Island has said it is set to launch a contact-tracing database system mostly built by software giant Salesforce, which has said it is also working with Massachusetts, California, Louisiana and New York City on a similar approach.\n\nSalesforce says it can use data-management software to help trained crews trace \"relationships across people, places and events\" and identify virus clusters down to the level of a neighborhood hardware store. It will rely on manual input of information gathered through conversations by phone, text or email.\n\n\"It's only as good as a lot of us using it,\" Democratic Gov. Gina Raimondo said at a news conference last week. \"If 10% of Rhode Island's population opts in, this won't be effective.\" The state hasn't yet outlined what people are expected to opt into.\n\nThe ACLU hasn't yet weighed in on the Salesforce model, but has urged contact-tracing public health departments to protect people from unnecessary disclosure of personal information and to not criminalize the requirement for self-isolation.",

The Emmy-winning actress along with other A-list celebrities from Barbara Streisand, Jennifer Lopez and Michael Strahan asked for donations to help relief and recovery efforts.\n\n\"Our city is under attack, but we've been here before,\" Robert De Niro said. \"In the last 20 years, both 9/11 and Hurricane Sandy.

Streisand and Audra McDonald showed the same optimism about New York City's Theater District coming back \"stronger than ever\" after being closed due to the pandemic lockdown.\n\nNew York Giants greats including Strahan, Eli Manning, Phil Simms and Justin Tuck announced an opportunity through a sweepstakes for one fan to play a game of touch football with the players in their own backyard and get a Super Bowl ring. The winner of the sweepstakes and three friends will have a chance to play against the players.\n\nOther musical performances included Sting's \"Message in a Bottle\" and Bon Jovi's \"It's My Life.\"\n\nFor most people, the coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks.

        "authors": [],
        "body": "FREMONT, Calif. -- Tesla CEO Elon Musk confirmed on Twitter Monday that the company has restarted its California factory in violation of local government orders.\n\nIn the afternoon tweet, Musk wrote that he would be on the assembly line and asked that he be arrested if authorities take anyone into custody.\n\nState law allows a fine of up to $1,000 a day or up to 90 days in jail for operating in violation of health orders.\n\nThe plant in Fremont, which is south of San Francisco, had been closed since March 23 under orders to prevent the spread of coronavirus.\n\nEarly Monday, the parking lot was nearly full at the massive plant, which employs 10,000 workers, and semis were driving off loaded with vehicles that may have been produced before the shutdown.\n\nThe restart violates orders from the Alameda County Health Department, which has deemed the factory a nonessential business that can't open under restrictions intended to help stop the spread of the coronavirus.\n\nAlameda County Sheriff Sgt. Ray Kelly said Monday that any enforcement of the order would come from Fremont police. Geneva Bosques, Fremont police spokeswoman, said officers would take action at the direction of the county Health Officer. She referred further comment to the Health Department, where the AP left messages seeking comment.\n\nThe Health Department said Saturday it was in talks with Tesla to reopen the plant safely.\n\nThe restart came two days after Tesla sued the county health department seeking to overturn its order, and Musk threatened to move Tesla's manufacturing operations and headquarters from the state.\n\nTesla contends in the lawsuit that Alameda County can't be more restrictive than orders from California Gov. Gavin Newsom. The lawsuit says the governor's coronavirus restrictions refer to federal guidelines classifying vehicle manufacturing as essential businesses that are allowed to continue operating.\n\n\"Frankly, this is the final straw,\" Musk wrote in a now-deleted tweet. \"Tesla will now move its HQ and future programs to Texas/Nevada immediately.\"\n\nHe wrote that whether the company keeps any manufacturing in Fremont depends on how Tesla is treated in the future.\n\nOn Monday, Newsom professed not to know if Tesla had reopened. \"Not aware (of) the details of that,\" he said.\n\n\"I have great expectations that we can work through at the county levels,\" the governor said about conflicts involving the Fremont plant. He said county health directors are in charge of restrictions and the timing of any resumption of manufacturing.\n\nThe Bay Area order currently calls for limited return of business and manufacturing, with health restrictions, starting May 18, the same day as Detroit automakers plan to restart assembly plants.\n\n\"We look forward to many, many decades of that relationship\" with Tesla, Newsom said.\n\nThe governor has repeatedly said that counties can impose restrictions that are more stringent than state orders. Alameda County was among six San Francisco Bay Area counties that were the first in the nation to impose stay-at-home orders in mid-March.\n\nEarly in the coronavirus crisis, Newsom praised Musk as the \"perfect example\" of the private sector assisting the state in the pandemic. His comments came after Musk pledged to provide more than 1,000 ventilators to California hospitals, a fact Newsom repeated often and called a \"heroic effort.\"\n\nBut whether Musk made good on the promise remains in dispute. Several weeks after Newsom was touting the ventilators, the state said it hadn't heard of any being delivered. Musk responded, demanding on Twitter that Newsom correct the record and sharing tweets and screenshots from hospitals and Los Angeles County thanking him for sending supplies.\n\nMusk has been ranting about the stay-home order since the company's April 29 first-quarter earnings were released. He called the restrictions fascist and urged governments to stop taking people's freedom.\n\nPublic health experts say stay-home orders have reduced the number of new coronavirus cases nationwide.\n\nThe coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms for most people. But it has killed nearly 80,000 people in the U.S., with the death toll rising.\n\nThe Health Department said Saturday it looks forward to reaching agreement on a plan to reopen \"very soon,\" but noted that given the sacrifices made to protect public health, \"it is our collective responsibility to move through the phases of reopening and loosening the restrictions\" in the safest way possible.\n\nTesla says it has safety procedures to protect workers including increased cleaning, enforcement of social distancing, providing face coverings and gloves where needed, installing barriers between workers when necessary and worker temperature checks at \"some locations.\"\n\nDespite Musk's threat, it would be costly and difficult to quickly shift production from Fremont to Texas or Nevada. The Fremont facility is Tesla's only U.S. vehicle assembly plant, and the company would lose critical production if it shut down the plant to move equipment.\n\nMusk plans another U.S. factory to increase output, possibly in Texas, and could move production once that plant is up and running.\n\nThe lack of production in Fremont is a big financial strain on the company. On a conference call last month, Musk called the closure of Fremont a \"serious risk.\"\n\nKrisher reported from Detroit. AP Reporters Janie Har and Juliet Williams in San Francisco and Kathleen Ronayne in Sacramento, California, contributed to this report.",

His comments came after Musk pledged to provide more than 1,000 ventilators to California hospitals, a fact Newsom repeated often and called a \"heroic effort.\"\n\nBut whether Musk made good on the promise remains in dispute. Several weeks after Newsom was touting the ventilators, the state said it hadn't heard of any being delivered. Musk responded, demanding on Twitter that Newsom correct the record and sharing tweets and screenshots from hospitals and Los Angeles County thanking him for sending supplies.\n\nMusk has been ranting about the stay-home order since the company's April 29 first-quarter earnings were released. He called the restrictions fascist and urged governments to stop taking people's freedom.\n\nThe Bay Area order forced Tesla to close the plant starting March 23 to help prevent the virus' spread, and it was extended until the end of May. Public health experts say the orders have reduced the number of new coronavirus cases nationwide.\n\nThe coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms for most people. But it has killed nearly 80,000 people in the U.S., with the death toll rising.\n\nAlameda County Sheriff Sgt. Ray Kelly said Monday he didn't know if Tesla has reopened and that this is in the \"attorney phase.\" Any enforcement would come from Fremont police, he said. Fremont police did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Mayor Lily Mei, who has expressed support for Tesla, also did not immediately return messages seeking comment.\n\nState law allows a fine of up to $1,000 per day or up to 90 days in jail for operating in violation of health orders.\n\nOn Monday, the county Health Department referred to a statement it made Saturday saying it was working with Tesla to develop a safety plan allowing the Fremont plant to reopen.\n\nThe department said it looks forward to reaching agreement on a plan to reopen \"very soon,\" but noted that given the sacrifices made to protect public health, \"it is our collective responsibility to move through the phases of reopening and loosening the restrictions\" in the safest way possible.\n\nTesla says it has safety procedures to protect workers including increased cleaning, enforcement of social distancing, providing face coverings and gloves where needed, installing barriers between workers when necessary and worker temperature checks at \"some locations.\"\n\nDespite Musk's threat, it would be costly and difficult to quickly shift production from Fremont to Texas or Nevada. The Fremont facility, formerly run jointly by General Motors and Toyota, is Tesla's only U.S. vehicle assembly plant, and the company would lose critical production if it shut down the plant to move equipment.\n\nBut Musk plans another U.S. factory to increase output, possibly in Texas, and could move production once that plant is up and running.\n\nThe lack of production in Fremont has cut off Tesla's revenue and is a big financial strain. On a conference call last month, Musk said the Fremont facility produces the majority of its vehicles. He called the closure of Fremont a \"serious risk.\"\n\nTesla's moves come as competing automakers are starting to reopen factories in the U.S. Toyota also planned to restart production Monday, while General Motors, Ford and Fiat Chrysler all plan to restart their plants gradually on May 18. Tesla is the only major automaker with a factory in California.\n\nAssociated Press reporters Janie Har and Juliet Williams in San Francisco and Kathleen Ronayne in Sacramento, California, contributed to this report.",

It's among dozens of protective measures under discussion.\n\nFighters would have to wear a face mask until inside the ring, while trainers and the referee would wear masks throughout bouts. No fans would be allowed. Testing protocols would be in place.\n\nThe five-page plan distributed to British promoters drew immediate attention for one line in particular: \"No spitting from Boxers when in corners.\" However, BBBofC general secretary Robert W. Smith told The Associated Press that it's more nuanced.\n\n\"We're working on apparatus in the corner where a boxer can refresh themselves in a safe and clean-as-possible way,\" Smith said. \"They'll be able to refresh themselves with water and obviously gargle ... and dispense with that water in as clean-as-possible way. An apparatus to do that will hopefully be in place. We'll have to have something that's closed.\"\n\nThe apparatus could include a version of the traditional spit bucket, he said, but one that is fully enclosed.\n\nThe coronavirus pandemic stopped sports around the world in March and has been responsible for more than 29,000 deaths in Britain. Restarting won't be easy, as soccer's Premier League is learning. Government restrictions will also dictate how and when sporting events can resume.\n\nSmith referred to the plan as a \"consultation document\" and said it is flexible. Initially, there would be no championship bouts, Smith said, because they require more personnel.\n\n\"If procedures are working well, we bring in the championships,\" he said. \"The whole thing is up for discussion.\"\n\nSmith said he had conversations Wednesday with prominent promoters Eddie Hearn and Frank Warren.\n\n\"We're all positive that we can get it done. Couple of things were discussed. We seem to be singing from the same song sheet,\" Smith said.\n\nHearn and Warren did not return messages seeking comment.\n\nAnthony Joshua's fight against Kubrat Pulev scheduled for June 20 at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium was postponed and is awaiting a new date. WBC interim heavyweight champion Dillian Whyte is scheduled to fight Alexander Povetkin on July 4 at Manchester Arena.\n\nThe BBBofC plan would also prohibit from events anyone with a fever or flu-like symptoms, those with serious medical conditions, pregnant women, anyone who is \"seriously overweight,\" as well as anyone over 70, regardless of health.\n\nEveryone entering events will have been tested, and will be required to bring their test result to the venue.\n\nSteve Wraith, a promoter in northeastern England, said he supports the plan in general but thinks they can reduce a few measures.\n\n\"I don't see the reason for wearing the mask coming into the ring,\" Wraith said. \"Some of these measures will be more visual for the watching (television) crowds rather than being practical.\"\n\nThe July timetable is definitely flexible, Smith said.\n\n\"It depends what is said on Sunday from the government, if we're on lockdown a further period of time,\" Smith said. \"It may end up in August, it may end up in September. We're not over this crisis yet.\"\n\nSmith said he will \"fully respect\" if boxers choose not to participate, whether because of lower potential winnings or for health concerns.\n\nMore AP sports: https://apnews.com/apf-sports and https://twitter.com/AP -- Sports",

        "authors": [],
        "body": "The Latest on the coronavirus pandemic. The new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms for most people. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness or death.\n\nTOP OF THE HOUR:\n\n-- Japan plunges into recession as US states start opening up.\n\n-- Greece reopens Acropolis in Athens and other ancient sites.\n\n-- European leaders consult on possibility of summer vacations.\n\n-- India reports 5,242 new cases, largest single-day surge, and 157 deaths.\n\nAustralia's government welcomed international support for an independent investigation of the coronavirus pandemic, a proposed inquiry that has been condemned by China and blamed for a bilateral trade rift.\n\nThe European Union has drafted a resolution, cosponsored by dozens of countries including Australia, that has been gaining support and is expected to be approved in a vote at the World Health Assembly in Geneva this week. The resolution before the assembly, the decision-making body of the World Health Organization, calls for an evaluation of the origins of the pandemic and responses to it.\n\nAustralian Foreign Minister Marise Payne said Monday her government had been keen to ensure that the resolution stipulates the inquiry be \"impartial, independent and comprehensive.\"\n\n\"We're very encouraged by the growing levels of support for this comprehensive World Health Assembly motion,\" Payne told reporters. \"We look forward to seeing hopefully a positive outcome later this week.\"\n\nAustralia has been seen as a leader in rallying global support for such an inquiry, attracting Chinese criticism that it is parroting the United States and inviting a Chinese boycott of exports and services.\n\nThe motion comes as Australia struggles to resolve a dispute with China over beef imports. Trade Minister Simon Birmingham said he's been unable to speak with his Chinese counterpart about China's ban on meat from Australia's four largest abattoirs over labeling issues.\n\nATHENS, Greece -- Greece reopened the Acropolis in Athens and other ancient sites Monday, along with high schools, shopping malls and mainland travel in the latest round of easing pandemic restrictions imposed in late March.\n\nPaving stickers were used as markers to keep visitors apart outside the Acropolis, while students were placed on rotation with online teaching to keep classes below 50% capacity.\n\nPublic compliance with strict lockdown measures helped keep the COVID-19 death toll to 166 while the total number of confirmed cases stood at 2,834 on Sunday. But authorities are keen to reopen the vital tourism sector, following a warning by the EU Commission that Greece is likely to suffer the worst recession in the bloc this year.\n\nPublic beaches reopened over the weekend amid heatwave temperatures, with strict distancing rules imposed by the government, but crowding did occur on buses from Athens to the nearby coast.\n\nTravel to the Greek islands remains broadly restricted.\n\nBERLIN -- Germany's foreign minister is consulting with 10 European colleagues on how to go about making summer vacations elsewhere on the continent possible.\n\nGermany's two-month-old warning against tourist travel to any country is due to expire on June 14. It and other countries aim to restore free travel across their borders next month.\n\nForeign Minister Heiko Maas planned a video conference Monday with counterparts from 10 countries that are popular destinations for Germans. He told ZDF television that \"we want to discuss under what criteria a summer vacation could be possible\" - including issues such as entry rules and quarantine requirements that some nations have imposed.\n\nMaas said countries also will have to agree on a mechanism \"to react very quickly\" if coronavirus infections surge again. He added that \"even if a summer vacation will be possible elsewhere in Europe, which I hope, one has to say that this vacation this year won't be like the ones we know from the past, because the pandemic is still there and we must at least have safety precautions for the worst case that the figures get worse again.\"\n\nBRUSSELS -- Belgium took the next step in its relaxation of the country's coronavirus lockdown on Monday, with more students going to school, and markets and museums reopening.\n\nSchools were permitted to go through a dry run on Friday, but primary and secondary classes resumed for real Monday with a limited amount of pupils to make sure social distancing was fully respected. In many cases, though, distance learning on laptops remained the order of the day.\n\nBarbers can also resume work, even though Monday used to be their traditional day off. Both barber and client will have to wear protective masks.\n\nHoping to make the most of the sunny weather, open-air markets can start selling the plentiful spring fruits and vegetables.\n\nAnd zoo animals, bereft of visitors since March, will have eyes on them again as parks can reopen. Museums will reopen as well and, like zoos, will have a strict reservation system to avoid overcrowding.\n\nKEY WEST, Fla. -- The Florida Keys will reopen to tourists on June 1, more than two months after the island chain closed to visitors to minimize the spread of the coronavirus.\n\nCheckpoints that barred visitors from coming into the Florida Keys will be removed next month, Monroe County Emergency Management said in a statement Sunday. Hotels and other lodging establishments will also be allowed to reopen at 50% occupancy, the statement said.\n\nThose businesses must implement sanitation stations and follow the American Hotel and Lodging Association's cleaning guidelines for COVID-19.\n\nThe Florida Keys have been closed to visitors since March 22.\n\nNEW DELHI, India -- India has recorded its biggest single-day surge with 5,242 new cases of coronavirus and 157 deaths due to COVID-19 in the last 24 hours, taking the country's infection tally to more than 96,000, the most in Asia.\n\nThe country now has 3,029 reported fatalities due to COVID-19.\n\nThe surge in infections comes a day after the federal government extended a nationwide lockdown to May 31 but eased some restrictions to restore economic activity and gave states more control in deciding the nature of the lockdown.\n\nAuthorities are largely attributing the recent surge in infections to the return of hundreds of thousands of migrant workers to India's villages, which have weaker health infrastructure.\n\nIndia had eased its lockdown rules on May 4 and even allowed migrant workers to travel back to their homes, a decision that has resulted in millions of people being on the move for the last two weeks.\n\nAll domestic and international passenger flights remain prohibited in the country. Metro services, schools, colleges, hotels and restaurants also remain shuttered nationwide.\n\nMost of the infections reported in India are from its major cities. Mumbai, the financial capital and home to Bollywood, alone has registered almost 20% of the total cases.\n\nMUZAFFARABAD, Pakistan -- The government in the Pakistani-administered sector of Kashmir announced it is reimposing full lockdown measures beginning Monday night after several people tested positive for the new coronavirus.\n\nThe move came days after about two dozen more people tested positive in Pakistan-held Kashmir, where so far 112 confirmed cases have been reported. The region has reported only one coronavirus-related death.\n\nThe lockdown was imposed in Pakistan-held Kashmir in March to contain the spread of the virus. But it was eased in April. Kashmir is a split between Pakistan and neighboring India but claimed by both in its entirety.\n\nThe announcement came as Pakistan reported 30 more deaths from the new coronavirus in the previous 24 hours, raising overall fatalities in the country to 903. So far, 42,125 confirmed cases have been reported in Pakistan, a total that includes the 112 infections in Pakistan-held Kashmir.\n\nFollow AP news coverage of the coronavirus pandemic at https://apnews.com/VirusOutbreak and https://apnews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak",

The capital territory has a population of only 420,000, the second-smallest of the states and territories, and its infection rate per head of population ranks in the middle of the field.\n\nEveryone with cold or flu symptoms have been offered free COVID-19 testing in Canberra for the past week and the government said that offer will be extended for another week. One in 49 of the territory's population had been tested by Thursday.\n\nHealth Minister Rachel Stephen-Smith said a government announcement will be made on Friday on the future of lockdown measures that will take into account the risk of a second wave of infections.\n\nLawmakers and their staff from across Australia will converge on Canberra on May 12 for the first regular sitting of Parliament since early March.\n\nAustralia has recorded 6,746 virus infections, 90 of whom have died. Eight new cases were reported since Wednesday.\n\nNEW DELHI -- India says it has achieved tremendous gains and improvement in curbing the coronavirus infections through a stringent lockdown imposed across the country five weeks ago.\n\nA Home Ministry statement late Wednesday said the government would give considerable relaxations in many districts as the lockdown comes for a review on Sunday.\n\nIndia has so far reported more than 33,050 positive coronavirus cases with 1,074 deaths.\n\nThe government on Wednesday allowed migrant workers, pilgrims, tourists, students and other persons stranded at different places in the country to resume their journeys by road. The decision will provide relief to hundreds of thousands of workers who want to return to their villages from Indian cities and towns after they lost jobs following the imposition of a country-wide lockdown on March 25.\n\nThe government recently allowed reopening of neighborhood shops in cities and towns and resumption of manufacturing and farming activity in rural India to help millions of poor people who lost work.\n\nSEOUL, South Korea -- -- South Korea has reported four more cases of the coronavirus over the past 24 hours, the first time that its daily jump has marked below five in about two months.\n\nThe Koreas Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in a statement Thursday that the additional figures took the country's total to 10,765 with 247 deaths. It says 9,059 of them have recovered and been released from quarantine.\n\nIt says the four new cases are all imported ones and that there were no newly reported cases of local infections.\n\nLocal media said it's the first time for South Korea to have no daily increase of local infections since Feb. 15.\n\nSouth Korea's caseload has been slowing in recent weeks after it recorded hundreds of new cases every day between late February and early March.\n\nSouth Korea has subsequently relaxed some of its social distancing guidelines. It expected to ease up on more restrictions in coming days if its caseload maintains a downward trend.\n\nMALE, Maldives -- Maldives has reported its first death to the new coronavirus with the total number of positive cases standing at 280.\n\nHealth Minister Abdulla Ameen said Thursday that the victim was an 83-year-old woman from the capital Male'.\n\nFirst cases of COVID-19 were reported at tourist resorts in this Indian Ocean archipelago state and authorities for sometime kept it from spilling over into the community. However, there is now a sudden spike in the number of patients in the capital island as well as far off islands with no traceable source of infection.\n\nNEW YORK -- Police were called to a Brooklyn neighborhood Wednesday after a funeral home overwhelmed by the coronavirus resorted to storing dozens of bodies on ice in rented trucks, and a passerby complained about the smell, officials said.\n\nInvestigators who responded to a 911 call found that the home had rented four trucks to hold about 50 corpses, according to a law enforcement official. No criminal charges were brought and the official, who was not authorized to speak publicly about the investigation, spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity.\n\nThe Andrew T. Cleckley Funeral Home was cited for failing to control the odors. The home was able to obtain a larger, refrigerated truck later in the day, the official said.\n\nNew York City funeral homes have struggled as at least 18,000 people have died in the city since late March.\n\nThe NYPD notified the state Department of Health, which oversees funeral homes, about the situation at the Andrew T. Cleckley Funeral Home. It did not respond to an email seeking comment.\n\nLAS VEGAS -- Nevada Gov. Steve Sisolak is extending his directive asking people to stay at home to limit the spread of coronavirus until May 15. But he will ease restrictions on other outdoor activities and some businesses starting Friday.\n\nSisolak's office said Wednesday night that he would allow starting May 1 retail businesses and marijuana dispensaries to offer curbside pickup, as restaurants have been doing. He will also allow drive-in church and other religious services, as long participants stay in their cars and maintain at least 6 feet of distance from those outside their household.\n\nThe governor said he was also once again allowing golf courses, pickleball and tennis courts to open Friday, as long as they can do so safely.\n\nThe updates Wednesday night came hours after the governor teased the announcements in an interview with ABC News.\n\nSisolak said in the interview that Nevada's cases and deaths from COVID-19 have reached a plateau, but he wants to see declines before lifting his directive that people stay home outside of essential trips. He said the opening of Las Vegas casinos likely won't happen until the third or fourth phase of his gradual reopening plan, but he has has not released any more details or timeline.\n\nThe governor's office said Wednesday night that if the numbers \"continues in a positive direction\" then he may ease more restrictions after May 15.\n\nLOS ANGELES -- The city of Los Angeles will offer free coronavirus testing to all residents, whether or not they have symptoms.\n\nUntil now tests were reserved for those with symptoms and frontline employees like healthcare and grocery store workers. Mayor Eric Garcetti says LA will be the first major U.S. city to offer widescale testing to all its residents.\n\nPeople can sign up online for appointments starting immediately. Priority will still be given to people with symptoms, such as a fever, cough and shortness of breath.\n\nPeople will be able to go back for tests several times: there is no limit.\n\nBEIJING -- China on Thursday reported no new deaths from coronavirus and four new cases, all brought from outside the country.\n\nThe National Health Commission said 619 people were hospitalized with COVID-19 and just over 1,000 were being monitored for possibly having the illness or for testing positive for the virus but showing no symptoms. China has reported a total of 4,633 deaths from the virus among 82,862 cases.\n\nOLYMPIA, Wash. -- Washington Gov. Jay Inslee says the state has to see more progress in several areas, including the daily number of new coronavirus cases and deaths, before social distancing restrictions can safely be lifted.\n\nHe says the state's stay-at-home order that was enacted March 23 would remain in place beyond May 4 and said he would have more details Friday on a phased-in approach to open the state's economy.\n\nWashington state in January had the country's first confirmed coronavirus case, the first deadly cluster in a Seattle-area nursing home and was among the first places to institute sweeping directives designed to slow the spread of COVID-19.\n\nLOS ANGELES -- A coalition of marijuana companies, churches and advocacy groups is asking California Gov. Gavin Newsom for a temporary cut in the state's hefty pot taxes.\n\nThe group that includes the California State Conference of the NAACP, Los Angeles Metropolitan Churches and the industry group Southern California Coalition warned in a letter to the governor that the coronavirus crisis and a crashing economy will take an especially heavy toll on businesses run by minorities who were disproportionately targeted during the decades-long drug war.\n\n\"If action is not taken now many of our business colleagues and friends may be pushed into the gray, or worse, back into the illicit market,\" said the letter, dated April 23.\n\n\"At a time where unemployment is at a record high, the legal industry is seeing its customers flock to lower priced cannabis products in the illegal market regardless of quality or safety,\" the group said.\n\n\"As COVID-19 continues to disproportionately impact communities of color, our social equity businesses and our customers will be impacted even more,\" the group warned.\n\nCalifornia kicked off broad legal sales in 2018. But the state's legal marijuana industry has long blamed tax rates that can approach 50% in some areas for driving business into the illicit market. According to some estimates, consumers are spending roughly $3 in the state's underground pot economy for every $1 in the legal one.\n\nCHEYENNE, Wyo. -- Gov. Mark Gordon says Wyoming will ease some of its coronavirus restrictions on Friday, with barbershops, gyms, nail salons and child care centers among the businesses that will be allowed limited re-openings.\n\nThe changes replace health orders that are set to expire Thursday. They are the first steps in the Republican governor's plan to restart the state economy.\n\nGordon also says Wyoming residents would be allowed to camp at state parks starting May 15.\n\nWINDOW ROCK, Ariz. -- Residents on the Navajo Nation will be under another lockdown this weekend as the tribe seeks to keep the coronavirus from spreading even further into communities.\n\nThe lockdown is the fourth the tribe has implemented. It comes around the first of the month when tribal members often travel to towns bordering the reservation to shop for food and other supplies.\n\nTribal officials say they are working with businesses on the reservation to create safeguards for Navajo elders, such as extending shopping hours exclusively for them and others who are at high risk for contracting the coronavirus.\n\nAnyone who doesn't need to leave their homes for food, medicine or in the case of an emergency is being told to stay home.\n\nAs of Tuesday, the tribe's health officials reported 1,873 positive cases of COVID-19 and 60 deaths. The 27,000 square-mile (70,000 square-kilometer) reservation stretches into Arizona, New Mexico and Utah.\n\nUNITED NATIONS -- The United Nations humanitarian chief says 44 cases of COVID-19 and four deaths have been announced in Syria.\n\nMark Lowcock tells the U.N. Security Council that a health care system decimated by nine years of war can't be expected \"to cope with a crisis that is challenging even the wealthiest nations.\"\n\nLowcock says 43 confirmed cases and three deaths have been announced by Syrian authorities in Damascus and its surroundings, and a first case and death has been confirmed in Syria's northeast.\n\nHe says \"testing capacity remains very limited,\" efforts are being made to set up isolation areas in camps, and measures aimed at containing the spread of COVID-19 are already hurting the most vulnerable.\n\nWASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump says the federal government will not be extending its social distancing guidelines when they expire Thursday at the end of the month.\n\nTrump told reporters in the Oval Office that the coronavirus guidelines will be \"fading out\" because of work that governors are doing in their states.\n\nVice President Mike Pence said the guidelines issued 45 days ago have been incorporated into guidance provided to the states on how they can begin the process of gradually reopening their economies.\n\nThe guidelines - which were originally supposed to last 15 days and were then extended another 30 - included encouraging Americans to work from home and avoid restaurants and discretionary travel as well as telling older Americans and those with serious underlying health conditions to isolate themselves.\n\nFollow AP news coverage of the coronavirus pandemic at https://apnews.com/VirusOutbreak and https://apnews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak",

        "body": "Austria is preparing for the summer tourist season while taking extra precautions to ensure the new coronavirus does not pick up again\n\nThe Latest on the coronavirus pandemic. The new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms for most people. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness or death.\n\nTOP OF THE HOUR:\n\n-- China lawmakers gather as doubts swirl over pandemic safety.\n\n-- Austria takes precautions as it awaits summer tourist season.\n\n-- Indonesia works to contain virus ahead of Islamic holiday.\n\n-- Japan urging international cooperation in combating virus.\n\nVIENNA -- Austria is preparing for the summer tourist season while taking extra precautions to ensure the new coronavirus does not pick up again.\n\nChancellor Sebastian Kurz said Thursday that people from countries where COVID-19 has stabilized could count on summer holidays with \"maximum safety and maximum enjoyment.\"\n\nThere is an agreement with Germany, Liechtenstein and Switzerland to fully open borders next month. Kurz was optimistic similar arrangements could be reached with Austria's eastern neighbors in the coming week. He says negotiations have begun with Austrian Airline's parent company Lufthansa for holiday flights.\n\nDistancing measures in Austria will remain in place and hotel staffers will be tested regularly for COVID-19.\n\n\"We need to ensure that the infection rate remains low,\" Kurz said. \"The lower the infection numbers the more people will go out.\"\n\nNICOSIA, Cyprus -- Cyprus is lifting most restrictions of a two-month stay-at-home order.\n\nThe decision allows for the reopening of primary schools, hair salons and outdoor cafes.\n\nPeople will no longer need permission forms or electronic approval to move outside their home or heed a night curfew. Public parks and squares are now open, but groups of more than 10 are prohibited.\n\nBeginning Saturday, sunbathers may go to the beaches on this east Mediterranean island, and the faithful can attend services at churches, mosques and other places of worship.\n\nLibraries, museums and archaeological sites reopen June 1 when ports will also resume operations, although cruise ship passengers won't be permitted to disembark.\n\nISTANBUL -- Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is urging international cooperation in combating the new coronavirus, saying any drug or vaccine must be \"fairly\" accessible and nations must assist less developed countries.\n\nThe prime minister spoke by videoconference Thursday during a ceremony led by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan to mark a hospital opening.\n\nThe 2,600-bed Basaksehir Pine and Sakura City Hospital in Istanbul was built by Turkey's Ronesans Holding in partnership with Japan's Sojitz Corporation.\n\nTurkey is separately constructing two other hospitals in Istanbul, including one on the site of the now-closed Ataturk Airport, as part of plans to turn the nation into a major destination for medical tourism.\n\nJAKARTA, Indonesia -- Indonesia's number of confirmed coronavirus cases surpassed 20,000 as the world's most populous Muslim nation is entering a critical period in its fight against the COVID-19 outbreak during its most important Islamic holiday.\n\nHealth ministry official Achmad Yurianto announced 973 new infections, the biggest daily increase since the start of the pandemic, bringing the total number of confirmed cases to 20,162.\n\nYurianto said the outbreak has been growing significantly in the East Java province in the past 24 hours with 502 confirmed cases, which has contributed the most to the country's biggest single-day spike on Thursday.\n\nIndonesia's COVID-19 Task Force chief Doni Monardo told a news conference the virus spread has been growing at its fastest speed during the last nine days as the country is entering a critical moment before and after its Eid al-Fitr celebration to mark the end of the fasting month of Ramadan.\n\nRamadan exodus was banned this year to contain the spread of the disease, but Monardo said some people had managed to leave big cities.\n\nMonardo said his team is asking help from the military and the police to prevent arrivals in the capital, Jakarta until a full reopening of the capital.\n\nTOKYO -- Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe announced Thursday he is removing a coronavirus state of emergency in Osaka and two neighboring prefectures in the west where the infection is deemed slowing, while keeping the measure in place in the Tokyo region and Hokkaido.\n\nAbe told reporters that experts at the meeting earlier Thursday approved the plan to lift the measures in Osaka, Kyoto and Hyogo, effective immediately.\n\nThe measure stays in place in Tokyo and three neighboring prefectures, as well as Hokkaido, where the infections have slowed but need further improvement.\n\nAbe said he plans to summon experts again on Monday to consider possible removal of the measure in the capital region and Hokkaido.\n\nJapan has taken a soft approach to coronavirus social distancing as Abe's government tried to take disease prevention measures while minimizing damage to the economy.\n\nJapanese business and industry groups are setting up new guidelines to resume operations while observing physical distancing and other preventive measures recommended by experts.\n\nCOLOMBO, Sri Lanka -- Sri Lankan police say three women died in a stampede Thursday when residents of a Colombo neighborhood scrambled to receive aid being distributed for people who have lost their livelihood because of the new coronavirus restrictions.\n\nPolice spokesman Jaliya Senaratne said there were few more people injured and hospitalized. He said police arrested six private individuals who organized the aid distribution.\n\nThe Maligawatte area of capital Colombo is a crowded neighborhood where most people drove three-wheeler taxies, ran mobile kiosks or engaged in daily-wage labor for a living.\n\nSri Lanka has reported just more than 1,000 COVID-19 cases with nine deaths.\n\nROME -- Italy's government is seeking to turn the coronavirus emergency into an opportunity to pass \"the mother of all reforms\" to simplify the country's notoriously bulky bureaucracy, invest in education and research and make Italy more attractive to foreign investment.\n\nPremier Giuseppe Conte told parliament's lower chamber on Thursday that an upcoming \"simplification\" decree aims to provide a \"shock\" to the economy, which was heading toward recession even before the pandemic turned Italy into the onetime European epicenter. He said it aims to make Italy more competitive and transparent, while maintaining checks to prevent organized crime from infiltrating public and private contracts.\n\nHe said: \"If we don't succeed in simplifying now, in this state of absolute emergency, I frankly doubt we'll be able to do it in the future.\"\n\nConte also updated lawmakers on the status of Italy's reopening, which began May 4 and accelerated this week. He said Italy now leads the world in per capita virus testing, and that antibody tests would begin May 25 on a sample 150,000 people -- three weeks later than planned.\n\nHe said Italy's contact-tracing app would begin tests \"in the coming days\" but he made no mention of whether Italy had hired teams of contact-tracers to actually conduct interviews and get in touch with people who had been in contact with COVID-19 patients, as other European countries have done.\n\nJOHANNESBURG -- The African continent needs to test about 10 times the number of people it has already tested for the coronavirus. That's according to the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nDirector John Nkengasong says Africa should strive to test at least 1% of the population of 1.3 billion people, or 13 million people, but so far 1.3 million to 1.4 million tests have been conducted. Africa's number of virus cases is above 95,000 and could surpass 100,000 by the weekend. The continent has seen roughly the same number of new cases in the past week as the week before, and Nkengasong says that \"we hope that trend continues.\"\n\nWhile early lockdowns delayed the pandemic, he says \"that doesn't mean Africa has been spared.\" But he says health officials are not seeing a lot of community deaths or \"massive flooding of our hospitals\" because of COVID-19.\n\nCountries with fragile health systems and a recent history of conflict like Somalia and South Sudan, however, remain \"very concerning\" as cases rise quickly. Somalia has reported more than 1,500 cases but aid groups worry the real number is far higher. South Sudan has more than 280 cases.\n\nMILAN -- Italian authorities are warning that young people gathering without respecting physical distancing rules and not wearing masks are risking Italy's hard-won efforts to control the coronavirus outbreak.\n\nMilan Mayor Giuseppe Sala said Thursday that he is asking local police to increase patrols of night spots, be more severe in handing out fines and close any bars or restaurants in flagrant violation of the rules.\n\nHe said in a Facebook message that Milan has a problem now, like many Italian cities: \"I understand the young people -- and they are not only young people -- who need to socialize. But the risk is very high.''\n\nCases in Milan, the seat of hard-hit Lombardy, continue to rise as Italy continues to relax its long lockdown. Since Sunday, there have been 137 new cases in the city of 1.4 million residents.\n\nPremier Giuseppe Conte echoed the concern in a speech to parliament's lower chamber, saying that while it was \"entirely understandable\" that young people are excited about going out again, now more than ever it was important to wear masks outdoors and maintain social distancing.\n\nMADRID -- Spaniards are going about their restricted lives wearing masks in compliance with a government order that comes into force Thursday.\n\nMasks are now mandatory for people over 6 years old in all public spaces, including outdoors when they can't keep a distance of 2 meters (6.5 feet) between them.\n\nThe new ruling affects approximately 45 million people. It departs from earlier recommendations to make the masks compulsory only for health workers and those with COVID-19 compatible symptoms.\n\nLast month the government extended their obligatory use to public transport.\n\nBank employee Carlos Garc\u00eda in Madrid welcomed the new regulation but said it was coming too late.\n\n\"It has been very confusing: one day yes, one day no. I think we are going slowly with this, like with so many other things,\" the 23-year-old said.\n\nSpain has recorded more than 27,800 deaths for the new coronavirus and over 230,000 infections confirmed by laboratory tests.\n\nBEIRUT -- Lebanon's prime minister is warning of a major food crisis in the Mediterranean country which is facing an unprecedented economic and financial crisis made worse by the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nIn an opinion piece published in the Washington Post late Wednesday, Prime Minister Hassan Diab also warns of eventual \"starvation\" in the Middle East that he says may spark a new migration flow to Europe.\n\nHe urges the United States and the European Union to establish a dedicated emergency fund to help the conflict-prone region.\n\nLebanon, one of the most indebted nations in the world, defaulted for the first time in March on its sovereign debt. Anti-government protests that erupted in October over widespread corruption subsided during a nationwide lockdown since mid-March to blunt the spread of the coronavirus, but sporadic protests continue.\n\nDiab's government is seeking a rescue program from the International Monetary Fund while grappling to deal with the financial crisis that saw the local currency crash, people's savings devastated and prices and inflation soar in the past few weeks.\n\nIn a stark warning, Diab says many Lebanese may soon find it difficult to afford even bread.\n\nMADRID -- The top official in charge of easing Spain's lockdown says that the country will reopen to foreign tourists in July only when safety for both locals and visitors is guaranteed.\n\nWary of the competition from other Mediterranean countries already reopening borders, hoteliers and officials in tourist-magnet islands and coastal regions have been pressing Spanish central authorities to relax curbs in place to fight the coronavirus outbreak.\n\nBut Environment and Energy Minister Teresa Ribera has told EFE news agency that an early massive opening to visitors would be \"irresponsible.\"\n\n\"Our idea is to work on safe origins and destinations thinking on July rather on June,\" Ribera told the state news agency.\n\nShe added that rebounds of the outbreak in China, South Korea and Singapore have been associated to imported infections.\n\nTourism contributes 12% of Spain's gross domestic product. The country has recorded at least 27,800 deaths for the novel virus and more than 232,000 confirmed infections.\n\nFollow AP news coverage of the coronavirus pandemic at https://apnews.com/VirusOutbreak and https://apnews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak",

        "body": "The Latest on the coronavirus pandemic. The new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms for most people. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness or death.\n\nTOP OF THE HOUR:\n\n-- British prime minister to return to work two weeks after being discharged from hospital\n\n-- India's prime minister warns against complacency and asks people to change their habits\n\n-- South Korea reports 10 confirmed cases, continuing slowing country's caseload\n\n-- Hawaii's stay-at-home order extended to May 31\n\n-- Warm weather draws people outdoors in California, prompting warnings\n\nLONDON -- The British prime minister's office says Boris Johnson will return to work Monday, two weeks after he was discharged from a London hospital where he was treated for the new coronavirus.\n\nJohnson, 55, spent a week at St. Thomas' Hospital, including three nights in intensive care, where he was given oxygen and watched around the clock by medical staff.\n\nAfter he was released April 12, he recorded a video message thanking staff at the hospital for saving his life.\n\nJohnson has not been seen in public since then, as he recovered at the prime minister's country retreat outside London.\n\nJohnson's return comes amid growing criticism of the government's handling of the coronavirus outbreak. The number of people with COVID-19 who have died in British hospitals reached 20,000 on Saturday. Thousands more are thought to have died in nursing homes.\n\nOpposition politicians are calling for more clarity on when the government will ease a nationwide lockdown that was imposed March 23 and runs to at least May 7.\n\nNEW DELHI: India's prime minister has cautioned his people against complacency in the fight against the coronavirus, saying it can return again and people must change their habits.\n\nDuring a 30-minute radio program on Sunday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said that people need to stick to social distancing, wearing face masks and not spitting in public places.\n\nHe also said that a traditional system of Indian medicine, known as \"Ayurveda\" which includes yoga exercises and drinking hot water, can be extremely helpful in building immunity to diseases.\n\nModi put India's 1.3 billion people under a strict lockdown on March 25 until May 3 to fight the virus. The restrictions have been eased somewhat by allowing neighborhood shops to reopen, and manufacturing and farming activities to resume in rural areas to help millions of poor daily workers.\n\nIndia has so far recorded 25,671 positive cases of the virus with 824 deaths attributed to COVID-19.\n\nSEOUL, South Korea -- -- South Korea has confirmed 10 more cases of the coronavirus over the past 24 hours, a continuation of the country's slowing caseload.\n\nThe additional cases reported Sunday marks the ninth day in a row that South Korea's daily increase came below 20.\n\nThe state-run Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says that the country's total to 10,728 with 242 deaths. It says 8,717 patients have recovered.\n\nSouth Korea has recently relaxed some of its social distancing rules, but officials have still raised worries about possible transmissions by \"quiet spreaders.\"\n\nSouth Korea had recorded hundreds of new cases every day between late February and early March, mostly in the southeastern city of Daegue and nearby areas.\n\nHONOLULU -- Gov. David Ige on Saturday extended Hawaii's stay-at-home order and the mandatory quarantine for visitors through May 31.\n\n\"This was not an easy decision. I know this has been difficult for everyone. Businesses need to reopen. People want to end this self-isolation and we want to return to normal,\" Ige said. \"But this virus is potentially deadly, especially for the elderly and those with pre-existing conditions.\"\n\nAt a news conference, Ige pointed to alarming COVID-19 clusters on the Big Island and Maui, Hawaii News Now reported. \"We still need to remain vigilant.\"\n\nIn his statement, Ige warned of undoing Hawaii's progress in containing the virus if public places open up too early. Hawaii has 601 cases of coronavirus and 13 deaths.\n\n\"Thanks to our residents, we are flattening the curve, saving lives, and avoiding a resurgence of this virus by not reopening prematurely,\" Ige said.\n\nThe governor also extended the eviction moratorium, which prevents any eviction from a residential dwelling for failing to pay rent, through May 31.\n\nBEIJING -- China said Sunday it had confirmed 11 more cases of the new coronavirus the previous day, bringing its official count to 82,827. However, there were no reported deaths for the 11th day in a row.\n\nFive of the new cases were in Heilongjiang province, a northeastern border area with Russia that has seen a surge in infections. Another was in Guangdong province, a manufacturing and tech region bordering Hong Kong in the south.\n\nThe other five cases were imported from overseas. China has identified 1,634 imported cases in all.\n\nChina said it also has 1,000 people who have tested positive for the coronavirus but do not have any symptoms. They are under medical observation but not included in the confirmed case count. (edited)\n\nLOS ANGELES -- A spring heat wave drove people to California beaches, golf courses and trails, leading to the closure of one coastal park as authorities warned people not to swarm recreational areas for fear of igniting a deadly coronavirus surge.\n\nTemperatures soared into the 80s and 90s from Sacramento to San Diego on Saturday. While most recreation remains shuttered under various stay-at-home orders, officials are wary that those still open could draw crowds that will ignore social distancing rules and seek sun and air after being mainly confined indoors for more than a month.\n\n\"We're seeing a summer day crowd,\" said Brian O'Rourke, a lifeguard battalion chief in Newport Beach in Orange County, which saw an estimated 40,000 people on Friday. A similar crowd was expected Saturday as the fog burns off.\n\nPolice in Pacific Grove said they had to close the picturesque Lovers Point Park and Beach at the southern end of Monterey Bay because of a lack of social distancing.\n\nLos Angeles city and county beaches, trails and playgrounds were closed, and officers on horseback were patrolling those areas to enforce social distancing rules. The city also opened cooling centers for people \"who might not be able to survive the heat wave at home,\" Mayor Eric Garcetti said.\n\nWASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump says his press briefings are \"not worth the time & effort\" as his administration prepares to adjust his public presence amid the coronavirus pandemic toward addressing the nation's economic woes.\n\nTweeting on Saturday, one of the few days in which he has not held a daily briefing since the start of the outbreak, Trump says: \"What is the purpose of having White House News Conferences when the Lamestream Media asks nothing but hostile questions, & then refuses to report the truth or facts accurately.\"\n\nThe president's tweet comes two days after he used a briefing to muse about the injection of chemical disinfectants, drawing warnings from manufacturers and the nation's top medical professionals. The White House claimed Friday that Trump was misinterpreted, though the president later asserted he was speaking \"sarcastically.\"\n\nWhite House aides are developing plans to shift the president's public emphasis from the virus to addressing the economic crisis it has caused and the government's plans for reopening the economy.\n\nNEW YORK -- Potbelly Sandwich Shop is the latest large company to say it will return money it received as part of the Payroll Protection Program.\n\nThe company said Saturday that its sales dropped dramatically when COVID-19 hit, forcing it to furlough employees and close shops. Potbelly applied for and qualified for assistance under the program.\n\n\"We were surprised and disappointed when the fund was quickly exhausted, leaving many without help,\" the company said. \"We are returning the PPP loan after further clarification from the Treasury Department.\"\n\nThe Chicago-based sandwich shop has about 6,000 employees and annual revenues of more than $400 million, according to FactSet.\n\nThe PPP is intended to help small businesses with fewer than 500 employees. Its initial $349 billion in funds ran out last week and the House gave final approval to $310 billion in additional funds Thursday.\n\nPHOENIX -- The pace of additional deaths in Arizona's coronavirus outbreak has slowed following a recent surge.\n\nThe Department of Health Services' tally of deaths statewide rose by seven to 273 as of Saturday, following an increase of 17 deaths reported Friday and a total of 62 deaths reported over the previous three days\n\nThe department said there were 6,820 cases reported statewide as of Saturday, an increase of 235 from Friday.\n\nHealth officials say the recent surge in reported fatalities likely resulted from a boost in cases weeks ago. It was expected to slow because it often takes weeks for patients to die once hospitalized and because hospitalizations appear to have leveled off.\n\nDr. Anthony Fauci is urging careful science to prove whether any of the drugs being explored as COVID-19 treatments actually work.\n\nFauci, infectious diseases chief at the National Institutes of Health, said Saturday during an online meeting of the National Academy of Sciences that the only way to get an answer is by doing a randomized controlled trial.\n\n\"We need something out there, but safety and efficacy is something we owe to the global population,\" Fauci said.\n\nFauci also stressed that caution is needed as economies reopen, pointing to a step-wise approach with restrictions gradually lifted as areas reach certain milestones.\n\n\"Any attempt to leapfrog over these almost certainly will result in a rebound, and then we can set ourselves back,\" he said. \"If we don't get control of it we will never get back to normal. I know we will, but we've got to do it correctly.\"\n\nFauci also cautioned against looking for a magic number of available tests needed as the country reopens.\n\n\"We don't want to get fixated on how many tests you need,\" Fauci said. Instead, places must \"have enough tests to respond to the outbreaks that will inevitably occur.\"\n\nMIAMI -- The president of a Florida medical center said at a press conference Saturday that any changes made going forward will have to be evaluated daily.\n\nOrthopedic surgeon Wael Barsoum was referencing remarks by Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis about restarting activities, such as elective procedures and surgeries.\n\n\"I think that there is a lot of excitement about seeing what happens as we move forward, as we start slowly seeing changes with the requirements that we've had put in place,\" said Barsoum, president of Cleveland Clinic Florida. \"But please recognize that we will learn every day, and we may have to step back from some of those decisions as a society.\"\n\nBarsoum said he told his parents, who are 75 and 84 years old, that regardless of what happens in the coming weeks he expects they will remain indoors.\n\nROME -- Nearly 200,000 Italian companies have asked authorities for permission to be able to operate during Italy's lockdown, either because they help essential businesses or because they deem themselves strategic for the national economy during the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nThe interior ministry said Saturday that a streamlined procedure is being implemented that \"trusts the sense of responsibility of individual business persons\" in allowing companies to resume operations.\n\nThe ministry's local authorities can verify that a company respects COVID-19 safety rules, including social distancing. Most of the requests have come from three northern regions that are among Italy's most productive, but also among those most heavily hit by coronavirus cases.\n\nSo far, only a tiny percentage of the businesses have been found not following the rules, which are part of a government decree aimed at containing Italy's COVID-19 outbreak.\n\nFollow AP news coverage of the coronavirus pandemic at https://apnews.com/VirusOutbreak and https://apnews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak",

        "body": "Japan says a panel of experts supports the government's plan to extend the nationwide state of emergency through the end of May\n\nThe Latest on the coronavirus pandemic. The new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms for most people. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness or death.\n\nTOP OF THE HOUR:\n\n-- Japan says experts back plan to extend state of emergency through May.\n\n-- China reports 3 new coronavirus cases, no deaths.\n\n-- Small groups ignore closures and hit warm California beaches.\n\n-- New Zealand reports no new cases for first time since mid-March outbreak.\n\n-- Trump says he thinks COVID-19 vaccine will be available by end of year.\n\nTOKYO -- Japan says a panel of experts supports the government's plan to extend the nationwide state of emergency through the end of May.\n\nPrime Minister Shinzo Abe said Friday he planned to keep the current coronavirus measures in place for another month, in accordance with recommendations from health experts. They noted the rise in new cases has slowed but Japan's medical system is still overburdened.\n\nEconomy Minister Yasutoshi Nishimura told reporters Monday that experts backed the government's plan to extend social distancing measures until May 31 and called it \"appropriate.\"\n\nNishimura said Sunday the current measures in Tokyo and a dozen other prefectures designated as special warning zones are expected to stay in place, while 34 other prefectures would be allowed to somewhat ease restrictions on the condition they take ample preventive steps.\n\nLater on Monday, after approval by parliamentary committees, Abe is set to formally announce an extension and explain details.\n\nJapan has had more than 15,000 virus cases and 510 deaths as of Monday, according to the health ministry.\n\nBEIJING -- China reported three new coronavirus cases Monday, all brought from overseas, and no additional deaths.\n\nA total of 481 people remain in the hospital because of the virus, with about 1,000 under monitoring and isolation after showing symptoms or testing positive without symptoms.\n\nChina has reported 4,633 deaths from COVID-19 among 82,880 cases.\n\nSAN FRANCISCO -- Small groups of people ignored closures and set down their towels and umbrellas on Orange County's warm beaches Sunday, defying stay-at-home orders to slow the spread of the coronavirus as pressure to reopen parts of California continues to build.\n\nCameras from news helicopters captured dozens of people scattered across a stretch of sand known as The Wedge in Newport Beach. The crowds were sparse but offered proof that despite stepped-up patrols and warnings to stay away, some people were determined to get to the beach.\n\nCity spokesman John Pope said lifeguards and police officers asked more than 2,500 people to leave. The previous weekend, a heatwave drew tens of thousands of people to Newport Beach, prompting Gov. Gavin Newsom to shut beaches in Orange County.\n\nA Huntington Beach police spokeswoman said people were cooperating, and no citations had been issued as of Sunday afternoon.\n\nMeanwhile, two counties in Northern California were set to allow many businesses to reopen Monday as a direct challenge to Newsom's order.\n\nYuba and Sutter counties north of Sacramento would join Modoc County, which began allowing hair salons, churches, restaurants and the county's only movie theater to reopen Friday as long as people stay 6 feet (1.8 meters) apart.\n\nModoc County Sheriff Tex Dowdy said the zero confirmed cases of COVID-19 among Modoc's 9,000 residents was a deciding factor in permitting a \"staged, safe\" reopening. No problems were reported over the weekend, officials said.\n\nWELLINGTON, New Zealand -- New Zealand reported no new coronavirus cases Monday, marking a significant moment that indicated the country's bold strategy of trying to eliminate the virus was working.\n\nIt was the first time since the outbreak took hold in mid-March that the country reported zero new cases. Director-General of Health Ashley Bloomfield said the figures were clearly encouraging, but the result represented a moment in time and it won't be until later this week that officials will know if new cases are continuing to pop up in the community. He said the result was a cause for celebration and was symbolic of the efforts of the entire country.\n\nNew Zealand closed its borders and imposed a strict monthlong lockdown after the outbreak began. The lockdown rules were eased a little last week to help reopen the economy, but many restrictions remain in place.\n\nMany businesses -- including most retail stores and sit-down restaurants -- remain closed, most school children are learning from home, and people are required to maintain social distancing. New Zealand has reported nearly 1,500 cases of the virus and 20 deaths.\n\nKUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia -- Many business sectors reopened Monday in some parts of Malaysia for the first time since a partial coronavirus lockdown began March 18.\n\nThe easing of restrictions, days before the lockdown was due to end May 12, came as Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin's government sought to balance between curbing the virus and reviving the hard-hit economy. But the move has split public opinion amid fears that the sudden reopening of economic activities could spark a new wave of infection.\n\nNine of the country's 13 states have either refused to open up yet or restricted the list of businesses that can operate. More than half a million Malaysians have also protested by signing online petitions to call for a more gradual approach to rolling back the restrictions.\n\nMuhyiddin said Friday it was time to heal the economy, which has lost billions of dollars, but businesses must follow strict health measures and mass gatherings will still be banned. That means places such as schools, cinemas and worship houses will stay shut, group sports are prohibited, and interstate travel remains banned.\n\nVirus cases have dropped sharply in recent weeks but the number crept up with 227 infections reported over the weekend. Malaysia has confirmed 6,298 cases, with 105 deaths.\n\nWASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump says he believes a vaccine for COVID-19 will be available by the end of the year.\n\nTrump also says the U.S. government is putting its \"full power and might\" behind remdesivir, a drug that has shown early promise as a treatment for the disease caused by the new coronavirus.\n\nTrump commented Sunday night during a televised town hall sponsored by Fox News Channel.\n\nTrump sat inside the Lincoln Memorial and fielded questions from two Fox hosts, as well as from people who submitted questions over Fox's social media platforms.\n\nTrump responded to a Nebraska man who recovered from COVID-19 by saying: \"We think we are going to have a vaccine by the end of this year.\"\n\nHe also said his administration was pushing hard for remdesivir.\n\nU.S. public health officials have said a vaccine is probably a year to 18 months away. But Dr. Anthony Fauci said in late April that it's conceivable, if a vaccine is developed soon, it could be in wide distribution as soon as January.\n\nNEW YORK -- After working with neighboring states on coronavirus-related closing and reopening plans, Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Sunday that New York will join with states from Massachusetts to Delaware to create a regional supply chain for masks, gowns, ventilators, testing supplies and other equipment vital to fighting the disease.\n\nThe states are joining together after months of dealing separately with what Cuomo said was a \"totally inefficient and ineffective\" purchasing process that pitted all 50 states against each other, as well as the federal government and other entities, driving up prices as supplies dried up.\n\nNew York buys about $2 billion worth of medical equipment supplies per year, Cuomo said. The other states joining the consortium together spend about $5 billion per year. Working together, they'll have stronger purchasing power and improve their clout with global suppliers, Cuomo said.\n\n\"It will make us more competitive in the international marketplace and I believe it will save taxpayers money,\" Cuomo said. \"I also believe it will actually help us get the equipment, because we have trouble still getting the equipment.\"\n\nThe other states in the consortium are Connecticut, Rhode Island, New Jersey and Pennsylvania. One goal, the states' governors said, is to find suppliers within the region, instead of relying on swamped manufacturers in China and other faraway places.\n\nWASHINGTON -- Michigan's governor says gun-carrying protesters who demonstrated inside her state's Capitol \"depicted some of the worst racism\" and \"awful parts\" of U.S. history.\n\nDemocrat Gretchen Whitmer tells CNN that the protests featured \"Confederate Flags, and nooses,\" as well as swastikas.\n\nMembers of the Michigan Liberty Militia protested the state's stay-at-home orders this week, some with weapons and tactical gear and their faces partially covered. They went inside the Capitol, where being armed is allowed, then demanded access to the House floor, which is prohibited.\n\nSome went to the Senate gallery, where a senator said armed men shouted at her.\n\nMichigan's Republican-controlled Legislature has questioned Whitmer's authority to extend stay-at-home orders amid the coronavirus pandemic. But the governor used an executive order to extend a state of emergency declaration and has directed most businesses statewide to remain closed.\n\nMentioned as a possible running mate for presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden, Whitmer said Sunday, \"This isn't something we just negotiate ourselves out of and it's a political matter.\"\n\nWASHINGTON -- Secretary of State Mike Pompeo says China has been responsible for the spread of disease in the past and must be held accountable for the coronavirus pandemic that originated in the country.\n\nIn comments likely to spark protests from Beijing and elsewhere, Pompeo said \"China has a history of infecting the world.\" He cited poor safety and security at epidemiological laboratories, including in the city of Wuhan where the virus was first reported.\n\nHe stressed that he had no reason to believe the virus was deliberately spread but he ramped up already harsh U.S. criticism of the Chinese for their response to the outbreak.\n\n\"Remember, China has a history of infecting the world, and they have a history of running substandard laboratories,\" Pompeo said Sunday on ABC's \"This Week\" program.\n\n\"These are not the first times that we've had a world exposed to viruses as a result of failures in a Chinese lab. And so, while the intelligence community continues to do its work, they should continue to do that, and verify so that we are certain, I can tell you that there is a significant amount of evidence that this came from that laboratory in Wuhan.\"\n\nPompeo appeared to be referring to previous outbreaks of respiratory viruses, like SARS, which started in China. But his remark may be seen as offensive in China given the history of U.S. discrimination against the Chinese and people of Chinese origin dating to the 19th century.\n\nROME -- On the eve of the start in Italy of partially eased restriction on citizens' movements during COVID-19 lockdown, the nation received some encouraging news after weeks of grim daily tallies of caseload and deaths.\n\nHealth Ministry figures put the number of deaths in the 24-hour period ending Sunday evening at 174, the lowest day-to-day number since 168 on March 10, at the start of national lockdown.\n\nThe number of new cases, 1,389, was also the lowest the nation has seen in two months. Italy's number of known COVID-19 infections total is 210,717, although authorities say the number is likely higher as many infections in people with no or almost no symptoms are believed to have gone undetected.\n\nItaly's death toll stands at 28,884, but that number, too, could be much higher, since many elderly persons in recent weeks died in nursing homes but weren't tested to see if they had coronavirus infection.\n\nOLYMPIA, Wash. -- More than 100 state parks, trails and boating sites across Washington state will re-open Tuesday as some coronavirus restrictions are eased, but many popular sites remain closed indefinitely, according to officials.\n\nParks that open will be limited to daytime use only and the number of parking spaces will be reduced at some urban parks to discourage crowding. Public lands managed by the Department of Natural Resources and Department of Fish and Wildlife also will reopen Tuesday.\n\nAll ocean beach parks and parks along the Columbia River Gorge on the Washington-Oregon border will remain closed to reduce impacts on rural communities and prevent crowds, according to Washington State Parks.\n\nDiscussions on when those sites could open are ongoing and involve park administrators, local community leaders and Oregon officials, state parks officials said.\n\nThe parks have been closed more than a month and are being re-opened under the first phase of the Gov. Jay Inslee's plan to ease rules imposed to prevent the spread of the virus. Beaches and campgrounds would re-open under the second phase of the plan, although large gatherings would still be banned.\n\nWASHINGTON -- The Justice Department has filed a statement of interest siding with a Virginia church suing the state's governor over restrictions because of the coronavirus.\n\nThe filing was made Sunday in support of the Lighthouse Fellowship Church.\n\nThe lawsuit alleges the church's pastor, Kevin Wilson, was issued a criminal citation because he held a service with 16 people on April 5.\n\nAuthorities allege the church violated the state's ban on gatherings of more than 10 people.\n\nThe Justice Department's filing, citing the lawsuit, says the church had maintained social distancing and had extensive sanitizing of common surfaces. The church said attendees had to stay 6 feet apart and use hand sanitizer before entering the building.\n\nThe Justice Department says Virginia \"cannot treat religious gatherings less favorably than other similar, secular gatherings.\"\n\nA judge had denied the church's motion for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction on Friday.\n\nNEW YORK -- A New York City police officer who was caught on video Saturday pointing a stun gun at a man and violently taking him to the ground over an alleged social distancing violation has been stripped of his gun and badge and placed on desk duty pending an internal investigation.\n\nBystander video showed the plainclothes officer, who was not wearing a protective face mask, slapping 33-year-old Donni Wright in the face, punching him in the shoulder and dragging him to a sidewalk after leveling him in a crosswalk in Manhattan's East Village.\n\n\"There will unquestionably be a careful look at what happened there,\" Mayor Bill de Blasio said Sunday.\n\nPolice spokeswoman Sgt. Mary Frances O'Donnell said Wright \"took a fighting stance against the officer\" when he was ordered to disperse and was arrested on charges including assault on a police officer and resisting arrest. Wright had not been arraigned as of Sunday afternoon, prosecutors said.\n\nA message seeking comment was left with the police officers' union.\n\nFollow AP news coverage of the coronavirus pandemic at https://apnews.com/VirusOutbreak and https://apnews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak.",

        "body": "The Latest on the coronavirus pandemic. The new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms for most people. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness or death.\n\nTOP OF THE HOUR:\n\n-- Fauci expects quick approval of new drug in virus fight.\n\n-- Czech Republic goes another day without COVID-19 death.\n\n-- China calls claim of virus released from lab 'fabricated.'\n\n-- Japan extends virus emergency; expects 'endurance race.'\n\nWASHINGTON -- The nation's top infectious diseases expert says he expects the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to quickly approve a new experimental drug that showed promising signs in treating patients with COVID-19.\n\nAnthony Fauci tells NBC's \"Today\" show Thursday that he anticipates the go-ahead for the emergency use of Remdesivir to happen \"really quickly.\"\n\nHe says he spoke with FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn on Wednesday, and while Hahn had yet to make a final decision, \"I would project that we're going to be seeing that reasonably soon.\" The drug was shown in a major study to shorten recovery time of hospitalized patients.\n\nFauci said the drug's manufacturer has committed to scaling production of the drug as quickly as possible as the world hunts for an effective treatment and ultimately a vaccine.\n\nFauci has been working on a project to fast track the development of a vaccine by mass producing formulas that appear safe and effective before they're fully vetted. The goal is to get hundreds of millions of doses to the public by January.\n\nBRUSSELS -- The European Union hopes to raise 7.5 billion euros ($8.2 billion) next week to fund research into a vaccine for the coronavirus as well as to develop new treatments and more efficient testing.\n\nEuropean Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said Thursday the May 4 conference aims \"to bring the world together to deliver on prevention, diagnostics and treatments against coronavirus.\"\n\nLeaders from Britain, Italy, France, Germany, Norway and Saudi Arabia are expected to speak at the videoconference. The commission would like the U.S. to take part but has not received a reply.\n\nThe commission says the goal is to develop a vaccine, treatment and tests that are available to all who need it and at an affordable price.\n\nMOSCOW -- Tajikistan has reported its first 15 confirmed cases of the new coronavirus.\n\nUntil now, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan were the only ex-Soviet countries in Central Asia that hadn't reported a single case. The announcement Thursday comes before the arrival of a World Health Organization group to assess Tajikistan's preparedness for the outbreak.\n\nTajik authorities had been denying for weeks that the nation is affected by the outbreak, attributing a surge of respiratory diseases to other infections and viruses.\n\nLast week, however, the government closed schools, theaters and cinemas and suspended mass gatherings. The authorities also temporarily banned exports of certain foods, such as grains, meat, eggs and potatoes.\n\nWASHINGTON -- The Emory University medical school doctor leading the Remdesivir drug trials says the drug provides a \"glimmer of hope\" for coronavirus treatment.\n\nAneesh Mehta said Thursday on ABC's \"Good Morning America\" that \"we are looking to find a medication that helps patients get better more rapidly, get them home to their families and make more room for other patients for us to take care of.\"\n\nHe adds: \"I think now we have the first glimmer of hope of something that can do that.\"\n\nMehta cautions that the Remdesivir data is \"very preliminary.\" He says most antivirals tend to work better earlier in the course of disease.\n\nHe adds that his team is working with the National Institutes of Health to adapt the clinical trial to look at other medications in combination with Remdesivir.\n\nROME -- Scientists are defending a controversial report warning of a new wave of critical coronavirus cases that prompted the Italian government to keep schools closed until September and take a gradual approach to reopening.\n\nThe statistical models in the report estimate that Italy could see as many as 151,000 people in intensive care by June 8 if everything reopened, given the large number of possible contacts where infections could spread.\n\nIndustrial groups have assailed the report's methodology, but its authors appeared at the Superior Institute of Health on Thursday to defend the findings.\n\nAt the height of Italy's outbreak, the deadliest in Europe, there were a fraction of people in ICUs, slightly more than 4,000 for four days running March 31-April 3. Even that number, however, overwhelmed the health system in hardest-hit Lombardy.\n\nTOKYO -- Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe plans to extend the ongoing coronavirus state of emergency beyond its scheduled end on May 6.\n\nAbe said Thursday that hospitals are still overburdened and medical workers are under severe pressure to deal with the patients still on the rise.\n\n\"I believe it will be difficult to return to our normal daily lives after May 7,\" Abe said. \"We must expect an endurance race to a certain extent.\"\n\nAbe said he will consult with experts to decide how long the measures should be extended. Local officials and medical experts have called for an extension for another month nationwide.\n\nThe rise in the cases somewhat slowed in the last few days. But Japan still had more than 200 new cases overnight, bringing a national total to some 14,000 cases, with 415 deaths.\n\nPRAGUE -- Nobody died of COVID-19 in the Czech Republic on Wednesday, the second day without a fatality this month after April 15.\n\nSo far, 227 people have died in the Czech Republic, according to Health Ministry figures released Thursday, after more than 7,500 have been tested positive.\n\nThe day-to-day increase of the new cases has been under 100 for the eighth day and less than 10 died daily since April 13.\n\nIt is now possible for the government to gradually ease its restrictive measures adopted to contain the pandemic.\n\nBERLIN -- More than 300,000 people in Germany have lost their jobs over the past month because of the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic. The government, however, says millions more remain employed thanks to the country's extensive use of short work.\n\nLabor Minister Hubertus Heil said Thursday the country faces a \"historic challenge.\"\n\nHe said unemployment rose by 13% in April, compared to March. The jobless rate rose to 5.8% from 5.1% the months before. He noted that the government expects GDP to drop by 6.3% this year.\n\nBut he noted that Germany should be able to avoid the mass unemployment seen in other countries, such as the U.S.\n\nHeil said that some 10.1 million people have applied for short work, which allows companies in distress to receive state funds if they hold onto employees rather than letting them go. He said restaurants, bars and hotels are particularly hard hit.\n\nBEIJING -- China says any claims that the coronavirus was released from a laboratory are \"unfounded and purely fabricated out of nothing.\"\n\nForeign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said Thursday the Wuhan Institute of Virology at the center of the allegations \"does not have the ability to design and create a new coronavirus, and it has never done so.\"\n\nGeng cited the institute's director, Yuan Zhiming, as saying the lab strictly implements bio-security procedures that would prevent the release of any pathogen.\n\n\"I would like to point out again that the origin of the virus is a complex scientific issue, and it should be studied by scientists and professionals,\" Geng said.\n\nGeng also criticized U.S. politicians who have suggested China should be held accountable for the global pandemic, saying they should spend their time on \"better controlling the epidemic situation at home.\"\n\nMADRID -- As Spaniards ready to go for runs or walks for the first time since mid-March and separated relatives plan how to meet in coming weeks, the head of Spain's health emergency coordination center says \"unnecessary risks\" should be avoided.\n\nAsked about children hugging grandparents, Dr. Fernando Sim\u00f3n said that \"psychologically it's great to hug as many people as possible,\" but that close contact would be exposing the elderly to \"low but unnecessary risks.\"\n\nThe epidemiologist said that contagion levels are waning in Spain even beyond what figures show because more testing is making visible infections that happened two weeks earlier and that showed no symptoms or required no hospitalization.\n\nBERLIN -- The head of Germany's disease control center says he expects the actual number of deaths in the country from the new coronavirus to be higher than those currently reported.\n\nLothar Wieler of the Robert Koch Institute told reporters Thursday that early figures from two of Germany's 16 states -- Berlin and Hesse -- indicate that the number of people dying is higher than average for the time of year.\n\nIn other countries, this so-called excess mortality has been higher than the reported COVID-19 death toll, indicating some deaths from the pandemic are going undetected, though it is unclear whether these result directly from infection or other factors, such as health system overload.\n\nWieler said his agency \"is working on the assumption that more people likely died of (COVID-19) than have been officially reported.\" He said the wide range of complications now linked to the disease could be one explanation.\n\nATHENS, Greece -- Greece's prime minister has spoken in parliament, appearing behind a protective plastic shield, to outline steps his center-right government is taking to aid the economy during the virus pandemic.\n\nThe barrier was installed at the podium in parliament's plenary chamber ahead of the debate Thursday that was joined by opposition party leaders.\n\nParliament staff assisting debates in the chamber are seated directly below the podium.\n\nPrime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis announced plans this week to ease lockdown restrictions over two months, starting May 4. Many stores have installed plastic barriers in customer areas ahead of the reopening.\n\nRecently emerged from a years-long financial crisis, Greece is widely expected to follow other European countries into recession in 2020.\n\nLONDON -- A British army veteran who started walking laps in his garden as part of a humble fundraiser for the National Health Service is celebrating his 100th birthday after warming the hearts of a nation that donated millions of pounds to back his appeal.\n\nCapt. Tom Moore planned to walk 100 laps of his garden ahead of Thursday's milestone.\n\nHis original target was 1,000 pounds ($1,250). He has now raised 30 million pounds.\n\nHe wrote on Twitter: \"Thank you everyone, you are all magnificent.\"\n\nEarlier he had told supporters in a handwritten note that the past few weeks had put a spring in his step.\n\nTo honor his determination, the Royal Air Force staged a birthday flypast, the public sent birthday cards and Prime Minister Boris Johnson offered a birthday message.\n\nJOHANNESBURG -- The Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says coronavirus cases across the continent have increased 37% in the past week.\n\nAfrica now has more than 36,000 cases including more than 1,500 deaths.\n\nWhile the continent's capacity to test for the virus is growing, shortages of test kits remain across Africa. That means more cases could be out there. But the head of policy with the Africa CDC, Benjamin Djoudalbaye, tells reporters that the virus \"is not something you can hide.\"\n\nIn South Africa, which has the most cases in Africa with more than 5,300, Health Minister Zweli Mkhize says that authorities are \"very hopeful we have averted the first storm.\"\n\nThe country has been praised for testing assertively and will slightly loosen a five-week lockdown on Friday.\n\nGENEVA -- The head of the World Health Organization's European office is warning the continent remains \"in the grip\" of the coronavirus pandemic even as about three-fourths of the region's countries are easing restrictive measures.\n\nDr. Hans Kluge noted a reduction of cases in the region thanks to social distancing measures, adding: \"We must monitor this positive development very closely.\"\n\nHe said Italy, Britain, France, Germany and Spain still have high numbers of cases, and pointed to increases in cases in Belarus, Russia, Kazakhstan and Ukraine.\n\nOf the 44 countries in WHO Europe's region that have enacted domestic restrictions, 21 have already started easing those measures and another 11 plan to do so in the coming days, Kluge said.\n\n\"This virus is unforgiving. We must remain vigilant, persevere and be patient, ready to ramp up measures as and when needed,\" he said. \"COVID-19 is not going away anytime soon.\n\n\"The European region accounts for 46 percent of cases and 63 percent of deaths globally,\" he added. \"The region remains very much in the grip of this pandemic.\"\n\nLONDON -- The British government acknowledges that it may miss a self-imposed goal of conducting 100,000 tests for coronavirus a day by Thursday, but insists it is on course to vastly expand the country's testing capacity.\n\nThe government has been criticized for failing to catch most cases of COVID-19 and now says wide-scale testing will be key to controlling the virus and easing a nationwide lockdown.\n\nEarlier this month it vowed to perform 100,000 tests a day by April 30. The number has been climbing steadily, but the highest daily total reached so far is 52,000.\n\nJustice Secretary Robert Buckland said that \"even if the target isn't met today ... we're well on our way to ramping this up.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, the U.K.'s official death toll from the virus leap to more than 26,000 after deaths in nursing homes were added to the hospital total. The tally is the world's third-highest, surpassed only by the United States and Italy.\n\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson, who spent a week in hospital with the virus, is under pressure to reveal when and how the government will ease a nationwide lockdown that was imposed on March 23. The restrictions are due to last at least until May 7.\n\nFollow AP news coverage of the coronavirus pandemic at https://apnews.com/VirusOutbreak and https://apnews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak",

For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness or death.\n\nTOP OF THE HOUR:\n\n-- China, South Korea see new virus cases as world lockdowns ease.\n\n-- Widely respected doctor in Greece dies from the new coronavirus.\n\n-- Thailand removes China and South Korea from its list of countries at high-risk for COVID-19.\n\nATHENS, Greece -- Greek former health minister, cardiologist and university professor Dimitris Kremastinos has died of the new coronavirus, Greek officials said Friday. He was 78.\n\nKremastinos, a widely respected doctor who became a household name in Greece as the personal physician of late prime minister Andreas Papandreou in the mid-1990s, was admitted to Athens' public Evangelismos hospital on March 26 and was being treated in the intensive care unit for COVID-19, the illness caused by the new coronavirus. He died Friday morning.\n\nNews of his death was made public by Health Minsiter Vassilis Kikilias, who tweeted that the former minister \"served the health sector with dignity and a sense of responsibility.\"\n\nTributes for Kremastinos, who was currently serving as parliament vice-president and was a member of the center-left KINAL party, poured in from politicians.\n\nPrime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis paid tribute to Kremastinos' legacy, saying \"the world of science and politics today lost a leading member.\" The prime minister tweeted that the professor had \"left a special imprint of dignity, responsibility and effectiveness.\"\n\nAlready an established leading cardiologist, Kremastinos became well-known in Greece when he became involved in the medical care of Papandreou, who spent the last months of his premiership critically ill before his death in 1996.\n\nBANGKOK -- Thailand's Health Minister says the government has agreed to remove China and South Korea from its official list of countries at high-risk for COVID-19 infections because their daily case counts have dropped to the single-digit level.\n\nAnutin Charnvirakul said Friday that the Center for Covid-19 Situation Administration has approved the action but he did not know when it would be implemented. The measure would become official upon its publication in the Royal Gazette.\n\nThe move, when implemented, would appear to exempt people arriving from China and South Korea from a mandatory 14-day quarantine upon their arrival in Thailand. But it would not mean a sudden influx of visitors, as Thai aviation authorities have banned incoming commercial passenger flights through May 31.\n\nThailand announced eight new confirmed COVID-19 cases Friday, bringing the total to 3,000 including 55 deaths. Nearly 3,000 patients have recovered.\n\nSEOUL, South Korea -- South Korea's top infectious disease expert says the country could possibly push back plans to reopen schools if coronavirus infections surge again over the weekend after a weeks-long decline.\n\nJeong Eun-kyeong, director of the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, made the comments on Friday while addressing fears of a broader spread of COVID-19 in the densely populated Seoul metropolitan area after health workers detected more than a dozen infections linked to nightclubs.\n\nA slowing caseload in previous weeks had allowed officials to relax social distancing guidelines and schedule a reopening of schools, starting with high school seniors on May 13.\n\n\"At this moment, it's too early to say whether we need to postpone the opening of schools, but we will monitor the spread of the virus and review information from our epidemiological investigations throughout today and tomorrow before determining the risks and discussing the matter with related ministries,\" she said during a virus briefing.\n\nThe government issued an administrative order advising nightclubs, hostess bars and similar entertainment venues around the country to close for a month after officials detected at least 15 infections linked to a 29-year-old patient, who visited three clubs in Seoul's Itaewon district on Saturday before testing positive on Wednesday.\n\nJeong said the patient did not wear masks inside the clubs and that the number of infections will likely rise as health workers are still tracing and testing his contacts.\n\nVIENNA -- Austria and Romania have reached an agreement to provide trains for Romanian care workers who have had trouble getting to Austria because of travel restrictions.\n\nThe Austrian government said that the first train will set off from Romania on Sunday, traveling through Hungary.\n\nIt says that about 33,000 people in Austria need round-the-clock care and many of the people who provide it come from Romania. Over recent weeks, restrictions in travel within Europe imposed to slow the spread of the coronavirus have made it near-impossible for colleagues from Romania to relieve them.\n\nIt wasn't immediately clear how many Romanians will use the trains.\n\nTEHRAN, Iran -- Iran's semi-official Tasnim news agency says Friday prayers are resuming in mosques in 146 cities with minimal risk conditions for spreading the coronavirus after being banned for more than two months.\n\nThe report said prayer gatherings will continue to be banned in major cities, including all provincial capitals, for now.\n\nIran is battling the worst outbreak in the Middle East while under heavy U.S. sanctions. Officials said Thursday the death toll from COVID-19, the illness caused by the virus, rose to nearly 6,500 among more than 100,000 confirmed cases.\n\nThere are currently no plans to reopen the country's religious shrines, including the most important Shiite holy site in the country, the Imam Reza Shrine in the northeastern city of Mashahd.\n\nNEW DELHI, India -- India has recorded 3,390 new coronavirus infections and 103 deaths in the last 24 hours.\n\nTotal cases in the country of 1.3 billion people surpassed 56,000, with 1,886 fatalities, according to health ministry data. More than 16,500 people have recovered.\n\nThe coastal state of Maharashtra remains the worst affected with almost 20,000 cases and 651 deaths.\n\nIndia began a mammoth evacuation exercise late Thursday, bringing back the first batch of its citizens stranded overseas amid the COVID-19 shutdown. More than 340 Indian nationals returned home on the first two flights from the United Arab Emirates (UAE).\n\nNational carrier Air India will conduct 64 flights to 12 countries from May 7-13 to bring back approximately 15,000 Indians stranded due to the coronavirus lockdown.\n\nOfficials say at least 200,000 Indians abroad have registered to return. The stranded Indians will pay their own fares. They will be quarantined when they arrive.\n\nIndia is also using its Navy to bring back stranded citizens. The country suspended all international travel in March before going into a strict lockdown to slow COVID-19 cases.\n\nSEOUL, South Korea -- China and South Korea both reported more coronavirus infections Friday after reopening economies damaged by devastating outbreaks. Around the globe, governments are opting to accept the risks of easing pandemic-fighting restrictions that left huge numbers of people without income or safety nets.\n\nIn the U.S., some governors are disregarding or creatively interpreting White House guidelines in easing their states' lockdowns and letting businesses reopen. An Associated Press analysis found 17 states appeared to have not met one of the key benchmarks set by the White House for loosening up -- a 14-day downward trajectory in new cases or positive test rates.\n\nSouth Korea's 13 fresh cases reported Friday were its first increase higher than 10 in five days. A dozen were linked to a 29-year-old who visited three nightclubs in Seoul last weekend.\n\n\"A drop of ink in clear water spreads swiftly,\" Vice Health Minister Kim Gang-lip said, urging vigilance to guard hard-won gains. \"Anyone can become that drop of ink that spreads COVID-19.\"\n\nIn China, where the new coronavirus first emerged, authorities reported 17 new cases, including 16 people that tested positive but were not showing symptoms. No new deaths have been reported for more than three weeks, and 260 people remain hospitalized for COVID-19 treatment.\n\nTOKYO -- Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and U.S. President Donald Trump have agreed to cooperate closely in developing COVID-19 vaccines and drugs, and in their efforts to boost their economies.\n\nThe two leaders held telephone talks as they seek to reopen businesses in their respective countries.\n\nJapan's Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga told reporters the leaders exchanged views on the COVID-19 situation, measures to prevent further spread of the virus, development of drugs and vaccines, and steps for reopening the economies in their countries. He said Abe proposed the talks.\n\n\"It was extremely meaningful to be able to reassure Japan-U.S. cooperation via telephone talks between the two leaders just as the international society is expected to unite and tackle the (pandemic),\" Suga said.\n\nThe Japanese health ministry, in a rare fast-track process, approved Gilead Sciences Inc.'s antiviral drug remdesivir on Thursday to treat COVID-19 patients. The approval was granted under a special fast-track process only four days after the company filed an application.\n\nJapan is still under a coronavirus state of emergency, which was extended this week until the end of May, though there have been no hard lockdowns.\n\nThe United States has more than 1.2 million reported infections, with deaths exceeding 75,000, while Japan has about 15,500 cases and 580 deaths.\n\nUNITED NATIONS -- United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres says the coronavirus pandemic keeps unleashing \"a tsunami of hate and xenophobia, scapegoating and scare-mongering.\"\n\nThe U.N. chief said Friday that \"anti-foreigner sentiment has surged online and in the streets, anti-Semitic conspiracy theories have spread, and COVID-19-related anti-Muslim attacks have occurred.\"\n\nGuterres said migrants and refugees \"have been vilified as a source of the virus -- and then denied access to medical treatment.\"\n\n\"With older persons among the most vulnerable, contemptible memes have emerged suggesting they are also the most expendable,\" he said. \"And journalists, whistleblowers, health professionals, aid workers and human rights defenders are being targeted simply for doing their jobs.\"\n\nGuterres appealed \"for an all-out effort to end hate speech globally.\"\n\nThe secretary-general called on political leaders to show solidarity with all people, on educational institutions to focus on \"digital literacy\" at a time when \"extremists are seeking to prey on captive and potentially despairing audiences.\"\n\nHe called on the media, especially social media, to \"remove racist, misogynist and other harmful content,\" on civil society to strengthen their outreach to vulnerable people, and on religious figures to serve as \"models of mutual respect.\"\n\nCANBERRA, Australia -- Australia plans to reopen its economy in three stages by July, but there are no plans to open the country to general international travelers in the foreseeable future.\n\nPrime Minister Scott Morrison said Friday the states will set their own pace in easing coronavirus restrictions, and details of the second and third stages of the plan had yet to be finalized.\n\nAustralia's two most populous states, New South Wales and Victoria, are continuing to record new cases daily while the other states and territories have gone multiple days without finding new infections despite ramped up testing.\n\nQueensland will relax its social distancing rules for Mother's Day on Sunday by allowing up to five people from one household to visit another household, and the Northern Territory will open pubs next week for the service of alcohol with meals.\n\nUnder stage one of a national plan agreed upon by federal and state leaders on Friday, small cafes and restaurants will open as long as each patron has at least 4 square meters (43 square feet) of space.\n\nChildren will return to classrooms and groups of 10 people will be allowed to gather outdoors. Playgrounds, golf courses, swimming pools and libraries will reopen.\n\nNightclubs and other drinking venues without seated dining will not reopen until stage 3.\n\nMorrison said he was open to the possibility of international students returning to Australian universities on charter flights, but general international travel will not open up \"in the foreseeable future.\"\n\nFollow AP news coverage of the coronavirus pandemic at https://apnews.com/VirusOutbreak and https://apnews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak.",

        "body": "The Latest on the coronavirus pandemic. The new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms for most people. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness or death.\n\nTOP OF THE HOUR:\n\n-- Pandemic eases in parts of Europe but worsens in India.\n\n-- India's virus lockdown eased while infection rate speeds up.\n\nATHENS, Greece -- Greece has begun gradually lifting its restrictive measures after a 42-day lockdown to stop the spread of the coronavirus.\n\nAs of Monday morning, Greeks are no longer restricted as to why they can leave their homes, and don't need to send an SMS or carry a self-written permit justifying being outdoors.\n\nThe first businesses have also opened as part of what authorities have said will be a staggered re-opening of the economy. Hair salons, barber shops and stores selling books, sporting goods, stationary, and other items can now open, albeit with strict hygiene and social distancing measures in place.\n\nMasks are now compulsory for staff and passengers on public transport, staff in shops selling fresh food and in several other places, with violators facing fines. Authorities strongly recommend mask-wearing in all indoor public areas.\n\nSchool students in the final grade of high school are to return to class as of next week, followed later in the month by those in the rest of junior high and high school grades.\n\nGreece's government imposed a lockdown early in the country's outbreak, which has been credited with keeping the number of deaths and critically ill at low levels. Greece has reported nearly 150 virus deaths and over 2,500 infections. Almost 80,000 tests had been carried out as of Sunday.\n\nNEW DELHI -- India has relaxed some lockdown restrictions even as the pace of coronavirus infections has slightly accelerated.\n\nSome economic activities resumed Monday after a nationwide halt that lasted nearly five weeks. Normal life, albeit with masks, social distancing and stringent hygiene standards, has started to return in low-risk areas with few or no cases, while constraints on movement and work continued elsewhere in the country.\n\nIn the capital of New Delhi, a designated hot spot, many lockdown restrictions remained. But more than 100 people -- not all observing social distancing measures -- stood in line ahead of the reopening of a liquor store.\n\nIndia has about 42,500 virus cases, 11,706 recoveries and 1,373 deaths. The country had conducted more than a million tests by Monday. Still, at 758 tests per million people, India is among the nations testing the lowest fraction of their population. And experts warn the virus has yet to peak.\n\nBRUSSELS -- The European Union has approved 7 billion euros ($7.6 billion) in loans and guarantees that the French state is providing to its airline Air France to weather the financial storm unleashed by the coronavirus.\n\nEU Commission Vice President Margrethe Vestager said the guarantees and loans \"will provide Air France with the liquidity that it urgently needs to withstand the impact of the coronavirus outbreak.\"\n\nIt was part of a deal by the French and Dutch governments announced April 24 of at least 9 billion euros ($9.7 billion) in bailout money to rescue both Air France and KLM, which are fighting for survival as most of their planes are grounded by virus lockdowns around the world.\n\nAir France will get 3 billion euros in direct loans from the French state and a 4 billion euro bank loan guaranteed by the state, the airline said in a statement.\n\nBRUSSELS -- Belgium is relaxing some of its lockdown measures Monday, confident enough that the coronavirus crisis is on the wane.\n\nBusiness-to-business companies can open their offices to employees again, even though remote work is still encouraged. Those who come to work need to respect social distancing or wear protective masks. Textile shops selling cloth will be opening, too, because they are essential if people want to make their own protective masks.\n\nThose masks will also be mandatory on public transportation, which will seek to reopen at full capacity. And people will be allowed to exercise and play sports with two others.\n\nBelgium has reported 7,844 deaths of people confirmed or suspected to have COVID-19. Authorities have been able to relax lockdown measures as coronavirus cases have steadily decreased over the past few weeks.\n\nTOKYO -- Japan says a panel of experts supports the government's plan to extend the nationwide state of emergency through the end of May.\n\nPrime Minister Shinzo Abe said Friday he planned to keep the current coronavirus measures in place for another month, in accordance with recommendations from health experts. They noted the rise in new cases has slowed but Japan's medical system is still overburdened.\n\nEconomy Minister Yasutoshi Nishimura told reporters Monday that experts backed the government's plan to extend social distancing measures until May 31 and called it \"appropriate.\"\n\nNishimura said Sunday the current measures in Tokyo and a dozen other prefectures designated as special warning zones are expected to stay in place, while 34 other prefectures would be allowed to somewhat ease restrictions on the condition they take ample preventive steps.\n\nLater on Monday, after approval by parliamentary committees, Abe is set to formally announce an extension and explain details.\n\nJapan has had more than 15,000 virus cases and 510 deaths as of Monday, according to the health ministry.\n\nBEIJING -- China reported three new coronavirus cases Monday, all brought from overseas, and no additional deaths.\n\nA total of 481 people remain in the hospital because of the virus, with about 1,000 under monitoring and isolation after showing symptoms or testing positive without symptoms.\n\nChina has reported 4,633 deaths from COVID-19 among 82,880 cases.\n\nFollow AP news coverage of the coronavirus pandemic at https://apnews.com/VirusOutbreak and https://apnews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak.",

For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness or death.\n\nTOP OF THE HOUR:\n\n-- India reports 5,242 new cases, largest single-day surge, and 157 deaths.\n\n-- Full lockdown reimposed in Pakistan-held Kashmir after positive tests.\n\n-- China reports 7 new cases, South Korea 15.\n\n-- Los Angeles Police Department wants virus test for everyone arrested.\n\n-- Canadian acrobatic jet crashes into British Columbia neighborhood.\n\n-- Trump calls into golf tournament, promises speedy return to normalcy.\n\nNEW DELHI, India -- India has recorded its biggest single-day surge with 5,242 new cases of coronavirus and 157 deaths due to COVID-19 in the last 24 hours, taking the country's infection tally to more than 96,000, the most in Asia.\n\nThe country now has 3,029 reported fatalities due to COVID-19.\n\nThe surge in infections comes a day after the federal government extended a nationwide lockdown to May 31 but eased some restrictions to restore economic activity and gave states more control in deciding the nature of the lockdown.\n\nAuthorities are largely attributing the recent surge in infections to the return of hundreds of thousands of migrant workers to India's villages, which have weaker health infrastructure.\n\nIndia had eased its lockdown rules on May 4 and even allowed migrant workers to travel back to their homes, a decision that has resulted in millions of people being on the move for the last two weeks.\n\nAll domestic and international passenger flights remain prohibited in the country. Metro services, schools, colleges, hotels and restaurants also remain shuttered nationwide.\n\nMost of the infections reported in India are from its major cities. Mumbai, the financial capital and home to Bollywood, alone has registered almost 20% of the total cases.\n\nMUZAFFARABAD, Pakistan -- The government in the Pakistani-administered sector of Kashmir announced it is reimposing full lockdown measures beginning Monday night after several people tested positive for the new coronavirus.\n\nThe move came days after about two dozen more people tested positive in Pakistan-held Kashmir, where so far 112 confirmed cases have been reported. The region has reported only one coronavirus-related death.\n\nThe lockdown was imposed in Pakistan-held Kashmir in March to contain the spread of the virus. But it was eased in April. Kashmir is a split between Pakistan and neighboring India but claimed by both in its entirety.\n\nThe announcement came as Pakistan reported 30 more deaths from the new coronavirus in the previous 24 hours, raising overall fatalities in the country to 903. So far, 42,125 confirmed cases have been reported in Pakistan, a total that includes the 112 infections in Pakistan-held Kashmir.\n\nBEIJING -- China reported seven new coronavirus cases Monday and officials said central government petition offices in Beijing, where people come from across the country to register complaints, will remain closed for the time being as a virus-control measure.\n\nNo new COVID-19 deaths have been reported in China in more than a month, although some have been announced retroactively after further tests were performed, and 82 people remain in treatment while another 450 are under isolation and monitoring as suspected cases or after testing positive for the virus without showing symptoms. China has reported a total of 4,634 deaths among 82,954 cases since the virus was first detected in the central industrial city of Wuhan.\n\nWith the decline in cases, China has moved to restart schools and reopen businesses and industries. However, some government offices that tend to attract large numbers of people in restricted spaces have largely remained closed to the public.\n\nCentral government petition offices are a particular concern because complainants often travel considerable distances to Beijing where they might live for weeks or months in substandard accommodations awaiting a response.\n\nIn its report, the official Xinhua News Agency said complaints could still be submitted online.\n\nSEOUL, South Korea -- South Korea has reported 15 new coronavirus cases and one more death, bringing its totals to 11,065 cases and 263 fatalities.\n\nSouth Korea's Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Monday said it believed 10 of the new cases were linked to passengers arriving from abroad.\n\nOnly two new cases were reported from the Seoul metropolitan area, where tens of thousands were tested in recent weeks after health officials discovered dozens of infections linked to club goers.\n\nOfficials have expressed hope that the transmissions are waning and plan to move ahead with a phased reopening of schools, starting with high school seniors on Wednesday.\n\nLOS ANGELES -- The Los Angeles Police Department wants to test everyone its officers arrest to determine whether they are infected with the coronavirus.\n\nPolice Chief Michel Moore told the department's civilian oversight body last week that jails are testing all new arrivals, but the results take days to come back. He said real-time data from a rapid-result test would help authorities isolate sick detainees, keep others detained in local jails safe and quickly alert officers to any potential exposure.\n\nMoore is asking city officials to purchase a rapid-result testing system, but it's unclear whether such a system will produce accurate test results.\n\nKAMLOOPS, British Columbia -- A Canadian acrobatic jet crashed into a British Columbia neighborhood Sunday during a flyover intended to boost morale during the pandemic, killing one crew member, seriously injuring another and setting a house on fire. Video appeared to show at least one person ejecting.\n\nThe crash left debris scattered across the neighborhood near the airport in the city of Kamloops, 260 miles (418 kilometers) northeast of Vancouver. Canada's defense department said emergency crews were responding. The Snowbirds are Canada's equivalent of the U.S. Air Force Thunderbirds or U.S. Navy's Blue Angels.\n\n\"It is with heavy hearts that we announce that one member of the CF Snowbirds team has died and one has sustained serious injuries,\" The Royal Canadian Air Force said in a tweet.\n\nThe Royal Canadian Mounted Police said the cause of the crash is under investigation.\n\nOperation Inspiration started in Nova Scotia earlier this month and features the team's signature nine-jet formation. It was aimed at boosting morale amid the pandemic.\n\nThe Snowbirds have performed at airshows across Canada and the U.S. for decades and are considered a key tool for raising awareness about -- and recruiting for -- the air force. Eleven aircraft are used during shows, with nine flying and two kept as spares.\n\nWASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump called into a charity golf tournament broadcast Sunday and promised Americans a speedy return to normalcy that sounded far more optimistic than most experts say is realistic.\n\nTrump hailed the event -- broadcast on NBC -- and said he'd like to see crowds packing into sports venues by this fall, whether or not a cure for the coronavirus is developed.\n\nHe said, \"We're looking at vaccines, we're looking at cures and we are very, very far down the line,\" adding: \"I think that's not going to be in the very distant future. But even before that, I think we'll be back to normal.\"\n\nExperts, however, say finding a cure that fast is far from certain and have warned that easing restrictions too quickly could cause the virus to rebound.\n\nTrump said events would likely resume with small crowds -- if any -- but hopes that by the time The Masters is played in November, the crowds can return.\n\n\"We want to get it back to where it was. We want big, big stadiums loaded with people,\" he said. \"We want to get sports back. We miss sports. We need sports in terms of the psyche, the psyche of our country.\"\n\nThe TaylorMade Driving Relief is being played at Seminole Golf Club in Florida to raise money for COVID-19 relief. There are no crowds, no caddies and a limited TV crew, all following social distancing guidelines.\n\nMANILA, Philippines -- Crowds and vehicular traffic returned to shopping malls in the Philippine capital after a two-month coronavirus lockdown was partially relaxed over the weekend, prompting police to warn of arrests and store closures.\n\nPresidential spokesman Harry Roque said the massive quarantine in the main northern Luzon region, home to more than 50 million people, was slowly being eased to revitalize the economy \"and not because we are safe.\" The economy contracted in the first quarter and more than 2 million people have lost their jobs or faced pay cuts due to lockdowns.\n\nThe Philippines has reported more than 12,500 infections, and 824 deaths due to COVID-19. It has only been able to conduct about a third of a daily target of 30,000 coronavirus tests.\n\nRoque warned against public complacency \"after we received reports of people who trooped to the malls with complete disregard of social or physical distancing.\"\n\nPolice Lt. Gen. Guillermo Lorenzo Eleazar warned shopping malls not only of closures but of criminal charges against the owners if they fail to regulate crowds.\n\nOnly metropolitan Manila and two other high-risk areas remain under a strict lockdown, but manufacturing plants were allowed to reopen with half their workforce from Saturday through the end of May. Essential businesses have reopened, too, but gyms, barber shops, movie houses and other recreation activities remain shut.\n\nPORTLAND, Ore. -- Oregon health officials say hospitals will be provided with an experimental drug that has shown some promise treating the coronavirus.\n\nThe Oregon Health Authority said Sunday that the state has received enough doses of remdesivir to treat all patients who met the medical criteria for using the drug as of Saturday.\n\nRecent early results for the drug suggested it could help patients recover from the coronavirus faster, although longer-term data is still needed to confirm any benefit.\n\nThe health authority is not taking a position on whether it should be used or not, leaving that decision up to doctors and their patients.\n\nLOS ANGELES -- Among the 7,000 homeless moved into hotel rooms to ride out the pandemic are people with compromised lungs and hearts.\n\nCalifornia counties have leased more than 15,000 hotel rooms as part of Project Roomkey, which Gov. Gavin Newsom launched in March to protect vulnerable homeless people.\n\nThe state has an estimated 150,000 homeless, which is the most in the country.\n\nCounty officials say it's been more difficult than expected to find appropriate hotels, negotiate leases and set up operations. People in the program must follow rules, including curfews and temperature checks whenever they return from outside. Some people have been coaxed inside after years sleeping on rough streets.\n\nCHEYENNE, Wyo. -- Health officials say the first outbreak of the coronavirus at a nursing home in Wyoming has infected at least nine people.\n\nThe Wyoming Department of Health said Sunday that five employees and four residents at the Worland Healthcare and Rehabilitation have been found to have COVID-19 so far.\n\nA department spokesperson said more test results were pending but officials believe all the residents and employees at the facility have been tested.\n\nThe testing began after staff members became sick and sought medical care but it's not clear how the virus was introduced into the facility. There was an outbreak at an assisted living facility in Lander in March but none at a nursing home until now.\n\nBOISE, Idaho -- Idaho is holding an entirely mail-in primary for the first time as the state works to slow the spread of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nBallots must be requested by Tuesday and returned by 8 p.m. June 2, with results announced that evening.\n\nDemocratic voters will see one high-profile name on their ballot: Former 2018 Democratic gubernatorial nominee Paulette Jordan of Plummer is running against former congressional candidate Jim Vandermaas for a chance to challenge GOP Sen. Jim Risch in November.\n\nJordan garnered national attention during her 2018 campaign amid hopes from supporters that she could become the first Native American governor in the United States.\n\nBusinesses that defy Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker's stay-at-home order could face a misdemeanor under emergency rules his administration has filed.\n\nThe change took effect Friday when the rules were filed, but legislators on a bipartisan committee have the chance to review it on Wednesday.\n\nIf they don't reject it, it'll remain in effect for 150 days. Class A misdemeanors are punished by a fine between $75 and $2,500.\n\nThe Pritzker's administration's general counsel Ann Spillane likens it to a traffic ticket. However, some Republicans called it an overreach of Pritzker's powers.\n\nRIO DE JANEIRO -- Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro greeted hundreds of supporters -- and joined some in a series of push-ups -- who gathered before the presidential offices Sunday to back his open-the-economy drive even as the coronavirus pandemic sweeps across the country.\n\nDemonstrators in Brasilia and Sao Paulo defied local stay-at-home orders to join the pro-Bolsonaro rallies at a time when the president is facing increasing pressure over his handling of the pandemic, which has killed more than 15,000 Brazilians.\n\n\"We hope to be free of this question soon, for the good of all of us,\" Bolsonaro told the crowd in Brasilia. \"Brazil will come back stronger.\"\n\nBolsonaro later invited a group of about 20 paratroopers, who were taking part in the protest, to join him on the stoop of the presidential office. The men, wearing camouflage trousers, black Bolsonaro T-shirts and red berets, swore allegiance to the president and his family, stretching their right arms, before some joined him in a series of push-ups.\n\nSupporters have gathered daily at the presidential residence, with larger crowds turning out on weekends.\n\nSome display banners denouncing Congress and the Supreme Court, which they believe are part of a plot to derail Bolsonaro's presidency.\n\nNEW YORK -- New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo got tested for coronavirus on live TV Sunday as he announced all people in the state experiencing flu-like symptoms are now eligible for tests.\n\nAny New Yorkers experiencing flu-like symptoms or those who will be returning to work as part of phased reopenings across the state can now get tested, Cuomo said.\n\nThe state is expanding eligibility as it deals with a surplus of testing capacity. Cuomo said drive-thru and walk-in testing sites are performing about one-third of the 15,000 tests they're capable of each day.\n\nIn all, the state is testing about 40,000 people per day.\n\nAn agreement with CVS will allow samples to be collected at more than 60 pharmacies across the state, Cuomo said. Testing in New York City is being expanded to 123 CityMD walk-in clinics.\n\nNew York Mayor Bill de Blasio also made an urgent appeal Sunday for blood donations, saying coronavirus-related blood drive cancellations have led supplies to dwindle to about two days' worth, which could mean postponing some surgeries.\n\nWASHINGTON -- One of President Donald Trump's top economic advisers is criticizing the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's early response to the coronavirus outbreak, saying it \"let the country down\" after initial delays with testing.\n\nWhite House trade adviser Peter Navarro declined to say when asked Sunday on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" whether Trump had confidence in the CDC to lead the U.S. pandemic response, saying that was a question for the president.\n\nBut Navarro says the CDC \"set us back\" in the early weeks of the outbreak.\n\nCDC struggled to develop its own diagnostic test for the coronavirus in January, later discovering problems in its kits sent to state and county public health labs in early February.\n\nIt took the CDC more than two weeks to come up with a fix, leading to delays in diagnoses as the virus rapidly spread.\n\nHealth and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar on Sunday said he disagreed the CDC had let the nation down. He told CBS' \"Face the Nation\": \"I believe the CDC serves an important public health role.\"\n\nFollow AP news coverage of the coronavirus pandemic at https://apnews.com/VirusOutbreak and https://apnews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak",

        "body": "The Latest on the coronavirus pandemic. The new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms for most people. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness or death.\n\nTOP OF THE HOUR:\n\n-- India's trains get ready to roll again amid steep rise in infections.\n\n-- New Zealand set to re-open economy and schools over next 10 days.\n\n-- 1918 flu survivor battling COVID-19.\n\n-- Shanghai Disneyland reopens with anti-virus controls.\n\n-- China reports 17 new coronavirus cases, South Korea 35.\n\nNEW DELHI, India -- India's train network, one of the world's largest, will gradually restart operations on Tuesday as the country eases its coronavirus lockdown amid a steep rise in infections.\n\nThe country reported 4,213 new COVID-19 cases over the past 24 hours, its biggest single-day spike. India has had more than 67,000 cases, including 2,206 deaths.\n\nThe rise in infections comes on a day when Prime Minister Narendra Modi will meet various state heads to discuss the country's lockdown exit strategy.\n\nIndia's train network, closed in late March when a strict nationwide lockdown was implemented, will be the first mode of transport to resume in the country of 1.3 billion people.\n\nPassengers would have to wear masks and undergo health screenings before being permitted to board, the railway ministry has said. Only asymptomatic passengers will be allowed on trains, which will make fewer stops than usual.\n\nThe announcement comes after the government arranged for trains to transport thousands of migrant workers stranded in Indian cities back to their homes.\n\nThe railway system is often described as India's lifeline, transporting 23 million people across the vast subcontinent each day, some 8.4 billion passengers each year.\n\nIndia's 54-day coronavirus lockdown is expected to end on May 17.\n\nWELLINGTON, New Zealand -- New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern on Monday announced a plan to re-open the economy and the nation's schools over the next 10 days.\n\nLife is expected to resemble what it was like before the coronavirus outbreak in many respects, although social distancing rules will still apply, and social gatherings will be limited to 10 people at events like weddings and funerals. The nation's borders will also remain closed.\n\nUnder the plan, almost all businesses will be able to re-open beginning Thursday, including retail stores, malls, restaurants, hair salons and gyms. People will also be able to take flights around the country. Schools will then re-open starting next Monday. Bars will be the last businesses allowed to reopen, on May 21.\n\nArdern said bars pose a high risk: \"We don't want to be South Korea -- to open our bars only to close them again,\" she said.\n\nNew Zealand has been successful in reducing new cases of the virus to a trickle, including two days last week when no new cases were recorded. In total, the country has reported close to 1,500 cases and 21 deaths.\n\nArdern said New Zealanders need to remain cautious: \"We may have won a few battles but we have not won the war,\" she said.\n\nGALLUP, N.M. -- A 105-year-old New Mexico woman who beat back the 1918 flu that killed millions, including her mother and infant sister, is battling COVID-19.\n\nThe Gallup Independent reports Lubica \"Luby\" Grenko, who will turn 106 in August, has been fighting the new coronavirus since being diagnosed April 29 at the Little Sisters of the Poor in Gallup, New Mexico.\n\nGrenko was born when World War I began and survived the 1918 flu before enduring the Great Depression and World War II.\n\nThe flu took the lives of her mother, Marijeta Kauzlaric, 28, and younger sister, Annie Kauzlaric, 1 month old.\n\nGrenko's granddaughter, Misty Tolson, says her grandmother remembers her mother going into the hospital and never coming out.\n\nTolson says she doesn't think her grandmother understands the current virus because she told one of the aides who walked in with protective gear on, \"What the heck do you have on?\"\n\nSHANGHAI -- Visitors wearing face masks streamed into Shanghai Disneyland as China's most prominent theme park reopened Monday in a new step toward rolling back anti-coronavirus controls that shut down its economy.\n\nThe park, which closed Jan. 25, will limit visitors and is keeping some attractions closed in line with social distancing guidelines. Disney guests, many wearing Mickey Mouse ears, and children dressed as movie characters were checked for fevers at the gate, and decals were used to designate a safe distance between visitors.\n\nChina, where the pandemic began in December, was the first economy to shut down and the first to reopen in early March. Factories and shops have reopened but cinemas, karaoke parlors, gyms and other businesses remain closed.\n\nBEIJING -- China reported another rise in coronavirus cases Monday, amid government reminders for people to \"remain alert and step up personal protection against the virus.\"\n\nThe warning from Mi Feng, spokesperson for the National Health Commission, came as 17 new cases were reported, up from 14 the day before, which had represented the first double-digit increase in 10 days. Of the 17 new cases, seven were listed as imported, while five were in the city of Wuhan, where a strict lockdown was lifted last month.\n\nAt a Sunday news conference, Mi renewed calls for people to avoid social gatherings and to \"seek medical advice or testing in designated hospitals if they exhibit symptoms such as fever, cough or fatigue.\" Despite that, Beijing on Monday sent 82,000 third-year middle school students back to classes to prepare for their high school entrance exams.\n\nAlso on Monday, the National Health Commission said there had been no new COVID-19 deaths, extending that streak to almost a month, and 141 people remained hospitalized in treatment. Another 783 people were under isolation and observation for being suspected cases or for having tested positive without showing any symptoms.\n\nChina has reported 4,633 deaths from the virus among 82,918 cases.\n\nSEOUL, South Korea -- South Korea has reported 35 additional coronavirus cases over the past 24 hours, the second day in a row its daily jump was above 30.\n\nThe figures released Monday by the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention pushed the country's total to 10,909 cases with 256 deaths. The agency says 9,632 people have recovered and been released from quarantine.\n\nThe center says 29 of the 35 new cases were locally transmitted, while six came from overseas.\n\nWorries about a second wave of virus infections are growing in South Korea after dozens of new cases linked to nightclubs in Seoul's Itaewon entertainment district have been confirmed in recent days. South Korea on Sunday reported 34 additional cases, 24 associated with the Itaewon clubs.\n\nAuthorities in the Seoul metropolitan area subsequently ordered the temporary closing of clubs, discos and other nightlife establishments to guard against a possible new surge in virus outbreaks.\n\nSouth Korean health authorities and police are combing through credit-card and mobile-phone records and security camera footage to track thousands of people who visited the popular entertainment district in recent weeks.\n\nThe slew of transmissions in the densely populated Seoul metropolitan area, where about half of South Korea's 51 million people live, have been a rude awakening to a country that had eased up on social distancing and could force officials to push back the reopening of schools.\n\nSeoul Mayor Park Won-soon said in a virus briefing Monday that 85 infections nationwide, including 51 cases in the capital, have so far been linked to people who went to clubs in the Itaewon district in recent weeks while the government was relaxing its social distancing guidelines.\n\nHealth workers have been attempting to contact some 5,500 people who visited clubs and other nightspots in Itaewon between April 24 and May 6, but more than 3,110 have been out of contact, Park said. He said every one of them should get tested regardless of whether they are exhibiting symptoms, and those who refuse to do so could face a 2 million won ($1,640) fine.\n\nWASHINGTON -- Sen. Lamar Alexander will not return to Washington this week and will self-quarantine in his home state of Tennessee after a member of his staff tested positive for COVID-19.\n\nThe Republican senator will be working remotely and will chair the Senate health committee hearing on Tuesday morning by video conference. Witnesses will include Dr. Anthony Fauci, Dr. Robert Redfield, Dr. Brett Giroir and Dr. Stephen Hahn, according to Alexander Chief of Staff David Cleary.\n\nFauci, Redfield and Hahn have also self-quarantined after exposure to an infected staffer. The witnesses will testify from remote locations as well.\n\nCleary said the staff member tested positive Sunday and is home recovering, and doing well. Alexander consulted with his physician and decided not to go back to Washington. He will self-quarantine for 14 days \"out of an abundance of caution.\"\n\nCleary said almost all of the senator's Washington staff are working from home, and there is no need for any other staff member to self-quarantine.\n\nWASHINGTON -- Vice President Mike Pence is self-isolating after an aide tested positive for the coronavirus last week.\n\nAn administration official says Pence is voluntarily limiting his exposure. He has repeatedly tested negative for COVID-19 since his exposure but is following the advice of medical officials.\n\nPence's move comes after three members of the White House's coronavirus task force placed themselves in quarantine after coming into contact with the aide, Pence spokeswoman Katie Miller.\n\nPence was informed of the positive test Friday morning before he left Washington for a day trip to Iowa.\n\n\"Vice President Pence will continue to follow the advice of the White House Medical Unit and is not in quarantine,\" said Pence spokesperson Devin O'Malley.\n\n\"Additionally, Vice President Pence has tested negative every single day and plans to be at the White House tomorrow.\"\n\nLONDON -- U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced a modest easing of the country's coronavirus lockdown Sunday and outlined his government's road map for further lifting restrictions in the coming months.\n\nIn a televised address to the nation, Johnson said people in Britain who can't work from home, such as those in construction or manufacturing jobs, \"should be actively encouraged to go to work\" this week.\n\nHe said that starting Wednesday, a restriction limiting outdoor exercise to once a day will be lifted and that people will be able to take \"unlimited amounts.\"\n\nThe prime minister, who spent a week in the hospital receiving treatment for COVID-19, stressed that social distancing guidelines still will have to be observed and said it would be \"madness\" to allow a second spike in infections.\n\nJohnson also laid out a \"conditional plan\" for relaxing other lockdown restrictions in the coming months, including the possible return to school for some younger children on June 1. He said he hopes some of the hospitality industry can reopen a month later.\n\nBERLIN -- The World Health Organization has dismissed as \"false allegations\" a media report that it withheld information about the new coronavirus following pressure from China.\n\nThe U.N. agency said in a statement late Saturday that a German magazine's report about a telephone conversation between WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus and Chinese President Xi Jinping on Jan. 21 was \"unfounded and untrue.\"\n\nWeekly Der Spiegel reported that Xi asked Tedros during the call to hold back information about human-to-human transmission of the virus and delay declaring a pandemic. The magazine quoted Germany's foreign intelligence agency, BND, which declined to comment Sunday.\n\nDer Spiegel also claimed that the BND concluded up to six weeks of time to fight the outbreak had been lost due to China's information policy.\n\nThe U.N. agency said Tedros and Xi \"have never spoken by phone\" and added that \"such inaccurate reports distract and detract from WHO's and the world's efforts to end the COVID-19 pandemic.\"\n\nIt said that China confirmed human-to-human transmission of the new coronavirus on Jan. 20.\n\nWHO officials issued a statement two days later saying there was evidence of human-to-human transmission in Wuhan, but more investigation was necessary. The global body declared COVID-19 a pandemic on Feb. 11.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump has been among the strongest critics of WHO's handling of the pandemic, accusing it of deference to China and ceasing payments to the agency.\n\nROME -- Italy has registered its lowest total of daily new COVID-19 cases since the start of the nationwide lockdown in early March.\n\nAccording to Health Ministry data, 802 coronavirus infections were confirmed in the 24-hour period ending Sunday evening.\n\nThat's also the first time daily new cases have dropped below 1,000 since very early in the country's outbreak. Italy now totals 219,070 known cases.\n\nThere were 165 deaths because of the virus since Saturday evening, raising the number of known deaths of infected patients to 30,560.\n\nAuthorities say the real total is surely much higher, as deaths at home or nursing care facilities or personal residences aren't counted if COVID-19 testing isn't done, although many of those deceased may well have had the illness.\n\nHelping to account for such a lower daily new case total was Lombardy, Italy's most stricken region. That northern region registered 282 infections in the 24-hour period. In recent days it had registered several hundred fresh cases daily.\n\nNEW YORK -- New York nursing homes must start twice-weekly coronavirus testing for all staffers and will no longer be sent COVID-19 patients leaving hospitals, Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced after facing growing criticism over the handling of nursing facility outbreaks.\n\nOf the nation's more than 26,000 coronavirus deaths in nursing homes and long-term care facilities, a fifth of them -- about 5,300 -- are in New York, according to a count by The Associated Press.\n\nThat's the highest number of nursing home deaths in the country, though other states have also struggled to control the virus in nursing facilities.\n\nNew York nursing home residents' relatives, health care watchdogs and lawmakers have said the state didn't focus enough on the threat and then the devastating reality of COVID-19 in nursing homes.\n\nCritics have faulted the state for taking weeks to release the number of deaths in individual nursing homes -- and still not releasing the number of cases -- and for not conducting or requiring widespread testing in the facilities.\n\nSEATTLE -- All passengers traveling through Seattle-Tacoma International Airport will be required to wear cloth face coverings beginning May 18 to slow the spread of the coronavirus.\n\nThe requirement also applies to airport workers, including Port of Seattle employees, and visitors who aren't flying, according to The Seattle Times.\n\nThe move announced by the Port of Seattle on Saturday night exempts people who can't tolerate facial coverings for medical reasons, as well as very young children.\n\nIt's not yet clear how the Port of Seattle will enforce the requirement, but port spokesman Peter McGraw said the policy will be refined in the coming week.\n\nSeveral major airlines and some airports also are requiring passengers to wear masks. Philadelphia International Airport and Los Angeles International Airport will require all passengers and visitors to wear masks starting Monday. Denver International Airport started requiring all passengers to wear face coverings this past week.\n\nSome carriers, including Seattle-based Alaska Airlines, require passengers to wear face coverings when they are on the plane.\n\nThe Transportation Security Administration now requires workers at screening checkpoints to wear masks. At Sea-Tac, seven TSA employees have tested positive for the coronavirus.\n\nFollow AP news coverage of the coronavirus pandemic at https://apnews.com/VirusOutbreak and https://apnews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak.",

More than 31,000 people have died, leaving Italy with the highest death toll after the United States and Britain. But the government led by Premier Giuseppe Conte has gradually reopened the country as the rates of infections and deaths have fallen.\n\nSocial distancing rules are being implemented in the sectors of the economy that have reopened, including factories and some businesses. Schools remain closed and crowds are not permitted, though people will be allowed to attend Mass in churches with some restrictions starting next week.\n\nNEW DELHI -- India's coronavirus infection cases have surpassed China's with the health ministry on Saturday reporting the spike to 85,940 cases with 2,752 deaths.\n\nIn total, China has reported 4,633 deaths among 82,933 cases since the virus was first detected late last year in the central city of Wuhan.\n\nThe worst hit Indian states are Maharashtra with 29,100 cases, Tamil Nadu 10,108, Gujarat 9,931 and New Delhi 8,895.\n\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi's government is due to announce this weekend a decision whether to extend the 54-day-old lockdown. Early this month, it started gradually easing the restrictions to resume economic activity by allowing neighborhood shops to reopen and manufacturing and farming to resume. It also has resumed a limited train service across the country to help stranded migrant workers, students and tourists.\n\nFollow AP news coverage of the coronavirus pandemic at https://apnews.com/VirusOutbreak and https://apnews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak.",

        "body": "The Latest on the coronavirus pandemic. The new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms for most people. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness or death.\n\nTOP OF THE HOUR:\n\n-- Japanese task force OKs end to state of emergency in 47 prefectures.\n\n-- Typhoon Vongfong bears down on Philippines during lockdown for coronavirus.\n\n-- United Nations chief calls for mental health needs to be addressed amid pandemic.\n\n-- Australia to continue to push for origin of coronavirus.\n\nTOKYO -- Experts on the Japanese coronavirus task force approved a government plan Thursday lifting an ongoing state of emergency ahead of schedule in most areas, except for Tokyo and several other high-risk areas.\n\nEconomy Minister Yasutoshi Nishimura, after attending the task force meeting, said the experts approved a plan to lift the state of emergency in 39 of the country's 47 prefectures, while keeping the measure in place for eight others, including Tokyo, Osaka, Kyoto and Hokkaido, where risks still remain high.\n\nPrime Minister Shinzo Abe declared a month-long state of emergency on April 7 in Tokyo and six other urban prefectures and later expanded it to the whole country through May 31. With signs of the infections slowing, Abe is seeking to relax the measure while balancing disease prevention and the economy. Japan now has more than 16,000 confirmed cases, with about 680 deaths. The number of new cases has significantly decreased nationwide.\n\nAbe is expected to explain details later Thursday. Experts are also expected to provide basis for easing the measure, as well as its possible tightening in case of a resurgence of the outbreak.\n\nThe Ehime prefecture in western Japan, which was hit by an in-hospital outbreak of about 20 nurses, patients and their families a day earlier, will have the state of emergency lifted on the condition containment measures are taken and the infections are closely investigated, Nishimura said.\n\nExperts and officials have urged people to adopt \"new lifestyles\" and continue practicing distancing measures such as remote working and avoid out-of-town trips, even after the state of emergency is lifted.\n\nMANILA, Philippines -- A strong typhoon roared toward the Philippines as authorities work to evacuate tens of thousands of people while avoiding overcrowding in emergency shelters that could spread the coronavirus.\n\nThe first typhoon to hit the country this year is expected to slam ashore on eastern islands later Thursday.\n\nTyphoon Vongfong has maximum sustained winds of 150 kph (93 mph) and gusts of up to 185 kph (115 mph).\n\nThe Philippines remains under a lockdown to fight the coronavirus.\n\nGovernors say social distancing will be nearly impossible for residents staying in emergency shelters. Some shelters are now serving as quarantine facilities, and they may have to be turned back into emergency storm shelters.\n\nUNITED NATIONS -- United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres is urging governments, civil society and health authorities to urgently address mental health needs arising from the coronavirus pandemic, warning that psychological suffering is increasing.\n\nHe pointed to \"grief at the loss of loved ones, shock at the loss of jobs, isolation and restrictions on movement, difficult family dynamics, and uncertainty and fear for the future.\"\n\nThe U.N. chief said in a video message late Wednesday launching a policy briefing that \"after decades of neglect and under-investment in mental health services, the COVID-19 pandemic is now hitting families and communities with additional mental stress.\"\n\nGuterres said those most at risk and in need of help are front-line health care workers, older people, adolescents, young people, those with pre-existing mental health conditions, and those caught up in conflict and crisis.\n\nHe said \"mental health services are an essential part of all government responses to COVID-19\" and must be expanded and fully funded.\n\nCANBERRA, Australia -- Australia says it will continue to push for an inquiry into the origins of the coronavirus, even if it hurts trade relations with China.\n\nPrime Minister Scott Morrison had been accused of playing \"deputy sheriff\" to the United States after calling for the inquiry. On Thursday, he brushed off the criticism.\n\n\"We have always been independent, we have always pursued our national interests, and we always will,\" he told reporters. \"We will always be Australians in how we engage with the rest of the world, and we will always stand our ground when it comes to the things that we believe in and the values that we uphold.\"\n\nChina has suspended beef imports from four abattoirs and plans to impose tariffs on Australian barley, after warning the inquiry could harm two-way trade ties.\n\nBEIJING -- China reported three new coronavirus cases Thursday while moving to reopen for business and schools.\n\nThe National Health Commission said 101 people remain in treatment for COVID-19, while 716 are isolated and being monitored for being suspected cases or for having tested positive for the virus without showing symptoms.\n\nChina plans to restart classes for most students on June 1, with other grades to resume at a later date, depending on conditions. No announcement has been made on when university classes will resume.\n\nChina has reported a total of 4,633 deaths among 82,929 cases of the virus.\n\nFollow AP news coverage of the coronavirus pandemic at https://apnews.com/VirusOutbreak and https://apnews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak.",

        "body": "The Latest on the coronavirus pandemic. The new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms for most people. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness or death.\n\nTOP OF THE HOUR:\n\n-- Japan considers attending G-7 summit if it is rescheduled by Trump, host nation U.S.\n\n-- Japan approves lifting state of emergency in three prefectures.\n\n-- Wuhan issues ban on the hunting, breeding and human consumption of wild animals.\n\nTOKYO -- Japan's top government spokesman said Thursday that the country is considering attending the Group of Seven summit meeting, if the U.S. reschedules the canceled gathering.\n\nChief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga was responding to a question about President Donald Trump's tweet Wednesday that he is considering rescheduling the canceled G-7 meeting with world leaders in the U.S., because it would be a \"great sign to all\" of things returning to normal during the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nTrump had scheduled the G-7 summit for June 10-12 at Camp David, the presidential retreat in Maryland. The summit was canceled it in March because of the pandemic, and Trump said the leaders would confer by video conference.\n\nSuga said Thursday that he interpreted Trump's tweet as \"an expression of the President's intention to normalize the global economy quickly.\"\n\nHe said his understanding is that details such as the dates and format of the meeting are still being studied by the U.S. as host nation.\n\nSuga said Tokyo and Washington are in discussion, but declined to comment further.\n\nJapan is still partially under a coronavirus state of emergency. Abe plans to announce lifting of the measure in three of the remaining eight prefectures later Thursday, while keeping it in place in Tokyo and four other areas.\n\nTOKYO -- Japan's economy minister says experts have approved a government plan to remove a coronavirus state of emergency in Osaka and two neighboring prefectures in the west where the infection is deemed slowing, while keeping the measure in place in the Tokyo region and Hokkaido.\n\nEconomy Minister Yasutoshi Nishimura told reporters that experts at the meeting approved the plan to lift the measure in Osaka, Kyoto and Hyogo.\n\nThe measure will be kept in place in Tokyo and three neighboring prefectures, as well as Hokkaido, where the infections have slowed but need further improvement.\n\nThe three are among the eight prefectures still under the emergency status after Prime Minister Shinzo Abe lifted the measure last week in all but eight of the 47 Japanese prefectures. Abe declared the state of emergency on April 7 in parts of Japan including Tokyo and later expanded it to nationwide.\n\nUnder Japan's state of emergency, which does not enforce lockdowns, many people have followed the social distancing requests but others had to continue commuting, while a sizeable minority continued to dine out or picnicked at parks. More stores, restaurants and bars have started to reopen recently, under new anti-infection guidelines.\n\nAbe will formally announce the plan later Thursday after approval by parliamentary committees.\n\nBEIJING -- The central Chinese city of Wuhan, where the global coronavirus pandemic is believed to have originated, has issued a total ban on the hunting, breeding and human consumption of wild animals.\n\nThe move is in an apparent response to research showing the virus most likely originated among bats and was transmitted to people via an intermediary wild species sold for food at a market in the city.\n\nThe regulation issued Wednesday seeks to carry out measures passed at the national level covering protected land animals as well as sea life, promising financial relief to help dealers move into other lines of business.\n\nHowever, it contains numerous exceptions, including for animals used for traditional Chinese medicine, as long as they are not consumed as food for humans. That left it unclear whether the ban would cover pangolins, small mammals whose scales are used for traditional Chinese medicine but which are thought to have been the intermediary carrier of the virus.\n\nThe regulation will be enforced immediately and will be in effect for five years.\n\nFollow AP news coverage of the coronavirus pandemic at https://apnews.com/VirusOutbreak and https://apnews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak",

For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness or death.\n\nTOP OF THE HOUR:\n\n-- Japan, U.S. agree to cooperate closely in COVID-19 fight.\n\n-- U.N. chief calls for end to virus hate speech.\n\n-- South Korea infections linked to Seoul nightclubs.\n\n-- EU promises Pakistan 150 million euros ($163 million) to fight COVID-19.\n\nTOKYO -- Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and U.S. President Donald Trump have agreed to cooperate closely in developing COVID-19 vaccines and drugs, and in their efforts to boost their economies.\n\nThe two leaders held telephone talks as they seek to reopen businesses in their respective countries.\n\nJapan's Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga told reporters the leaders exchanged views on the COVID-19 situation, measures to prevent further spread of the virus, development of drugs and vaccines, and steps for reopening the economies in their countries. He said Abe proposed the talks.\n\n\"It was extremely meaningful to be able to reassure Japan-U.S. cooperation via telephone talks between the two leaders just as the international society is expected to unite and tackle the (pandemic),\" Suga said.\n\nThe Japanese health ministry, in a rare fast-track process, approved Gilead Sciences Inc.'s antiviral drug remdesivir on Thursday to treat COVID-19 patients. The approval was granted under a special fast-track process only four days after the company filed an application.\n\nJapan is still under a coronavirus state of emergency, which was extended this week until the end of May, though there have been no hard lockdowns.\n\nThe United States has more than 1.2 million reported infections, with deaths exceeding 75,000, while Japan has about 15,500 cases and 580 deaths.\n\nUNITED NATIONS -- United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres says the coronavirus pandemic keeps unleashing \"a tsunami of hate and xenophobia, scapegoating and scare-mongering.\"\n\nThe U.N. chief said Friday that \"anti-foreigner sentiment has surged online and in the streets, anti-Semitic conspiracy theories have spread, and COVID-19-related anti-Muslim attacks have occurred.\"\n\nGuterres said migrants and refugees \"have been vilified as a source of the virus -- and then denied access to medical treatment.\"\n\n\"With older persons among the most vulnerable, contemptible memes have emerged suggesting they are also the most expendable,\" he said. \"And journalists, whistleblowers, health professionals, aid workers and human rights defenders are being targeted simply for doing their jobs.\"\n\nGuterres appealed \"for an all-out effort to end hate speech globally.\"\n\nThe secretary-general called on political leaders to show solidarity with all people, on educational institutions to focus on \"digital literacy\" at a time when \"extremists are seeking to prey on captive and potentially despairing audiences.\"\n\nHe called on the media, especially social media, to \"remove racist, misogynist and other harmful content,\" on civil society to strengthen their outreach to vulnerable people, and on religious figures to serve as \"models of mutual respect.\"\n\nCANBERRA, Australia -- Australia plans to reopen its economy in three stages by July, but there are no plans to open the country to general international travelers in the foreseeable future.\n\nPrime Minister Scott Morrison said Friday the states will set their own pace in easing coronavirus restrictions, and details of the second and third stages of the plan had yet to be finalized.\n\nAustralia's two most populous states, New South Wales and Victoria, are continuing to record new cases daily while the other states and territories have gone multiple days without finding new infections despite ramped up testing.\n\nQueensland will relax its social distancing rules for Mother's Day on Sunday by allowing up to five people from one household to visit another household, and the Northern Territory will open pubs next week for the service of alcohol with meals.\n\nUnder stage one of a national plan agreed upon by federal and state leaders on Friday, small cafes and restaurants will open as long as each patron has at least 4 square meters (43 square feet) of space.\n\nChildren will return to classrooms and groups of 10 people will be allowed to gather outdoors. Playgrounds, golf courses, swimming pools and libraries will reopen.\n\nNightclubs and other drinking venues without seated dining will not reopen until stage 3.\n\nMorrison said he was open to the possibility of international students returning to Australian universities on charter flights, but general international travel will not open up \"in the foreseeable future.\"\n\nSEOUL, South Korea -- South Korean officials are concerned after finding more than a dozen coronavirus infections linked to clubgoers in the densely populated Seoul metropolitan area.\n\nThe new infections raised fears about another surge in transmissions after the country had eased social distancing measures amid a slowing caseload the past few weeks.\n\nSouth Korea's Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported 12 new cases of COVID-19 in the 24 hours before midnight Thursday, the first time in five days the daily jump was more than 10.\n\nVice Health Minister Kim Gang-lip said the country detected at least 13 more cases in the following hours, all linked to a 29-year-old patient who visited three nightclubs in Seoul's Itaewon district Saturday before testing positive on Wednesday.\n\nKim said there was a \"very high possibility\" more infections will be confirmed as health workers scramble to trace the patient's contacts. He said the clubs' visitor lists show more than 1,500 customers combined on Saturday.\n\nOf the 13 new cases confirmed on Friday, Kim says 12 were clubgoers, including three foreign nationals and one soldier. The other was an office colleague of the patient who was first detected.\n\n\"A drop of ink in clear water spreads swiftly,\" Kim said during a briefing, urging vigilance to maintain hard-won gains against the virus. \"Anyone can become that drop of ink that spreads COVID-19.\"\n\nThe country has not reported a daily jump above 100 since April 1, which allowed officials to ease social distancing guidelines, schedule the re-opening of schools and allow professional sports to return to action without fans in the stands.\n\nISLAMABAD -- The European Union promised Pakistan 150 million euros ($163 million) to fight the spread of COVID-19 as the country's daily infection rate continues to climb steadily along with its death rate.\n\nPakistan recorded another daily high Friday with 1,574 new cases in the last 24 hours, bringing the total number of infections nationwide to 25,837 -- one of the highest rates in the region after Iran, which has reported more than 103,000.\n\nPakistan, with a population of 220 million people, has suffered 594 deaths due to COVID-19. Despite the climbing figures, Prime Minister Imran Khan has said the country will ease its lockdown beginning Saturday. Shops will be allowed to open for five days a week but social distancing will be enforced -- although that has proven nearly impossible in the teeming markets of Karachi in the south with 14 million people and Lahore in the east with 8 million.\n\nKhan has also refused to close mosques during the Islamic fasting month of Ramadan, which will end later this month with the festival of Eid-ul Fitr.\n\nPakistan's chief immunologist and the man leading the government's COVID-19 battle, Dr. Rana Mohammad Safdar, told The Associated Press he expects cases to multiply significantly by the end of May.\n\nChina reported one new coronavirus case Friday and 16 additional positive tests for people not showing symptoms.\n\nNo new deaths were reported. There are 260 people who remain hospitalized because of the virus and 890 under isolation as suspected cases or after testing positive without showing symptoms.\n\nBEIJING -- The European Union delegation to China says it allowed a Chinese state newspaper to publish an op-ed even after it removed a reference to the Chinese origins and spread of the coronavirus.\n\nThe delegation said in a news release that it had been informed the foreign ministry would not allow the article to appear unless part of a sentence relating to what has become a hugely sensitive topic for China was removed.\n\n\"The EU Delegation to China made known its objections to the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs in no uncertain terms,\" the delegation said in a statement Friday.\n\nHowever, it said it decided to proceed with publication because the op-ed \"passed key messages on a number of our priority areas to a potential audience of more than 1 billion readers,\" including on climate change and sustainability, human rights, the importance of multilateralism and debt relief for highly indebted countries.\n\nOnly the English-language China Daily published the editorial, although the original agreement had also called for it to be published in the ruling Communist Party's Chinese-language flagship People's Daily.\n\nWhile the virus was first detected in the Chinese city of Wuhan late last year, China insists the true origins have yet to be determined and has angrily fired back at suggestions by U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and others that it escaped from a high-security lab in Wuhan.\n\nNEW YORK -- The Brooklyn district attorney's office released data late Thursday showing that of the 40 people arrested for social distancing violations in the New York City borough since mid-March, 35 were black and four were Hispanic. One was white.\n\nSome of the arrests were caught on video, including one from Monday in which an officer knocked a man to the ground with his arm in Brooklyn. Police said he took a \"fighting stance\" as officers wrestled his stepbrother against a squad car. Another video from Saturday shows an officer pulling a stun gun on a man and violently taking him to the ground.\n\nThe arrests stand in sharp contrast to photos and video tweeted by the NYPD showing friendly officers handing out face masks and gently reminding people to stay 6 feet apart.\n\nMayor Bill de Blasio, despite mounting pressure to stop using police to enforce social distancing and the data showing that such arrests disproportionately affect people of color, stood by the practice on Thursday, saying: \"We're not going to sideline the NYPD.\"\n\nPolice Commissioner Dermot Shea said the incidents should be evaluated on a case-by-case basis.\n\nSEOUL, South Korea -- North Korea says leader Kim Jong Un has sent a personal message to Chinese President Xi Jinping praising what he described as China's success in getting its coronavirus epidemic under control.\n\nThe report by North Korea's state media on Friday came amid outside observations that the pandemic is taking a toll on an economy already crippled by decades of policy failures and U.S.-led international sanctions over its nuclear weapons program.\n\nChina is seen as North Korea's most significant ally and economic lifeline, accounting for about 90% of the country's external trade. With China's COVID-19 caseload easing, some experts say the North could reach out to China to reinvigorate cross-border trade that had been significantly reduced in past months.\n\nThe Korean Central News Agency says Kim in the message to Xi \"congratulated him, highly appreciating that he is seizing a chance of victory in the war against the unprecedented epidemic.\" It did not specify when the message was sent.\n\nSouth Korea's spy agency recently told lawmakers in a closed-door briefing that trade volume between North Korea and China in the first quarter declined 55% from a year earlier. In March, the bilateral trade volume suffered a 91% drop, lawmakers cited the agency as saying.\n\nTOKYO -- The annual Tokyo Game Show, which highlights the latest video game software and machines, is moving online, organizers said Friday, to prevent the spread of the new coronavirus.\n\nDetails of the event will be disclosed starting in late May, Computer Entertainment Supplier's Association and other organizers said in a joint statement.\n\n\"We are making this decision out of concern for the health and safety of the visitors, exhibitors and other participants,\" the statement said.\n\nThe Tokyo Game Show was scheduled to be held in sprawling Makuhari Messe, outside Tokyo, from Sept. 24-27. In the past, Microsoft Corp. and Sony Corp., as well as game developers from around the world, set up about 2,000 booths that have drawn crowds of more than 250,000 people.\n\nWASHINGTON -- When the Great Smoky Mountains National Park becomes one of the country's first national parks to reopen Saturday, some of its most popular trails will remain off limits.\n\nMajor roadways, most trails and some restroom facilities will be accessible, but it's unclear when the Laurel Falls, Chimney Tops and Alum Cave trails will reopen, park spokeswoman Dana Soehn says. She says safety will be stressed as officials seek to follow federal and state guidelines to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.\n\n\"We think that access to the three most heavily used trails just simply wouldn't be possible with CDC social distancing guidelines,\" Soehn said.\n\nThe push to restore access to some of the country's most treasured spaces comes six weeks after the park abruptly shut its gates after visitors weren't following social distancing guidelines.\n\nLocated on the Tennessee-North Carolina border, the Great Smoky Mountains is the nation's most visited national park.\n\nJACKSON, Miss. -- Mississippi Republican Gov. Tate Reeves did a dramatic about-face Thursday, saying state legislators will have a role in deciding how to spend $1.25 billion the state is receiving from the federal government as part of a massive coronavirus relief package.\n\n\"They've assured me that they want what I want, which is to get this money to those people that need it,\" Reeves said at a news conference with Lt. Gov. Delbert Hosemann and House Speaker Philip Gunn. The fellow Republicans had challenged Reeves' assertion that the governor has the power to spend money without legislative consent during emergencies.\n\nThe majority-Republican state House and Senate met Friday and voted nearly unanimously to pass a bill that puts most of the money into funds that they control. They cited the Mississippi Constitution's provisions that say lawmakers have the power to spend money. Reeves harshly criticized Hosemann and Gunn during multiple public appearances in the past week, accusing legislators of a power grab. But Reeves said Thursday that he had invited them to the Governor's Mansion on Wednesday to make peace.\n\nCARSON CITY, Nev. -- Nevada will begin allowing restaurants, salons and other non-essential businesses to open starting Saturday.\n\nDemocratic Gov. Steve Sisolak says he's still encouraging people to get takeout or food delivery, but restaurants may open if they limit capacity to 50% and keep customers seated 6 feet apart. Salons and barbershops cannot except walk-in appointments and must keep customers spaced apart, while stores may reopen but must limit customers to 50% of the building's capacity.\n\nSisolak says casinos, nightclubs, spas and gyms must remain closed until further notice.\n\nLANSING, Mich. -- Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer says auto and other manufacturing workers can return to the job next week, further easing her stay-at-home order while extending it through May 28 because of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nManufacturers -- which account for 19% of the state's economy -- can resume operations on Monday. It is key for auto parts makers a week ahead of automakers' planned phased-in May 18 restart. Factories must adopt measures to protect their workers, including daily entry screening and, once they are available, the use of no-touch thermometers.\n\nOKLAHOMA CITY -- Authorities in Oklahoma say three McDonald's employees suffered gunshot wounds when a woman opened fire because she was angry that the restaurant's sit-down dining area was closed because of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nPolice Capt. Larry Withrow says a 16-year-old employee was shot in in the arm, another 16-year-old and an 18-year-old suffered shrapnel wounds while a second 18-year-old suffered a head injury.\n\nAll are expected to recover.\n\nWithrow said Gloricia Woody, 32, whose first name is spelled Glorica in jail records, was arrested for assault and battery with a deadly weapon.\n\nWoody entered the restaurant's lobby and was told the dining room was closed for safety reasons, Withrow said\n\n\"The suspect was forced out of the restaurant by employees. She reentered the restaurant with a handgun and fired approximately three rounds in the restaurant,\" Withrow said.\n\nThe shooting comes amid tensions over restrictions in efforts to curb the coronavirus pandemic that have escalated into violence elsewhere in the country.\n\nWASHINGTON -- U.S. officials say fewer illegal immigrants are trying to enter the country from Mexico amid new enforcement rules imposed in response to the coronavirus outbreak.\n\nActing U.S. Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Mark Morgan says agents are encountering about half the number of migrants along the southwest border than in the month before President Donald Trump authorized the rapid expulsion of migrants under a March 21 public health order.\n\nTotal encounters in April were about 16,700.\n\nThe public health order was initially renewed for 30 days and is scheduled to expire this month. But Morgan and Deputy Commissioner Robert Perez suggested Thursday that the public health restrictions may have to stay in place longer even as the U.S. starts to ease quarantine restrictions.\n\nMorgan also said border agents have encountered their first two migrants with confirmed cases of COVID-19. The first was from India and was captured near Calexico, California, on April 23. The second was a man from Mexico captured this week as he tried to enter the U.S. to seek medical attention for his illness.\n\nWASHINGTON -- A military member working in close proximity to President Donald Trump tested positive for the new coronavirus Wednesday. The White House says Trump and Vice President Mike Pence have since tested negative for the virus and \"remain in good health.\"\n\nSpokesman Hogan Gidley says in a statement the military member works \"on the White House campus\" and tested positive Wednesday. The White House instituted safety protocols nearly two months ago to protect the nation's political leaders, including frequent temperature checks. Last month it began administering rapid COVID-19 tests to all those near the president, with staffers being tested about once a week.\n\nFollow AP news coverage of the coronavirus pandemic at https://apnews.com/VirusOutbreak and https://apnews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak.",

For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness or death.\n\nTOP OF THE HOUR:\n\n-- President Trump heads to Phoenix to tour Honeywell plant.\n\n-- French President Macron criticized for opening schools next week.\n\n-- Britain's official coronavirus death toll becomes highest in Europe.\n\nMEXICO CITY -- Mexico has received a shipment of 211 medical ventilators from the United States as part of aid that U.S. President Donald Trump promised his Mexican counterpart.\n\n\"We want to very fully thank the government of the United States, especially President Trump,\" said Foreign Secretary Marcelo Ebrard. \"As the saying goes, when there are hard times is when you know who your friends are.\"\n\nMexican President And\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador said last month that Trump had promised aid when he called and asked for help in obtaining 1,000 ventilators and other equipment for intensive care units.\n\nEbrard said the shipment includes equipment made by Swiss-based Hamilton Medical at prices ranging from $16,000 to $24,000.\n\nHe said they would be sent to government hospitals.\n\nAs of midday Tuesday, Mexico had reported 24,905 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 2.271 deaths, though officials acknowledge that actual infections are a multiple of the tested figure.\n\nLONDON -- Britain's official coronavirus death total has passed Italy's number to become the highest in Europe.\n\nThe U.K. government says 29,427 people with COVID-19 have died in hospitals, nursing homes and other settings, an increase of 693 on the figure announced a day earlier. In Italy, 29,315 people confirmed to have the virus have died.\n\nThe toll is the second-highest in the world behind the United States.\n\nBoth the British and Italian tallies are probably underestimates because they do not included suspected cases. In the U.K. there have been 32,375 deaths in which COVID-19 was either confirmed or suspected.\n\nROME -- Italy has reported its lowest daily number of new COVID-19 cases since its lockdown began in early March.\n\nThe Italian health ministry registered 1,075 new cases, running the overall number of confirmed infections nationwide to 213,013, although experts note that many persons with no or mild symptoms never get tested. All but two of Italy's 20 regions had 100 or fewer new cases in the 24-hour period ending Tuesday evening.\n\nWhile the lower number of daily new cases is heartening, epidemiologists have warned that the daily numbers will be especially critical to watch in about two weeks, when it will be clearer if partially lifted lockdown rules, which went into effect on Monday, might see an uptick in infections.\n\nThe death toll rose to 29,315, with 236 more deaths of infected persons registered on Tuesday.\n\nNEW DELHI, India -- Health officials in India are rushing to contain the spread of the virus in the southern Indian city of Chennai in Tamil Nadu after a large cluster was discovered in one of the country's largest markets for fruits, vegetables and flowers.\n\nJ. Radhakrishnan, the nodal officer for COVID-19 in Chennai, tells The Associated Press that some 7,000 people connected to the busy Koyambedu market that remained open through India's nationwide lockdown were being traced and quarantined. Many of these people had returned to their homes in different districts in the region, he says.\n\nThe market is spread over 250 acres and has around 500 shops. It was shut on Monday after the viral cluster was detected.\n\nChennai now has 2,008 cases, with 545 cases detected in the past two days, and the city now accounts for half of the state's total 4,058 cases.\n\nATHENS, Greece -- Greek authorities have issued a public warning to coffee-bar owners who dodge lockdown restrictions by selling takeaway alcoholic drinks to customers who gather outside to drink them as the establishments play loud music.\n\nCivil Protection Agency chief Nikos Hardalias says the practice is forbidden and police will be on the lookout for offenders. Coffee shops can only sell takeaway coffee under current regulations.\n\nGreece has recorded 10 new coronavirus cases and no deaths. A total of 2,642 infections have been recorded and 146 deaths.\n\nBut the health ministry's spokesman for coronavirus matters, infectious diseases specialist Sotiris Tsiodras, noted Greece might have over-reported its own coronavirus deaths. Answering a question during his daily briefing, Tsiodras said Greece's death toll includes anyone who died and tested positive for the virus, regardless of whether their death might have been due to other, unrelated causes.\n\nMADRID -- Spain's Socialist-led government will ask parliament on Wednesday to extend the state of emergency another two weeks through May 24.\n\nBut the conservative Popular Party, the main opposition, is reluctant.\n\nPrime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez says extending the state of emergency \"is the only instrument that allows the government to limit mobility, in order to prevent contagion, save lives and protect citizens.\"\n\nHealth Minister Salvador Illa says the state of emergency, which has allowed the government to impose a lockdown, has been \"essential\" in reducing the daily infection rate from 35% to 0.4%.\n\nFinance Minister Maria Jesus Montero warned that economic measures to cushion the pandemic's blow are dependent on state of emergency legislation.\n\nIf the Popular Party votes against the extension, it could scuttle the government's pandemic plans. It may decide to abstain, in which case the government's request should win approval.\n\nHARTFORD, Conn. -- Gov. Ned Lamont ordered in-person classes at all Connecticut K-12 public schools to remain canceled for the rest of the current school year, requiring districts to continue distance learning.\n\nThe Democrat says schools must continue providing to-go meals to children under the school lunch and breakfast programs. Lamont says he's working with state and local education officials to determine whether summer school programs should be held.\n\nLamont says he was hoping high school seniors could complete the final few weeks, but it wasn't possible given the virus and the need to \"protect everyone's safety.\"\n\nThe state's largest teachers' union, the Connecticut Education Association, praised Lamont's decision.\n\nMASERU, Lesotho -- Lesotho, the only nation among Africa's 54 to not report a case of COVID-19, will lift its five-week lockdown on Wednesday.\n\nPrime Minister Tom Thabane says schools, churches and bars will open, with restrictions. Businesses will open but they must maintain social distancing and staff must work in shifts to reduce congestion. Churches can open but they must have less than 50 people per service. People will be expected to wear face masks in public.\n\nThabane says mass-testing will begin. The tiny mountain kingdom of Lesotho is surrounded by South Africa, which has Africa's highest number of confirmed cases at 7,220.\n\nSouth Africa slightly eased its strict lockdown this week to allow some mines, manufacturers and retailers to resume operations at up to 30% capacity. Rwanda and Nigeria also eased restrictions this week.\n\nWASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump says Americans should think of themselves as \"warriors\" in the fight against the new coronavirus.\n\nTrump spoke to reporters Tuesday before boarding Air Force One for a trip to Phoenix to tour a Honeywell plant that's making N95 respirator masks.\n\nTrump's trip is designed to give the appearance of a return to normalcy as states begin to reopen after shutting down in a bid to slow the spread of the virus.\n\nThe president has stayed close to the White House since mid-March, when he declared a national emergency over the outbreak. He traveled to Virginia at the end of March to see a Navy hospital shift off to New York, and he spent this past weekend at the Camp David presidential retreat in Maryland.\n\nTrump says: \"The people of our country should think of themselves as warriors. Our country has to open.\"\n\nLONDON -- Virgin Atlantic says it plans to cut 3,150 jobs and end its operation at London's Gatwick Airport.\n\nThe company says the job losses will be across the board and it will reduce the size of its fleet.\n\nVirgin is applying for emergency loans from the British government. The airline says recovery is expected to take up to three years.\n\nAlso, new car sales in the U.K. came to a near standstill in April, the lowest monthly level since 1946.\n\nFigures from the Society of Motor Manufacturers & Traders indicate only 4,321 cars were registered during the month, down 97% from the year before. Dealerships were closed and potential buyers have been in lockdown since March 23.\n\nALBANY, N.Y. -- New York state is reporting more than 1,700 previously undisclosed deaths at nursing homes and adult care facilities.\n\nAt least 4,813 people have died from COVID-19 in the state's nursing homes since March 1, according to a tally released by Gov. Andrew Cuomo's office late Monday. It includes, for the first time, people believed to have died from the coronavirus before it could be confirmed by a lab test.\n\nExactly how many nursing home residents have died remains uncertain despite the state's latest disclosure. The list doesn't include nursing home residents who were transferred to hospitals before dying.\n\nBEIRUT -- Dozens of Lebanese returned home from Syria after authorities briefly opened two border crossings nearly two months after they were closed.\n\nThe returnees were subjected to tests for the coronavirus and will stay in hotels for one day to wait for the results. Lebanon, which has reported 741 cases of coronavirus and 24 deaths, will extend the lockdown until May 24.\n\nInformation Minister Manal Abdul-Samad says the government has asked security forces to make sure the lockdown is enforced.\n\nShe also says Lebanon accepted a $750,000 donation from Google in the form of advertisements to raise knowledge about coronavirus.\n\nPARIS -- French President Emmanuel Macron confirmed plans to gradually reopen schools next week amid concerns from mayors, teachers and parents about the timing.\n\nMacron, wearing a mask, visited a primary school in a suburb west of Paris on Tuesday that has remained open for children of health workers.\n\nMore than 300 mayors in the capital region, including Paris mayor Anne Hidalgo, urged Macron in an open letter to delay the reopening of primary schools scheduled for next week.\n\nThey denounced an \"untenable and unrealistic timetable\" to meet the sanitary and safety conditions required by the state, including class sizes capped to a maximum of 15. The majority of French children attend public schools.\n\nMany parents say they won't send their children back to school as France is one of the world's hardest-hit countries by the coronavirus.\n\nFrance starts lifting confinement measures on May 11, with businesses to resume activity and parents to return to work.\n\nGENEVA -- The U.N. human rights office says conditions in many prisons in the Americas are \"deeply worrying\" as COVID-19 spreads in many overcrowded facilities that lack hygiene.\n\nRights office spokesman Rupert Colville says fear of contagion and lack of basic services like access to food and health care have stoked riots and protests in some prisons.\n\nHe pointed to outbreaks of deadly violence in detention centers in Colombia, Peru, and Venezuela in recent weeks, along with attempted prison breaks in Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Mexico and the United States.\n\nColville says the incidents suggest some states had not taken \"appropriate measures to prevent violence in detention facilities,\" urging states to investigate the deaths and injuries and any allegations of use of force by authorities during the rioting.\n\nCAIRO -- Yemen's health minister affiliated with the Houthi rebels has announced the first coronavirus death in the rebel-controlled northern part of the country.\n\nTaha al-Motawakel says a Somali migrant who died Sunday in a hotel in the capital Sanaa tested positive for the virus. He didn't provide details about other confirmed cases in areas under Houthi control.\n\nThe surfacing of the pandemic in Yemen has stoked fears that an outbreak could devastate its already crippled health care system.\n\nYemen's civil war erupted in 2014, when the rebels seized Sanaa, and much of the country's north. The U.S.-backed, Saudi-led coalition intervened to oust the rebels and restore the internationally recognized government. The conflict has killed more than 100,000 people and settled into a bloody stalemate.\n\nThe latest coronavirus death brings the total confirmed cases to 22 and three deaths across the country.\n\nATHENS, Greece -- Greece's prime minister says it appears \"absolutely feasible\" for restaurants and cafes to reopen on June 1 if the coronavirus outbreak keeps slowing.\n\nOn Monday, Greece reported two deaths and six confirmed infections, bringing the total death toll to 146, with confirmed infections at 2,632.\n\nGreece began easing its lockdown measures on Monday, with the opening of a limited number of retail businesses, such as beauty salons and bookshops, and people allowed to leave their homes.\n\nPrime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis held a video conference with several cabinet members Tuesday to discuss how to reopen the restaurant and caf\u00e9 sector while maintaining social distancing regulations. One possibility was increasing the outdoor space for tables and chairs.\n\nGreece imposed a lockdown early on in its coronavirus outbreak, a move credited with containing the number of deaths.\n\nLONDON -- Scotland's leader Nicola Sturgeon has outlined how lockdown restrictions could be relaxed while stressing the move is not imminent.\n\nSturgeon says Scotland was at a \"critical\" moment and the lockdown will be extended for another three-week period after the next review on Thursday.\n\nHowever, she says the first loosening considered by the government would be time spent outdoors. Other discussions relate to easing restrictions on community care services and businesses.\n\nShe says it's too early to reopen schools and they possibly won't reopen before the summer holidays.\n\nSturgeon says it's preferred all four nations of the U.K. -- England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland -- should move together on easing the lockdown.\n\nFollow AP news coverage of the coronavirus pandemic at https://apnews.com/VirusOutbreak and https://apnews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak.",

The new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms for most people. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness or death.\n\nTOP OF THE HOUR:\n\n-- More than 1 million Australians download coronavirus tracing app.\n\nCANBERRA, Australia -- Australian officials are pleased that more than 1 million people have downloaded an app designed to accelerate contact tracing for coronavirus despite some privacy concerns.\n\nWithin 12 hours of the Australian-developed COVIDsafe app becoming available late Sunday, 1.13 million of Australia's 26 million population had downloaded it onto their smart phones.\n\nChief Health Officer Damian Murphy said Monday he was \"really excited\" by the app's early popularity.\n\nGovernment officials intend to rush legislation through Parliament to outlaw use of collected data for purposes other than tracing people who might have COVID-19. Officials have also promised to release the app's source code within two weeks so that independent analysts can better understand how to works and its privacy implications.\n\nThe government says at least 40% of the Australian population needs to take up the technology based on Singapore's TraceTogether app for it to be effective.\n\nIf users of COVIDsafe are diagnosed with the virus, they can upload the app's encrypted data logs which identify other users who have been in close proximity for 15 minutes or more in the previous three week.\n\nThe government hopes the app will enable Australia to safely reopen the economy by enabling health officials to quickly identify and contain new outbreaks. Australia will resume non-urgent surgeries this week for the first time since March 27 as confidence grows that hospitals won't be overwhelmed by COVID-19 cases.\n\nAustralia has recorded 6,720 cases of the virus, 83 patients have died and 27 remained critically ill in hospitals on ventilators on Monday.\n\nTOKYO -- Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said Monday that his country is adding 14 more countries, including Russia, Peru and Saudi Arabia, to the entry ban list as the country steps up border control as the coronavirus infections continued to spread in the country.\n\nJapan has already banned entry from more than 70 other countries, banning foreigners with records of visiting those countries in the past two weeks, while invalidating visas for the rest of the world. The additional step on the 14 countries will take effect Wednesday, Abe said.\n\nThe entry ban and the visa restrictions, initially set to end on April 30, are extended until the end of May.\n\nJapan is now under a month-long state of emergency through May 6, for now. Officials and experts are now gauging its effect and whether to extend the measure.\n\nJapan has 13,385 confirmed cases, as well as 712 others from a cruise ship quarantined near Tokyo earlier this year, with 364 deaths, according to the health ministry.\n\nFollow AP news coverage of the coronavirus pandemic at https://apnews.com/VirusOutbreak and https://apnews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak",

Gen. Rhoderick Armamento said law enforcers found a Chinese patient in the seven-bed hospital and drug store during Tuesday's raid at a residential villa, which was illegally turned into a medical facility at the Clark Freeport and Special Economic Zone northwest of Manila.\n\nMore than 200 suspected Chinese-brand coronavirus rapid test kits and syringes, which have been used, were recovered in trash cans, he said.\n\n\"They have practiced medicine and prescribed drug without license,\" Armamento told The Associated Press by telephone Wednesday. \"The Chinese patients who were brought there may still be walking around in public and can infect other people.\"\n\nThe Chinese who have gone to the underground hospital may include the large numbers of workers in online gambling outfits in Clark, a former U.S. Air Force base turned into a commercial and leisure hub.\n\nPolice Lt. Gen. Guillermo Eleazar said the illegal hospital and drugstore can endanger patients instead of saving them because they do not conform with government health regulations and standards.\n\nThe Philippines has reported nearly 13,000 coronavirus infections, including 837 deaths, among the highest in Southeast Asia.\n\nUNITED NATIONS -- The United Nations secretary-general is warning that the coronavirus pandemic threatens Africa's progress and could push millions into extreme poverty.\n\nAntonio Guterres said in a video message Wednesday launching a policy briefing on \"The Impact of COVID-19 in Africa\" that countries on the continent have responded swiftly to the crisis, \"and as of now reported cases are lower than feared,\" with more than 2,500 deaths.\n\nBut the U.N. chief said \"much hangs in the balance,\" and he called for \"international action to strengthen Africa's health systems, maintain food supplies, avoid a financial crisis, support education, protect jobs, keep households and businesses afloat, and cushion the continent against lost income and export earnings.\"\n\nTo help address the devastating economic and social consequences of the pandemic, Guterres said Africa needs more than $200 billion and \"an across-the-board debt standstill for African countries.\"\n\nHe said in recent years economic growth in Africa has been strong, the digital revolution \"has taken hold\" and agreement has been reached on a free trade area.\n\nBut Guterres said \"already, demand for Africa's commodities, tourism and remittances are declining\" and \"the opening of the trade zone has been pushed back.\"\n\nAnd the secretary-general said the pandemic \"will aggravate long-standing inequalities and heighten hunger, malnutrition and vulnerability to disease.\"\n\nSINGAPORE -- Singapore, which has one of the highest infection rate in Asia, plans to exit a partial lockdown that ends June 1 in a controlled approach over three phases.\n\nOfficials say businesses that do not pose high risk of transmission can reopen from June 2 but some retail shops, personal services and dine-in restaurants will still be barred. Schools will reopen in phases and families can visit each other, but limited to one visit a day and not more than two guests in a household.\n\nThe city-state has reported 28,794 cases with 22 deaths. Most of the cases are linked to foreign workers, who remained locked down in their crowded dormitories. Earlier this month, the city-state allowed select businesses to open doors after infections dropped in the local community, away from the dorms.\n\nThe government said in a statement Tuesday that it expects infections to rise with the increased activity next month. If transmission remains low and stable, and the dorm situation under control, it said more activities will gradually resume including gyms, tuition centers and retail outlets in phase two.\n\nIt said all restrictions will eventually be eased in phase three but with strict health guidelines in a \"new normal\" until an effective vaccine for COVID-19 is developed.\n\nNEW DELHI -- In a major relief to tens of thousands migrant workers eager to return to their village homes from cities and towns, Indian Railways will be doubling the number of special trains for them and also run 200 new trains across the country from June 1.\n\nIndian Railways in a statement says that it has operated more than 1,600 trains for migrant workers and transported over 2.1 million of them to their home states in the past 19 days.\n\nPassengers are required to wear masks and undergo health screenings before being permitted to board. The return of these workers in huge numbers has raised fears of many of them carrying infections to their home states from cities and towns.\n\nThousands of workers have been crowding rail stations, bus stations and highways with their wives and children in blazing heat anxious to return to their homes. They say the they can resume farming and also take up jobs like building roads, water harvesting in drought-hit areas and construction of animal shelters under a government program that guarantees 100 days of employment a year in rural India for 200 rupees ($2.65) per person per day.\n\nThe Railways statement on Tuesday appealed to the migrants not to panic.\n\nThe number of coronavirus cases in India have surged past 100,000 with nearly 4,000 deaths. Almost 39,000 people have recovered from the illness. India's two-month-old lockdown has been extended until May-end.\n\nThe railway system is often described as India's lifeline, transporting 23 million people across the vast subcontinent each day, some 8.4 billion passengers eac\n\nANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) -- Alaska Gov. Mike Dunleavy is lifting restrictions put into place because of the coronavirus.\n\n\"It's time to get Alaska back on its feet,\" he said at a Tuesday evening news conference. \"Friday, we're open for business across the state of Alaska.\"\n\nLow case numbers and death totals in the nation's largest but sparsely populated state led Dunleavy, a first-term Republican facing a recall effort, to his decision. Alaska has had 399 COVID-19 cases and 10 deaths.\n\nAll businesses, including bars and gyms, will be allowed to reopen without restrictions or capacity limits, as will churches, libraries and museums. Recreational and sports activities will also be allowed to resume.\n\n\"It will all be open just like it was prior to the virus,\" he said.\n\nThere will be some guidelines in place, however. Alaskans will be advised to still practice social distancing, clean touch screens before use, stay home if sick and wear a face covering in public if near other people.\n\nVisitor restrictions remain in place for senior centers, prison and institutions. And organizers with large gatherings and festivals should consult with public health officials before scheduling the event. A 14-day mandatory quarantine for those arriving in Alaska remains in place until June 2.\n\nSEOUL, South Korea -- South Korean students have begun returning to schools as their country prepare for a new normal amid the coronavirus outbreak in the Asian country.\n\nWednesday's reopening of schools come as South Korea reported 32 new cases over a 24-hour period, the first time its daily jump has marked above 30 in nine days.\n\nHundreds of thousands of high school seniors in South Korea were allowed to go back to their schools earlier Wednesday. The education ministry says lower-level students are set to go back to schools in phased steps in coming weeks.\n\nStudents and teachers are required to have temperature checks before entering schools and wear masks at classrooms. The education ministry says some schools installed plastic partitions at each student's desk.\n\nSouth Korea's new school year was supposed to start in early March, but it had been delayed several times due to worries about the spread of the coronavirus. About 5.4 million students in South Korea have been subsequently taking classes online.\n\nSouth Korea relaxed much of its social distancing rules in early May. But it quickly saw a small but sudden spike in new infections linked to nightclubs in Seoul. Those latest outbreaks had been on a downward trend until Tuesday.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump has said he is considering barring entry to flights coming from Brazil due to the spread of COVID-19 in Latin America's hardest-hit country. It was the second time Trump has said he is studying such a measure.\n\n\"I don't want people coming in here and infecting our people. I don't want people over there sick either. We're helping Brazil with ventilators. We're sending them ventilators,\" Trump told reporters during a Cabinet meeting at the White House.\n\nHours later Brazil reported more than a thousand deaths from the disease for the first time in a 24-hour period. The health ministry's announcement of 1,179 deaths on Tuesday boosted the nation's death toll to 17,971. Brazil has 271,628 confirmed cases, the third most in the world after Russia and the U.S.\n\nBrazil's President Jair Bolsonaro, who like Trump has previously downplayed the disease and encouraged supporters to go back to work, neither responded to Trump's remarks nor commented on the record daily figure.\n\nAlso on Tuesday, the U.S. government announced it was offering Brazil $3 million to mitigate the impact of COVID-19. The Trump administration has already pledged $950,000 to Brazil in efforts against the pandemic. The resources will be used in 79 emergency centers for COVID-19, laboratories and in the health care system of 13 border cities.\n\nBEIJING -- China is continuing to combat a cluster of new coronavirus infections in its northeastern province of Jilin, with four out of five new cases reported Wednesday located in the region north of Beijing.\n\nAuthorities believe the outbreak may have begun among a group of family members and friends who gathered for dining and drinking without maintaining the social distancing regulations that have been increasingly relaxed nearly four months after they were imposed over much of the country.\n\nNo deaths were reported on Wednesday and just 87 people remained in treatment, while 375 others were under isolation and monitoring for being suspected cases or for having tested positive without showing symptoms.\n\nChina has recorded a total of 4,634 deaths from the virus among 82,965 cases.\n\nWASHINGTON -- The U.S. Department of Homeland Security says a public health order that imposes strict regulation of the country's borders has been extended.\n\nThe new order announced Tuesday by Acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf does not put a 30-day limit on the restrictions as before. It says instead that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will review the latest health data every 30 days to ensure the restrictions are still needed.\n\nHomeland Security officials had signaled in recent days that the order should be extended but that the decision would be up to health authorities. It had been scheduled to expire May 20.\n\nThe order enables U.S. Customs and Border Patrol to immediately expel anyone stopped trying to enter the country without authorization, including people seeking asylum. DHS officials say the COVID-19 pandemic makes it too dangerous to hold people in their detention facilities.\n\nImmigrant advocates say it deprives people of the legal right to seek asylum under international law.\n\nNEW ORLEANS -- Coronavirus fears closed a Louisiana Office of Motor Vehicles location near New Orleans the same morning that it reopened after a two-month pandemic closure.\n\nThe office in Harvey was notified that someone in the building might have been in contact with somebody who had COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, Deputy Commissioner Keith Neal said Tuesday.\n\nNeal said he did not know whether the notification was from a state Department of Health contact tracer. The health department reported Tuesday that more than 35,000 people have been diagnosed with the disease, 1,004 of them are hospitalized and 2,458 have died. About 26,200 are presumed recovered.\n\nHe said the office -- one of 11 that reopened statewide Monday after being closed since March 20 -- will be sanitized before reopening.\n\nSALEM, Ore. -- Oregon's unemployment rate soared to 14.2% in April, marking the deepest recession the state has experienced since it began keeping records in 1939.\n\nState officials say the numbers released Tuesday don't reflect the full effect of the economic downturn brought on by a statewide stay-at-home order and the closure of schools and most businesses.\n\nThe state lost 266,600 jobs in the first two months of the pandemic, going from a near-record-low unemployment rate of 3.5% in March to the current 14.2%. More than half of all jobs in the leisure and hospitality industry have dried up.\n\nFollow AP news coverage of the coronavirus pandemic at https://apnews.com/VirusOutbreak and https://apnews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak",

Those checks were imposed on Germany's borders with France, Switzerland, Austria, Luxembourg and Denmark on March 16 and people \"without a valid reason to travel\" haven't been allowed to cross.\n\nATHENS, Greece -- Greek health and civil protection authorities have launched an operation for widespread testing and contact tracing in an area in central Greece where an outbreak of coronavirus infections have been detected.\n\nThe civil protection authority said Wednesday that consecutive positive infections had been recorded in a Roma settlement in the central city of Larissa. Ten new confirmed infections were recorded on Tuesday, including seven people in the same family.\n\nThe local outbreak led authorities to implement a plan that will conduct widespread repeated testing in three phases, with the first tests on Wednesday, then repeated on the seventh day and on the 14th day. Positive cases will lead to quarantines of city blocks or neighborhoods, or to people being transferred for quarantine in a medical center set up in the area for this purpose, the civil protection authority said.\n\nGreece implemented a lockdown early on in its outbreak, a move which has been credited with keeping the number of coronavirus deaths low. The country's death toll currently stands at 152, with 2,744 confirmed infections and 32 people hospitalized on respirators in intensive care units.\n\nSaudi Arabia says it will go into a full lockdown during the days of celebration that follow the Muslim holy fasting month of Ramadan.\n\nThe Interior Ministry made the announcement early Wednesday morning, saying the lockdown would be in effect from May 23 through May 27.\n\nThose days mark the start of Eid al-Fitr, the holiday that comes at the end of Ramadan. That holiday typically sees families invite loved ones over for meals and go out to eat and drink during the day.\n\nMeanwhile, in the neighboring United Arab Emirates, the federation of seven sheikhdoms says it will offer free coronavirus testing for all citizens beginning next week. Foreigners in the country with coronavirus symptoms, pregnant women, those over 50 and those in contact with those who fell ill with COVID-19 also will be among those able to be tested for free.\n\nPrivate beaches at hotels also are beginning to reopen in Dubai, even as the number of confirmed cases and deaths continue to rise in the country. (edited)\n\nBERLIN -- Travel company TUI says it expects to cut thousands of jobs as it works to cut its costs amid the fallout from the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nThe Germany-based tour, travel and hotel operator said Wednesday that it is \"prepared for a resumption of its operational activities\" and its first hotels on the German coast will reopen in the coming days.\n\nTUI was granted a German government-backed bridging loan of 1.8 billion euros ($1.95 billion) to help cushion the effects of shutdowns. The company said it will have to cut investments and costs in a globally weakened market and is aiming for a permanent 30% reduction in its overhead cost base.\n\nCEO Fritz Joussen said in a statement that \"this will have an impact on potentially 8,000 roles globally that will either not be recruited or reduced.\" He added that \"we must now implement the realignment quickly.\"\n\nSEOUL, South Korea -- South Korea says it has no immediate plans to revive strict social distancing rules despite a spike in coronavirus cases linked to nightclubs in Seoul.\n\nVice Health Minister Kim Gang-lip told reporters Wednesday the government needs more time to analyze details of recent outbreaks before determining whether to maintain relaxed social distancing guidelines.\n\nSouth Korea has eased up on much of its strict social distancing rules last week before it has about roughly 30 new cases each day in the past several days. On Wednesday, South Korea recorded 26 new cases, 20 of them associated with clubs in Seoul's Itaewon entertainment district.\n\nHealth officials say in principle they would maintain relaxed social distancing rules if the country's daily jump is below 50 and the number of untraceable cases account for less than 5% of all confirmed cases.\n\nMEXICO CITY -- Mexico's top advisory body on the coronavirus pandemic says it has issued guidelines that would allow for the re-opening of construction, mining, and car and truck manufacturing.\n\nThe General Health Council said that following a Tuesday meeting it had decided to classify those industries as \"essential activities\" that are allowed to continue working during a lockdown aimed at fighting the spread of the novel coronavirus.\n\nThe council did not set a timeline for when the reopening would begin. But it said that by June 1, a 'stoplight' system should be in place to tell local populations what activities are allowed.\n\nThe council also said that restrictions on schools and businesses should be lifted in townships that have no cases of COVID-19 and whose neighboring townships also have no cases.\n\nPresident Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador is set to announce a plan for the \"gradual\" resumption of economic activities Wednesday.\n\nWELLINGTON, New Zealand -- New Zealand reported zero new cases of the coronavirus on Wednesday, the second day in a row without any and the fourth such day since early last week.\n\nDirector-General of Health Ashley Bloomfield said it was encouraging news as the country prepares to ease many of its lockdown restrictions from midnight. Most businesses, including malls, retail stores and sit-down restaurants, will be able to reopen. Social distancing rules will remain in place and gatherings will be limited to 10 people.\n\n\"The sense of anticipation is both palpable and understandable,\" Bloomfield said.\n\nThe lifting of restrictions will coincide with the release of the government's annual budget on Thursday. Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said the country faced the most challenging economic conditions since the Great Depression because of the virus.\n\n\"New Zealand is about to enter a very tough winter,\" she said. \"But every winter eventually is followed by spring, and if we make the right choices we can get New Zealanders back to work and our economy moving quickly again.\"\n\nISLAMABAD -- Pakistan crossed 2,000 new positive coronavirus cases in a single day for the first time since the outbreak earlier this year.\n\nThe increase comes just days after Prime Minister Imran Khan eased lockdown restrictions and stepped up the return of Pakistanis stranded overseas, ignoring please for stricter controls by Pakistan's medical professionals.\n\nScenes of crowds of people crammed into markets throughout the country greeted the let up in restrictions despite the government's call for safe distancing, which has been largely ignored by many of Pakistan's 220 million people. The latest figures show 34,312 positive cases following a 24-hour high of 2,255 new cases.\n\nKhan has been criticized for downplaying the severity of the pandemic, refusing to close down mosques particularly since the start of Islam's fasting month of Ramadan which ends in two weeks with the holiday of Eid-ul-Fitr. Islamic clerics in Pakistan wield considerable control, often frightening political leaders with their ability to bring angry mobs onto the street.\n\nKhan has argued the lockdown has hurt the country's poorest the hardest. A vast majority of Pakistanis earn barely $75 a month mostly doing construction and daily wage work.\n\nSEOUL, South Korea -- -- South Korea has reported 26 additional cases of the coronavirus over the past 24 hours amid a new spike in infections linked to nightclubs in Seoul.\n\nFigures released Wednesday by the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention brought the national tally to 10,962 with 259 deaths. The agency says 9,695 of them have recovered from the illness.\n\nIt says 22 of the 26 new cases were locally infected patients while the rest four came from overseas.\n\nSouth Korea's caseload has been on a slight yet steady upward trajectory since last week, with most cases linked to nightlife establishments in Seoul. Earlier the country's daily jump had been single digits or around 10 for many days, prompting authorities to ease up on social distancing guidelines.\n\nBEIJING -- China reported seven new cases of the coronavirus on Wednesday. Six of them were in the northeastern province of Jilin where authorities have raised alert levels and suspended rail connections to once county where a cluster of unknown origin has appeared over recent days.\n\nAnother 754 people are in treatment for being suspected cases or for having tested positive but not shown symptoms, while 104 people are in hospital undergoing treatment.\n\nChina has reported a total of 4,633 deaths among 82,926 cases.\n\nOn Tuesday, local media reported the government would conduct tests on all 11 million residents of Wuhan, the central industrial city where the virus was first detected late last year.\n\nPORTLAND, Ore. -- Portland Parks and Recreation says it will not open seasonal public swimming pools this summer and will cancel all camps and activities because of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nThe Oregonian/OregonLive reports the department announced the measures Tuesday.\n\nParks, trails and nature areas remain open and park greeters will be deployed \"to make sure people know how to use their park system safely during the pandemic.\"\n\nPortland Parks and Recreation Director Adena Long said in a statement they have had to layoff or not hire hundreds of seasonal employees.\n\nFollow AP news coverage of the coronavirus pandemic at https://apnews.com/VirusOutbreak and https://apnews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak.",

        "body": "The Latest on the coronavirus pandemic. The new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms for most people. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness or death.\n\nTOP OF THE HOUR:\n\n-- Expert warns many countries are driving blind as they reopen.\n\n-- Visitors from abroad will have to quarantine for 14 days after arriving in Spain.\n\n-- India to start limited trains as it looks to ease lockdown.\n\nMADRID -- Spain will require all visitors from abroad to quarantine for 14 days if they arrive in the country after May 15.\n\nThe new Health Ministry order, published Tuesday in Spain's official gazette, says the goal is to \"limit the risks derived from the international traffic of people\" during the rollback of the coronavirus lockdown.\n\nTravel agencies and transport companies must inform their customers about the new regulations before they sell their Spain-bound tickets, and airlines need to make sure that passengers fill out a \"location card\" in case they need to be contacted after their trip.\n\nTourism-magnet Spain is starting to loosen the grip after seven weeks of strict confinement. Authorities have reported more than 26,700 deaths for the new coronavirus and over 268,000 infections confirmed by tests.\n\nNEW DELHI, India -- India is reopening parts of its colossal rail network and will run limited trains as the country begins easing its nearly seven-week strict lockdown amid an increase in coronavirus infections.\n\nSpecial trains will depart from select big cities Tuesday, including Delhi and Mumbai, and run to full capacity. Passengers will be allowed to enter stations only if they are asymptomatic and clear thermal screening; they must maintain social distancing on board and will be given hand sanitizers upon entry and exit.\n\nThe train network often described as India's lifeline spans 67,000 kilometers (42,000 miles) and carries more than 20 million passengers daily.\n\nIndia's rail, road and air services were suspended in late March as part of a tight nationwide lockdown that has helped keep confirmed coronavirus infections relatively low for a population of 1.3 billion. But in recent days, as the lockdown has eased and some businesses have reopened, infections and deaths due to COVID-19, the respiratory disease caused by the coronavirus, are increasing.\n\nIndia has confirmed 70,756 coronavirus cases, including 2,293 deaths.\n\nSINGAPORE -- Singaporeans will be able to get a haircut at the barber or pop in to their favorite bakery Tuesday as the government loosens coronavirus restrictions three weeks before a partial lockdown ends.\n\nDespite an upsurge in cases due to an outbreak among foreign workers staying in crowded dormitories, the government says transmission in the local community has dropped and it plans a phased reopening of the economy. Barbers and hairdressers, food manufacturers and outlets, and laundry shops are among selected businesses that can open with strict health measures in place Tuesday after five weeks of shutdown.\n\nBarbers are open by appointment only and notices outside shops call for face masks before entry. Officials reminded citizens not to rush out or loiter outside.\n\nSingapore has reported 23,822 infections, the most in Asia after China, India and Pakistan. But it has a low fatality rate of 21 deaths. About 90% of cases are linked to foreign workers' dorms, which have all remained locked down as testing continues.\n\nSEOUL, South Korea -- The mayor of the South Korean capital of Seoul says the number of recent coronavirus cases linked to the city's clubs and other nightspots has surpassed 100.\n\nPark Won-soon said in a virus briefing that 64 of the 101 cases detected as of 10 a.m. Tuesday came from Seoul, which is requesting that anyone who visited any clubs or bars in the Itaewon entertainment district between April 24 and May 6 get tested for COVID-19. He said more than 7,200 people have been tested so far.\n\nMore than 8,500 police officers have been deployed nationwide to track down thousands of people who were listed as customers of the Itaewon clubs and bars linked to infections but have been out of contact, according to Health Ministry official Yoon Tae-ho.\n\nHealth workers are also using credit card and telecommunications records to track down Itaewon visitors. Park said the city sent text messages to some 10,900 people urging them to get tested after receiving data from police and mobile phone operators that showed they used their devices in the area.\n\nSEOUL, South Korea -- South Korea has reported 27 new cases of the coronavirus in the past 24 hours.\n\nFigures released by South Korea's Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Tuesday brought national figures to 10,936 cases and 258 deaths. At least 1,138 infections have been linked to international arrivals, but such cases have declined after the country strengthened border controls in April, enforcing two-week quarantines on all passengers coming from abroad.\n\nThe recent transmissions linked to club goers have alarmed a country that had eased up on social distancing and scheduled a reopening of schools, which was pushed back by a week to May 20.\n\nMANILA, Philippines -- Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte said the massive lockdown that has restricted millions to their homes will be eased, but he warned that people who want to return to work must follow safeguards to avoid more deaths and a second wave of COVID-19 outbreaks.\n\nThe Philippine economy contracted in the first quarter and the finance secretary reported that up to 1.5 million jobs have been lost during the lockdown on Luzon island, the country's most populous region, which includes the capital, Manila.\n\nDuterte made the announcement in videotaped remarks shown on nationwide television Tuesday. He said his spokesman will later disclose which regions will remain under lockdown and which areas would be released based on the scale and speed of infections. The two-month lockdown was supposed to last until May 15.\n\n\"Don't gamble with COVID,\" Duterte said.\n\nThe Philippines has reported more than 11,000 infections, including 726 deaths.\n\nBEIJING -- China reported just one new coronavirus case Tuesday as the government presses ahead with reopening measures, including allowing Beijing middle school senior students to return to class and Shanghai Disneyland to open its gates again to a limited number of visitors.\n\nOther measures have included permitting Beijing's ancient Forbidden City to expand its visitor numbers, as long as they book online first, show evidence they are healthy and wear a mask while touring the massive complex that was home to generations of China's emperors.\n\nAlso on Tuesday, the National Health Commission said 115 people remain in treatment and 763 are being isolated and monitored as either suspected cases or after testing positive for the virus without showing symptoms.\n\nChina has not reported a new death from the virus in almost a month. In total, it has recorded 4,633 deaths among 82,919 cases since the virus was first detected in the central Chinese city of Wuhan last year.\n\nThe single new case Tuesday follows double-digit increases over the previous two days that had set off renewed warnings from officials for citizens to avoid becoming overconfident and prompted the suspension of train service to one affected county in the northeastern province of Jilin.\n\nFollow AP news coverage of the coronavirus pandemic at https://apnews.com/VirusOutbreak and https://apnews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak.",

He said this brought the total number of infections linked to clubgoers to 40 -- 27 in Seoul, 12 in neighboring Incheon and Gyeonggi province towns, and one in the southern port city of Busan.\n\nThe KCDC, which complies data from local governments, couldn't immediately confirm Park's numbers.\n\nFRANKFORT, Ky. -- A federal court has halted the Kentucky governor's temporary ban on mass gatherings from applying to in-person religious services.\n\nThe temporary restraining order issued Friday prevents Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear's administration from enforcing the ban on mass gatherings at \"any in-person religious service which adheres to applicable social distancing and hygiene guidelines.\"\n\nThe ruling sided with the Tabernacle Baptist Church, but applies statewide. Two other federal judges had previously ruled the ban was constitutional. But also on Friday, one of those judges in a separate order granted Maryville Baptist Church an injunction allowing in-person services at that specific church.\n\nBeshear had previously announced that places of worship could hold in-person services starting May 20, as part of a broader plan to gradually reopen the state's economy. Earlier Friday, he outlined reopening requirements, including limiting attendance at in-person services to 33% of building occupancy capacity.\n\nBeshear's office had not issued a statement on the injunctions as late Friday\n\nISLAMABAD -- Pakistan has begun lifting the weeks-long lockdown that was enforced to curb the spread of the coronavirus, as authorities reported another big jump of 1,637 cases which rose to 27,474 with 24 new fatalities.\n\nArmy soldiers who manned roadside checkpoints along with police since late March when the lockdown was enforced, were seen leaving for their barracks in the capital, Islamabad and elsewhere in the country on Saturday.\n\nThe latest development comes two days after the prime minister Imran Khan said he was ending the lockdown in phases because his government was unable to financially help those millions of people who rely on their daily earnings to survive and feed their families.\n\nKhan says he tried to financially help the country's poor amid the pandemic, but he was unable to support all those who lost their jobs due to the lockdown. So far, Khan has bowed to pressure from the country's powerful clerical establishment by allowing mosques to remain open, even as the number of new cases has recently increased.\n\nSo far, Pakistan has reported 618 coronavirus-related deaths, although it had its first case in February.\n\nPakistan has warned that it will reimpose the lockdown if people do not adhere to social distancing guidelines, which experts say could cause a peak later this month. Although Pakistan has lifted curbs on several economic sectors and allowed business activities to reopen, schools will remain closed until July 15\n\nMANAUS, Brazil -- A funeral home business leader for Brazil's state that covers much of the Amazon region says emergency coffin shipments have started to arrive for people who have died of COVID-19.\n\nManuel Viana is president of the Amazonas Union of Funeral Companies and said Friday that more than 500 coffins were delivered by ship to Manaus, the largest city in Amazonas state.\n\nHe says hundreds more are on the way and will be distributed in Manaus and other cities in the region.\n\nManaus is one of the hardest hit Brazilian cities for coronavirus deaths and Viana says there are predictions that the city of more than 2 million could have more than 4,300 deaths in May.\n\nA Johns Hopkins University count says there have been more than 10,000 COVID-19 deaths so far in Latin America's largest and most populous country.\n\nA Brazil funeral home association last week requested an airlift of coffins to Manaus.\n\nSEOUL, South Korea -- North Korea says leader Kim Jong Un sent a letter to Russian President Vladimir Putin to congratulate him on the 75th anniversary of the allied victory in World War II and wishing Russia success in fighting its coronavirus outbreak.\n\nThe report by Pyongyang's official Korean Central News Agency on Saturday came a day after it reported Kim sent a personal message to Chinese President Xi Jinping to praise what he described as China's success in getting its COVID-19 epidemic under control.\n\nSome experts say the North could intensify its diplomatic outreach to neighbors, particularly China, as it seeks economic help after closing its border for months to fend off the virus.\n\nKCNA says Kim's message \"sincerely wished the president and people of Russia sure victory in their struggle to build a powerful Russia by carrying forward the tradition of the great victory in the war and to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus infection.\"\n\nHONOLULU -- Hawaii is reporting no new cases of the coronavirus for the first time in nearly two months.\n\nThe state Department of Health said the number of positive cases remained at 629. The last time there was no new case was on March 13. At that point, Hawaii had a total of just two cases.\n\nHawaii has been under a statewide stay-at-home order since the last week of March to slow the spread of the virus. Gov. David Ige has begun relaxing some restrictions.\n\nHawaii also requires those arriving in the state and traveling between the islands to observe 14 days of quarantine.\n\nASHLAND, Ore. -- The Oregon Shakespeare Festival, a major tourist draw in southern Oregon, is cancelling its fall season due to the coronavirus outbreak.\n\nIn a statement the festival noted Oregon Gov . Kate Brown recently said that large gatherings wouldn't happen in the state until at least late September. The company's season was to begin Sept. 8. The festival urged 2020 ticketholders to donate tickets or consider a voucher for use in 2021.\n\nThe Tony Award-winning Oregon Shakespeare Festival is among the oldest and largest professional nonprofit theaters in the nation. It prides itself on offering outdoor showings of Shakespeare's plays performed in a venue similar to what his contemporary audiences would have experienced, but it also offers other types of theater in indoor performance halls.\n\nNEW ORLEANS -- Louisiana's governor says the state will have 250 workers in place by the end of next week to contact people infected with the new coronavirus and track down people they have been in close contact with.\n\nSuch \"contact tracing\" is a key factor in whether the state will be able to start easing restrictions and closures of businesses.\n\nDemocratic Gov. John Bel Edwards is under increasing pressure from Republican officials to restart Louisiana's economy. Increased testing is also a factor, and Edwards said the state plans to complete a total of 200,000 tests for the month of May.\n\nEdwards said the state has signed contracts with two companies that will establish the contact tracing system. That will bolster the 70 contact tracers currently working. The state expects to eventually hire as many as 700 contract tracers if needed.\n\nEdwards' current emergency order, banning gatherings of more than 10 people and closing many nonessential businesses, expires May 15. He plans to announce Monday whether the restrictions will be extended.\n\nOLYMPIA, Wash. -- Data from COVID-19 projection models show that the rate of infection is increasing in Washington state, Gov. Jay Inslee said Friday.\n\nWashington was one of the first U.S. states to be hit hard by the coronavirus, with outbreaks in Seattle-area nursing homes.\n\nThe Democratic governor urged people to follow his measured approach to slowly reopening the state the from his stay-at-home restrictions.\n\nInslee did say that curbside retail sales in Washington could begin almost immediately for businesses with reopening plans approved by health officials.\n\nHe said data showed that the reproductive rate of the coronavirus in Western and Eastern Washington was above three when the outbreak was first detected in late February and March. That means each infected person infects about three others. It has since dropped to about one, Inslee said, but data up to April 19 shows that the reproduction rate is on the upswing.\n\nJACKSON, Miss. -- Mississippi's governor says barbershops, salons and gyms will be allowed to reopen Monday but must take steps to curb the spread of the new coronavirus.\n\nRepublican Gov. Tate Reeves made the announcement Friday. It was his latest step to gradually remove restrictions he had imposed because of the pandemic. Reeves said people must continue taking precautions against the virus as confirmed case numbers continue to rise. But he also said he is trying to avoid another Great Depression.\n\nReeves said the pandemic has been \"particularly cruel to the working class -- those people who work on their feet, those people who don't have a home office or paid leave.\"\n\nReeves said he is extending his \"safer at home\" order for another two weeks. It was set to expire Monday morning, and the new expiration date is May 25. It requires medically vulnerable people to stay home and suggests that people work from their homes if possible. It limits indoor gatherings to groups of no more than 10 people and outdoor gatherings to groups of no more than 20.\n\nRules for Mississippi restaurants took effect Thursday and will remain in place through May 25. They are allowed to reopen their dining rooms and patios with limits on the numbers of customers; servers must wear masks.\n\nBOGOTA, Colombia -- A Colombian advertising company is pitching a novel if morbid solution to shortages of hospital beds and coffins during the coronavirus pandemic: combine them.\n\nABC Displays has created a cardboard bed with metal railings that designers say can double as a casket if a patient dies.\n\nCompany manager Rodolfo G\u00f3mez said he was inspired to find a way to help after watching events unfold recently in nearby Ecuador.\n\nFamilies in the coastal city of Guayaquil waited with dead loved ones in their homes for days last month as COVID-19 cases surged. Many could not find or were unable to afford a wood coffin, using donated cardboard ones instead.\n\nG\u00f3mez said he plans to donate 10 of his new beds to Colombia's Amazonas department, where resources are in short supply. So far there is no indication whether the beds will be put to use and no orders have been placed.\n\nCOLUMBUS, Ohio -- The number of people dying from the coronavirus in Ohio's nursing homes has continued to increase at an alarming pace.\n\nClose to 500 residents of long-term care centers have died of COVID-19 in the past three weeks, according to data released by the state this week. That's nearly double the total reported for the previous two weeks.\n\nThe increase in deaths could be attributed to a significant jump or a backlog of cases being added over the past week, said Melanie Amato, a spokeswoman for the state health department.\n\nSince mid-April, more than 4,300 nursing home residents and staff members have tested positive for the virus.\n\nThe numbers don't tell the entire story of how the virus has devastated nursing homes during the pandemic because the Ohio Department of Health has only released the totals for just the past three weeks.\n\nBefore that, the state didn't require local health departments to report nursing home deaths linked to the virus.\n\nCOLUMBIA, S.C. -- Restaurants throughout South Carolina can soon reopen with limited, indoor dining service.\n\nStarting Monday, Gov. Henry McMaster said restaurants could open for indoor dining as long as they kept patrons to 50% occupancy, placed tables 6-to-8 feet apart and followed stringent cleaning and sanitizing guidelines. Among the new guidelines are to keep hand sanitizer at entrances and remove previously shared condiments from tables.\n\n\"A lot of iconic restaurants have actually gone out of business, and the whole state regrets that,\" the governor said Friday, in announcing what he calls \"phase 2\" of a process to get dining rooms back open.\n\nThe Republican governor is gradually lifting restrictions initially put in place to stem the coronavirus outbreak and promising to soon discuss reopening other businesses.\n\nFollow AP news coverage of the coronavirus pandemic at https://apnews.com/VirusOutbreak and https://apnews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak.",

        "body": "The Latest on the coronavirus pandemic. The new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms for most people. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness or death.\n\nTOP OF THE HOUR:\n\n-- Navy warship carrying 698 stranded Indian citizens returns.\n\n-- South Korea president says citizens shouldn't panic over rise in new virus cases.\n\n-- 3 members of White House coronavirus task force place themselves in quarantine.\n\nNEW DELHI -- An Indian navy warship carrying Indians stranded in the Maldives because of the coronavirus lockdown has docked at a port in Kochi, the capital of the southernmost state of Kerala.\n\nThe INS Jalashwa with 698 returning Indian citizens aboard is the first vessel to arrive Sunday as part of India's massive repatriation mission. India is also using national carrier Air India to bring back thousands of stranded citizens from the Persian Gulf, U.K. and elsewhere in Asia.\n\nSea and air passengers have been charged a fare to return to India. Hundreds of thousands of Indian citizens have signed up for additional repatriation journeys planned this month.\n\nIndia's lockdown entered a sixth week Sunday, though some restrictions have been eased for self-employed people unable to access government support to return to work. India has reported 60,829 positive cases, including 19,357 recovered patients, and 2,109 deaths.\n\nSEOUL, South Korea -- South Korea's president says his proposal to North Korea on jointly tackling infectious diseases such as the COVID-19 illness remains valid, though the North hasn't responded.\n\nPresident Moon Jae-in told reporters Sunday that he believes the North is suffering \"various difficulties\" over the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nMoon didn't elaborate. His spy agency recently told lawmakers the virus pandemic resulted in sharply shrinking the North's external trade and causing panic buying in Pyongyang, the North's capital.\n\nMoon says he'll try to persuade North Korea to accept his offers for reconciliation projects after the pandemic is stabilized. Moon has proposed reconnecting severed railways, resuming reunions of families split by war and sending South Korean tourists to North Korea.\n\nNorth Korea has been taking intense anti-virus quarantine steps but it has steadfastly claimed there hasn't been a single case of the coronavirus on its territory. Many foreign experts are skeptical of the North's claim.\n\nSEOUL, South Korea -- South Korea's president is urging citizens not to lower their guard down, but said there's no reason to be panicked amid worries about a new surge in the coronavirus outbreak in the country.\n\nPresident Moon Jae-in made the comments in a speech Sunday as his health authorities detected a slew of new cases linked to nightclubs in Seoul's Itaewon district in recent days. Earlier, South Korea's caseload had been waning for weeks, prompting authorities to relax their social distancing rules.\n\n\"The infection cluster which recently occurred in entertainment facilities,\" Moon said, \"has raised awareness that, even during the stabilization phase, similar situations can arise again anytime, anywhere in an enclosed, crowded space.\"\n\nMoon added that, \"We must never lower our guard regarding epidemic prevention.\" But he also said \"there's no reason to stand still out of fear. \"\n\nSouth Korea reported 34 additional cases of COVID-19 over the past 24 hours as a spate of transmissions linked to clubgoers threatens the country's hard-won gains in its fight against the virus.\n\nFigures released Sunday by the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention increased national totals to 10,874 with 256 deaths. The agency said 9,610 have recovered and 10,128 others were undergoing tests to determine whether they've contracted the virus.\n\nMoon says South Korea has \"the right quarantine and medical systems combined with experience to respond quickly to any unexpected infection clusters that might occur.\"\n\nWASHINGTON -- Three members of the White House coronavirus task force, including Dr. Anthony Fauci, placed themselves in quarantine after contact with someone who tested positive for COVID-19, another stark reminder that not even one of the nation's most secure buildings is immune from the virus.\n\nFauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and a leading member of the task force, has become nationally known for his simple and direct explanations to the public about the coronavirus and COVID-19, the disease it causes. Also quarantining are Dr. Robert Redfield, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, Stephen Hahn.\n\nFauci's institute said he has tested negative for COVID-19 and will continue to be tested regularly. It added that he is considered at \"relatively low risk\" based on the degree of his exposure, and that he would be \"taking appropriate precautions\" to mitigate the risk to personal contacts while still carrying out his duties. While he will stay at home and telework, Fauci will go to the White House if called and take every precaution, the institute said.\n\nRedfield will be \"teleworking for the next two weeks\" after it was determined he had a \"low risk exposure\" to a person at the White House, the CDC said in a statement Saturday evening. The statement said he felt fine and has no symptoms.\n\nJust a few hours earlier, the Food and Drug Administration confirmed that Hahn had come in contact with someone who tested positive and was in self-quarantine for the next two weeks. He tested negative for the virus.\n\nFollow AP news coverage of the coronavirus pandemic at https://apnews.com/VirusOutbreak and https://apnews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak.",

        "body": "Slovenia has become the first European country to proclaim an end to the coronavirus epidemic at home\n\nThe Latest on the coronavirus pandemic. The new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms for most people. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness or death.\n\nTOP OF THE HOUR:\n\n-- Virus hot spots flare, hospitals tested as economies reopen.\n\n-- Slovenia first European country to proclaim end to coronavirus epidemic.\n\n-- World Bank approves $1 billion in aid for India.\n\n-- First virus case reported in crowded camps for Rohingya refugees.\n\nLJUBLJANA, Slovenia -- Slovenia has become the first European country to proclaim an end to the coronavirus epidemic at home.\n\nThe European Union state's government said Friday the COVID-19 spread is under control and there is no longer a need for extraordinary health measures.\n\nThe government says EU residents are free to cross into Slovenia from Austria, Italy and Hungary at predetermined checkpoints, while most non-EU nationals will have to undergo a mandatory 14-day quarantine in what is a major step for the small Alpine country as it accelerates the easing of restrictions.\n\nThe first coronavirus case in Slovenia was recorded on March 4, a returnee from neighboring Italy. The nationwide epidemic was proclaimed on March 12.\n\nBy May 13, there were 1,467 confirmed cases and 103 deaths in Slovenia.\n\nNEW DELHI -- The World Bank has approved $1 billion in emergency response to support India's efforts at providing social assistance to poor and vulnerable households severely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nA bank statement says the move will increase its total commitment to India to $2 billion. A $1 billion package was announced last month for India's health sector.\n\nAn immediate allocation of $750 million will help scale-up cash transfers and food benefits to provide robust social protection for essential workers involved in coronavirus relief efforts and benefit migrants and informal workers, the bank statement said late Thursday.\n\nA second influx of $250 million will deepen the social protection package in fiscal year 2021, it said.\n\nHalf of India's population earns less than $3 a day. More than 90 percent of India's workforce is employed in the informal sector, without access to significant savings or workplace-based social protection benefits such as paid sick leave or social insurance, the statement said.\n\nOn Tuesday, India's federal government announced an economic rescue package of 20 trillion rupees ($260 billion) to tide over a massive economic crisis created by the pandemic. Millions of migrant workers have fled big Indian cities to their village homes as they could find no work.\n\nBERLIN -- Germany's most populous state has lifted a requirement for people arriving from other European countries to self-quarantine for 14 days, and other regions are expected to follow.\n\nThe rule expired in the western region of North Rhine-Westphalia at midnight. The state government said in a statement that Germany's states agreed with the federal government on Thursday to exempt travelers from other countries in the European Union, Iceland, Norway, Liechtenstein, Switzerland and Britain and that they will implement that decision over the coming days.\n\nInterior Minister Horst Seehofer recommended earlier this week that states lift the quarantine rule for travelers from Europe - but maintain it for those from elsewhere.\n\nA court in North Rhine-Westphalia's northern neighbor, Lower Saxony, already suspended the rule for that state earlier this week.\n\nOn Friday night, Germany plans to end two-month-old checks on its border with Luxembourg and loosen them somewhat on its borders with Austria, Switzerland and France - though it doesn't plan to restore free travel across its borders until mid-June.\n\nATHENS, Greece -- Authorities are imposing extra lockdown measures on a Roma neighborhood in the central Greek city of Larissa after an outbreak of coronavirus there led to 35 people testing positive, the largest jump in new daily cases nationwide in three weeks.\n\nThe Civil Protection Authority said a nighttime curfew was being imposed on the neighborhood for 14 days as of Friday, and wearing masks is now required for all residents leaving their homes. Regional authorities were distributing masks and antiseptics.\n\nThe cases emerged after health authorities conducted 637 tests to detect a possible outbreak. The virus reportedly spread after mourners attended the funeral of a local resident who died of COVID-19.\n\nThose who have tested positive were being transferred to a local health facility for quarantine.\n\nResidents working in open-air markets will only be allowed to leave the area for work if they have two consecutive negative tests, the authority said. Testing was continuing for all market vendors and any remaining residents not yet tested, while health authorities are tracing the contacts of those who have tested positive.\n\nGreece has so far managed to contain its outbreak at low levels of deaths and critically ill people, and authorities have been eager to sustain that as they gradually lift lockdown measures, a process which began nearly two weeks ago. On Thursday, authorities announced 10 new positive cases and one new death, bringing the total death toll to 156 and the confirmed cases to 2,770 in a country of nearly 11 million.\n\nDHAKA, Bangladesh -- Authorities have reported the first coronavirus case in the crowded camps for Rohingya refugees in southern Bangladesh, where more than 1 million people are sheltered.\n\nThe person from the Rohingya community and a local person who lives in the Cox's Bazar district who also tested positive have been isolated, Mahbub Alam Talukder, the country's refugee commissioner, said Thursday.\n\nTeams have been activated for treatment of the patients as well as tracing people they might have encountered and quarantining and testing of those contacts, Louise Donovan, a spokeswoman for the U.N. refugee agency, told The Associated Press.\n\nAid workers have been warning of the potential for a serious outbreak if the virus reached the camps. The dense crowding with plastic shacks standing side by side housing up to 12 residents each mean the refugees would be dangerously exposed to the virus.\n\nBEIJING -- China's foreign minister says the country has brought the coronavirus outbreak under control and he lashed out at foreign politicians he accused of having \"insisted on politicizing the epidemic, labeling the virus, and smearing the World Health Organization.\"\n\nWang Yi's comments carried by the official Xinhua News Agency appeared directed at the United States, where President Donald Trump's administration has repeatedly castigated China for allegedly covering up the initial outbreak and has suspended payments to the WHO over what it calls a pro-China bias and failure to effectively deal with the pandemic.\n\nOther countries, including Australia, have also urged an independent investigation into the origin of the pandemic, calls that China has furiously rejected.\n\nUnder head of state and ruling Communist Party leader Xi Jinping's leadership, China has been able to \"put the outbreak under control through arduous efforts and has been gradually resuming economic and social life while undertaking prevention and control measures on a regular basis,\" Wang was quoted as saying in a phone call Thursday with the foreign ministers of Hungary, Estonia and Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n\nChina has \"overcome its own difficulties, offered support and assistance to relevant countries, shared prevention and control experiences and treatments without reservation, and facilitated various countries' purchase of anti-epidemic supplies in China,\" Wang said.\n\nAttempts to politicize the pandemic and smear the WHO are \"a serious violation of international moral principles and undermine international anti-epidemic efforts,\" Wang added.\n\nSYDNEY -- Many cafes and restaurants opened again Friday in Sydney as some coronavirus restrictions were lifted, although rainy weather and ongoing fears appeared to keep patronage relatively low.\n\nAustralia's most populous state of New South Wales began allowing cafes, restaurants and places of worship to reopen with up to 10 people on the condition they adhere to social distancing rules. Pubs and clubs were also permitted to open, but only for dining.\n\nState Premier Gladys Berejiklian warned people to take personal responsibility, saying that easing restrictions in some other countries had backfired.\n\n\"Let's please do our part in keeping everybody safe so that all of us can keep moving forward so that we never, ever go backwards,\" Berejiklian told reporters in Sydney. \"That's really, really critical.\"\n\nMany Catholic churches across the state opened for private prayer, confession and small-scale masses.\n\n\"The celebration of mass is the highest form of Catholic worship and to not be able to physically gather these past two months has been very difficult for Catholics,\" Sydney's Archbishop Anthony Fisher said in a statement.\n\nMany Jewish synagogues and other Christian churches decided to keep their doors closed.\n\nNew South Wales on Friday reported eight new cases of the virus, bringing the state total to a little over 3,000. Australia has reported a total of about 7,000 cases and 98 deaths.\n\nMEXICO CITY -- Mexico reported its largest one-day rise in coronavirus cases, with 2,409.\n\nAssistant Health Secretary Hugo L\u00f3pez-Gatell said Thursday the country is at \"the most difficult\" moment in the pandemic. It was the first time in Mexico that the number of new cases exceeded 2,000 in one day.\n\nIn percentage terms, the 6% increase was not the biggest one-day jump.\n\nOfficials also reported 257 more deaths from COVID-19, for a total of 4,477 since the pandemic began. There have been higher one-day death tolls this week.\n\nL\u00f3pez-Gatell said there are \"tendencies of decline\" in some parts of the country. But there also are signs that hospital capacity is nearing its limit in Mexico City, the country's hardest-hit area.\n\nThe increase in cases comes four days before Monday's scheduled partial reopening of key industries such as mining, construction and automobile assembly.\n\nFollow AP news coverage of the coronavirus pandemic at https://apnews.com/VirusOutbreak and https://apnews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak.",

For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness or death.\n\nTOP OF THE HOUR:\n\n-- 4 new cases in South Korea, China show work on containment.\n\n-- Spain sees highest unemployment figure in nearly four years.\n\n-- Australia PM still suspects virus originated in Chinese market, not lab.\n\nMADRID -- The Spanish government says that the halting of most economic activity during April's strict confinement shot up unemployment to a total of 3.8 million, the highest figure in nearly four years.\n\nAltogether 282,891 people registered as jobless in April, or 8% more than a month earlier, data published on Tuesday by Spain's Labour Ministry shows.\n\nMore than 300,000 people had already gone jobless the previous month, after authorities enacted a state of emergency on March 14 that provided the legal framework to confine Spaniards at home and deal with a pandemic that has killed at least 25,000.\n\nThe jobless statistics don't include the millions of workers in Spain that have been furloughed or seen a temporary reduction in the number of hours that they are working.\n\nThe government wants to prolong the state of emergency for two additional weeks to May 23, although opposition parties argue that the government doesn't need special powers during the lockdown roll back and are threatening to block the extension when the bill reaches parliament on Wednesday.\n\nCANBERRA, Australia -- Australia's prime minister still suspects the new coronavirus originated in a Chinese wildlife market despite U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo advocating a theory that it began in a laboratory.\n\nPrime Minister Scott Morrison said Tuesday that he had written to Group of 20 government leaders calling for a \"proper assessment\" of the origins of and government responses to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nPompeo, who has backed Australia's call for an independent review, told ABC's \"This Week with George Stephanopoulos\" that there is \"enormous evidence\" that the virus began in the Wuhan Institute of Virology.\n\nThe institute, which is run by the Chinese Academy of Sciences, is about 8 miles (13 kilometers) from a market considered a possible source of the virus.\n\nAsked about the lab theory, Morrison told reporters Australia works closely with the United States and cannot rule out potential origins. But he said a wet market was \"most likely\" the origin of the pandemic.\n\nChina has dismissed calls for an international inquiry independent of the World Health Organization and has accused Australia of parroting the United States.\n\nWASHINGTON -- On board the coronavirus-stricken USS Theodore Roosevelt, the crew is getting the aircraft carrier ready to head back out to sea.\n\nFor the ship's commander, Capt. Carlos Sardiello, the road to recovery has been a challenge. For the crew sidelined in Guam for more than a month, it's been an emotional roller coaster.\n\nSardiello was a former Roosevelt captain when he abruptly returned to the ship in early April to take command after Capt. Brett Crozier was fired for urging faster action to stem the virus outbreak onboard.\n\nMore than 4,000 crew members went ashore last month. While more than 2,000 are back on board, at least 1,000 are still testing positive for the virus and remain on land. And the close to 700 crew members who had been protecting and running the Roosevelt and systems aboard have now moved into hotels and other facilities on the island for their quarantine.\n\nWhen it's time to return to the ship, boarding takes place in slow, meticulous waves. Wearing gloves and masks, the crew members climb onto sterile buses only after they've had two negative tests for the virus. They are screened and checked when they get on the bus and again before they board the ship. Even a simple sniffle can get them turned back.\n\nThose who had stayed on the ship did deep cleaning four times a day.\n\nWELLINGTON, New Zealand -- The leaders of Australia and New Zealand say they're committed to resuming travel between the two countries as soon as they can do so safely.\n\nThe announcement Tuesday came after New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern took the unusual step of joining Australian counterpart Scott Morrison and his National Cabinet for a discussion by video link. Morrison said he'd been talking to Ardern for several weeks about creating a safe travel zone between the countries.\n\n\"It is still some time away,\" Morrison said. \"But it is important to flag it because it is part of the road back.\"\n\nBoth countries have experienced success in suppressing their coronavirus outbreaks. New Zealand reported no new cases Tuesday for the second consecutive day, while Australia reported 25 new cases.\n\nTEHRAN, Iran -- The new coronavirus pandemic has brought back something unseen in Iran since its 1979 Islamic Revolution: a drive-in movie theater.\n\nOnce decried by revolutionaries for allowing too much privacy for unmarried young couples, a drive-in theater now operates from a parking lot right under Tehran's iconic Milad tower, showing a film in line with the views of hard-liners.\n\nWorkers spray disinfectants on cars that line up each night here after buying tickets online for what is called the \"Cinema Machine\" in Farsi. They tune into the film's audio via an FM station on their car radios.\n\nWith stadiums shut and movie theaters closed, this parking-lot screening is the only film being shown in a communal setting amid the virus outbreak in Iran, one of the world's worst. Iran has reported more than 98,600 cases with over 6,200 deaths, though international and local experts acknowledge the toll is likely far higher.\n\nFollow AP news coverage of the coronavirus pandemic at https://apnews.com/VirusOutbreak and https://apnews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak.",

Yuriko Koike on Wednesday called for an extension of Japan's nationwide \"state of emergency,\" which requests people to stay home and social distance, to stem the spread of the coronavirus outbreak.\n\n\"Tokyo is still facing a serious situation and so I would like to have it go on longer,\" she told reporters.\n\nShe noted reported daily cases of COVID-19 in Tokyo have topped 100 people recently.\n\nJapan has had about 400 deaths so far nationwide, 100 of them in Tokyo.\n\nThe state of emergency, declared by Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, lasts through May 6, which marks the end of the Golden Week holidays that began this week.\n\nThe government has asked people not to travel during the holidays. There is no lockdown in Japan, and some businesses and restaurants remain open.\n\nBut the usually jam-packed commuter trains and streets of Tokyo have thinned out, and at times look abandoned.\n\nWorries remain another surge of cases could be ahead if people let go of social distancing restrictions.\n\nSEOUL, South Korea -- South Korea officials have issued public pleas for vigilance to maintain hard-won gains against the coronavirus as the nation enters its longest holiday since infections surged in February.\n\nSouth Korea's Vice Health Minister Kim Gang-lip on Wednesday said 180,000 people are expected to visit the resort island of Jeju during a six-day break from Thursday to Tuesday, despite the island government pleading travelers not to come.\n\nHotels and other accommodation facilities are nearly fully booked in some seaside towns in Gangwon province, which hosted the Winter Olympics in 2018.\n\nKim urged travelers to wear masks, not to share food and stay at home if they have fever or respiratory symptoms. Gangwon has increased the number of thermal cameras at train stations, bus terminals and highway rest areas. Jeju plans to expand temperature checks at its airport and conduct virus tests on travelers with even mild fevers above 37.3 degrees Celsius.\n\n\"(I) hope that this 'golden holiday' could really be remembered as golden,\" Kim said during a virus briefing. \"We must not let a moment of carelessness trigger mass transmissions that would make the efforts we invested so far vanish like bubbles of water.\"\n\nCANBERRA, Australia -- An Australian mining magnate and partner in the government's pandemic response says a global inquiry into the coronavirus should be delayed until after the U.S. presidential election.\n\nAndrew Forrest, who became a billionaire exporting iron ore to China as founder of Fortescue Metals Group, said on Wednesday such an inquiry made \"common sense,\" but should be held after the November election so \"there's not going to be a political dog in this fight.\"\n\nHe told Australian Broadcasting Corp.: \"Sure have a COVID-19 inquiry -- not a Chinese inquiry -- but let's do it after the U.S. election, because there's a bloke in the White House who really wants to stay there and he's pushing blame as fast as he possibly can to anywhere else but himself and I don't think this should be politically orientated.\"\n\nAustralia announced on Wednesday it has secured an additional 10 million COVID-19 tests from China manufacturers through its partnership with Forrest's charitable Minderoo Foundation that would enable a 20-fold increase in Australian testing by the end of the year.\n\nAustralian support for an international inquiry into the origins of coronavirus independent of the World Health Organization is damaging bilateral relations with China, which accused Australia of parroting the United States.\n\nMEXICO CITY -- Mexico's Interior Department is urging towns and states to stop putting up roadblocks and curfews to stem the spread of the new coronavirus, as hundreds have done.\n\nThe department said in a statement Tuesday that such measures violate constitutional rights like the right to free movement, and argued that local governments don't have the authority to enact them.\n\n\"The health emergency does not constitute a state of emergency or suspension of rights,\" the department wrote.\n\nThe department said in a report that almost 20% percent of Mexican municipal governments, about 340, have put up checkpoints or filters to limit people's movements. Most were concentrated along the country's coasts, where many beach towns have tried to exclude travelers who might spread the coronavirus.\n\nDozens of towns have enacted curfews and at least three of the country's 31 states have threatened to arrest people who don't obey social distancing measures.\n\nBEIJING -- China has decided to hold the annual meeting of its ceremonial parliament late next month after postponing it for weeks because of the coronavirus outbreak.\n\nThe official Xinhua News Agency on Wednesday said the National People's Congress would open in Beijing on May 22, according to a decision made by its standing committee, which handles most legislative affairs outside the annual two-week session of the full body.\n\nThe convening of the full session, which would encompass about 3,000 members, indicates China's growing confidence that it has largely overcome the pandemic that was first detected in China late last year.\n\nThe meeting involves bringing delegates from across the country by plane and train to Beijing, where they first meet to hear a state of the country address from Premier Li Keqiang, seated shoulder-to-shoulder in the colossal auditorium at the Great Hall of the People.\n\nIt wasn't clear from the report whether delegates would be meeting in person or virtually and there was no word on any meeting of the congress' advisory body that meets around the same time.\n\nFollow AP news coverage of the coronavirus pandemic at https://apnews.com/VirusOutbreak and https://apnews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak",

        "body": "The Latest on the coronavirus pandemic. The new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms for most people. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness or death.\n\nTOP OF THE HOUR:\n\n-- Virus tamed in New Zealand, while Brazil emerges as hot spot.\n\n-- Planeload of supplies leaves Turkey for the United States.\n\n-- Trump urges states to consider opening schools before summer.\n\nANKARA, Turkey -- Turkey has dispatched a planeload of personal protective equipment to support the United States as it grapples with the coronavirus outbreak.\n\nA Turkish military cargo plane carrying the medical equipment took off from an air base near the capital Ankara on Tuesday, the state-run Anadolu Agency reported.\n\nA top official said Turkey is sending 500,000 surgical masks, 4,000 overalls, 2,000 liters (528 gallons) of disinfectant, 1,500 goggles, 400 N-95 masks and 500 face shields.\n\nTurkey has sent similar medical equipment aid to a total of 55 countries -- including Britain, Italy and Spain -- in an apparent attempt to improve its global standing by positioning itself as a provider of humanitarian aid at times of crisis.\n\n\"We pledge to help our friends and allies in need to the best of our ability and stand in solidarity with nations around the world at this difficult time,\" said Fahrettin Altun, the presidential communications director.\n\nPresident Donald Trump says states should \"seriously consider\" reopening their public schools before the end of the academic year, even though dozens already have said it would be unsafe for students to return until the summer or fall.\n\nTrump made the comments Monday in a call with governors discussing how to reopen their economies, among other topics.\n\nNone of the governors on the call responded to the suggestion, according to a recording obtained by The Associated Press.\n\nTrump made the comments as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention worked to finalize guidelines for reopening the economy. For schools, that included putting students' desks 6 feet apart, serving meals in the classroom instead of the cafeteria and closing playgrounds.\n\nReopening schools is considered key to getting the economy moving again. Without a safe place for their kids, many parents would have difficulty returning to work.\n\nBut some education officials say opening schools quickly would bring major risk and little reward, especially since the end of the school year is approaching.\n\nWASHINGTON -- The White House released new guidelines aimed at answering criticism that America's coronavirus testing has been too slow, and President Donald Trump tried to pivot toward a focus on \"reopening\" the nation.\n\nStill, there were doubts from public health experts that the White House's new testing targets were sufficient.\n\nMonday's developments were meant to fill critical gaps in White House plans to begin easing restrictions, ramping up testing for the virus while shifting the president's focus toward recovery from the economic collapse caused by the outbreak. The administration unveiled a \"blueprint\" for states to scale up their testing in the coming week -- a tacit admission, despite public statements to the contrary, that testing capacity and availability over the past two months have been lacking.\n\nThe new testing targets would ensure states had enough COVID-19 tests available to sample at least 2.6% of their populations each month -- a figure already met by a majority of states. Areas that have been harder hit by the virus would be able to test at double that rate, or higher, the White House said.\n\nTOKYO -- The head of Japan's medical association thinks it will be difficult to hold the Olympics without an effective coronavirus vaccine.\n\n\"I hope vaccines and drugs will be developed as soon as possible,\" Japan Medical Association President Yoshitake Yokokura said Tuesday.\n\nJapan and the International Olympic Committee agreed to postpone the Tokyo 2020 Summer Games until July next year due to the coronavirus pandemic. Japan is under a monthlong state of emergency amid a rapid increase of infections throughout the country, where hospitals are overburdened.\n\nYokokura did not say whether he opposes the Olympics without a vaccine.\n\n\"The key is a situation with the infections at that point. If the infections are under control only in Japan, it will still be difficult to hold the games unless the pandemic is over in the rest of the world,\" he said.\n\nExperts have said it could take 12-18 months or longer to develop a vaccine that is safe and effective for clinical use.\n\nJapan has 13,576 reported virus cases, plus 712 others from a cruise ship quarantined near Tokyo earlier this year, with 389 deaths, the health ministry said Tuesday.\n\nNEW YORK -- JetBlue will start requiring all customers to wear a face covering while traveling, the airline announced Monday.\n\nPassengers will be required to cover their nose and mouth during check-in, boarding, in flight and while deplaning. The policy goes into effect May 4.\n\n\"This is the new flying etiquette,\" Joanna Geraghty, president and chief operating officer of JetBlue, said in a news release. \"Onboard, cabin air is well circulated and cleaned through filters every few minutes but this is a shared space where we have to be considerate of others.\"\n\nDelta announced earlier Monday that it will require flight attendants to wear masks starting Tuesday, and American Airlines said Monday night it will mandate the same beginning May 1. The airlines will join United, JetBlue and Frontier in requiring masks be worn by flight attendants during flights.\n\nThe new regulations follow outrage on social media over a crowded American Airlines flight with many passengers not wearing masks. The Association of Flight Attendants, which represents United flight attendants but not those at JetBlue, American, Delta or Southwest, asked the federal government to require that passengers wear masks.\n\nFollow AP news coverage of the coronavirus pandemic at https://apnews.com/VirusOutbreak and https://apnews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak",

Video showed fierce rain and wind swaying coconut trees, rattling tin roofs and obscuring visibility. Some towns lost power.\n\nTyphoon Vongfong was packing maximum sustained winds of 150 kilometers per hour (93 miles per hour) and was forecast to blow northwestward and barrel across densely populated eastern provinces and cities before exiting in the north Sunday.\n\nThe Philippines remains under a lockdown to fight the coronavirus.\n\nGovernors say social distancing will be nearly impossible in emergency shelters. Some shelters are now serving as quarantine facilities, and they may have to be turned back into emergency storm shelters.\n\nThe typhoon is forecast to largely bypass Manila, but authorities say tents being used as temporarily medical facilities in the capital might be damaged in strong winds.\n\nCOPENHAGEN, Denmark -- Commuters in Denmark must practice social distancing in trains, subways and buses and sit at least one meter (3.3. feet) apart when on the same bench and avoid face-to-face seating.\n\nTransportation Minister Benny Engelbrecht said Friday he expects the capacity in public transportation to reach up to 70% of normal capacity.\n\n\"Traffic companies, customers and workplaces share the responsibility for making public transport work efficiently and health-wise correctly now that we again expect more passengers,\" he said.\n\nEngelbrecht urged, among others, people that when possible to avoid rush hour, walk or bicycle \"to give other travellers, who do not have the same opportunity, better space in public transport.\"\n\nPublic transportation in Denmark has functioned during the lockdown that started March 11 but trains, subway and buses have been almost empty. In recent weeks, the Scandinavian country has slowed reopened.\n\nTOKYO -- Experts on the Japanese coronavirus task force approved a government plan Thursday lifting an ongoing state of emergency ahead of schedule in most areas, except for Tokyo and several other high-risk areas.\n\nEconomy Minister Yasutoshi Nishimura, after attending the task force meeting, said the experts approved a plan to lift the state of emergency in 39 of the country's 47 prefectures, while keeping the measure in place for eight others, including Tokyo, Osaka, Kyoto and Hokkaido, where risks still remain high.\n\nPrime Minister Shinzo Abe declared a month-long state of emergency on April 7 in Tokyo and six other urban prefectures and later expanded it to the whole country through May 31. With signs of the infections slowing, Abe is seeking to relax the measure while balancing disease prevention and the economy. Japan now has more than 16,000 confirmed cases, with about 680 deaths. The number of new cases has significantly decreased nationwide.\n\nAbe is expected to explain details later Thursday. Experts are also expected to provide basis for easing the measure, as well as its possible tightening in case of a resurgence of the outbreak.\n\nThe Ehime prefecture in western Japan, which was hit by an in-hospital outbreak of about 20 nurses, patients and their families a day earlier, will have the state of emergency lifted on the condition containment measures are taken and the infections are closely investigated, Nishimura said.\n\nExperts and officials have urged people to adopt \"new lifestyles\" and continue practicing distancing measures such as remote working and avoid out-of-town trips, even after the state of emergency is lifted.\n\nUNITED NATIONS -- United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres is urging governments, civil society and health authorities to urgently address mental health needs arising from the coronavirus pandemic, warning that psychological suffering is increasing.\n\nHe pointed to \"grief at the loss of loved ones, shock at the loss of jobs, isolation and restrictions on movement, difficult family dynamics, and uncertainty and fear for the future.\"\n\nThe U.N. chief said in a video message late Wednesday launching a policy briefing that \"after decades of neglect and under-investment in mental health services, the COVID-19 pandemic is now hitting families and communities with additional mental stress.\"\n\nGuterres said those most at risk and in need of help are front-line health care workers, older people, adolescents, young people, those with pre-existing mental health conditions, and those caught up in conflict and crisis.\n\nHe said \"mental health services are an essential part of all government responses to COVID-19\" and must be expanded and fully funded.\n\nCANBERRA, Australia -- Australia says it will continue to push for an inquiry into the origins of the coronavirus, even if it hurts trade relations with China.\n\nPrime Minister Scott Morrison had been accused of playing \"deputy sheriff\" to the United States after calling for the inquiry. On Thursday, he brushed off the criticism.\n\n\"We have always been independent, we have always pursued our national interests, and we always will,\" he told reporters. \"We will always be Australians in how we engage with the rest of the world, and we will always stand our ground when it comes to the things that we believe in and the values that we uphold.\"\n\nChina has suspended beef imports from four abattoirs and plans to impose tariffs on Australian barley, after warning the inquiry could harm two-way trade ties.\n\nBEIJING -- China reported three new coronavirus cases Thursday while moving to reopen for business and schools.\n\nThe National Health Commission said 101 people remain in treatment for COVID-19, while 716 are isolated and being monitored for being suspected cases or for having tested positive for the virus without showing symptoms.\n\nChina plans to restart classes for most students on June 1, with other grades to resume at a later date, depending on conditions. No announcement has been made on when university classes will resume.\n\nChina has reported a total of 4,633 deaths among 82,929 cases of the virus.\n\nFollow AP news coverage of the coronavirus pandemic at https://apnews.com/VirusOutbreak and https://apnews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak.",

The plant has been closed since April 22, and the Iowa Department of Public\n\nHealth reports 444 workers have tested positive for the virus. The plant is Arkansas-based Tyson's largest pork processing operation, with the ability to process 19,500 hogs per day. That accounts for 3.9% of the U.S. pork processing capacity, according to the National Pork Board.\n\nAll those who will return to work have been tested for COVID-19, the disease cased by the virus, the company said. Those who have tested positive will remain on sick leave until they can return to work.\n\nNEW DELHI -- Indian authorities have decided to shut down liquor shops in Mumbai, India's financial capital which is the worst hit by the coronavirus pandemic, after the police found it extremely difficult to control the surging crowds at the vends over the past two days.\n\nMunicipal Commissioner Praveen Pardeshi in an order late Tuesday said that only groceries and pharmacies will be allowed to be opened in Mumbai which is battling a rapidly rising number of coronavirus cases.\n\nMumbai currently has around 10,000 positive cases and 387 deaths. On an average it has been getting more than 400 cases per day.\n\nAfter some lockdown restrictions were eased in India on Monday, thousands turned up at liquor stores across the country without following social distancing guidelines. This led the authorities to shut many of the liquor shops. In some places, the police had to resort to baton-charge to disperse crowds.\n\nAuthorities in India's capital imposed a special tax of 70% on liquor purchases on Tuesday to dissuade huge gatherings of thirsty drinkers at stores. The new tax is called the \"special corona fee.\"\n\nIndia's total positive cases have touched 46,711 with 13,161 recoveries and 1,583 deaths, according to India's Health Ministry.\n\nFollow AP news coverage of the coronavirus pandemic at https://apnews.com/VirusOutbreak and https://apnews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak.",

The new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms for most people. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness or death.\n\nTOP OF THE HOUR:\n\n-- As United States, Europe reopen more, big nations see rising virus toll.\n\n-- Virus cases in India surge past 100,000.\n\n-- Unemployment claims in Britain jumped by 69% in April.\n\n-- Human Rights Watch urges Qatar to release certain prisoners amid virus outbreak.\n\n-- Probe suggests many more virus-related deaths in Mexico City than official count.\n\nNEW DELHI, India -- The number of coronavirus cases in India has surged past 100,000, and infections are on the rise in home states of the migrant workers who left cities and towns during the nationwide lockdown.\n\nIndia's Health Ministry on Tuesday reported a total of 101,139 cases and 3,163 deaths due to COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus. Almost 39,000 people have recovered from the illness.\n\nSince last week, India has averaged almost 4,000 new cases a day. The country's worst-affected state, Maharashtra, has reported more than 35,000 cases and 1,249 fatalities.\n\nThe recent surge in recorded infections has largely been attributed to an increase in testing. Health experts, however, worry that India is still lagging behind in that area. The country has one of the lowest testing rates in the world, with only 1.5 samples tested per 1,000 people, compared to 32 in the United States.\n\nIndia extended its lockdown on Sunday to May 31 but gave power to states to allow the reopening of businesses to spur economic activity.\n\nLONDON -- Unemployment claims in Britain jumped by 69% last month as the COVID-19 pandemic took hold and hit the labor market.\n\nThe Office of National Statistics says jobless claims surged by 856,000 to 2.1 million in April as compared to March.\n\nJonathan Athow, deputy national statistician for economic statistics at the ONS, says the figures covered only the first weeks of the lockdown.\n\nHe says employment for the month held up because furloughed workers still count as being employed but \"hours worked fell sharply in late March, especially in sectors such as hospitality and construction.''\n\nDUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- Human Rights Watch is urging the Arab Gulf state of Qatar to release older prisoners and those held for nonviolent offenses amid a coronavirus outbreak in the country's central prison.\n\nThe rights group interviewed six non-Qatari detainees who said several prisoners were suspected of contracting COVID-19.\n\nQatar's communication office responded to the Human Rights Watch report on Tuesday, confirming 12 prisoners had the virus in the Central Prison.\n\nThe prisoners told the rights group that authorities isolated the block where the outbreak occurred, but not before transferring some detainees to other overcrowded and unsanitary sections of the prison. They said their block has eight bathrooms for 150 prisoners, and people are sleeping on the floor with no ability to socially distance.\n\nThe government said the 12 people who tested positive for COVID-19 were treated at a medical facility on site, with two transferred out for additional care before being sent back to prison once fully recovered.\n\nQatar said inmates have received gloves and masks and undergo regular health checkups. In April, Qatar's ruler pardoned more than 500 inmates to reduce the number of people imprisoned amid the pandemic.\n\nQatar has nearly 34,000 confirmed cases of the virus, including 15 deaths.\n\nMEXICO CITY -- A registry of death certificates in Mexico City suggests there have been 4,577 cases in which doctors mentioned coronavirus or COVID-19 as a possible or probable cause of death, more than three times the official count.\n\nThe federal government acknowledges only 1,332 confirmed deaths in Mexico City due to COVID-19 since the pandemic began.\n\nMexicans Against Corruption said in a report Monday it obtained access to a database of death certificates issued in Mexico City between March 18 and May 12. It showed that in explanatory notes attached to 4,577 death certificates, doctors included the words \"SARS,\" \"COV2,\" \"COV,\" \"Covid 19,\" or \"new coronavirus.\"\n\nThe virus' technical name is SARS-CoV-2. The notes the group counted included terms such as \"suspected,\" \"probable,\" or \"possible\" when describing the virus' role in the deaths. In 3,209 certificates, it was listed as a suspected contributing factor along with other causes of death, like pneumonia, respiratory failure, septic shock or multiple organ failure.\n\nMexico City Mayor Claudia Sheinbaum has acknowledged there are more virus-related deaths than officially reported, and has said a special commission will review the death figures. Her office did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the new report.\n\nHONG KONG -- Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam says the territory is ramping up coronavirus testing, especially for workers at the busy international airport and caregivers at homes for the elderly and disabled.\n\nLam said Tuesday tests would be increased from 4,500 to 7,000 daily with both the government health department and university laboratories taking part. Hong Kong has gone several days without new local infections, but a recent cluster among three members of the same family has increased concerns about those who show no symptoms passing the virus on to others, something authorities hope can be remedied with increased testing.\n\nA densely populated city of more than 7 million people just across the border from mainland China, Hong Kong has reported 1,055 COVID-19 cases and four deaths.\n\nSALEM, Ore. -- The Oregon Supreme Court halted a rural judge's order which had tossed out statewide coronavirus restrictions imposed by Gov. Kate Brown in a case brought by churches arguing the Democrat exceeded her authority.\n\nBaker County Circuit Judge Matthew Shirtcliff had ruled that Brown erred by not seeking the Legislature's approval to extend the stay-at-home orders beyond a 28-day limit. The Supreme Court's late Monday decision stays Shirtcliff's decree pending review by all the high court justices.\n\nIn a statement, Brown praised the Supreme Court action.\n\n\"There are no shortcuts for us to return to life as it was before this pandemic. Moving too quickly could return Oregon to the early days of this crisis, when we braced ourselves for hospitals to be overfilled,\" she said.\n\nBEIJING -- China reported six new coronavirus cases Tuesday, a day after President Xi Jinping announced his country would provide $2 billion to help respond to the outbreak and its economic fallout.\n\nThree of the new cases were listed as imported. Two were registered as local infections in Jilin province, and another local case was identified in Hubei province, where China's outbreak was centered.\n\nAuthorities in Hubei carried out nucleic acid tests on more than 1.5 million people between May 11 and May 17. More than 72.5% of tests were administered in Wuhan, where authorities plan to eventually test all 11 million residents as part of safeguards against a second wave of virus cases.\n\nWuhan and surrounding cities in Hubei accounted for the bulk of China's reported 82,690 cases and 4,634 deaths from COVID-19.\n\nXi's appearance via video link at the World Health Assembly on Monday came amid finger-pointing between the United States and China over the pandemic, and the World Health Organization bowing to calls from most of its member states to launch an independent inquiry into how it managed the response to the coronavirus.\n\nSEOUL, South Korea -- South Korea has reported 13 new coronavirus cases, a possible sign that a recent outbreak in the capital area is stabilizing as officials prepare to reopen schools this week.\n\nFigures announced by the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Tuesday brought national totals to 11,078 cases and 263 deaths.\n\nNine of the new cases were from Seoul and nearby regions, where dozens of infections have been linked to club goers who went out in early May as the country began relaxing social distancing measures.\n\nVice Health Minister Kim Gang-lip urged vigilance to maintain hard-won gains against the virus and called for education officials to double check preventive measures with high school seniors returning to school on Wednesday.\n\nFollow AP news coverage of the coronavirus pandemic at https://apnews.com/VirusOutbreak and https://apnews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak",

    "The second virus wave: How bad will it be as lockdowns ease?": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "ROME -- From the marbled halls of Italy to the wheat fields of Kansas, health authorities are increasingly warning that the question isn't whether a second wave of coronavirus infections and deaths will hit, but when -- and how badly.\n\nAs more countries and U.S. states chaotically re-open for business -- including some where infection rates are still rising -- managing future cases is as important as preventing them.\n\nIn India, which partly eased its virus lockdown this week, health authorities scrambled Wednesday to contain an outbreak at a massive market. Experts in hard-hit Italy, which just began easing some restrictions, warned lawmakers that a new wave of virus infections and deaths is coming. They urged intensified efforts to identify possible new victims, monitor their symptoms and trace their contacts.\n\nGermany warned of a second and even a third wave, and threatened to re-impose virus restrictions if new cases can't be contained. German Chancellor Angela Merkel was meeting Wednesday with the country's 16 governors to discuss further loosening restrictions that have crippled Europe's largest economy.\n\n\"There will be a second wave, but the problem is to which extent. Is it a small wave or a big wave? It's too early to say,\" said Olivier Schwartz, head of the virus and immunity unit at France's Pasteur Institute.\n\nMany areas are still struggling with the first wave of this pandemic. Brazil for the first time locked down a large city, the capital of Maranh\u00e3o state. Across the ocean, the number of confirmed coronavirus cases in Africa has shot up 42% in the past week and infections are expected to surpass 50,000 on Wednesday.\n\nAn Associated Press analysis, meanwhile, found that U.S. infection rates outside the New York City area are in fact rising, notably in rural areas. It found New York's progress against the virus was overshadowing increasing infections elsewhere.\n\n\"Make no mistakes: This virus is still circulating in our community, perhaps even more now than in previous weeks,\" said Linda Ochs, director of the Health Department in Shawnee County, Kansas.\n\nThe virus is known to have infected more than 3.6 million and killed more than 251,000 people, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins that all experts agree is an undercount due to limited testing, uneven victim criteria and deliberate concealment by some governments.\n\nThe U.S. has seen over 71,000 deaths amid its 1.2 million infections, and Europe has endured over 144,000 reported coronavirus deaths. Behind each of those vast numbers is a family in pain.\n\n\"Burying both parents at the same time? It's hard,\" said Desmond Tolbert, who lost his mother and father in rural southwest Georgia. Because they had the virus, he couldn't be with them when they died.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump, with his eye on being reelected in November, is pushing hard to ease state stay-at-home orders and resuscitate the U.S. economy, which has seen over 30 million workers lose their jobs in less than two months. Trump is expected to wind down the country's coronavirus task force, possibly within weeks, despite concerns that states aren't being careful enough as they reopen.\n\nA century ago, the Spanish flu epidemic's second wave was far deadlier than its first, in part because authorities allowed mass gatherings from Philadelphia to San Francisco.\n\nAs Italy's lockdown eased this week, Dr. Silvio Brusaferro, president of the Superior Institute of Health, urged \"a huge investment\" of resources to train medical personnel to monitor possible new cases. He said tracing apps -- which are being built by dozens of countries and companies and touted as a possible technological solution -- aren't enough to manage future waves of infection.\n\n\"We are not out of the epidemic. We are still in it. I don't want people to think there's no more risk and we go back to normal,\" said Dr. Giovanni Rezza, the head of the institute's infectious disease department.\n\nIn Germany, authorities may reimpose restrictions on any county that reports 50 new cases for every 100,000 inhabitants within the past week.\n\nLothar Wieler, head of Germany's national disease control center, said scientists \"know with great certainty that there will be a second wave\" of infections but said Germany is well-prepared to deal with it. The country has been hailed for testing widely and has suffered four times fewer deaths than Italy or Britain, which both have smaller populations.\n\nBritain has begun recruiting 18,000 people to trace contacts of people infected. British officials acknowledge that they should have done more testing and tracing earlier and could learn from South Korea, which brought its outbreak under control by rigorously testing, tracing and isolating infected people.\n\nSouth Africa, which has years of experience tracking HIV and other infections, is already testing and tracing widely. Turkey has an army of 5,800 teams of contact tracers who have tracked down and tested nearly half a million people linked to infected cases. Israel plans to conduct 100,000 antibody tests to determine how widespread the coronavirus outbreak has been and prevent a second wave.\n\nIndia was concentrated on the immediate drama around the market in the southern city of Chennai, which is now tied to at least 1,000 virus cases. Another 7,000 people connected to the now-shuttered Koyambedu market are being traced and quarantined. Experts are worried about a health catastrophe in a country of 1.3 billion people with an already stressed medical system.\n\nNew confirmed daily infections in the U.S. exceed 20,000, and deaths per day are well over 1,000, according to the Johns Hopkins tally. And public health officials warn that the failure to lower the infection rate could lead to many more deaths -- perhaps tens of thousands -- as people venture out and businesses reopen.\n\n\"The faster we reopen, the lower the economic cost -- but the higher the human cost, because the more lives lost,\" New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo sai d. \"That, my friends, is the decision we are really making.\"\n\nTrump acknowledged the toll but argued that keeping the U.S. economy closed carries deadly costs of its own, such as drug abuse and suicides.\n\n\"I'm not saying anything is perfect, and yes, will some people be affected? Yes. Will some people be affected badly? Yes. But we have to get our country open and we have to get it open soon,\" he said during a visit to Arizona in which he did not don a face mask.\n\nCharlton reported from Paris and Blake from Bangkok. Associated Press journalists around the world contributed to this report.\n\nFollow AP pandemic coverage at http://apnews.com/VirusOutbreak and https://apnews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak",

    "These coronavirus 'carriers' take test samples around London": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "A bicycle courier, Gee zips from the city's hospitals and clinics with medical samples of the virus, taking them to laboratories for processing.\n\nGee faces a two-fold fear: exposure to the coronavirus and whether he will have a job after the outbreak. The British government considers medical couriers to be essential workers during the pandemic, but Gee faces being laid off when it is over because the outbreak has hurt the other business of the diagnostics firm he works for.\n\nThousands of other \"gig economy\" workers, including ride-hailing service drivers and food couriers, also are torn between safety and sustenance. As Britain's economy stalled when the country went into lockdown on March 23, sending unemployment to a two-decade high, they have scrambled to keep working despite the risks.\n\n\"There's a lot of anxiety,\" Gee said as he paused between deliveries. \"Everyone else was going in one direction, staying at home. And I was going in the other direction.\n\n\"You just don't know if it's something you're going to catch,\" he said. \"I can't afford to get the virus and be off sick, because if that was the case, I only get the statutory sick pay, which is \u00a394 ($115) week. So it is very much a case of just having to get up and get in and work, and just hope that I don't catch it.\"\n\nGee and his colleagues say they haven't been given adequate protection for going into hospitals, clinics and doctors' offices where they collect swab samples to be tested for the highly contagious virus. Their employer gave them gloves, cotton masks and hand gel, but Gee says the supply runs out quickly.\n\nHe feels unprotected when he sees the equipment worn by staff at the facilities he visits, including those at a temporary drive-thru test site.\n\n\"They had the full visor, the gown, the gloves -- very much the full kit,\" he said. \"They're taking samples from doctors and nurses that are driving through. And then once they're finished, they're handing us a big bag of ... suspected COVID samples. And there I am in my thin gloves and my little cotton mask meant to transport this back to our lab. It made me feel very uneasy.\"\n\nGee said he is not just concerned about his own health.\n\n\"We're talking about the potential for spreading the virus. We are going into hospitals and clinics. And later on in the day, we're going into cancer hospitals, we're going into fertility clinics, we're going into elderly wards,\" he added.\n\nHe's not being alarmist. While attention has understandably focused on the risks taken by front-line medical workers, more than 100 of whom have died in the U.K. from COVID-19, many other workers also face danger. Britain's Office for National Statistics found that security guards, chefs, cabbies and bus drivers all had higher coronavirus death rates than health care workers.\n\nThe riskiest jobs are often low-paid, insecure and ineligible for a government furlough program that is temporarily paying 80% of the salary of 8 million British employees.\n\nMany gig-economy workers only have welfare payments to fall back on. Claims for Britain's main welfare benefit soared by 69% in April to 2.1 million, the highest level since the 1990s. Construction, hospitality and retail sectors saw some of the biggest falls in job numbers.\n\nWhile most stores and restaurants remain shut, some food outlets have continued to offer delivery, providing some work -- and risk -- for drivers like Hanna-Beth Scaife, who works for a fast-food delivery firm in northeast England.\n\nScaife said she has often delivered to homes where \"there would be a notice on the door saying, 'Please step back, leave food at the door. Do not knock. We have symptoms.'\"\n\n\"I don't think when you go and order your takeaway, you realize what kind of a risk your driver is putting themself at,\" she said.\n\nGee and Scaife belong to the Independent Workers Union of Great Britain, which has campaigned for gig economy workers. In 2016, it won a British court ruling that Uber drivers are employees, rather than independent contractors, and thus entitled to a minimum wage, paid vacation and sick pay. Uber is appealing to the U.K. Supreme Court.\n\nThe union is challenging Gee's employer, The Doctors Laboratory, which said this month it plans to fire 10 of its 140 medical couriers, including Gee. It says the company also failed to provide adequate protective equipment and refused a request by couriers to be tested. The couriers are currently voting on whether to strike.\n\nThe Doctors Laboratory said in a statement that \"proposed redundancies are not a consideration ever made lightly.\" But it said \"our laboratories have experienced a reduction in activity over the past months, which means there is less demand for the sample transportation our courier fleet delivers.\"\n\nThe firm said its health and safety protocols \"are compliant with current regulations\" and are kept under review.\n\n\"It is inconceivable that we would deliberately expose any of our workforce, of whom our courier fleet is an important part, to undue risk at any time but especially now,\" it said.\n\nAs Britain slowly eases its lockdown, the streets are starting to fill up again. Gee worries that he soon won't be able to socially distance on his daily commute by train. And he says talks with the company over the layoffs have stalled.\n\n\"The clock's ticking down; in two weeks' time, we could be out of work,\" he said.\n\nDespite his anxiety, Gee says he feels lucky to have been working during the outbreak. He has enjoyed the \"guilty pleasure\" of cycling through an eerily empty London.\n\n\"With all the chaos going on around us, we had the streets to ourselves,\" he said.",

    "This is his quest: An actor serenades the front-line workers": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "NEW YORK -- It's a stunning sound, emerging amid the clanging and the whooping and the banging and the honking at 7 p.m. each night as New Yorkers cheer front-line workers: the velvety, buttery baritone of Brian Stokes Mitchell.\n\nFor decades, Mitchell's voice has been one of the most celebrated in the Broadway theater, evoking goosebumps in musicals like \"Kiss Me, Kate,\" for which he won a Tony, and \"Man of La Mancha,\" in which he played Don Quixote. Now, with Broadway's houses shuttered due to the coronavirus, the voice rings out from a fifth-floor apartment on the Upper West Side -- fittingly on Broadway, a couple miles up from the theater district.\n\n\"This is my quest,\" Mitchell sings, leaning precariously out his window, launching directly into the meatiest part of \"The Impossible Dream.\"\n\n\"To follow that star. No matter how hopeless, no matter how far ...\"\n\nBelow, and across the avenue in their apartments, neighbors cheer. But Mitchell, 62, is looking to serenade crews of ambulances, fire engines, police cars, or medical workers from the nearby urgent care facility. When they do stop and listen -- as a city bus did recently -- Mitchell sings directly to them. And when people clap, he sweeps his arms over the workers, as if to say: \"Not me. Them.\"\n\nMitchell's gratitude, expressed nightly the last few weeks, stems from a very personal ordeal. He himself is a survivor of the coronavirus, falling ill in late March. One night, he had a fever nearing 105 degrees, and almost was hospitalized. He's been symptom-free for three weeks.\n\n\"I'd been going to the window to applaud for the health care workers like everybody else in New York,\" he says. \"Then one night I spontaneously thought, 'Oh, I think my lungs feel like I can sing now.'\"\n\nAnd so, he did. He thought it would be a one-night gig. He was mistaken. People kept coming.\n\n\"To fight for the right, without question or pause, to be willing to march into hell for a heavenly cause!\" Mitchell smiles as he repeats the words, amazed at how appropriate they are for medical workers fighting an \"unbeatable foe.\"\n\n\"People think it's just called 'The Impossible Dream,' but it's also called 'The Quest,'\" he says. \"It's not about DOING the impossible. It's about trying.\"\n\nIt is, of course, a terrible time for the theater community, with arts institutions suffering severe economic loss. Mitchell is chairman of The Actors Fund, which helps performing arts and entertainment professionals. He's donating all profits from his latest album, \"Plays With Music,\" to the fund.\n\nWhen the city shut down, Mitchell was working on numerous projects. \"Everything was canceled,\" he says. \"I have no idea when they'll come back. A year? Six months? Unfortunately I think our sector will be one of the last to come back fully.\"\n\nFor now, though, Mitchell feels busy with his unpaid gig. \"Broadway's closed, but someone's still singing on Broadway!\" he quips.\n\nHis performance ends with a flourish: \"And the world will be better for this, that one man, scorned and covered with scars, still strove, with his last ounce of courage, to reach the unreachable star!\"\n\nMitchell, though, adapts the lyrics to squeeze in words like \"one first responder and health-care worker.\" The audience cheers.\n\n\"It's three minutes,\" says onlooker Sari Rubin, \"of me remembering that there's good in the world.\"\n\nAssociated Press video journalist Jessie Wardarski contributed from New York.\n\nWhile nonstop global news about the effects of the coronavirus has become commonplace, so, too, are the stories about the kindness of strangers and individuals who have sacrificed for others. \"One Good Thing\" is an Associated Press continuing series reflecting these acts of kindness.\n\nFollow Jocelyn Noveck on Twitter at www.Twitter.com/JocelynNoveckAP",

        "authors": [],
        "body": "The PGA Tour has outlined a health plan for its return that includes players testing for the new coronavirus both at home and when they arrive at tournaments\n\nPlayers, caddies and key personnel will be tested once a week at tournaments and have their temperatures taken every day as part of a PGA Tour plan to limit the risk of the new coronavirus when golf resumes next month in Texas.\n\nThe plan offers a glimpse into significant changes for golf's return, from the elimination of pro-ams to designated hotels to the availability of charter planes that get players and their caddies from one tournament to the next.\n\nThe first trial is scheduled for the Charles Schwab Challenge at Colonial in Fort Worth on June 11-14.\n\nThe key components are testing, social distancing on and off the golf course and creating what the tour referred to as a \"bubble\" of essential people that will be tested at tournaments.\n\n\"We're not going to play if we can't do it in a safe and healthy environmental for all our constituents,\" said Tyler Dennis, the tour's chief of operations.\n\nHe also said the tour will not go forward with its testing if it takes away from resources in the city where it plays.\n\nPlayers and caddies will be sent pre-travel tests, and they will be given the RT-PCR test for COVID-19 when they arrive at tournaments. The test, authorized last month by the Food and Drug Administration, involves a nasal swab. Results typically take a couple of days, and the tour is hopeful of using local labs for a quicker turnaround.\n\nAnyone who tests positive will have to withdraw from the tournament and self-isolate for 10 days, provided there are no further symptoms and they get two negative tests 24 hours apart.\n\nThe tour said it would give players and caddies a stipend to pay for the self-isolation. Andy Levinson, the senior vice president for tournament administration, said the tour would pay for all testing material.\n\nBeyond testing, the tour is recommending players stay in a designated hotel and practice social distancing as if they were still at home by avoiding eating at restaurants or meeting at bars.\n\nOn the golf course, players are to handle their own clubs and let their caddies rake bunkers and remove the pins, wiping down both after they're done with them.\n\nAnother change: No shaking hands after the round.\n\nAlong with no fans for at least the first four tournaments, the tour is not allowing family members and only limited support staff, such as trainers and instructors. All would be subject to the same level of testing -- a health questionnaire and thermal screening every day.\n\nLevinson estimates key personnel -- players, caddies, officials, clubhouse staff -- amounts to 400 people.\n\nFor the charter flights, all passengers must take a viral test 24 hours before leaving, and then be tested again when they arrive at the next event.\n\nThe tour said about 25 players remain overseas and recommended they arrive at least two weeks ahead of the tournament to meet the federal 14-day quarantine requirement.\n\nA player hotel will be designated, although players would be allowed to stay in RVs if they have them, rental homes the tour approves and their own homes if they live in the area.\n\nFour tournaments without fans will be Colonial, the RBC Heritage at Hilton Head, the Travelers Championship in Connecticut and the Rocket Mortgage Classic in Detroit. The tour said it will decide after that whether it's safe for a limited number of fans.",

    "Tourists enter reopened Grand Canyon despite virus concerns": {

        "body": "GRAND CANYON NATIONAL PARK, Ariz. -- Tourists appeared ready to roam Grand Canyon National Park again after it partially reopened Friday, despite objections from Navajo officials and others that it could hurt efforts to control the coronavirus.\n\nBy 7:30 a.m., more than two dozen people were enjoying some viewpoints along the South Rim.\n\nAmong them were friends Jack Covington from Texas and Judy Smith from Tucson, Arizona. They had planned their trip to the Grand Canyon a year ago since Covington had never seen it. They changed their plans and were visiting other places in Northern Arizona when they found out the park would be open.\n\n\"We figured we'd go for an adventure and we got lucky,\" Smith said.\n\nPark officials said the South Rim entrance will only open from 6-10 a.m. through Monday. Visitors have limited daytime access to viewpoints, picnic areas and some restrooms. The east entrance to the South Rim will remain closed. The North Rim remains closed.\n\n\"This initial reopening phase will increase access to our public lands in a responsible way by offering the main feature of the park for the public, the view of the canyon, while reducing the potential exposure of COVID-19 to our nearly 2,500 residents,\" Grand Canyon National Park Superintendent Ed Keable said.\n\nCommercial services within the park remain closed. Visitors were told to bring food, water and hand sanitizer. There are no overnight accommodations available.\n\nThe National Park Service says it is working with federal, state and local public health authorities to closely monitor the pandemic and using a phased approach to increase access on a park-by-park basis.\n\nHowever, officials on the hard-hit Navajo Nation, which stretches into northern Arizona, expressed disappointment at the reopening. There have been at least 3,632 positive cases and 127 deaths on the reservation, which also includes portions of New Mexico and Utah.\n\n\"We welcome the economic benefits that tourists bring, but we are also fearful of the potential negative impacts and had hoped that when the Grand Canyon closed on April 1, the park would remain closed until our positive COVID-19 numbers have flattened,\" Navajo Nation President Jonathan Nez said.\n\nThe Sierra Club also cited the Navajo Nation in its criticism of the reopening. Alicyn Gitlin of the Sierra Club's Grand Canyon Chapter said it could result in a \"patrolling and enforcement nightmare.\"\n\n\"Cases in Coconino County where Grand Canyon's South Rim is located are still rising,\" Gitlin said. \"The large population that lives at Grand Canyon and all nearby communities are put at risk by this move.\"\n\nFor most people, the new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia and death. -- -- -- --\n\nAssociated Press photographer Matt York contributed to this report.",

    "Triple combination therapy shows promise for COVID-19 patients with less severe illnesses": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "As scientists scramble to find COVID-19 treatments among existing approved drugs, researchers in Hong Kong may have found a winning combination. Early data shows that a triple antiviral therapy may be safe and effective in treating patients with mild to moderate cases of COVID-19, according to a study published Friday in Lancet.\n\nAll three drugs used in the study are already approved to treat other illnesses. Interferon beta 1b is a drug commonly used to treat multiple sclerosis, lopinavir-ritonavir is an anti-retroviral medication used to treat HIV and ribavirin is commonly used to treat hepatitis C.\n\nResearchers from six different hospitals in Hong Kong assigned over 120 patients to one of two treatment groups. They gave one group of patients suffering mild to moderate COVID-19 symptoms a cocktail of all three drugs, and gave the other group only lopinavir-ritonavir.\n\nDoctors tested the amount of virus in samples taken from the patient's nose, saliva, back of the throat and stool on a machine that can detect the presence of viral genetic material.\n\nWhen researchers compared the two groups, they found that the typical patient given the three drug-combo tested negative for the virus five days earlier than those who received just a single drug. In addition, the triple therapy treatment group had shorter hospital stays and reported that their symptoms disappeared much faster than the control group.\n\nThe study offers a promising sign that the drug cocktail helped their bodies beat back the virus faster.\n\nExperts are cautiously optimistic about these results, but pointed out that more rigorous studies will be needed to know for sure if this drug combination works.\n\nThey believe that one of the driving factors in the success of the triple combination therapy groups was early treatment. Treatment was started within seven days of symptom onset for the majority of patients in both groups.\n\n\"The most important thing in treating any viral diseases is that you want to treat it early. If you don't treat it early, you're probably going to miss the window to treat it. And then you have to deal with its complications,\" said Dr. David Bernstein, vice chair of medicine for clinical trials and chief of hepatology and director of the Sandra Atlas Bass Center for Liver Diseases at Northwell Health.\n\nAnother welcome finding was the lack of significant negative side effects. The main negative side effects of the medications were nausea and diarrhea, but there was no difference between the two groups, and none of the patients in the study died.\n\n\"Patients often do not tolerate these medications terribly well,\" said Dr. Nathan Erdmann, an assistant professor in the division of infectious diseases at the University of Alabama at Birmingham.\n\nDr. Todd Ellerin, chief of infectious diseases at South Shore Health agreed: \"Interferons have significant adverse side effects such as flu-like illness and have never really gained traction in and of themselves for the treatment of viral diseases.\"\n\nLopinavir-ritonavir appears to have caused most of the side effects, he said.\n\nHowever, there are some significant issues with the study. Experts say it was too small to draw any definitive conclusions.\n\n\"I will say, at this stage, I would not recommend rapid uptake of this treatment as standard therapy because of the limited sample size,\" said Erdmann.\n\nBernstein agreed, \"This is a first study proving a concept, and now it has to be validated. And it has to be validated in large numbers.\"\n\nAn additional limitation of the study is that only patients with mild to moderate COVD-19 symptoms were examined. This triple combination therapy may not be as effective in people who are severely sick with COVID-19.\n\nExperts also poked holes in the study's design, pointing out that it was not \"blinded,\" meaning both participants and doctors knew which drugs were given, and their optimism about the triple combination treatment may have ultimately influenced the results.\n\n\"It's a severe limitation,\" said Bernstein. \"We would like to see a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.\"\n\nIn a double-blinded, placebo-controlled study neither the participants nor the doctors know which of the participants are given the real treatment or a placebo until the end of the study. This design better protects against researcher bias.\n\nThis brings up another concern, there was \"no placebo arm,\" said Ellerin. \"That may be the biggest issue.\"\n\nInstead of testing the triple combination therapy against a placebo, the researchers tested it against lopinavir-ritonavir -- a drug that was already tested in patients with severe COVID-19 infection and didn't make a significant difference.\n\nNevertheless, despite its shortcomings the study may potentially fill an important gap in the slim number of COVID-19 treatments. In the U.S., doctors currently have nothing to offer patients with mild to moderate symptoms. They are generally sent home to rest and not admitted to the hospital unless they develop severe symptoms.\n\n\"This has the potential to be an outpatient treatment that can be used on patients with mild to moderate disease, but further testing is certainly required,\" said Bernstein. \"I don't think you can go crazy over one particular small study, but let's see what happens and let's hope that there can be further investigation.\"\n\n\"Hopefully, future studies will provide more detail on which of the therapies are primarily responsible for the observed effect, or whether it is in fact the combination that drives the viral clearance,\" Erdmann said.\n\nEllerin added, \"Whether this combination is as effective as other experimental therapies that are currently under investigation or whether there is a better combination out there that could lead to mortality benefits remains to be proven.\"",

        "authors": [],
        "body": "SAN JOSE, Costa Rica -- In the week since Costa Rica began testing truck drivers entering the country from Nicaragua and Panama, 23 who were asymptomatic have tested positive for the new coronavirus and others who showed symptoms were turned away without tests, officials said Thursday.\n\nThe results are another sign that the spread of the virus in Nicaragua could be greater than its government has acknowledged. Nicaragua has reported only 25 confirmed cases and eight deaths. Its government has not imposed social distancing measures and continues to promote mass gatherings.\n\nOn Tuesday, a Nicaraguan truck driver was treated after fainting at the Costa Rican border and later tested positive for the coronavirus. Costa Rican authorities confirmed two other positive tests at a crossing from Nicaragua on the first day of testing last week, but did not immediately respond to a request for a breakdown of drivers' nationalities. They conducted 230 tests that first day.\n\nOfficials have not said how many drivers have been denied entry into Costa Rica for displaying possible symptoms of COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus. The virus results in mild or moderate symptoms for most people, but it can cause more severe illness or death for some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems.\n\nMarvin Altamirano, president of the Nicaraguan Truck Drivers' Association, said that so far it had confirmation of five infected drivers.\n\nOn Thursday, the U.S. Embassy warned U.S. citizens in Nicaragua via Twitter about the coronavirus.\n\n\"Independent health monitors report the actual number of cases is likely much higher,\" the embassy said. \"Independent reporting also suggests the spread of COVID may be impacting the ability of the medical system in areas outside of Managua to effectively respond.\"\n\nThe test results in Costa Rica also suggest that infected truck drivers could be a point of contagion for countries that have left their borders open to commerce. Costa Rica is the only country in Central America known to have mandatory on-site testing of truck drivers at its border crossings. El Salvador, which has imposed the strictest measures in the region aimed at slowing the virus' spread, only takes drivers' temperature at its borders.\n\nCostan Rican health officials take samples from truck drivers at the border crossings and then the drivers have to wait there for the results, which have been coming in less than 24 hours.\n\nCosta Rica's health minister, Daniel Salas, explained previously that when infected drivers are confirmed positive, authorities notify the government of the country they entered from and their home government.\n\nCosta Rica has reported 830 confirmed coronavirus cases in the country and eight deaths.\n\nInternational pressure is growing on the Nicaraguan government to take more measures to slow the virus' spread and provide a more transparent accounting of cases. Despite the official numbers, reports are increasing of overwhelmed hospitals and \"express burials\" of suspected coronavirus victims.\n\nOn Wednesday, Nicaragua's government moved more than 2,800 prisoners to house arrest as reports spread of suspected COVID-19 cases in the country's prisons. The government said it was a gesture for the upcoming Mother's Day celebration.\n\nAssociated Press writer Gabriela Selser in Managua, Nicaragua, contributed to this report.",

        "authors": [],
        "body": "LONDON -- British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is returning to work after recovering from a coronavirus infection that put him in intensive care, with his government facing growing criticism over the deaths and disruption the virus has caused.\n\nJohnson's office said he would be back at his desk in 10 Downing St. on Monday, two weeks after he was released from a London hospital. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab, who has been standing in for the prime minister, said Sunday that Johnson was \"raring to go.\"\n\nBritain has recorded more than 20,000 deaths among people hospitalized with COVID-19, the fifth country in the world to reach that total. Thousands more are thought to have died in nursing homes.\n\nJohnson, 55, spent a week at St. Thomas' Hospital, including three nights in intensive care, where he was given oxygen and watched around the clock by medical workers. After he was released on April 12, he recorded a video message thanking staff at the hospital for saving his life.\n\nJohnson has not been seen in public since, as he recovered at Chequers, the prime minister's country retreat outside London.\n\nOpposition politicians say Britain's coronavirus death toll could have been lower if Johnson's Conservative government had imposed a nationwide lockdown sooner. They are also demanding to know when and how the government will ease the restrictions that were imposed March 23 and run to at least May 7.\n\n\"Decisions need to be taken quicker and communication with the public needs to be clearer,\" opposition Labour Party leader Keir Starmer said in a letter to Johnson.\n\n\"The British public have made great sacrifices to make the lockdown work,\" he wrote. \"They deserve to be part of an adult conversation about what comes next.\"\n\nDespite the toll, which saw another 813 virus-related deaths announced Saturday, some in Britain are growing impatient with the restrictions, which have brought much of the economy and daily life to a halt. Road traffic has begun to creep up after plummeting when the lockdown first was imposed, and some businesses have begun to reopen after implementing social-distancing measures.\n\nScientists say the U.K. has reached the peak of the pandemic but is not yet out of danger. The number of people hospitalized with COVID-19 is declining and the number of daily deaths peaked on April 8.\n\nBut with hundreds of new deaths announced each day, some health experts say Britain could eventually have the highest virus death toll in Europe.\n\nAs fears recede that the health system will be overwhelmed, opponents are criticizing Johnson's government over shortages of protective equipment for medical workers and a lack of testing for the virus. More than 100 infected medical workers have died so far.\n\nThe government has promised to conduct 100,000 coronavirus tests a day by the end of the month, but has yet to reach even 30,000 a day. Increasing testing, so that all people with the virus can be identified and their contacts traced and isolated, is key to loosening the lockdown.\n\nThe British government says all health care staff and other essential workers can be tested if they show symptoms. It is rolling out almost 100 mobile testing sites, staffed by soldiers, to conduct tests at nursing homes, police stations, prisons and other sites.\n\nIn the first two days of expanded testing, however, the online system handling daily demand for the tests had exceeded the supply by early morning.\n\nFollow AP news coverage of the coronavirus pandemic at https://apnews.com/VirusOutbreak and https://apnews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak",

        "body": "LONDON -- British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and his fiancee Carrie Symonds announced the birth of a son on Wednesday, just two days after Johnson returned to work following hospitalization for the coronavirus.\n\nJohnson's office said Symonds gave birth to a \"healthy baby boy at a London hospital\" on Wednesday morning, and both mother and infant were doing well.\n\nJohnson, 55, and Symonds, 32, announced in February that they were engaged and expecting a child together. At the time they said the baby was due in early summer. No wedding date has been announced.\n\nJohnson only returned to work Monday after suffering from a bout of coronavirus that left him dangerously ill. He spent a week in London's St. Thomas' hospital, including three nights in intensive care, before recovering for two weeks away from London.\n\nSymonds, an environmental campaigner and former Conservative Party staffer, also said she was sick for a week with COVID-19 symptoms, though she wasn't tested for the virus. The newborn boy is her first child.\n\nJohnson has four children with his second wife Marina Wheeler, from whom he is divorced, and has fathered at least one other child outside his marriages.\n\nThe baby is the third born to a sitting British prime minister this century. The wives of leaders Tony Blair and David Cameron also had babies while their husbands were in office.\n\nIt wasn't immediately clear whether Johnson planned to take paternity leave.\n\nThe birth comes as the British government faces big decisions about how and when to ease the nationwide lockdown imposed March 23 to slow the spread of the coronavirus. The measures are due to be in place at least until May 7.\n\nBritain is among the countries hardest hit by the pandemic. As of Tuesday, 21,678 people with COVID-19 had died in U.K. hospitals, and several thousand more in nursing homes and other settings.\n\nJohnson's government faces growing criticism over its slowness in getting enough protective equipment to medics and nursing home staff and its struggle to increase the number of tests being performed for the virus.\n\nJohnson had been due to return to Parliament on Wednesday to take part in the weekly Prime Minister's Questions session. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab will stand in for him.\n\nOpposition Labour Party leader Keir Starmer, who had been due to face off against Johnson in the Commons, tweeted that the birth was \"wonderful news.\"\n\nHouse of Commons Speaker Lindsay Hoyle congratulated the couple.\n\n\"Such happy news amid so much uncertainty - 2020 is certainly a year they will never forget,\" he said.",

        "authors": [],
        "body": "LONDON -- The U.K. held a minute's silence Tuesday for all front-line workers who have died from the coronavirus, as the government extended its testing program and concerns mounted about the rising death toll in care homes.\n\nAs clocks struck 11 a.m., senior political leaders, including Prime Minister Boris Johnson, joined hospital and nursing home staff in observing the silence. London's transport networks came to a halt as workers honored colleagues who have died from COVID-19, and the bells of Westminster Abbey went silent.\n\nHealth Secretary Matt Hancock said 85 front-line workers in the National Health Service had died from the virus, while another 19 have died in care homes.\n\n\"These are the nation's fallen heroes and we will remember them,\" Hancock said at the government's daily briefing.\n\nThe minute's silence had been campaigned for by the Unison union, the Royal College of Midwives and the Royal of College of Nursing, many of whose members have complained about insufficient supplies of personal protective equipment.\n\n\"An even greater task now remains -- to stop more joining the tragic number of those who have died,\" said Donna Kinnair, chief executive and general secretary of the Royal College of Nursing.\n\nJohnson, who returned to work Monday after recovering from COVID-19, has said he won't risk a second peak in the virus by relaxing lockdown restrictions too soon, while acknowledging that the country was coming out of the \"first phase of this conflict.\"\n\nThe government has set five tests for an easing of restrictions from their current end-date of May 7, including \"a sustained and consistent\" fall in the daily death rate.\n\nOver the past couple of weeks, it has become clear that daily coronavirus-related deaths in U.K. hospitals have trended lower while the number being hospitalized, particularly in London, has fallen. On Tuesday, Hancock said another 586 people died in U.K. hospitals, taking the total to 21,678.\n\nThose figures don't include deaths outside hospitals such as care homes. Hancock said more comprehensive daily figures will be published from Wednesday.\n\nEarlier, the Office for National Statistics revealed that 22,351 people in England and Wales died in the week ending April 17. That was the highest since comparable records began in 1993 and more than double the rolling five-year average.\n\nIn its analysis of death certificates, which take longer to compile than deaths recorded in hospitals, the statistics agency said the coronavirus was mentioned as a cause of death in 8,758 cases, nearly 40% of the total.\n\nIt also said 4,316 deaths involving COVID-19 had been registered up to April 17 outside of hospitals with 3,096 in care homes. The equivalent figure for hospital deaths over that period was 14,796.\n\nProvisional figures since April 17 provided with the assistance of a regulator, the Care Quality Commission, point to the daily death rate in care homes in England and Wales heading towards the rate in hospitals.\n\nHancock said the government's testing program was being expanded, including to all staff and residents in care homes whether they show symptoms or not. Anyone over 65, and all workers who must leave their homes to work, are also eligible if they show virus-like symptoms.\n\nHancock also said the U.K. government position had not changed on face coverings, saying there is \"weak science\" on their use. Earlier, the Scottish government recommended their use for shopping and travel, the latest point of divergence between the U.K. government and the devolved administration.\n\nFollow AP pandemic coverage at http://apnews.com/VirusOutbreak and https://apnews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak",

        "authors": [],
        "body": "UNITED NATIONS -- The U.N. envoy for Yemen reported \"significant progress\" in negotiations toward a nationwide cease-fire in the war-torn country on Thursday, but warned of stark challenges as coronavirus spreads at an unknown rate across the Arab nation.\n\nMartin Griffiths urged Yemen's warring sides -- the internationally recognized government and Houthi rebels who control the capital and most of the country's north -- to quickly resolve their differences over humanitarian and economic measures needed to move peace efforts forward and help the country counter the virus.\n\nGriffiths spoke to the U.N. Security Council in a video briefing, saying that steps to allow medical supplies and personnel to reach vulnerable people are \"now a very, very urgent priority.\"\n\nHe did not elaborate on progress in peace talks. Despite Saudi Arabia's unilateral cease-fire declaration last month, the conflict has escalated and a declaration of self-rule over the south by Yemen's separatists reopened a dangerous new front.\n\nYemen has so far reported 86 cases of the virus, including 13 deaths. The internationally recognized government and WHO have criticized the rebels for their lack of transparency, as just two cases, including one death, have been recorded in territory under their control.\n\nWith the drastic spike in cases over the last 10 days across far-flung provinces, Ramesh Rajasingham, the U.N.'s acting assistant secretary-general for humanitarian affairs, warned that community transmission has taken off.\n\nHe said it is shocking that in the midst of a pandemic, relief money is running out and that 31 of the 41 major U.N. programs in Yemen will start closing down in the next few weeks if more funding isn't secured, including COVID-19 response teams and feeding centers for severely malnourished children.\n\n\"That means many more people are likely to die,\" he said, appealing for an additional $2 billion to cover essential activities from June through December.\n\nSaudi Arabia and the United Nations will host a virtual pledging conference on June 2, and Rajasingham urged the Saudis and the United States to turn pledges into cash and other donors to pledge and quickly pay.\n\nRajasingham said Yemeni civilian casualties rose again in April, with 177 civilians killed or injured. Griffiths said he remains extremely concerned about the battle in Marib, heavy fighting in Bayda and Dhale governorates, and cease-fire violations in Hodeida, where the country's main port is located.\n\nFierce clashes erupted this week in the southern province of Abyan between Saudi-backed government troops and separatists backed by the United Arab Emirates. The fighting between the two sides -- nominally allies in the Saudi-led coalition -- has added another layer to the complex civil war.\n\nGriffiths said people, especially in the southern port city of Aden, \"face outbreaks of COVID-19 and other diseases believed to include malaria, cholera, and dengue and others.\"\n\n\"Deaths are rising daily, but nobody knows exactly why because the health system is so ill-equipped to diagnose and treat people,\" he said.\n\nAden's local government reported 70 deaths on Wednesday and 76 the day before -- a fivefold daily increase from the first week of May. The causes of death were unspecified.\n\nSave the Children suggested in a statement on Thursday that some of the deaths in the unusual surge in fatalities could be from COVID-19, the illness caused by coronavirus. It said many Aden hospitals and clinics have closed and in those still open, some staff refuse to work because of severe shortages of protective equipment.\n\nThe group's Yemen director, Mohammed Alshamaa, says aid workers have witnessed many desperate patients \"breathing heavily or even collapsing\" being denied entry to hospitals.\n\nAden and its surroundings have recently been hit by torrential rains, becoming a breeding ground for mosquitoes that carry dengue and chikungunya, which can cause fevers and respiratory symptoms similar to COVID-19.\n\n\"Aden is an example of the horrors that face Yemen,\" Griffiths said, pointing also to the city's damaged infrastructure, serious power outages and long-deteriorating public services \"now at a breaking point.\"\n\nRajasingham, the humanitarian official, pointed to an April 6 attack by armed men who threw grenades at the guards of an isolation center at a Dhale hospital, adding that \"fear of stigma may also be leading fewer people to seek medical care when they need it.\"\n\nAs for refugees, asylum-seekers and migrants, he said, \"stigma is already a grave concern.\"",

        "authors": [],
        "body": "HONOLULU -- The U.S. Navy said Wednesday it will host the world's largest maritime exercises in Hawaii again this year, but the drills will only be held at sea because of the coronavirus.\n\nThe Navy has held the Rim of the Pacific exercises in Hawaii every two years since the early 1970s. Hawaii Gov. David Ige earlier this month asked the military to postpone the drills \"until the COVID-19 situation here in the islands subsides.\"\n\nThe Pacific Fleet said in a statement RIMPAC 2020 would not include social events on shore. Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam will host a \"minimal footprint\" of staff for logistics and support functions.\n\nIt said the modified exercise was a way to \"conduct a meaningful exercise with maximum training value and minimum risk to the force, allies and partners, and the people of Hawaii.\"\n\nThe drills will also be held over two weeks, from Aug. 17-31, instead of the usual five weeks of events from late June to early August.\n\nIge said in a statement he was pleased the Navy agreed to postpone the exercise and would conduct it at sea. He said he would reassess and respond appropriately if conditions changed.\n\nTwo years ago, RIMPAC brought 46 surface ships and 25,000 personnel from 25 nations to the islands.\n\nThe U.S. has the most coronavirus cases in the world, while an outbreak on the USS Theodore Roosevelt aircraft carrier infected nearly 1,000 sailors. Other RIMPAC participants including Japan have also experienced outbreaks.\n\nHawaii has had 613 cases of the virus as of Wednesday, though only four new ones including three on Oahu. Kauai County has had more than two weeks without a new case.\n\nResidents have been adhering to a statewide stay-at-home order since late March to limit the spread of the virus. The state has also imposed a 14-day quarantine on all travelers arriving in the islands.\n\nOn Wednesday, Honolulu Mayor Kirk Caldwell said golf courses, car dealers and pet groomers would be allowed to resume some operations so long as they followed social distancing requirements.\n\nCaldwell said the city, the governor and the other county mayors were working to determine how to keep everyone safe.\n\n\"Together, we are taking the first steps towards a more open way of life,\" Caldwell said in a statement. \"Getting people back to work is a priority right now and we will continue to make decisions based on all available data and sound science,\" Caldwell said in a statement.\n\nThe mayor made his announcement after Gov. David Ige approved the rule changes.\n\nIge told a news conference that officials were discussing allowing hair salons to resume operations but noted it's a business with a high level of contact between people and thus carries a high risk of spreading the disease.\n\nFor most people, the new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia and death.",

        "authors": [],
        "body": "SHORELINE, Wash. -- Disease trackers are calling a choir practice in Washington state a superspreader event that illustrates how easily the coronavirus can pass from person to person.\n\nThe act of singing itself may have spread the virus in the air and onto surfaces, according to a report from Skagit County Public Health published Tuesday.\n\n\"One individual present felt ill, not knowing what they had, and ended up infecting 52 other people,\" said lead author Lea Hamner, calling the outbreak a tragedy.\n\nTwo choir members died of COVID-19 after attending the March 10 practice of the Skagit Valley Chorale. The rehearsal was held nearly two weeks before the state's stay-at-home order.\n\nOther superspreader events are known: A Chicago cluster of 16 cases, including three deaths, stemmed from a funeral and a birthday party. South Korea is investigating an outbreak linked to nightclubs reopening earlier this month.\n\nThe singers sat 6 to 10 inches apart in different configurations during the 2 1/2 hour rehearsal at a church in Mount Vernon, Washington, about 60 miles north of Seattle, according to the report published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nChoir members had no physical contact, although some snacked on cookies and oranges or helped stack chairs, they told investigators. The virus could have spread when exhaled droplets landed on those items.\n\nAnother theory? A fine mist of virus particles emitted during singing could have contributed, the report suggests. Some people emit more particles than others and such emissions can happen with loud talking or, possibly, singing.\n\nThe virus is thought to primarily spread through droplets when an infected person coughs or sneezes.\n\nThe singers felt their first symptoms -- cough, fever, muscle pain or headaches -- one to 12 days after the practice. The sick singers' average age was 69 and most were women, nearly matching the demographics of choir practice attendees.\n\nUnderstanding how the coronavirus spreads is important for preventing and tracking the disease it causes. The CDC recommends avoiding large groups, wearing cloth masks in public and staying at least 6 feet apart from others.\n\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute's Department of Science Education.

        "authors": [],
        "body": "SAN DIEGO -- A 57-year-old person in immigration custody died Wednesday from complications related to the coronavirus, authorities said, marking the first reported death from the virus among about 30,000 people in immigration custody.\n\nThe detainee had been held at the Otay Mesa Detention Center in San Diego and hospitalized since late April, said Craig Sturak, a spokesman for the San Diego County Health & Human Services Agency.\n\nU.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement would neither confirm nor deny the death. CoreCivic Inc., the private company that operates the detention center, didn't respond to a request for comment.\n\nOtay Mesa has been a hotbed for the spread of COVID-19, with nearly one of five detainees who have tested positive nationwide. As of Wednesday, 132 of ICE's 705 positive cases were at the San Diego facility. Additionally, 10 of 39 ICE detention employees who have tested positive are at Otay Mesa.\n\nTwo guards at an immigration detention center in Monroe, Louisiana, died late last month from the coronavirus -- Carl Lenard, 62, and Stanton Johnson, 51. Until Wednesday, no detainees had been reported dead.\n\nA Justice Department attorney, Samuel Bettwy, said at a hearing on Monday that the San Diego detainee was intubated at a hospital with a prognosis that was not good. While the death came as no surprise, advocacy groups that have been pressing ICE to release detainees on bond swiftly criticized the agency.\n\n\"This tragic news is even more evidence that failing to act will result in cruel and needless death,\" said Monika Langarica, an attorney at the American Civil Liberties Union of San Diego & Imperial Counties, which successfully sued to force the release of dozens of older and medically vulnerable detainees at Otay Mesa.\n\nFor most people, the new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia and death.\n\nThe frequency of testing may have something to do with Otay Mesa's elevated infection rate. At Monday's hearing, authorities said 119 of 171, or 70%, of detainees tested at Otay Mesa were positive. ICE says only that it has tested 705 detainees nationwide, without breaking testing down by detention center.\n\nThe first positive case at Otay Mesa was a guard, whose test result was announced March 31. The facility is designed to hold up to 1,970 ICE detainees and U.S. Marshals Service inmates but has lowered its count in recent weeks.\n\nAs of April 26, it held 662 immigration detainees and 325 Marshals Service inmates. Dozens are being released this week under a court order.",

        "body": "MEXICO CITY -- The U.S. government has resumed an old practice of flying deported migrants back to Mexico City, though it apparently did not promise to test them for coronavirus before sending them home.\n\nThe first flight landed Tuesday, and video showed migrants sitting on a packed airplane, and having their temperatures checked. Mexico's Foreign Relations Department said Wednesday the flights will carry up to 133 migrants apiece.\n\nIn past years, the U.S. government used such flights to Mexico City, in the country's center, to move migrants away from the border and discourage repeat attempts to cross. This time, it also cited coronavirus concerns.\n\nA total of eight flights are planned, four from San Diego, California and four from Brownsville Texas, through May 29. The Mexican government will arrange transportation to their home towns, but will not subject them to a mandatory quarantine, instead suggesting they self-isolate for two weeks.\n\n\"Before the flights leave, U.S. authorities will carry out sanitary protocols to detect early symptoms of COVID-19,\" the department said. \"It is important to note that only those who, at the time of deportation, show no symptoms or who are asymptomatic, will board the flights.\"\n\n\"Upon the arrival of the flight, the international Sanitary team will carry out a preventative check of the Mexican citizens ... to detect symptoms related to COVID-19.\"\n\nThe issue of migrants arriving with coronavirus had temporarily halted deportation flights to Guatemala. That nation's government demanded the United States test migrants before sending them back, but some have still arrived infected.\n\nU.S. Customs and Border Protection said it \"has observed an increase in Mexican nationals who make repeated attempts to enter the U.S. illegally and bypass public health measures. Such behavior increases the risk of exposure to immigration officials at the ports-of-entry, Border Patrol agents, and the American public.\"\n\n\"All individuals will be medically screened to ensure they are fit for travel and surgical masks will be provided prior to boarding and worn throughout the flight,\" CPB said.",

        "authors": [],
        "body": "MANAUS, Brazil -- In the remote Amazon community of Betania, Tikuna tribe members suspect the coronavirus arrived this month after some returned from a two-hour boat trip down the Solimoes River to pick up their government benefit payments.\n\nDozens subsequently got headaches, fevers and coughs. Two died. And the five government medical workers for the community of about 4,000 are not treating the sick because they lack protective equipment and coronavirus tests, said Sin\u00e9sio Tikuna, a village leader.\n\nSo the Tikuna rely on their traditional remedy for respiratory ailments: Inhaling clouds of smoke from burning medicinal plants and beehives.\n\nThe Tikuna's plight illustrates the danger from the coronavirus as it spreads to rainforest areas where tribe members live in close quarters with limited medical services. Most are reachable only by boat or small aircraft.\n\n\"We're very worried, mainly because help isn't arriving,\" Sin\u00e9sio Tikuna said in a telephone interview.\n\nBrazil has Latin America's highest COVID-19 death toll, with more than 15,000 as of Sunday. The country's hardest hit major city per capita is in the Amazon -- Manaus, where mass graves are filling up with bodies.\n\nAs Sin\u00e9sio Tikuna described in an interview his belief that beehive smoke saved four sick tribe members, there was no one at a Manaus hospital to help a feverish woman, struggling to breathe, make it inside the emergency room. A police officer put her on a gurney, wheeling it inside with an Associated Press photographer's help.\n\nThe indigenous people dwelling up the Solimoes and Negro rivers that merge in Manaus to form the Amazon River tried for weeks to seal their reserves off from the virus, pleading for donations while awaiting government deliveries of food so they could remain isolated. It didn't come for many, indigenous advocates said.\n\nThe Upper Solimoes basin has 44 tribal reserves and has emerged as the Brazilian Amazon's indigenous infection hotspot. Testing is extremely limited, but shows that at least 162 of the area's approximately 76,000 indigenous people have been infected and 11 have died. There are more than 2,000 confirmed infections in parts of the area not overseen by the government's indigenous health care provider.\n\nIn a Tikuna village named Umariacu near the border with Peru and Colombia, the first three COVID-19 deaths were elderly tribe members infected by younger members who left town to receive government welfare payments and trade fish and produce for chicken and other food, said Weydson Pereira, who coordinates the region's indigenous government health care.\n\n\"Our biggest anguish today is the indigenous people who aren't staying in their communities and coming in and out of town. Today the safest place for them is inside their villages,\" Pereira said this month, infected and isolating at home with his infected wife and daughter.\n\nTwo weeks of tribal quarantine for the region would have provided time to identify and isolate cases, but \"unfortunately, that hasn't happened,\" he said.\n\nIn the same area, people of Kokama ethnicity have been unable to get medical treatment fromhealth system in the small city of Tabatinga or from the government's indigenous care provider, federal prosecutors said in a lawsuit filed this week seeking to expand Tabatinga's hospital.\n\nThat hospital's 10 ventilators are in use for coronavirus patients and the nearest intensive care is 1,000 miles (1,600 kilometers) downriver in Manaus, also filled with patients, Pereira said.\n\nManaus' lack of coronavirus treatment prompted Pedro dos Santos, the leader of a slum named Park of Indigenous Nations, to drink tea made of chicory root, garlic and lime to combat a high fever that lasted 10 days. A 62-year-old neighbor of Bare indigenous ethnicity needed an ICU bed, but none were available and he died, said the man's son, Josu\u00e9 Paulino.\n\nSome frightened residents of Manaus, population 2.2 million, are fleeing but they may be asymptomatic carriers and could spread the virus elsewhere, said Miguel Lago, executive director of Brazil's Institute for Health Policy Studies, which advises public health officials.\n\nAbout 575 miles (925 kilometers) up the Negro River from Manaus is the community of Sao Gabriel Cachoeira, where people of 23 indigenous ethnicities make up more than 75 percent of the population.\n\nAbout 46,000 live in the urban area and on rural reserves with frequent back-and-forth transit, said Juliana Radler, an advisor for the Socio-Environmental Institut, an environmental and indigenous advocacy group.\n\nSao Gabriel Cachoeira quickly reacted to the COVID-19 threat within a week of the World Health Organization's pandemic declaration by cutting off riverboat and plane arrivals in late March -- except for essential goods and soldiers.\n\nBut Radler said some Sao Gabriel Cachoeira residents stuck in Manaus headed home on supply ships -- disembarking nearby and sneaking into town under cover of darkness. About 150 others made the voyage on a triple-decker ferry named the Lady Luiza.\n\nWhen it arrived days later, authorities tried but failed to turn passengers away. No quarantine areas were available and some ferry passengers may have brought the virus to Sao Gabriel Cachoeira, Radler said.\n\nBrazil's Navy authorized the ferry's trip and passengers were desperate to go home because \"they felt exposed and vulnerable\" in Manaus, the Lady Luiza's owner said on Facebook.\n\nBy mid-April, many residents had what they believed was a strong flu. The community's COVID-19 committee used radio broadcasts, sound trucks and pamphlets to issue warnings about the virus in Portuguese and indigenous languages including Tukano, Nheengatu and Baniwa.\n\nOne of the first confirmed coronavirus cases was a teacher of Baniwa ethnicity who died after being taken to Manaus for treatment. For most people COVID-19 causes moderate symptoms like fever, but it can result in death.\n\nAs of this week, Sao Gabriel Cachoeira had 292 confirmed infections and nearby indigenous reserves had registered their first cases.\n\nAll six functioning ventilators in the hospital were in use and remote tribal health centers were short of supplies, Radler said.\n\n\"We need a field hospital as fast as possible, in the next 20 days,\" she said. \"If not, it will be a catastrophe, a true catastrophe.\"",

        "body": "WELLINGTON, New Zealand -- Surfers in New Zealand hit the waves at dawn, builders returned to construction sites and baristas fired up their espresso machines as the nation eased a strict lockdown Tuesday amid hopeful signs the coronavirus has been all but vanquished Down Under -- at least for now.\n\nBut elsewhere, Brazil was emerging as a potential new hot spot for infections, and fresh doubts were raised over whether Japan would be able to host the already postponed Olympic Games next year.\n\nEurope and some U.S. states were also continuing to gradually ease limits on movement and commerce as they tried to restart their economies.\n\nBut in a reminder of the virus's increasing toll, President Donald Trump said the numbers of deaths could reach 70,000 in the U.S., after putting the number at 60,000 several times earlier this month.\n\nWith the number of new cases waning, New Zealand's government loosened its lockdown, which for more than a month had shuttered schools and most businesses, and only allowed people to leave their homes for essential work, to get groceries or to exercise.\n\nMost students will continue studying from home and workers are still required to work from home if they can, while everyone is required to maintain social distancing. But restaurants can now reopen for takeaway orders, construction can restart, and golfers and surfers can play.\n\nNew Zealand reported just three new infections on Tuesday and the country's health authorities said they're winning the battle against the virus. Nevertheless they cautioned people not to get complacent and to maintain social distancing.\n\nPrime Minister Jacinda Ardern said people had done an incredible job to break the chain of transmission, but cautioned they needed to remain vigilant. Quoting a microbiologist, Ardern said \"there may still be some smoldering ashes out there, and they have the potential to become a wildfire again, if we give them the chance.\"\n\nIn Australia, authorities reopened Sydney's iconic Bondi Beach to swimmers and surfers on Tuesday and hundreds returned to the water as soon as the restrictions were lifted. People can only use the beach during daylight hours, cannot linger on the sand and are counted to ensure social distancing.\n\nIn Japan, a top medical expert said he thinks it will be difficult to hold the Olympics in 2021 without an effective coronavirus vaccine.\n\n\"I hope vaccines and drugs will be developed as soon as possible,\" said Yoshitake Yokokura, the president of the Japan Medical Association.\n\nJapan and the International Olympic Committee agreed to postpone the Tokyo 2020 Summer Games until July next year due to the pandemic. Japan is under a monthlong state of emergency amid a rapid increase of infections throughout the country, where hospitals are overburdened.\n\nIn Brazil, President Jair Bolsonaro has insisted COVID-19 is just a \"little flu\" and that there is no need for the type of restrictions that have slowed the infection's spread in Europe and the U.S.\n\nBrazil has reported 4,600 deaths and 67,000 confirmed infections. But the true numbers are believed to be vastly higher given the lack of testing and the many people without severe symptoms who haven't sought hospital care.\n\nMedical officials in Rio de Janeiro and at least four other major cities have warned that their hospital systems are on the verge of collapse or are too overwhelmed to take any more patients.\n\nThere are also signs that a growing number of victims are now dying at home. Brazil is Latin America's biggest country, with 211 million people.\n\n\"We have all the conditions here for the pandemic to become much more serious,\" said Paulo Brand\u00e3o, a virologist at the University of Sao Paulo.\n\nBolsonaro has disputed the seriousness of the coronavirus and said people need to resume their lives to prevent an economic meltdown. But most state governors in the country have adopted restrictions to slow the spread and pushed people to stay at home.\n\nIn other developments, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson returned to work after a bout with the virus and warned strongly against easing his own country's lockdown too soon: \"I refuse to throw away all the effort and the sacrifice of the British people and to risk a second major outbreak and huge loss of life.\"\n\nAnd New York canceled its Democratic presidential primary, set for June 23, since Bernie Sanders has already conceded the nomination to Joe Biden. The state reported 337 deaths for the lowest daily count this month, down from nearly 800 almost three weeks ago.\n\nThe number of confirmed infections in the U.S. has risen to nearly 1 million, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University, although the true number is likely much higher because not everybody who contracts the virus is tested.\n\nWorldwide, the death toll topped 210,000. The number of dead in the U.S. surpassed 56,000. Italy, Britain, Spain and France accounted for more than 20,000 deaths each.\n\nBiller reported from Rio de Janeiro.

    "Washington mental hospital staff call virus testing unsafe": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "SEATTLE -- Workers who had been exposed to the coronavirus at Washington state's largest psychiatric hospital were herded into a small building to be tested. Inside, few wore masks. They were given test kits by people without gloves and told to swirl a swab inside their noses.\n\nThe method was designed only for people showing symptoms, but the staffers said none of them did. Many told The Associated Press that the flawed testing process this month likely produced inaccurate results and exposed them to the virus again.\n\n\"I absolutely feel it was a misuse of the testing materials,\" said Dr. Lauren Smith, a forensic psychologist at the hospital. \"In addition to that, the manner in which they did it put us all at risk.\"\n\nEmployees say it's another example of the state's failure to protect staff and patients at Western State Hospital. The 850-bed facility south of Seattle has been the target of multiple state and federal investigations, including one launched when a man accused of torturing a woman to death escaped. There's a pattern of violent attacks by patients and a failure to meet health and safety requirements.\n\nThe violations led the facility to lose its accreditation and federal funding, and staffers say mismanagement during the pandemic could cost lives. They fear a repeat of the Seattle-area nursing home that became the first U.S. cluster of COVID-19 deaths, with 43.\n\n\"I'm afraid this could become another tragedy similar to what happened at Life Care Center of Kirkland,\" said Justin Lee, a spokesman for the hospital employee union.\n\nA 400-member nurses union is calling for top administrators at the Department of Social and Health Services, which oversees the hospital, to be removed over their handling of the outbreak.\n\nDepartment Secretary Cheryl Strange said she's disappointed and has been working to address the union's concerns.\n\n\"There is always much work to do in a hospital this large, and we will continue our efforts to restore the faith of the membership,\" she said.\n\nAt least 29 workers at the psychiatric hospital have tested positive for the virus, while six patients have confirmed cases and one has died. Psychiatric hospitals in other states also have struggled with COVID-19, including a facility in Michigan where more than 100 patients and workers tested positive.\n\nAt the Washington hospital, most patients are severely mentally ill. They're either a danger to themselves or others or have committed a crime and are being treated to restore their mental competency to face charges. Some are old and many have compromised immune systems because of their medications, putting them at greater risk if they catch the virus. But they aren't inclined to wear masks or take other precautions.\n\n\"If you give patients Purell, they'll drink it,\" said Ben LaLiberte, a forensic evaluator. Masks could be used to choke so are distributed carefully and usually ignored.\n\nUnlike nursing homes, which are particularly susceptible to COVID-19, psychiatric wards can be chaotic and sometimes violent, requiring staff to make physical contact with patients.\n\n\"The 6-foot rule isn't possible,\" LaLiberte said. \"I easily come into close contact with 20 people every day.\"\n\nOn April 6, staffers who had worked on the ward housing criminal offenders were told two infected employees had exposed them to the coronavirus and they needed tests. What they thought would be drive-thru testing that isolates people in their cars instead was held inside a small building, a half-dozen workers told the AP.\n\nThey jammed into a crowded hallway, and only a few had masks. They were called two at a time to a small office and given tests by two hospital staff members. Neither wore gloves and one took his mask off and on.\n\nSmith, the forensic psychologist, said the person testing her was coughing and not wearing protective gear. She expected a typical test where a medical worker collects a sample from deep in the nasal canal and was concerned when she was told to swab just inside her nose.\n\nState health officials began recommending the shallow self-test after a study by the Everett Clinic and the University of Washington said it 90% was accurate on people with COVID-19 symptoms. The study prompted the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to change its guidelines to allow the method for sick people.\n\nDepartment of Social and Health Services spokeswoman Kelly Von Holtz defended the shallow swab, saying it's \"FDA approved\" and has proven as accurate as a deep nasal test.\n\nBut the FDA doesn't approve testing methods, just sets guidelines for how they should be done, a spokesperson said. And Dr. Yuan-Po Tu, who co-authored the study, said that because his research was done only on patients with symptoms, the FDA limits the shallow nasal test to those people.\n\nThe hospital staff didn't have symptoms.\n\nWorkers also questioned why none of the patients on the ward where they were exposed had been tested.\n\nState officials have reported conflicting numbers on patient testing throughout the facility. On April 14, Von Holtz said only two had been tested that month. The next day, she said 38 had been tested.\n\nStaffers don't believe official reports because infections in workers have more than doubled since March, while cases among patients haven't changed this month.\n\n\"I have a lot of suspicion about the information we're getting,\" said LaLiberte, the forensic evaluator. \"It ends up putting people at risk.\"",

    "Watchdog cites persistent infection lapses in nursing homes": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "WASHINGTON -- Before COVID-19 killed thousands of nursing home residents, about 4 in 10 homes inspected were cited for infection control problems, according to a government watchdog report that found a \"persistent\" pattern of lapses.\n\nIn light of the pandemic, seemingly minor cutting of corners such as an employee caring for residents while battling a cold has taken on new significance.\n\n\"Warning signs were ignored and nursing homes were unprepared to face a pandemic,\" said Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon, the top Democrat on a committee that oversees Medicare and Medicaid. \"There need to be big changes in the way nursing homes care for seniors.\"\n\nThe report from the Government Accountability Office found that state inspectors who help enforce federal nursing home standards classified the overwhelming majority of violations as not severe, generally meaning there was no actual harm to residents. The federal Centers for Medicare and Medicare Services carried out enforcement actions for 1% of violations classified as not severe from 2013-2017, the report said.\n\nNursing homes ended up bearing the brunt of the coronavirus outbreak. About 1.4 million people live in some 15,500 facilities in the United States. Most of those people were already at higher risk due to age and medical history, and they also shared dining rooms, recreation areas, bathrooms and sleeping quarters.\n\nAn ongoing count by The Associated Press has found that outbreaks in nursing homes and long-term care facilities have killed more than 30,000 people, more than one-third of all coronavirus deaths in the country.\n\nThe GAO report found that about 40% of the nursing homes inspected in each of the past two years were cited for problems with infection control and prevention.\n\nLooking deeper into federal data for 2013-2017, investigators found a recurring pattern of problems. Data for that five-year period showed that 82% of nursing homes inspected, or 13,299, had at least one deficiency related to infection control and prevention. About half of the facilities had an infection-related deficiency in multiple consecutive years.\n\n\"This is an indicator of persistent problems,\" the GAO's nonpartisan investigators said.\n\nThe types of problems involved such issues as failing to properly wash hands and not isolating sick residents during outbreaks. \"Many of these practices can be critical to preventing the spread of infectious diseases, including COVID-19,\" investigators wrote.\n\nAmong the incidents cited in the report:\n\n-- A nursing assistant at a California facility had been sick for at least two days with fever, diarrhea, cough and a runny nose but kept working. Seven employees had not been screened for tuberculosis before they were hired. Workers who hadn't had their flu shots were working without masks. No enforcement action was taken against the facility.\n\n-- A New York nursing home was in the throes of a respiratory infection outbreak that had sickened 38 residents. But it lacked a complete and accurate list of the sick, and it failed to isolate them from those who were symptom-free. Likewise, staff helping the sick patients were not isolate. Residents continued to share the dining hall. The federal CMS took action, requiring the nursing home to retrain staff and submit a plan for corrective action to state inspectors.\n\n-- A nursing assistant at an Arkansas facility was seen helping an incontinent resident after a bowel movement. Then, without removing her soiled gloves, the assistant helped get the patient comfortable in bed, fixed the pillows, and replenished supplies in the bedside drawer. A glucose meter for measuring blood sugar was not properly disinfected before being used on several different residents. No enforcement action was taken against the nursing home.\n\nThe nursing homes cited in the report were not identified.\n\nSeema Verma, head of the federal Medicare and Medicaid agency, said this week that governors should exercise \"extreme caution\" before allowing nursing homes to reopen to visitors. Verma has announced that CMS plans to name a commission to examine the nursing home response to coronavirus and make recommendations. The GAO said it plans other reports to independently examine how CMS responded to the outbreak as well as the agency's oversight of infection control in nursing homes.\n\nThe head of the nursing home trade group, the American Health Care Association, has flagged infection control as a priority for the industry. \"We are absolutely committed to a renewed emphasis on infection control,\" Mark Parkinson said in a recent interview.\n\nWhile about 40% of nursing homes nationwide were cited for infection control problems, the GAO found wide differences among states. In 2017, nearly 61% of the inspected facilities in California had a deficiency, while in Rhode Island it was less than 4%.\n\nThe report also found that nonprofit nursing homes were somewhat less likely to be cited for persistent infection control problems.",

        "body": "Some countries -- and U.S. states -- are shifting their focus away from stay-at-home measures and toward fixing ravaged economies. But some worry that prematurely lifting restrictions could spark a resurgence in coronavirus infections. For many it's the most agonizing of delicate balancing acts imaginable.\n\nPerhaps less so in Georgia, where reopening in the U.S. state is set to continue apace with restaurants and movie theaters, as more restrictions against the coronavirus are loosened in the big U.S. southern state. An earlier easing saw many establishments gratefully opened their doors after a monthlong closure, but others didn't feel ready yet and remained shuttered. A similar mixed response is expected from the businesses allowed to reopen today.\n\nHere are some of AP's top stories Monday on the world's coronavirus pandemic. Follow APNews.com/VirusOutbreak for updates through the day and APNews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak for stories explaining some of its complexities.\n\nWHAT'S HAPPENING TODAY:\n\n-- Stocks around the world rose Monday as governments prepare to gradually lift restrictions they imposed on businesses to slow the sweep of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\n-- The novel coronavirus has sickened thousands of America's first responders and killed dozens more. But many have recovered, and they're going back to work -- back to the crime scene, back into the ambulance, back to the jail.\n\n-- Americans' support for mail-in voting has jumped amid concerns about the safety of polling places during the coronavirus pandemic, but a wide partisan divide suggests President Donald Trump's public campaign against vote by mail may be resonating with his Republican backers.\n\n-- The historic crash in oil prices in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic is reverberating across the Middle East as crude-dependent countries scramble to offset losses from a key source of state revenue. The economies of all the Arab Gulf oil exporters are expected to contract this year.\n\n-- The Tokyo Olympics were postponed a month ago. But there are still more questions than answers about the new opening on July 23, 2021, and what form those games will take.\n\n-- Selling Girl Scout cookies is normally a foolproof business model, but the coronavirus outbreak cooled sales of for Alaska scouts. The Girl Scouts of Alaska looked for help and the group is expected to receive a federal recovery loan to help compensate for lost cookie sales.\n\nFor most people, the coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia and death. The vast majority of people recover.\n\nHere are the symptoms of the virus compared with the common flu.\n\nOne of the best ways to prevent spread of the virus is washing your hands with soap and water. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends first washing with warm or cold water and then lathering soap for 20 seconds to get it on the backs of hands, between fingers and under fingernails before rinsing off.\n\nYou should wash your phone, too. Here's how.\n\nTRACKING THE VIRUS: Drill down and zoom in at the individual county level, and you can access numbers that will show you the situation where you are, and where loved ones or people you're worried about live.\n\n-- 0: The number of hospitalized patients in Wuhan, the city at the center of China's coronavirus outbreak, after the last 12 were discharged Sunday.\n\nIN OTHER NEWS:\n\n-- VIRUS OUTBREAK-BLUEGRASS MUSEUM -- The Bluegrass Music Hall of Fame and Museum in western Kentucky is encouraging fans to visit by taking a new virtual tour of its exhibits.\n\n-- VIRUS OUTBREAK-VIRTUAL PROMS -- High schoolers undefeated by the coronavirus lockdowns are heading online for isolation proms.\n\nFollow AP coverage of the virus outbreak at https://apnews.com/VirusOutbreak and https://apnews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak",

    "With over 200 possible cases, doctors warn reports of rare, coronavirus-linked child inflammatory illness likely to rise ": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "Medical professionals in 20 states and Washington D.C. are investigating more than 200 confirmed or suspected cases of a mysterious illness thought to be linked to the coronavirus and affecting children, according to a new ABC News survey of hospital and state health officials across the country. And while the unexplained syndrome is believed to be extremely rare, experts said they expect the number to grow.\n\nExperts said the inflammatory syndrome, recently named by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C), resembles toxic shock syndrome and Kawasaki disease, itself a rare inflammatory disease typically affecting children under the age of five, and has the potential to be deadly. At least three children have died with the syndrome in New York, where at least an additional 119 cases are under investigation, according to the New York State Department of Health.\n\nWhile the CDC says the group of symptoms is \"associated with\" COVID-19, exact cause remains a mystery.\n\nMany kids, though not all, who experience symptoms of MIS-C -- which include fever, rash, eye irritation, swollen lymph nodes and/or swelling of the hands and feet -- either have been diagnosed with COVID-19 or tested positive for the antibodies, said health experts. And doctors say even those that have tested negative for antibodies could test positive later because of the lag in antibody development.\n\nAccording to the CDC, It typically takes one to three weeks after someone becomes infected with the novel coronavirus for their body to make antibodies, and some people could take longer than that.\n\nThe illness is only a small percentage of the 1.5 million coronavirus cases in the U.S. Dr. Courtney Gidengil, a pediatric infectious disease physician and a policy researcher at the thinktank RAND, said the syndrome is incredibly rare, and parent's should not panic.\n\nBut Gidengil warned the U.S. should expect to see the number of reported cases of the mystery illness rise.\n\n\"It seems like it takes four to six weeks for [MIS-C] to develop after infection, not due to the virus itself but rather the body's response to the illness,\" Gidengil said. \"We probably will start to see it pop up more around the entire country.\"\n\nThere is no current official tally of suspected incidents of the illness nationwide, but an ABC News survey of hospital and state health officials in all 50 states and Washington, D.C. found at least 220 confirmed or possible cases of the illness. The majority of possible cases have been reported in New York, but more than a dozen have also been reported in New Jersey and Michigan, and officials said they also saw potential cases in Massachusetts, Washington D.C., Connecticut, California, Utah, Delaware, Illinois, Kentucky, Louisiana, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Washington State, Tennessee, Mississippi, Missouri, Georgia and Minnesota.\n\nSome other states like Maryland and North Carolina have told ABC News they don't have any confirmed cases but are monitoring for any suspected cases.\n\n\"I'll wager that's going to only go up and it's going to be much more widespread than anyone thinks,\" New York's Cuomo said.\n\nThe CDC sent a warning Thursday to thousands of doctors to be on the lookout for the illness, which was previously known as pediatric multi-system inflammatory syndrome, or PMIS. Friday the government agency said that surveillance of the disease \"is limited,\" but \"now that the case definition and [a health alert] are out, more info is likely to follow.\"\n\nHealth departments across the country said they have already been on the lookout. Doctors in the U.K., Italy and Spain reported an increase in cases there last month.\n\nThe Michigan health department sent out an alert earlier this month to local health agencies and health care providers about the disease and a reminder to report suspected cases within 24 hours. To date, there are 17 suspected cases under review in the state, Michigan health department spokesperson Lynn Sutfin told ABC News. New Jersey, which has reported a total of 18 cases as of Wednesday, sent out their own alert earlier this month as well.\n\nA doctor in Oregon told ABC News proper knowledge about the illness allowed an afflicted eighth grader to get treatment immediately, which ultimately helped save her.\n\n\"I'm very grateful because I could have been gone,\" 14-year old Leah said in an interview with ABC . \"I'm glad I got help right away.\"\n\nIn California, the state has yet to declare the syndrome a reportable illness, but hospitals have been paying close attention as early as March. Dr. Jim Stein, chief medical officer at Children's Hospital Los Angeles, said the illness is a sign that the impact of the novel coronavirus is extending to children in a way that \"this is no longer considered necessarily less significant for children than it is for adults.\"\n\nThe CDC alert said that \"It is currently unknown if multisystem inflammatory syndrome is specific to children or if it also occurs in adults.\"\n\nBut little is known about the illness' connection to COVID-19.\n\nOf the 16 children with inflammatory symptoms in California, 14 have been tested for coronavirus antibodies, Stein said. None of them had tested positive for the coronavirus detection at the time they were admitted to the hospital, but four of them tested positive later. Stein added that the 10 patients that tested negative could also develop antibodies later.\n\nDr. Andrew Pavia, who has been monitoring two suspected cases at the University of Utah Health Primary Children's Hospital, said treatments given to patients with the toxic shock related symptoms could also interfere with antibody tests for COVID-19, further complicating the efforts to identify any link between the two.\n\nHealth experts are also going back to their current and past patients as they examine more patients and the case definition of the illness broadens from the classic Kawasaki disease, which could increase the number of cases brought forth.\n\n\"There's just a lot to worry about with respect to kids,\" Alker said. \"We really need a national strategy we need our leaders to sort of thoughtfully consider and address this wide range of threats that children face right now to their health and development.\"\n\n\"And unfortunately there's just no sign that exists right now,\" Alker added.\n\nWith new illness, questions about summer camps, schools re-opening\n\nThe sudden rise in critically ill children, albeit extremely small nationwide, has only further ignited the debate surrounding reopening, especially when it comes to schools.\n\nMost states have decided that school openings will occur on a local level, and for nearly the entire country that decision still hangs in the balance. But the start of summer camps and summer programs is just around the corner, and many states have already moved to allow them to go on. States including Georgia, Tennessee, and Connecticut all have possible cases of MIS-C they have been monitoring in their state but have said summer camps may reopen with various forms of social distancing in place.\n\nDr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's top infectious disease expert, repeatedly warned lawmakers during a hearing on Tuesday about opening schools and businesses too soon, which he said could cause further outbreaks.\n\n\"We don't know everything about this virus and we really better be very careful particularly when it comes to children,\" Dr. Fauci warned.\n\nBut some lawmakers have been quick to dismiss the warnings, eagerly pushing to open schools in the fall, which are seen as a major indicator of the country being officially opened.\n\nSen. Rand Paul, R- Kentucky, pushed back on Fauci's calls for cautiousness and said it would be a \"huge mistake\" not to let kids return to school sooner. President Trump also told reporters Wednesday that he was \"surprised\" by Fauci's comments. He said it was \"not an acceptable answer.\"\n\n\"I think that we have to open our schools,\" Trump said in an interview on Wednesday. \"Young people are very little affected by this. We have to get the schools open.\"\n\nIn Connecticut, where Gov. Ned Lamont and hospitals have recently confirmed that at least five children in the state are being monitored and treated for the new syndrome, the state's Office of Early Childhood announced this week that summer camps, with the exception of overnight camps, can open on June 29 with specific guidance in place, including a requirement to get a permission to host a group more than 30 as well as other social distancing measures. When schools can reopen there remains a question, as Education Commissioner Miquel Cardona said this week that the school reopening plan will depend on infection trends and that they will need to be flexible.\n\nGeorgia Gov. Kemp has implemented a similar measure. Summer camps were permitted to begin operating this week, as long as they follow 32 mandatory criteria that his team developed in absence of the CDC's guidance. Overnight camps are prohibited. Kemp's office did not respond to a request for comment about how the new illnesses in the state would impact his decisions about schools moving forward.\n\nIn most other states, some summer camps are opening up while some other camps are choosing to remain closed amid state governments' lack of state-wide directives.\n\nIn Maryland, Montgomery County this week went ahead and cancelled all summer camps in the county as it awaits for state health department's guidance for camps. Guidance on summer camps is pending in Michigan and Massachusetts as well, while Missouri has left it to counties and cities to decide on the fate of summer camps.\n\nIn Utah, the Girl Scouts of Utah has extended the cancellation of \"in-person meetings for troops and services of units\" until June 30, but YMCA of Northern Utah is moving ahead with its camps while adhering to CDC social distancing guidelines. Schools remain closed through the end of the academic year.\n\nAn 'additional risk to consider'\n\nEarly concerns about re-opening schools had more to do with the possibility of children potentially transmitting the coronavirus to their teachers, parents or elderly grandparents, who have shown to be much more susceptible to COVID-19's more serious effects.\n\nPavia said that the new \"scary illness\" affecting kids, while very rare, has only added to the difficult safety calculations.\n\n\"I think it's one more factor to put into the very complex decision making about letting kids go back to school in the fall or the summer camps,\" Pavia said. \"We know that overall they're likelihood of getting severe respiratory disease is very low. We think that MIS-C is a rare but very serious complication, and you know how it's hard to make decisions about rare but serious events.\"\n\n\"I think for schools, it's just an additional risk to consider,\" Pavis added. \"I still think that for deciding whether to open schools, the bigger concern is what role children may play in prolonging the epidemic and infecting older people. That's likely to be a much larger impact in terms of numbers. Psychologically, this may have a bigger role.\"\n\nIn the meantime, health experts are urgently trying to get the word out about the disease so parents can know identify and get their children medical attention as soon as possible.\n\n\"Parents: know the signs of Pediatric Multi-Symptom Inflammatory Syndrome to protect your child,\" New York City blasted out in its text-message notification system on Friday.\n\n\"This is truly disturbing,\" Gov. Cuomo said of the illness at a press conference this week. \"We raise it because it's something parents should be aware of.\"",

    "With testing, Iceland claims major success against COVID-19": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "HVAMMSTANGI, Iceland -- Winter storms isolated the northern village of Hvammstangi from the rest of Iceland. Then spring brought the coronavirus, isolating villagers from each other. Now, as summer approaches, residents hope life is getting back to some kind of normal.\n\nHigh schools, hair salons, dentists and other businesses across Iceland are reopening Monday after six weeks of lockdown, after this North Atlantic nation managed to tame its coronavirus outbreak.\n\nIceland has confirmed 1,799 cases of the virus, but just 10 people have died. The number of new COVID-19 cases each day has fallen from 106 at the peak of the outbreak to single digits -- even, on some days, zero.\n\n\"I didn't expect the recovery to be this fast,\" said Iceland's chief epidemiologist, Thorolfur Gudnason.\n\nIceland's success is partly testament to its tiny population -- just 360,000 people. But it also reflects decisive action by authorities, who used a rigorous policy of testing and tracking to find and isolate infected people, even when they had no symptoms.\n\nThat has helped Iceland weather the pandemic without resorting to the near-total social and economic shutdowns enforced in many other European countries. Infected people and their contacts were quarantined, but the rest of the population was not forced to stay inside, only to be careful.\n\nA volcanic island nudging the Arctic Circle, Iceland may be remote, but it is far from isolated. Its Keflavik Airport is a trans-Atlantic hub, and Icelanders are enthusiastic travelers. As in several other European countries, some of the first cases of the virus here were brought back from ski resorts in the Alps, including the Austrian village of Ischgl.\n\nEarly vigilance was key to Iceland's success. The country confirmed its first case of the virus on Feb. 28, and declared Ischgl a high-risk zone on March 5, two days before authorities there confirmed the first case.\n\nGudnason said Iceland had been updating and testing its response to a global pandemic since 2004. Hospitals had been testing people arriving from abroad for a month before the first confirmed case, and a media campaign urged hand washing and social distancing.\n\n\"Each institution involved in the response knew its role from the start,\" he said.\n\nIceland quarantined everyone returning from virus hotspots and began test-and-trace measures to locate and isolate every case. Bigger countries such as Britain took the same approach, at first. But the U.K. abandoned test-and-trace in March as the number of cases overwhelmed the country's testing capacity. More than a month later and with almost 30,000 Britons dead, the U.K. is scrambling to resume testing and tracing as part of its route out of national lockdown.\n\nIceland's testing capacity was helped by the presence of Reykjavik-based biopharmaceutical company deCODE Genetics, which early in the outbreak teamed up with health authorities to ramp up public testing.\n\nOver six weeks, Iceland managed to test almost 50,000 people, more than 13 percent of the population, the biggest chunk of any country in the world.\n\nDeCODE did not test people already feeling sick or in quarantine, who were tested in hospitals. The company used its facilities to test a cross-section of the population, and identified scores of new cases, including people with mild or no symptoms.\n\nKari Stefansson, deCODE's ebullient CEO, said the approach showed that \"with the use of modern science, even an epidemic like this one can be contained.\"\n\nIceland's testing yielded new leads for scientists about how the virus behaves. Early results suggested 0.6 percent of the population were \"silent carriers\" of the disease with no symptoms or only a mild cough and runny nose.\n\nPreliminary research suggests one-third of those who tested positive at deCODE infected someone around them, providing evidence that silent carriers do transmit the disease but much less than symptomatic patients.\n\nIn a random sample of 848 children under the age of 10 none of them tested positive, which guided Icelandic authorities' decision to keep schools open for children under 16.\n\nAlongside the testing, civil defense authorities set up a Contact Tracing Team, including police officers and university students, which used legwork and phone calls to identify people who had come into contact with infected individuals. A mobile phone tracing app was up and running a few weeks later.\n\nGudnason said the approach's success is shown by the fact that about 60% of people who tested positive were already in quarantine after being contacted by the tracing team.\n\nAltogether, 19,000 people were ordered into two-week quarantine. Everyone else carried on with a semblance of normality. Primary schools remained open, and some cafes and restaurants kept operating, following social distancing rules: no more than 20 people gathered at once and everyone 2 meters (6.5 feet) apart.\n\nStarting Monday, gatherings of up to 50 will be permitted, high schools and colleges can resume classes and all businesses except bars, gyms and swimming pools can reopen.\n\nThe entire country, however, must self-isolate from the rest of the world for the time being. Everyone arriving from abroad faces a 14-day quarantine.\n\nThat means a bleak economic outlook for a country that depends on tourism. On Road Number One, the \"Ring Road\" looping through Iceland's coastal towns and villages, the Associated Press passed empty vista points and few cars.\n\n\"Business can only go up from here,\" said Margr\u00e9t Gu\u00f0j\u00f3nsd\u00f3ttir, 28, working alone at the roadstop in Hvammstangi.\n\nThe village, population 600, was hit badly early on. The town ended up having 26 confirmed cases of the virus, and was put under lockdown for a week while the transmission was being mapped out.\n\nThe local grocery store created \"shifts\" for customers so they could shop while socially isolating. In an April snowstorm, local search and rescue volunteers used their super-jeeps to drive hospital staff to and from work and shuttled warm meals to elderly residents around town.\n\n\"Making each other's lockdown a little more pleasant became people's mission,\" Gu\u00f0j\u00f3nsd\u00f3ttir said. \"It really showed me the benefit of living in a small community.\"",

        "authors": [],
        "body": "The original epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak, Wuhan, China, has now recorded the first new cluster of local cases since its strict lockdown was lifted in early April.\n\nThe outbreak in Wuhan is one of two worrying clusters, with the other popping up hundreds of miles away in the northeastern city of Shulan, which was ordered back into a lockdown.\n\nIn Wuhan, local authorities reported Monday that six new cases of local transmission were recorded over the weekend within the residential neighborhood of Sanmin.\n\nThe South China Morning Post reported that the municipal Wuhan government fired a local official because of poor disease control in his neighborhood.\n\nChina's Xinhua News Agency reported that the new cases were discovered when tests were conducted on more than 5,000 Sanmin residents. The Sanmin community had recorded 20 cases earlier in the outbreak.\n\nThe Wuhan Health Commission said that an 89-year-old man in the neighborhood displayed symptoms as early as March, but it wasn't confirmed as a case until Saturday. His wife and four others in the neighborhood all tested positive for COVID-19 the next day although they were asymptomatic.\n\n\"Wuhan is still facing huge pressure to control the current epidemic,\" the health commission said. \"We need to pay close attention to control both imported cases as well as local cases, and resolutely contain the resurgence of COVID-19.\"\n\nA second larger cluster is emerging out of the city of Shulan, in China's northeastern Jilin province near the Russian and North Korean borders. Its mayor announced in a press conference on Monday that Shulan is in a \"wartime\" footing against COVID-19, placing the city of more than 700,000 residents under lockdown at least until the end of May.\n\nShulan has reported 14 cases over the past two days, all linked to a 45-year-old woman working at the local police's laundry department who tested positive for the virus last Thursday. Authorities still do not know how she became infected.\n\nAs the rest of the country appears to be on the road to recovery and the Chinese government tries to direct its efforts to restarting the economy, the northeastern provinces bordering Russia and North Korea have emerged as a lingering and growing COVID-19 hotspot.",

    "Years of conflict leave Somalia ill-equipped to fight virus": {

        "body": "MOGADISHU, Somalia -- Years of conflict, instability and poverty have left Somalia ill-equipped to handle a health crisis like the coronavirus pandemic. In fact, no one really knows how many cases of COVID-19 it has.\n\nThe uncertainty has led to fear, confusion and panic even after authorities have tried to keep the public informed about the outbreak.\n\nThe official count of cases is now above 1,200, with 53 deaths, according to figures from Johns Hopkins University.\n\nBut some aid groups -- and even authorities leading the fight -- have warned that official figures could be far too low in a country with one of the world's weakest health systems after three decades of civil war and attacks by Islamic insurgents, as well as recurring humanitarian crises.\n\n\"We are not dismissing the fact that the death toll could be a lot higher than publicized,\" Mohamed Mohamud Ali, the head of Somalia's COVID-19 task force, told The Associated Press.\n\nThe numbers for the country are stark.\n\nThere is only one well-equipped quarantine facility for a population of more than 15 million people.\n\n\"Staff are reporting that people with symptoms are being told to stay home to save the limited health resources for those who become severely ill, showing that the official count is far off from reality,\" said Richard Crothers, the International Rescue Committee's country director, in remarks earlier this month.\n\nOthers who think they are infected often are too scared to even approach some clinics, adding to the unease in the population.\n\nSomalia was one of the last nations in Africa to have the capacity to test for the virus. Just over 2,700 tests have been carried out, according to the World Health Organization.\n\nMogadishu Mayor Omar Mohamud Mohamed touched off a panic early this month when he estimated almost 500 deaths in the capital in less than two weeks. Then, Somalia's information minister, Mohamed Abdi Hayir, warned that everyone who dies would be referred to as a COVID-19 victim.\n\nThe health ministry quickly dismissed the remarks as \"unproven\" and \"unsupported.\"\n\nStill, Ali described the spread of the virus as \"a speeding car with a failed brake.\"\n\nAbout the only advantage Somalia might have is the relative youth of its population, he said.\n\n\"Our capacity to deal with all cases in the country is limited, and we are afraid that trying to do so would make us overstretched, which could lead to negligence in handling the cases we have now,\" Ali said.\n\nSomalia's plight is echoed in other war-shattered countries where a fragile corps of health workers faces overwhelming odds.\n\n\"In places like Syria, Yemen and Libya, where health care infrastructure has been significantly damaged by ongoing conflict, mounting an effective response against COVID-19 poses an extremely difficult challenge,\" the United Nations has said. Aid groups have warned that those seeking shelter from fighting in crowded, squalid camps could find little escape from the virus if it arrives.\n\nU.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has pleaded for a global cease-fire to allow exhausted health workers to better deal with pandemic.\n\nIn Somalia, restrictions on flights and the difficulties of traveling in a country threatened by the al-Qaida-linked al-Shabab extremist group have left large regions without easy access to basic aid, let alone intensive care facilities.\n\n\"It has been extremely difficult to access these areas with humanitarian support during this long period of restriction and lockdown,\" the WHO said this week.\n\nThat has led some communities to take matters into their own hands.\n\nResidents of Beledweyne in central Somalia set up their own quarantine measures. \"We cannot wait for the government any longer,\" said Shafi'I Mohamed, a local infectious disease specialist. \"We had to do something.\"\n\nEvacuating patients to the capital \"is not an option for now, since that could further contribute the spread of the virus,\" said Ali, the COVID-19 task force leader.\n\nBut he urged communities to share information, saying authorities would still try to reach affected areas.\n\n\"Fear is the problem here,\" he said.\n\nAt Martini Hospital, the main facility treating COVID-19 patients in Mogadishu, health care workers have received little training, and they have raised concerns about their personal safety. One of its nurses died of the disease this week.\n\n\"The hospital has only 76 beds, among them 20 ICU beds,\" said Dr. Abdirisak Yusuf. \"The hospital cannot cover the needs of the population of people in Mogadishu. That is why we need to be planning to open other hospitals. I am very worried that the hospital will be overwhelmed by COVID-19 patients.\"\n\nHundreds of messages about virus prevention have been posted across Mogadishu, including in the crowded settlements of thousands of people displaced by drought and instability. Aid groups fear what will happen if the virus spreads among the country's 2.6 million displaced people, many with poor access to water and sanitation.\n\nMeanwhile, workers in one of Mogadishu's largest cemeteries are preparing for more funerals.\n\nGravedigger Ali Dhere said they were burying 15-25 bodies a day, \"and this has never happened before.\"\n\nMany families do not even register the death, simply burying their relatives on the day they die in accordance with Islamic customs. While data on the outbreak is badly needed, the cause of death remains unknown.\n\nFollow AP coverage of the virus outbreak at https://apnews.com/VirusOutbreak and https://apnews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak",
