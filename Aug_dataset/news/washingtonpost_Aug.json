        "body": "Brenda Emery hoped that after undergoing surgery, she would be comfortable in her body as a transgender woman. Then, the coronavirus pandemic caused cancellation of elective surgeries. (Bill O'Leary/The Washington Post) By Alyssa Fowers and Alyssa Fowers Graphics reporter focusing on data visualization and analysis William Wan William Wan National correspondent covering health, science and news August 18\n\nThe surgery was supposed to be a turning point.\n\nBrenda Emery spent a year preparing for the vaginoplasty. To save up for it, she took jobs in food service straight out of college and moved in with her mother. She talked at length to therapists and medical experts to make sure the procedure to modify her lower body was what she really wanted as a transgender woman.\n\nAfter the surgery, Emery hoped, she would be fully comfortable in her own body. Finally, she could pursue dreams of working in local theaters that had been put on hold to save money. So this March, she quit her restaurant job and prepared to travel from her home in the Maryland suburbs to New York for the procedure.\n\nThen came the novel coronavirus, halting all non-emergency surgeries.\n\n\"I just felt numb. I didn't know how to process it,\" Emery, 26, said. Her surgery got rescheduled for May, only to be canceled again. Unemployed and unsure whether the procedure would still happen, Emery spent her days in bed, grappling with anxiety, sadness and frustration. \"It felt like I put my whole life on hold.\"\n\nEven as the coronavirus has upended lives throughout the country, it has taken a deep toll on the transgender community, a population that has long struggled with higher rates of mental illness and poor medical care because of discrimination and abuse.\n\nSince the pandemic began, crisis calls to Trans Lifeline -- a crisis telephone line staffed by transgender people -- have risen 40 percent and continue to climb. At Whitman-Walker, an LGBTQ-focused community health center in Washington, mental health providers are seeing 25 percent more patients than they did before the pandemic, and they are no longer able to accept new referrals. Transgender peer support groups at Whitman-Walker have also reached capacity since the start of the pandemic.\n\nCrisis calls to Trans Lifeline increase during pandemic\n\nCalls per week\n\nRolling 3-week average\n\nCrisis calls reach a new high in June when the Trump administration\n\nrolls back federal\n\nprotections for\n\nLGBTQ healthcare\n\n90 weekly calls\n\nCalls increase in July 2019 when a social post about the help line goes viral\n\n0\n\nJune 2019\n\nJan.\n\nMar. 9\n\nJuly 2020\n\nNote: Calls per week to Trans Lifeline where caller is in active crisis, including suicidal ideation\n\nCrisis calls increase during pandemic\n\nCalls per week\n\nRolling 3-week average\n\nThe highest volume of calls is recorded in June after the Trump administration removes federal protections for LGBTQ healthcare\n\n90 weekly calls\n\nCalls to Trans Lifeline pick up in July 2019 when a social post about the help\n\nline goes viral\n\n0\n\nJune 2019\n\nJan. 2020\n\nMar. 9\n\nJuly\n\nNote: Calls per week to Trans Lifeline where caller is in active crisis, including suicidal ideation\n\nCrisis calls to Trans Lifeline increase during pandemic\n\nCalls per week\n\nRolling 3-week average\n\nThe highest volume of calls is recorded in June after the Trump administration removes federal protections for LGBTQ healthcare\n\n90 weekly calls\n\nCalls to Trans Lifeline pick up in July 2019 when a social post about the help line goes viral\n\n0\n\nMar. 9\n\nJune 2019\n\nJan. 2020\n\nJuly\n\nNote: calls per week where caller is in an active crisis, including suicidal ideation\n\nCrisis calls to Trans Lifeline increase during pandemic\n\nCalls per week\n\nRolling 3-week average\n\nThe highest volume of calls is recorded in June after the Trump administration removes federal protections for LGBTQ healthcare\n\n90 weekly calls\n\nCalls to Trans Lifeline pick up in July 2019 when a social post about the help line goes viral\n\n0\n\nJan. 2020\n\nMar. 9\n\nJune 2019\n\nJuly 2020\n\nNote: calls per week where caller is in an active crisis, including suicidal ideation\n\nMeanwhile, advocates say some are experiencing more abuse than usual, especially as some are forced to move back home or stay closer to people who don't support them. Homicides of transgender people, for example, have skyrocketed. In 2019, the Human Rights Campaign tracked at least 27 deaths nationally from violence against transgender and gender nonconforming people. In the first half of this year, the homicide total has already reached 26, according to the Human Rights Campaign.\n\nIn recent months, the cratering economy has alarmed many in the transgender population, which experiences a substantially higher rate of unemployment and workplace discrimination.\n\nAdvocates for transgender rights say unemployment has a domino effect: lack of jobs means lack of insurance and medical care. Such struggles combined with isolation have placed increasing psychological pressure on a population already beset with high rates of suicide and mental health crises.\n\nIn a 2015 survey of transgender people...\n\n40% attempted suicide\n\n82% seriously\n\nconsidered suicide in their lifetime\n\nIn the general population...\n\n5% attempted suicide\n\n15% seriously\n\nconsidered suicide in their lifetime\n\nIn a 2015 survey of\n\ntransgender people...\n\nIn the general\n\npopulation...\n\n82%\n\nseriously\n\nconsidered\n\nsuicide at some point\n\nin their life\n\n15%\n\nseriously\n\nconsidered\n\nsuicide at some point\n\nin their life\n\n40%\n\nattempted suicide\n\n5%\n\nattempted suicide\n\nIn a 2015 survey of\n\ntransgender people...\n\nIn the general\n\npopulation...\n\n15%\n\nseriously considered suicide at some point in their life\n\n82%\n\nseriously considered suicide at some point in their life\n\n40%\n\nattempted suicide\n\n5%\n\nattempted suicide\n\nIn a 2015 survey of\n\ntransgender people...\n\nIn the general population...\n\n15%\n\nseriously considered suicide at some point in their life\n\n82%\n\nseriously considered suicide at some point in their life\n\n40%\n\nattempted suicide\n\n5%\n\nattempted suicide\n\n\"We're survivors as a community,\" said Elena Rose Vera, executive director of Trans Lifeline. \"But all these problems reinforce each other and exacerbate everything we're already facing. ... It's like the volume has been turned up on everything.\"\n\nWhile studies have shown the coronavirus has disproportionately infected and killed African Americans and Hispanics, the extent of the coronavirus's effect on the transgender community is unclear because most states do not collect data on the LGBTQ community. In recent weeks -- five months into the pandemic -- California became one of the few to begin doing so.\n\nExperts are particularly worried about an alarming increase in mental health problems. The pandemic has increased anxiety and depression across the country, and transgender people may be enduring the additional stresses of the pandemic with an already elevated risk for mental crises. A survey conducted online among a non-random volunteer sample of 27,715 transgender people found that 40% of respondents had attempted suicide in their lifetimes, 8 times the rate of the general population. Those results provide a glimpse of the mental health experiences of transgender Americans, although the finding cannot be projected to the overall transgender population.\n\nIn the past, what has driven much of that mental health burden is gender dysphoria -- the psychological pain caused by living in a body that does not match one's gender identity. \"But that's powerfully alleviated by getting the care that we need,\" Vera said. \"The further struggles we have are due to people treating us poorly.\"\n\nTransgender mental health counselors say they have seen signs those struggles have increased in intensity during the pandemic.\n\nCrisis calls touch on...\n\n59%\n\nSuicidal ideation\n\nCovid-19\n\n42%\n\nLack of trans community\n\n24%\n\nMedical treatments to bring one's body more in line with one's gender\n\n22%\n\nFamily rejection\n\n21%\n\nVerbal/emotional abuse\n\n18%\n\nMedical transition\n\nDistress about the difference between one's gender and body\n\n15%\n\nPTSD\n\n14%\n\nBody dysphoria\n\nReferring to someone as the incorrect gender or with a given name they no longer use\n\n14%\n\nMisgendering/deadnaming\n\n13%\n\nComing out to family\n\nNote: Percent of crisis calls associated with\n\neach topic from March 9 to August 2.

Other people, like Emery, have struggled with rescheduled surgery or obtaining other transition-related care.\n\nBritt Walsh, director of gender-affirming care at Whitman-Walker, said mental health problems early in the pandemic were often attributable to delays in care.\n\n\"There's very real devastation and day-to-day upheaval. Access for surgery requires jumping through hoops and gate-keeping to prove to your insurance that this is medically necessary,\" Walsh said.\n\nOne in seven crisis calls during the pandemic involved medical transition\n\nMar. 9\n\nAug. 2\n\n15% of crisis calls\n\nEach line represents a fifth of weekly crisis calls answered by Trans Lifeline\n\nOne in seven crisis calls during the pandemic discussed medical transition\n\nMar. 9\n\nAug. 2\n\n15% of crisis calls\n\nEach line represents a fifth of weekly crisis calls answered by Trans Lifeline\n\nOne in seven crisis calls during the pandemic discussed\n\nmedical transition\n\nMar. 9\n\nAug. 2\n\n15% of crisis calls\n\nEach line represents a fifth of weekly crisis calls answered by Trans Lifeline\n\nOne in seven crisis calls during the pandemic discussed medical transition\n\nMar. 9\n\nAug. 2\n\n15% of crisis calls\n\nEach line represents a fifth of weekly crisis calls answered by Trans Lifeline\n\nSome in the transgender community have struggled during the pandemic to maintain hormone therapy.\n\nIn the early days of the pandemic, Coral Mercy Cruse was turned away when she tried to pick up a refill of her estrogen prescription. The pharmacy technicians insisted not enough time had passed between prescriptions even after she explained they were mistaken. And as she turned to leave, she said, she heard them laughing at her.\n\n\"I felt dehumanized,\" Cruse said. \"My hormones were being dangled in front of me, and I wasn't even being talked to like a human being. I felt a lot of hopelessness about being treated this way forever.\"\n\nThat night, she struggled with suicidal thoughts and called Trans Lifeline for help. \"If they hadn't been there,\" Cruse said, \"I don't know what would have happened that night.\"\n\nAmid a pandemic in which health care has become especially urgent, transgender people also face barriers to medical care because of discrimination -- clinicians who dismiss medical injuries as minor or somehow related to being transgender because they are uncomfortable with treating them.\n\nAdvocates describe the phenomenon as \"trans broken arm syndrome\" -- being turned away from medical care when clinicians treat issues such as broken arms as a symptom of being transgender.\n\nThat discrimination has in turn caused some transgender people to distrust medical establishments or made them less likely to seek medical help.\n\n\"The president of the United States told doctors they will be protected if they treat me unfairly. That doesn't increase my confidence in my chances if I catch covid-19,\" said Vera, who leads Trans Lifeline.\n\nThis summer, the Trump administration rolled back nondiscrimination protections for transgender people in health care, which was seen as a significant setback in the movement for LGBTQ rights. The rollback has since been challenged in court.\n\nAdvocates say transgender people are also more vulnerable during the pandemic because of how closely America has tied access to health care to employment.\n\nThe pandemic has made jobs -- and the employer-based insurance it offers -- a lifeline that transgender people cannot afford to lose, which for some has meant hiding who they are during this time of crisis, crisis counselors say.\n\nMonica, an engineer in Upstate New York, said she feels drained every day by the effort of staying in the closet. \"What I show out in the field is Charlie. I have to translate from Charlie to Monica, and Monica to Charlie, and that's exhausting.\"\n\nSpeaking on the condition only her first name be used for of fear of workplace discrimination, she said she decided to stay in the closet after watching a transgender colleague experience so much harassment she was forced to leave their company and work as an outside contractor. Another friend lost her job after coming out at work. \"If you get ridiculed all the time, it's really tough to take,\" she said. \"I fear I could lose my job and insurance at 60 years old. This is what has ruled my world for the last 35 years.\"\n\nBeyond loss of insurance, unemployment puts food, rent and other necessities out of reach, increasing anxiety and chances of mental health crises, counselors say. \"There is a joke in the community that we're always passing the same $15 around to each others' fundraisers,\" Vera said. \"That's been true for as long as I've been part of the community. But now more than ever, I'm seeing fundraisers for rent, for food. The need is enormous.\"\n\nAs transgender people lose jobs, many have also lost housing. Some younger transgender people were forced to move back in with family members who don't always support them and have in some cases tried to force them back into the closet, according to peer facilitators for transgender support groups at the DC Center for the LGBT Community.\n\nSince the pandemic started, virtual support groups held by the center have attracted almost twice as many people as their in-person sessions before the crisis.\n\nThe counseling team at Whitman-Walker has received messages from those trapped in unsafe living situations. \"We sometimes get messages from Instagram or Facebook Messenger where someone says: 'You can't call me, I can't email you. It's not safe where I am. But please, can you help me access services?'\" Walsh said.\n\nOne in four crisis calls during\n\nthe pandemic discussed lack of\n\ntrans community\n\nMar. 9\n\nAug. 2\n\n24% of crisis calls\n\nEach line represents a fifth of weekly crisis calls answered by Trans Lifeline\n\nOne in four crisis calls during the pandemic discussed lack of trans community\n\nMar. 9\n\nAug. 2\n\n24% of crisis calls\n\nEach line represents a fifth of weekly crisis calls answered by Trans Lifeline\n\nOne in four crisis calls during the pandemic discussed\n\nlack of trans community\n\nMar. 9\n\nAug. 2\n\n24% of crisis calls\n\nEach line represents a fifth of weekly crisis calls answered by Trans Lifeline\n\nOne in four crisis calls during the pandemic discussed lack of trans community\n\nMar. 9\n\nAug. 2\n\n24% of crisis calls\n\nEach line represents a fifth of weekly crisis calls answered by Trans Lifeline\n\nAs the pandemic stretches on, transgender people have continued a tradition of turning to one another for support.\n\nEven amid a pandemic, police brutality, nationwide protests and rollback of transgender rights, \"we're still finding ways to see each other and meet our community's needs,\" said Jessica Austin, a peer support facilitator at the DC Center. \"Community allows us to move through all this unrest.\"\n\n\"We do this because it's necessary,\" said Vivian Topping, another peer support facilitator. \"There's a world where we say, we're exhausted, we can't do it, and the group doesn't continue. But that doesn't happen because trans folks push really hard to support our people and be resilient. There's still beauty. There's still joy. There's still a life to keep looking forward to.\"\n\nIf you or someone you know are transgender and need help, call the Trans Lifeline at 877-565-8860.

        "body": "Micah Conrad, 26, in Los Angeles this summer. (Jenna Schoenefeld for The Washington Post)\n\nIt began as a freelance job. Micah Conrad would wake up midmorning, check his email and begin downloading videos that had arrived while he slept. He would brew coffee, drinking it on the narrow patio of the small apartment he shares with his wife in a sun-bleached building near the intersection of Hollywood and Sunset boulevards in Los Angeles. Then it was back inside, where he would edit footage for the next 10 hours at a standing desk in the corner of their bedroom.\n\nA 26-year-old aspiring filmmaker clinging to the lowest rungs of Hollywood's hierarchy, Conrad often took work as it came. The virtual conference whose presentations he was now polishing provided at least a week of steady employment at a time when the coronavirus pandemic had cut off many of his regular sources of income.\n\nThen, on a Sunday night in late April, he went on Facebook to announce that the conference was providing him with something else: a revelation that challenged his understanding of his body, his government and -- above all -- the infection that was ending and changing lives across the country.\n\nConrad had been editing videos for an event called the Health Freedom Summit. The faces he was studying for so many hours on his computer screen belonged to some of the world's most influential anti-vaccine activists and coronavirus skeptics.\n\nThere was Andrew Wakefield, the British ex-doctor behind a fraudulent study linking autism to the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine; Robert F. Kennedy Jr., whose transformation from crusading litigator to anti-vaccination firebrand had outraged other members of one of America's most storied political dynasties; Judy Mikovits, a disgraced virologist who would soon become famous for her starring role in \"Plandemic,\" a video that promoted conspiracy theories about the pandemic while attacking Microsoft founder Bill Gates and Anthony S. Fauci, the nation's top infectious-disease expert.\n\nConrad was unsure what to make of these speakers, he told his 600 Facebook friends. But he believed they deserved a fair hearing.\n\n\"I've had countless moments where I completely stopped work, and just listened to what these people had to say about topics like COVID-19, the government setting America up for mandatory Vaccinations, and how we are so brainwashed by what the mass media is telling us day in and day out,\" he wrote, including a link to the summit's Facebook page. \"Before you make a potential life changing decision about your health and personal freedoms, ask yourself WHO and WHAT ultimately convinced you. Challenge your own facts and reasoning.\"\n\nThe reaction from his online social circle was swift -- and divided.\n\n\"Yeah boii! Lots of people waking up,\" one friend enthused in a comment on his post.\n\n\"This is not 'health freedom,' this is stoking paranoia for the purpose of political gain,\" another warned. \"These people do NOT have your best interest at heart.\"\n\nConrad had never given much thought to politics or public policy. But he had stumbled into a debate that could reshape a country reeling from the worst pandemic in a century. When he wrote his Facebook post, covid-19 had killed at least 52,000 people in the United States. Since then, the death toll has more than tripled and almost 6 million Americans have become infected. Amid inconsistent, incomplete or incompetent state and federal efforts to contain the virus, many Americans have placed their hopes in the breakneck quest for a vaccine.\n\nBut even if a safe and effective vaccine is developed, its universal embrace is not assured. The haste with which vaccines are being pursued, bungled messaging by public health officials and President Trump's politicization of the science surrounding the virus have all contributed to doubts about inoculation against covid-19.\n\nThose doubts are also being fueled by anti-vaccination activists, who are seeking an unprecedented victory for their movement by undermining confidence in a drug that could end the pandemic.\n\nFor months, they have spread messages rejected by an overwhelming majority of scientists and doctors. Among them are the ideas that common vaccines are inherently dangerous, that the coronavirus can be conquered by spending time in the sun and taking vitamin supplements, that Gates is plotting to profit from the pandemic and even that covid-19 symptoms are caused by plutonium from exploding satellites.\n\nScientists don't agree on the threshold for herd immunity, the percentage of the population that must become resistant to the virus in order to halt its spread. But most do agree that a vaccine will have greater odds of success if large numbers of people are immunized -- and that outcome is in doubt.\n\nA CNN poll in mid-August found that 40 percent of Americans said they would not try to get a coronavirus vaccine if it were widely available at a low cost. In a literal sense, the fate of the virus and the country it has crippled hang on American public opinion -- on the opinions of people like Micah Conrad.\n\nBefore he began work on the Health Freedom Summit, Conrad had accepted health officials' warnings about the threat of the coronavirus and their advice for reducing the risk of contracting it. But he had also been raised, like many Americans, to question authority. Behind the heavy curtains that blocked Southern California's sunlight from his bedroom-cum-office, that skepticism was being stoked. Here were men and women whose names were followed by PhD and MD, saying that face mask recommendations were the first step toward a new age of tyranny and that the coronavirus was no more dangerous than the common cold.\n\n\"These are knowledgeable people,\" Conrad said, \"and they're saying stuff that's very, very different than what's in the media right now.\"\n\nWhen Conrad wrote his Facebook post in the spring, he was still sorting out whether he would get a coronavirus vaccine. But the simple fact of his uncertainty posed a challenge for the doctors, scientists and politicians trying to beat back the pandemic.\n\nConrad had received his early childhood vaccinations. He had little exposure to the fringe figures who for decades have promoted anti-vaccine ideology. In 2016, he voted for Hillary Clinton.\n\nIf someone like him could be persuaded to reject a coronavirus vaccine, how many others might follow?\n\nTanned, tall and lean, Conrad blends in among the aspiring creative types drawn to his adopted city. He lives in Los Feliz, a fashionable neighborhood north of downtown L.A., where young people can be found at odd hours of the work day picking at pastries alfresco along Hillhurst Avenue or testing their legs against the hills of Griffith Park.\n\nBut he passed his formative years in a very different environment. Conrad grew up on the rural western shore of Michigan's lower peninsula. His family home was on several forested acres above a ravine; a creek running across the property empties a half-mile west into Lake Michigan. His dad was a salesman. His mom, an art teacher, left her job to care for and eventually home-school Conrad and his sister. Life was insular and could feel remote.\n\nConrad loved it.\n\n\"It was just a boy's heaven,\" he said. Like many home-schoolers, the Conrads found that lessons could often be completed by lunchtime, allowing Micah to wander the woods by afternoon. He hunted deer and fished in the backyard creek for steelhead trout. But Micah was not a budding Marlboro Man, according to his mother, Sue Conrad.\n\n\"When he saw his dad clean a fish for the first time, he just about lost it,\" she recalled.\n\nGentle and inquisitive, Micah -- along with his sister, who would go on to become a professional ballerina -- also showed artistic tendencies from an early age. A pivotal moment in his life-defining obsession with film came when he and his dad watched a movie not universally hailed as high art: \"Rambo III.\"\n\nAction and superhero stories would remain Micah's preferred genre. Beneath the explosions and schlock one-liners, he believed, these movies revolved around timeless and important themes: the power and consequences of individual choices, the possibility for even the most ordinary person to do something extraordinary. A Batman poster adorns the walls of Micah's apartment today.\n\n\"What I love about him is that he's just a normal guy like everyone else. He's just a dude,\" Micah said. \"But he reminds us that every dude can be a hero.\"\n\nAnother powerful influence shaped Micah's life from an early age: religion. The family regularly attended a nondenominational Christian church in the nearby town of Holland, and he remains a believer. His mother said she sought to instill in him a desire to understand God's will and to follow his conscience when making decisions.\n\nIt was her own conscience that led Sue Conrad to embrace alternative diets and health care. She believed that a healthy, well-nourished immune system was often more important than the interventions of modern medicine. Although she vaccinated both her children, Micah received fewer inoculations than his older sister. The last was a tetanus booster after he cut himself playing outside at age 5. Vitamin supplements accompanied a family diet that revolved around wild game and fresh fruits and vegetables.\n\n\"I'm not going to say we didn't run through Taco Bell when we needed some fast food when we were out,\" Sue said. \"But by and large, their food was as natural as we could get it.\"\n\nIt was this idiosyncratic mix of influences -- sermons and Stallone, venison and Taco Bell -- that Micah brought with him to L.A. in 2013 after completing an associate degree at a film school in Grand Rapids, Mich. He worked as a production assistant, a visual-effects artist, a teleprompter operator. He fell in love and married. He both embraced and distrusted the profoundly secular, liberal culture that held sway in Hollywood.\n\nSo when a series of speakers appeared on his computer screen challenging that culture's received truths, Micah sat up and listened.\n\nAs the pandemic worsened this spring, some health experts believed it would spell the end of the anti-vaccine movement by showing the danger of a virus for which no inoculation is available.\n\nTara C. Smith, an epidemiologist and professor at the Kent State University College of Public Health, knew that optimism betrayed unfamiliarity with the tactics of those who challenge vaccine safety. And she knew that far from crippling the movement, the pandemic provided it with a rare opportunity.\n\nThe same public-health establishment long reviled by anti-vaccination activists was now urging strict limitations on Americans' freedom to shop, eat in restaurants or gather for religious worship. Vaccine opponents rushed to join forces with Trump supporters holding demonstrations to reopen the economy in defiance of expert advice.\n\n\"I'm not surprised at all that these combined into a new flavor of science denial,\" Smith said.\n\nAnti-vaccine messages have at least tripled from their pre-pandemic level, said Joe Smyser of the Public Good Projects, a health policy nonprofit that tracks vaccine information in social media, blogs, online news publications and other sources through an initiative called Project VCTR.\n\n\"Just from a research point of view, it's fascinating to watch,\" Smyser said. \"Whereas public health is very disorganized in our approach to the pandemic, anti-vaxxers are extremely organized and are hosting online summits and doing advocacy training.\"\n\nOne effort that caught Smyser's attention was the Health Freedom Summit. Released online in late April, it ultimately drew approximately 35,000 registrants, said Alana Newman, one of the organizers.\n\nNewman, who lives in Louisiana, praised Conrad's editing work for the summit, which included sepia graphics and an ominous soundtrack that begins and ends the presentations. \"Any idea he suggested, he implemented it, and went beyond my wildest dreams as to how beautiful the results were,\" she said.\n\nThe conference's recurring message was that government officials were exaggerating the threat of the coronavirus in an attempt to violate individual liberties, culminating in a program of forced, universal vaccination that was possibly tied to a plan for worldwide population surveillance.\n\n\"We are seeing a destruction of the economy, a destruction of people and families . . . and unprecedented violations of health freedom,\" Wakefield said. \"And it's all based upon a fallacy. \"\n\nMikovits -- who would reach millions in \"Plandemic,\" which was removed by Facebook, YouTube and others for misinformation that could put people at risk -- warned that wearing masks would actually make people sick.\n\n\"Viruses don't float through the air,\" she said. \"You can't spread it the way they're saying it's spreading, so the masks are hurting the people wearing them, and I can't say that enough.\"\n\nSuch statements are contradicted by data and broad scientific consensus. Not only is the coronavirus airborne; many researchers now believe that it spreads even more easily through air than initially known. Since reopening its economy, the United States has experienced an explosion of infections and deaths.\n\nIn Florida, one of the states that has been ravaged by covid-19 since efforts to contain the virus were relaxed, Michael Green was dumbfounded by Conrad's tentative endorsement of the Health Freedom Summit speakers on his Facebook page. Green, a 31-year-old visual effects artist and film editor who worked with Conrad in California before moving to Tampa, was among those who pushed back in the comments section of Conrad's April post.\n\n\"I wouldn't say that I'm really good friends with Micah, but I've hung out with him on multiple occasions,\" Green said in an interview. \"To see somebody that you do care about end up being persuaded into this -- whatever you want to call it -- it's frustrating. Because you want to just be, like, 'No, dude, don't do it. It's the dark side.' \"\n\nNewman -- whose interview with a Washington Post reporter was interrupted when a police officer confronted her at a store where she was shopping without a required mask -- defended the views espoused in the conference, saying federal and state officials' response to the pandemic had been excessive. Regardless of the merits of the arguments made at the summit, she said, people should be able to hear them and reach their own conclusions.\n\n\"What's the threat,\" Newman said, \"of people considering ideas?\"\n\nA few days before the summit went live at the end of April, Conrad said, he was on a call with Newman and Stephanie Lind, the event's co-host. Lind was a friend of Conrad's who had brought him on board for the project. Conrad asked how publicity for the conference was going. Was word about the summit getting out?\n\nThere was a problem on that front, Lind admitted: Facebook had shut down their ads.\n\nConrad was confused. Was there a copyright problem?\n\nNo, Lind told him: The summit had been tagged as coronavirus misinformation. Facebook was in the midst of a crackdown on false or misleading material that could abet the spread of the virus.\n\n\"It took me a second to process that,\" Conrad recalled. \"I was like, 'Wow. So Facebook is deciding to label what we're doing as misinformation. Where are they getting that story from? And is that their right?' \"\n\nAmid those questions, Conrad felt sure about one thing: By helping to spread messages others were trying to suppress, he was doing the right thing.\n\n\"It didn't make me concerned about what I was doing,\" he said of the social media Goliath's censorship. \"It made me motivated to get it out.\"\n\nHis conviction grew in the days and weeks after the summit during discussions with his 29-year-old wife, Dasha, an aspiring actress. The pair had met at church and married in 2018. Dasha Conrad, who immigrated from Kazakhstan to Texas with her mother as a child, had heard about the Illuminati, an 18th-century secret society founded in Bavaria that has been grist for countless conspiracy theories. The notion of a shadowy network of elites directing the course of history made sense to her. Assertions that powerful people had orchestrated the pandemic did not seem far-fetched.\n\n\"The whole system is corrupt,\" she said. \"I don't know the whole answer. I just know that we have to be awakened to it.\"\n\nThe Conrads talked about what was being said in the videos Micah edited. Why were social media companies and public health officials going to such lengths to stop those voices? Were they afraid of what might happen if people were allowed to decide for themselves what was true and what was false?\n\nAnd so the Conrads made their own decision. They might not be able to verify all the Health Freedom Summit information. But they saw plenty of reasons to distrust the authorities pushing for a coronavirus vaccine.\n\nA vaccine that Micah and Dasha Conrad would not be getting.\n\n\"I don't think it's necessary to put that into our bodies,\" Micah said. Instead, the couple would focus on boosting their immune systems through exercise and healthy food, with diets that include intermittent fasting and a regimen of homemade juices.\n\nMicah said he is not opposed to all vaccines and acknowledges the benefits they have provided to many. He and Dasha weren't rejecting every mainstream medical suggestion for combating the coronavirus. They continued to wear masks in public places out of respect for those around them.\n\nBut Micah's trust in some of that guidance was continuing to erode. He was asking more questions and scouring the Internet for answers. On June 24, about 10 weeks after he had first urged his friends on social media not to trust what they were hearing about the pandemic from the government and the media, he again went on Facebook, quoting from a widely circulated post that cast doubt on the effectiveness of masks.\n\n\"Ooo, this is interesting,\" Conrad wrote to his friends. \"What are your thoughts?\"\n\nThe debate did not get far. Facebook removed his post, telling him in a notification that it violated the company's standards on \"misinformation that could cause physical harm.\"\n\nMicah still believed he was just exercising his right to free speech, asking questions that encouraged people to think for themselves. But to those patrolling social media for coronavirus falsehoods, it was clear which side he was on.\n\nStory editing by Lynda Robinson. Photo editing by Mark Miller. Video editing by Peter W.

    "A TV reporter learned she had cancer after a viewer sent her a concerned email": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "When she opened an email in June that had a small message in the subject line but was otherwise empty, Price, 28, was tempted to dismiss it as a bad joke or spam. But then she impulsively decided to hand her phone to her boyfriend, Ryan Smith.\n\n\"I said, 'Look at this weird email I just got,' \" recalled Price, an investigative journalist for NBC affiliate WFLA.\n\nA woman from out of state had seen a report by Price on the evening news a few hours earlier and had spotted something that troubled her, she said.\n\n\"Hi, just saw your news report,\" the viewer wrote. \"What concerned me is the lump on your neck. Please have your thyroid checked. Reminds me of my neck. Mine turned out to be cancer. Take care of yourself.\"\n\nPrice, who had never noticed anything unusual about the appearance of her neck, said she didn't think the message was worth taking seriously.\n\nSmith thought otherwise.\n\nAdvice from a woman who survived covid-19, the 1918 flu -- and cancer\n\n\"He said, 'You know, you did say you've been feeling a little more tired than usual these last few months,' \" Price said. \"He told me that I should call my doctor and have it checked out.\"\n\nSeveral weeks later, after she had had an ultrasound and a blood panel screening, Price received startling news: She had papillary thyroid cancer that had started to spread to her lymph nodes. Her doctor recommended that she have surgery as soon as possible.\n\n\"It was explained to me that I had a large nodule growing right in the middle of my thyroid, and it was pushing my gland so that it bulged from the side of my neck,\" Price said. \"That's what the woman who emailed me had noticed. Fortunately for me, she reached out about it.\"\n\nOn July 27, Price underwent surgery at Tampa General Hospital to have her thyroid removed. Her surgeon also removed 19 cancerous lymph nodes, she said, and she was relieved to learn that she didn't immediately need to do any follow-up treatment apart from daily hormone replacement medicine.\n\n\"It's serendipity that somebody noticed it on television and told her about it, but to discover it this way is really not uncommon,\" said Gary Clayman, Price's surgeon and the director of the Clayman Thyroid Center in Tampa, explaining that a common symptom is a visible mass in the neck.\n\n\"Victoria is lucky that this was detected sooner than later,\" he added.\n\nA few days before the surgery, in a post on Twitter, Price alerted WFLA viewers to her diagnosis and thanked the observant stranger who may have saved her life.\n\n\"As a journalist, it's been full throttle since the pandemic began,\" she wrote. \"Never-ending shifts in a never-ending news cycle. We were covering the most important health story in a century, but my own health was the farthest thing from my mind. Until a viewer emailed me last month.\n\n\"Turns out, I have cancer,\" Price wrote. \"And I owe it to one of our wonderful @WFLA viewers for bringing it to my attention. I'll be off work for a bit after tomorrow, but I'll see y'all soon.\"\n\nShe was stunned, she said, when her tweet rapidly built up nearly 20,000 likes.\n\n\"I never in a million years thought it would develop this kind of reaction,\" she said. \"Everyone's kindness, love and concern has been overwhelming.\"\n\nNow back at work, Price said she hopes to launch a foundation before year's end to promote thyroid cancer awareness for young adults.\n\n\"I've learned that for young people, particularly women between ages 20 and 35, this is the most commonly diagnosed cancer,\" she said, with about 53,000 people diagnosed every year.\n\n\"I think it's important to make this something that's discussed more often, just like we discuss breast cancer and prostate cancer,\" Price said. \"My goal is to develop a platform for young professionals who might not be going to the doctor as often.\"\n\nIf not for that alert viewer, Price said, she might have gone for months without knowing she had a problem.\n\n\"What if I was an accountant working in an office? Or what if I was working at home by myself?\" she said. \"I'm fortunate that a lot of people see me because of my job. It's very humbling to know that this person took the time to shoot me this little email. Your health is your wealth -- without it, you don't have anything.\"\n\nPrice remained calm when she learned she had cancer, she said, probably because of her journalism background.\n\n\"I took a few seconds to process it then said: 'Okay, what's the game plan? What are we going to do about it?' \" she said. \"TV reporters are conductors of chaos -- we're always 30 seconds to airtime, covering problems that need to be solved. So it takes a little more to rattle me, I think, than the average person.\"\n\nThe woman who spotted the suspicious lump in her neck is a mother with several children who doesn't want any attention for her potentially lifesaving act, Price said.\n\n\"We've exchanged texts back and forth and hope to get together at some point,\" she said. \"I'm so incredibly thankful for what she did. If she hadn't sent that email, I may have never seen my doctor, and the cancer would have continued to grow.\n\n\"I just want to thank her from the bottom of my heart for what she did,\" she said.\n\nHe asked to play a piano at a store.

    "A Taiwan health official tried to warn the world about the novel coronavirus. The U.S. didn't listen.": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "Chinese health officials had linked the outbreak to a seafood market in Wuhan, and claimed it was not spreading between people. Now the local officials were describing clusters of cases that seemed to suggest human-to-human transmission -- but were hesitant to say so.\n\nBy the time Chuang returned to Taiwan two days later, he was convinced that China was hiding critical information. The next day, he held a news conference to warn the world.\n\nTaiwan took immediate action. The United States did not.\n\nThe United States' top health official, Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar, is in Taiwan this week for the highest-level visit by a U.S. Cabinet secretary since 1979, when the United States cut formal ties with Taiwan to establish diplomatic relations with China.\n\nTaiwan and U.S. to hold highest-level meeting since 1979 as China tensions soar\n\nThe trip is meant to signal Washington's support for Taiwan at a time when the United States and China are at odds over nearly everything. It's also a chance for the United States and Taiwan to compare notes on the pandemic.\n\nThe gap between the democracies is stark: Taiwan, population 23 million, has reported fewer than 500 novel coronavirus cases and seven deaths as of Sunday. The United States, population 328 million, has reported 5 million cases and more than 162,000 deaths.\n\nIn an interview with The Washington Post, Chuang described learning of the virus that in less than nine months has infected more than 19.7 million people worldwide and killed more than 729,000.\n\nMuch of Taiwan's coronavirus strategy -- masks, contact tracing, testing, quarantine -- has been well documented. But Chuang's testimony about the earliest days of the outbreak offers additional lessons about how Taiwan was able to stop the coronavirus in its tracks -- while the United States was overrun.\n\nTaiwan is pushing hard to join the World Health Organization, against objections from China, arguing that it has much to offer the international community on global public health. It's a campaign the United States has supported, even as the White House seeks to sever ties with the U.N. health agency.\n\nChuang's account is a timely reminder that Taiwan warned the world about the coronavirus's deadly potential early, but few listened. \"I was disappointed,\" Chuang said.\n\nLike many infectious-disease specialists, Chuang first heard about a mysterious pneumonia in Wuhan in late December. He recalled seeing reports online that Wuhan health officials were ordering hospitals to report all cases -- a potentially worrying sign.\n\nThe small Pacific islands at the center of a big power play\n\nOn Dec. 31 -- days before the first warning from the WHO -- Taiwan started inspecting flights from the central Chinese city. The Taiwan Centers for Disease Control formed a task force.\n\nIn early January, China linked the mysterious pneumonia to a seafood market and promptly shut it down. Chinese officials said the virus was not spreading between people. The WHO repeated this claim.\n\nBut many infectious-disease specialists, particularly those who were veterans of the 2003 SARS epidemic, were not convinced. Taiwan pushed to visit China. By Jan. 12, Chuang was en route to Wuhan, where he would spend two days with a group of experts from Hong Kong and Macao.\n\nThe group met with local officials the next day. The first red flag, Chuang recalled, was that their hosts briefed them verbally, without showing them epidemiological curves, or \"epi curves,\" that are essential to understanding outbreaks.\n\n\"They did not provide a PowerPoint, they did not provide any curves, so I knew they were reluctant to show us everything,\" he said.\n\nThen there were the cases. What the Chinese officials described were clusters in which not every case was directly linked to the market. This suggested that people were spreading the virus elsewhere.\n\nThe group pressed the officials for more epidemiological detail. \"Most of the visitors tried to ask about human-to-human transmission, each one from a different angle,\" Chuang said.\n\nTaiwan's CPBL becomes first baseball league to allow fans during coronavirus pandemic\n\nThe Chinese officials kept saying there was no evidence of human-to-human transmission, Chuang said. Then a national official interjected, saying limited human-to-human transmission could not be excluded. \"So, this is the real situation,\" Chuang thought.\n\nHis suspicions were deepened the next day at Wuhan's Jinyintan Hospital, where the group was taken to a \"clean room\" and shown patients on a monitor. The measures suggested that doctors were worried about visitors getting infected.\n\nChuang and the others pressed for case details, but the doctors were tight-lipped. He realized he would be going home without all the information he expected. \"Probably they were not allowed to tell the truth,\" he said.\n\nChuang returned to Taiwan and updated health officials. The next day, he outlined his findings to the press. Taiwan immediately upped its travel advisory, warning travelers to Wuhan to avoid crowded places and urging those returning from the city to inform their doctors if they developed symptoms.\n\nIt wasn't until three days later, on Jan. 19, that the head of a Chinese government team confirmed human-to-human transmission. Also at that time, a regional WHO office tweeted that there was evidence of limited human-to-human transmission.\n\nTaiwan rejects WHO chief's claim of racist campaign against him\n\nTaiwan was ready. On Jan. 20, a Taiwanese woman returned from Wuhan with a fever, cough and shortness of breath. Health officials knew exactly what to do: She was taken from the airport to a designated hospital by a quarantine officer and treated in an isolation room.\n\nHer test came back positive. Health officials alerted the public and contacted 46 people from her flight, Taiwan's CDC said in a detailed news release.\n\nLater that day, the United States reported its first case -- but did not raise the same alarm. In a Jan. 22 interview at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, President Trump said everything was \"totally under control.\"\n\n\"It's one person coming in from China. We have it under control,\" he said. \"It's going to be just fine.\"\n\n'One China' dispute means one big headache for Taiwan in coronavirus crisis\n\nTaiwan beat covid-19 and won friends. At the WHO, it's still fighting for a seat at the table.",

        "body": "Pitcher Zach Plesac apologized after the Indians called a car service to take him home from Chicago rather than letting him fly home with his teammates after he violated team rules and protocols by going out Saturday night with friends.\n\n\"I realize I made a poor choice to leave the hotel, which broke protocols and could have endangered other people,\" Plesac said in a statement. \"I understand that in these times of uncertainty, I need to be more vigilant and responsible, and I am determined to earn my teammates' forgiveness and get back to work.\"\n\nIt is unclear whether Plesac had been tested and he will be tested daily while being quarantined for three days. The team had yet to decide whether he would be disciplined for his decision during a compressed, 60-game season.\n\n\"We love Zach, we support him, but he screwed up,\" pitcher Shane Bieber said (via ESPN). \"We're going to handle this in-house, and we'll see where it goes from here.\"\n\nAfter another Cardinals player tested positive, the Cardinals' series against the Pittsburgh Pirates, which was to have run Monday through Wednesday in St. Louis was postponed. The Cardinals have not played since July 29, with 17 members of the organization (10 players and seven staff members) having tested positive since last week.\n\nCardinals Manager Mike Schildt revealed Sunday that some members of the organization have had to seek treatment in an emergency room after experiencing symptoms. John Mozeliak, the team's president of baseball operations, said one player and one staff member had gone to a hospital, but neither was admitted for treatment and both are at home.\n\nAfter coronavirus shutdown, rebuilt Marlins rise to top of NL East standings\n\n\"There are people that have symptoms, and have had a few visits to the ER for some IVs and a little more clarity.\" Shildt said during a KMOX interview.\n\n\"Nobody has had to stay [in the hospital]. But there are people dealing with -- I mean, this is real. And people are experiencing a lot of the symptoms that we hear about, that are associated with this. A variety of them. Most of them are experiencing multiple ones. Seems like they rotate with them,\" Shildt said. \"And again, nobody is in close to any critical shape, but people are having to deal with some things that aren't comfortable at all.\"\n\nSince MLB's season began, 27 games have been postponed because of coronavirus concerns, with the Miami Marlins and 21 positive tests the epicenter of the sport's problems. MLB has responded by placing stricter rules on players and staff on and off the field.\n\nFor Mozeliak, that meant the team is \"doubling down on our tracing\" in an effort to get back on the field.\n\n\"It's a bummer. We're learning as we go,\" Mozeliak told reporters. \"What's the right amount of time to not assemble to try and prevent the spread? I don't think we know that answer perfectly.\"",

        "body": "Ebony Brown-Olaseinde with her husband, Segun Olaseinde, and their twins, Jurnee and Jordan, who were born premature during the pandemic. (John O'Boyle/Saint Barnabas Medical Center)\n\nOn a bright October day last fall, Ebony Brown-Olaseinde and her husband, Segun Olaseinde, found out that their longtime dream had finally been realized: They were going to be parents. After three years spent trying to conceive, they had succeeded through in vitro fertilization -- and they soon learned that their twins, a boy and a girl, were due in June 2020.\n\nBy the beginning of March, Ebony, 40, an accountant in Newark, was feeling grateful that her high-risk pregnancy had progressed so easily. Segun, 43, an operations manager for UPS, couldn't wait to be a father. Ebony's doctors told the couple that she'd reached an important milestone: At 24 weeks pregnant, their twins were viable, more likely to survive if they arrived early.\n\nThat was one week before the World Health Organization formally declared the coronavirus pandemic. Ten days after that, Ebony suddenly began feeling short of breath.\n\nThe following excerpts from interviews with Ebony, her family and members of the medical team that cared for her at Saint Barnabas Medical Center in Livingston, N.J., have been edited for length and clarity.\n\nEbony Brown-Olaseinde: At first, we were told that if you were sick, then you needed to wear a mask, but if you didn't have a cough or a fever, you were fine. I wasn't around anybody who seemed to have covid. But I did continue to go to work in March.\n\nFariborz Rezai, director of critical care and medical/surgical intensive care: The first ICU covid patient we had was March 13; I remember because I was on call that weekend. And then they just kept coming.\n\nBrown-Olaseinde: Now that I look back and I know all of the symptoms, I probably was sick earlier than I knew. I never had a fever, I never had a cough, but I did have a runny nose that I attributed to it being cold in my office. I remember, on March 22, I was folding clothes and felt a little winded. I remember needing to sit down. But I figured, \"I'm seven months pregnant with twins.\" I went to work the next day, and had a small meeting -- we social distanced -- and I remember not being able to breathe well in that meeting. By 10 o'clock I remember going to my office and emailing my supervisor to say, \"I'm not feeling well, I'm going to go to the hospital, I'll see you guys tomorrow.\" My OB/GYN advised me to go to Saint Barnabas, and when I got to the parking lot I called my husband and let him know that I was going to go to the hospital to see what the problem was. They got me in, they gave me IV fluids, and I texted my husband at 5 p.m. to say, \"I'm feeling better, I'll be home by 6 o'clock.\" But then the nurse came back and said that test results showed I didn't have the flu, and they wanted to do X-rays on my lungs. When we got those results back, the nurse said it didn't look good.\n\nAngela Wimmer, OB/GYN: Ebony never thought she was covid-positive when she came to the hospital. She told me she just didn't feel great. She was shocked that she had it.\n\nBrown-Olaseinde: They put me on oxygen, and two days later, the test came back confirming that I did have covid. I wasn't able to maintain the oxygen level that they needed me to maintain for the twins. They'd come in and check the twins every couple of hours. They wanted to put me on the CPAP machine, and the CPAP machine is really scary. When they put that on, I felt like I couldn't breathe. The doctor said, \"Listen, you're going to go and get intubated,\" and I remember saying to him, \"Please, just don't take the babies out. Please, let them mature more.\"\n\nSegun Olaseinde, Ebony's husband: I took time off work and self-quarantined, because we needed to see if I had covid. I was staying home, waiting for calls from the hospital. I was praying a lot, calling family members, our family members were praying. When she called and said they were going to put her on the ventilator, she was more calm than I was. I started crying.\n\nBrown-Olaseinde: I called my husband, I gave him the phone numbers of people to reach at the hospital if something happened. I remember telling my husband, \"If I don't make it, just make sure you take care of the babies.\" And then that's all I remember.\n\nWimmer: She tried to hold off on being intubated because she just wanted the best for her babies. That's what she kept saying: \"Just let them make it.\"\n\nRichard C. Miller, chairman of obstetrics and gynecology: On March 31, at 28 weeks and one day into her pregnancy, Ebony was having more respiratory difficulties than we thought we'd be able to amend. Her blood pressure began to become very erratic, and very low.\n\nOlaseinde: It got to the point where I was so on edge I couldn't really take phone calls anymore, so I called my sister. She's a doctor, so any communications from the hospital went through her and she would call me, because I wasn't in a state of mind to process medical terms.\n\nYetunde Daniel, Olaseinde's sister: As a physician, knowing what I know, I was scared and worried for Ebony. This was my sister-in-law, who I love. But I had to be positive and not share too many details that would only worry my brother more. The worst-case scenario would play in his head, and he was at home alone by himself. We couldn't even be there for him.\n\nRezai: I vividly remember, it was around noon that day, and I walked by her room and the nurse said, \"Hey, Dr. Rezai, she's getting worse.\" Her blood pressure was going down, and she became more and more hypoxic, meaning her oxygen was dropping. We had no more room to give her any more oxygen. At that point, Dr. Miller and I spoke about what to do.\n\nMiller: There are some cases of women who have severe respiratory failure who do respond and turn a corner, but it's always a 50/50 proposition. The options at that point would have been to wait to see if Ebony succumbed to her disease, and then do a postmortem Caesarean section. Those are always much more difficult. The babies' condition would be much more dicey.\n\nRezai: That's when we made the call to get everyone into the room for an emergency C-section.\n\nMiller: We'd already sounded the alarm that we might be moving Ebony from the intensive care unit over to the operating room, but in fact she deteriorated so rapidly and profoundly that there wasn't time to move her. The OR brought over all the equipment; they essentially mobilized an operating room and set it up for us in the ICU.\n\nRezai: Suddenly everybody is there. We're talking 20-plus people. And this is not the largest room; it's actually very small.\n\nMiller: The delivery itself was probably the most risky type of procedure for the individuals who were in the room to do the C-section. First of all, it was done in intensive care, not in our regular operating room; and second of all, Ebony was covid-positive and considered to be highly infectious.\n\nWimmer: That was the craziest day of my career. I've been practicing for about 22 years, and I've done urgent, emergency C-sections, but never in an ICU setting. All morning, we were checking in on Ebony, we're watching her oxygen and her blood pressure drop as they're increasing her pressure support, and I thought, \"Oh my God, she is not going to survive.\" And then my next thought was, \"Oh my God, we have to get these babies out.\" The faster we could get in and the faster we could get out was the best for those babies and for Ebony. We needed her to turn that corner.\n\nBrianna Carlotti, critical care nurse: Ebony was sedated and in and out of consciousness. Her eyes would open but then immediately close. I was at the head of the bed with her the whole time. I was holding her hand, and telling her, \"We're going to deliver your babies, they're going to be okay. We need you to hang on. You're going to be better.\" She was my priority.\n\nKwanchai Chan, neonatologist: We had two teams in the room, and respiratory therapists. Twin A, Jurnee, was 2 pounds, 0.6 ounces. Twin B, Jordan, was 2 pounds, 5 ounces. They were premature, and they needed to be intubated, but they did well. They were stable.\n\nCarlotti: There was a lot of hustle and bustle in the room. And then it was over, and everyone got out, and it was just me and Ebony. I was getting her cleaned up and telling her she did such a good job. That is a day I will never forget.\n\nOlaseinde: The doctors called my sister, and she called me. They told her there was the possibility that they were going to take the babies out. And then, as she was telling me this, they called her back and said the babies were out already. I was freaking out, because that was so early. But I talked to family members who knew people who had preemie babies, and they were telling me the twins were going to be okay.\n\nRezai: As soon as the OR team and the NICU team left, in the next hour or two, Ebony's pressure requirements -- the amount of medication required to keep up her blood pressure -- started improving. Her oxygen requirements started improving. By the next day, she was a new person. And about 48 hours after the C-section, we had her off the ventilator. It was pretty astonishing. I've been a critical care physician for over 13 years, and I've never seen anything like that. Especially with covid patients, you know when a patient is going to survive or not, and Ebony was not looking like she was going to survive. The decision to do the C-section really saved her life.\n\nDaniel: What they did was astounding. If they'd waited another 30 minutes, what could have happened? If they had wasted any time at all, this would be a different story. Especially as an African American woman, that she had such a good outcome in a case like this -- that's a miracle.\n\nBrown-Olaseinde: When I woke up on April 3, I thought I'd only been there for a week, but I'd already been there for two weeks.\n\nCarlotti: She was out of it in the beginning, and it was hard to explain to her: \"You came in with these babies, and you don't remember having them, but they're here and they're doing well.\" I'd tell her, and she'd touch her stomach, and I'd say, \"They're safe, they're doing well.\" Then she'd go to sleep and wake up confused again.\n\nBrown-Olaseinde: My husband told me that the babies were born. The doctors had told me, but I wasn't very responsive yet, and I didn't remember that. My husband and sister-in-law were able to send a little picture of the twins, and I'd look at the picture every day. I remember asking the nurse, \"Can I go home?\" Because I thought as soon as I go home, I can see the twins.\n\nChan: Ebony had to have two negative covid tests to come to the NICU, and it took her about a month to achieve that. But her husband never tested positive, so we allowed him to come in.\n\nOlaseinde: The first time I saw the babies, all I remember is how small they were.\n\nBrown-Olaseinde: I came home on April 9. I still had to be isolated from my husband because I was testing positive. It was difficult. I was just coming back from being on a ventilator, I still couldn't really breathe, my voice was gone, I had to stay in our bedroom. I'm thankful that my husband was able to have the month off because he was able to take care of me every day, and he was still able to go see the twins every day. He would FaceTime from the NICU, he'd set the phone on the incubator, and I could look at them, and read to them, talk to them.\n\nChan: When Ebony finally could come to see the babies, we tried to make it up to her. We had a banner, we had a little celebration for her. She'd waited so long.\n\nBrown-Olaseinde: The nurses were so lovely. They actually had made a sign that said, \"Welcome, Mommy, we miss you.\" It became emotional. When I got there, I was like, \"Oh, my\" -- it didn't translate over the phone just how small they were. As a mother I didn't care, that first day I was just holding them. But it was intimidating, because they were so fragile.\n\nChan: Jurnee left after 53 days, and that was emotional for Ebony because I think both parents preferred to bring home both babies together, but unfortunately for Jordan, he still needed some oxygen. So we kept Jordan approximately another week. He went home on June 1.\n\nWimmer: That was a time when the ICU was really spiraling. Patients weren't doing well. And so for Ebony to pull off a miracle, it was incredible for all of us. We were so elated for the family.\n\nBrown-Olaseinde: The team saved our lives. They really did. I'm happy they made that decision to take the babies out, even though I was so adamant about letting them grow more inside.\n\nMiller: The fact that she was unconscious when she delivered her babies, only to wake up to know that they had been delivered -- those are substantial, impactful events for her. She'll never be able to fill in all the gaps. But I'm sure she'll never forget the beginning and the end of the journey here.\n\nBrown-Olaseinde: I still am short of breath, so that's a process. I do have some pain sometimes in my side. I have a follow-up appointment with a cardiologist in a couple of months. I received hydroxychloroquine, and every day I still think about that. I watch the news, and I see the side effects, and I don't know what the consequences are going to be from taking that medicine.\n\nRezai: Some patients do suffer post-traumatic stress. So that's something you have to be attuned to. I'm sure she's very happy and ecstatic that she survived, that her babies are healthy. I'm not a psychiatrist, and everyone is different, but we do recognize that PTSD among ICU survivors is very real.\n\nBrown-Olaseinde: The twins are beautiful. They make us laugh so much, they make us smile. They're growing well, they're doing tummy time well, they're focusing well. As the doctor said, because they were preemies, they'll be a little bit delayed, but they're on point for preemies. And I'm so happy they made it. I'm just so happy they made it.\n\nPhoto editing by Monique Woo. Design by Audrey Valbuena.

    "A vaccine, or millions of deaths: How America can build herd immunity to the coronavirus": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "An immune Bob acts as a wall between Alice and Charlotte, and Charlotte never gets sick. The disease is unable to spread.\n\nThis is the essence of what disease experts call \"herd immunity.\" Although Charlotte was susceptible to the disease, she was protected by someone else in her community -- her herd -- who was immune.\n\nIn communities larger than Alice, Bob and Charlotte's, a spreading disease will slow and eventually stop once a certain share of the population becomes immune. Epidemiologists call that percentage the \"herd immunity threshold.\"\n\nTo see herd immunity in action, we can watch as a fake disease -- we will call it simulitis -- spreads through three communities, each of 200 people. In the first community, no one will be immune to simulitis. In another, 40 percent of the people will be immune. And in the third, 80 percent will be immune.\n\nAs you watch the simulations below, notice how in the 40-percent community, simulitis manages to infect many healthy people. Only once the share of immune people crosses a certain threshold -- for simulitis it is about 80 percent -- are most of the healthy people protected from the sick people.\n\nEach time you restart the simulation, the immune people scatter randomly, opening new paths for the disease to spread while closing others. Try as it might, simulitis rarely spreads far in the community on the right.\n\nThe herd immunity threshold of real diseases varies. Measles, an especially contagious disease, only slows down after about 95 percent of people become immune. Scientists are still determining the herd immunity threshold of SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus that produces the deadly disease covid-19. Estimates range from about 40 percent to about 80 percent.\n\nAs the coronavirus continues to spread across the United States, some have suggested that rather than try to disrupt it, it would be better to let it run its course. In time, they argue, there will be so many immune people that the virus will stop spreading on its own.\n\nThe United Kingdom and Sweden pursued such a strategy early on but abandoned it when officials saw it would not work. More recently, television host Laura Ingraham tweeted that pursuing herd immunity was the \"only practical way forward.\"\n\nYet even if coronavirus antibodies prevent repeat infections -- an assumption still being studied and debated -- evidence suggests the United States remains far from achieving herd immunity. To get there, Americans would probably have to endure a scale of death and loss many times greater than they already have.\n\nOne way to measure the gap between herd immunity and reality is through seroprevalence surveys, in which researchers draw blood from thousands of people and check to see how many of them have coronavirus antibodies. Because people infected with the coronavirus often fail to show symptoms, these surveys can reveal more people with antibodies than case numbers alone would suggest.\n\nIn late July, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention published the results of coronavirus seroprevalence surveys at 10 sites across the country. Compare those results to a 60 percent herd immunity threshold, the midrange of current estimates.\n\nNew York City, by far the closest to achieving herd immunity, was somewhere between one-half and one-third of the way there. This, in a city where more than 23,000 people have already died of covid-19 and at least 230,000 people have tested positive for the coronavirus.\n\nThe CDC data is based on blood tests conducted months ago, so it is likely that the country has moved closer to reaching the herd immunity threshold. To measure how much closer, a team of nine scientists from Harvard and Yale universities built a statistical model that estimates the share of people in each state who have had a coronavirus infection.\n\nSeroprevalence in the United States, they estimate, stands at about 9 percent. Even in New Jersey, the state whose population has the highest share of antibodies, seroprevalence is estimated to be only about 20 percent.\n\n\"There's just way too little seroprevalence in all of these states to come anywhere close to achieving herd immunity,\" said Marcus Russi, a Yale epidemiologist who helped build the model.\n\nEven the higher range of the estimates, which suggest seroprevalence in the United States could be as high as 25 percent, remain far from the herd immunity threshold.\n\n[Tracking the spread of coronavirus across the U.S.]\n\nTo build herd immunity without the sickness and death of uncontrolled spread, pharmaceutical companies are racing to develop a coronavirus vaccine.\n\nMaking and distributing a safe and effective vaccine is part of the challenge. The other part is convincing people to take it, said Jason Schwartz, a vaccine expert at the Yale School of Public Health.\n\n\"There's lots of consensus about the kinds of best practices that help disseminate evidence to help the public do well in a health crisis,\" Schwartz said. \"At the top of the list is to have very, very clear messaging that is amplified regularly, repeatedly, isn't complicated or undermined or conflicted or muddled.\"\n\nThroughout the pandemic, Schwartz added, \"there's been such a cacophony of different messages, and that understandably has caused great confusion and ultimately great harm to the public. We can't repeat that with respect to a vaccine.\"\n\nThe alternative to waiting for a vaccine -- letting the virus run rampant through a population unfortified by herd immunity -- is far worse.\n\nTo estimate how much worse, just three numbers are needed: the total population, the coronavirus's herd immunity threshold and its fatality rate -- the percentage of infected people who die.\n\nMultiplying those three numbers together reveals roughly how many people would need to die for the population to develop herd immunity. You can do the grim calculation yourself.\n\nMany thousands of additional infections and deaths would be expected even after herd immunity is reached.\n\n\"The epidemic doesn't stop on a dime when you hit herd immunity,\" said Carl Bergstrom, a biologist at the University of Washington who uses computer simulations to model populations' vulnerability to disease.\n\n\"The herd immunity point is when you're at the peak of the epidemic. So you've come up the curve,\" Bergstrom added. \"But you still got to go all the way back down.\"",

    "AP Explains: How India's fast-growing cases topped 3 million": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "How the virus is spreading in the world's second most-populous country:\n\nIndia's first cases were reported in the southern state of Kerala in late January. They were three university students who had been studying in the disease epicenter of Wuhan, China. But community transmission took hold in cities thousands of miles (kilometers) to the north, with the financial center of Mumbai reporting huge spikes in late spring followed by New Delhi, the capital, in early summer.\n\nThe rise in new infections has since leveled off in India's two largest cities, with serological surveys showing widespread prevalence among populations.\n\nIn New Delhi, a recent government study of 15,000 volunteers showed 29% had antibodies for the coronavirus, although the city of 11 million has only 150,000 confirmed cases, suggesting many undetected infections.\n\nDr. Ullas Kolthur Seetharam, a biologist in Mumbai, conducted a survey across the city of 12.4 million in July that found more than half of the the people tested in slums had antibodies compared to 16% of those tested in organized residential neighborhoods.\n\nThe survey suggested that shared toilets, high population density and lack of physical distancing contributed to the spread.\n\n\"Any change in the demography will change the prevalence of the virus,\" Seetharam said.\n\nIndia's meager health resources are poorly divided across the country. Government data shows wide disparity in health indices, with India's poorest states comparable to sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nNearly 600 million Indians live in rural areas, and with the virus spreading fast across India's vast hinterlands, health experts worry that hospitals could be overwhelmed, with less testing making it all the more difficult for the authorities to track and contain the disease.\n\n\"India's rural areas have very limited health infrastructure,\" said epidemiologist Jayaprakash Muliyil. \"I fear we might soon witness a spurt in cases there.\"\n\nIn Bihar, nearly 90% of the population lives in villages. Every year, the state struggles to deal with dengue outbreaks and other seasonal diseases, and it has only one hospital bed and just under four doctors per 10,000 people, according to official data.\n\nBihar, which is testing 10,000 samples per day, has sought the federal government's help to test 10 times that number.\n\nBut that's only one part of the problem. Many people are hiding their symptoms and don't opt for tests, complicating the state's effort to curb the spread of the virus, officials say.\n\nNationwide, India is testing more than 900,000 samples per day, exceeding the World Health Organization's benchmark of 140 tests per 1 million people. But it's not clear how many are antigen tests, which are faster but less accurate compared to RT-PCR, the gold standard for the coronavirus.\n\nUttar Pradesh, with 200 million people India's most populous state and also one of its poorest, is conducting the most tests, with an average of 110,000 daily.\n\nBut new hot spots continue to drive the surge in cases. Uttar Pradesh is now among the five worst-affected states in India, behind Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka.\n\nTelangana, home to India's tech hub of Hyderabad, has come under fire for insufficiently testing its 40 million people.\n\nIn Hyderabad, which is normally buzzing with activity, an ongoing fear of the coronavirus has kept parks, shopping areas and roads quiet.\n\nTelangana has reported about 79,000 total cases. But two prominent scientific bodies -- the Center for Cellular and Molecular Biology and Indian Institute of Chemical Technology -- have warned that an analysis of Hyderabad sewage suggests that the real rate of infection in the city alone could be six times higher than the state's reported total.\n\nAfter conducting the tests of sewage samples at 10 sewage treatment plants, the scientists reported that about 6.6% of Hyderabad's population of 10 million -- 660,000 people -- could be infected.\n\nIndia has the third-highest caseload in the world after the United States and Brazil. But with the rate of infection growing in recent weeks, experts fear India could soon surpass those countries.\n\nFor 18 consecutive days, India has reported the most new cases in the world. At the same time, the mortality rate has dropped to 1.87% -- far lower than in the other hardest-hit countries.\n\n\"I don't know what magic people think is going to happen,\" said Dr. Gagandeep Kang, an infectious diseases expert at the Christian Medical College at Vellore, in southern India.\n\nShe said that with India's population of nearly 1.4 billion and the way the virus is spreading through the country, \"what makes you think that you're not going to end up with the biggest numbers in the world?\"\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Sheikh Saaliq and Aniruddha Ghosal in New Delhi; Omer Farooq in Hyderabad, India; Indrajit Singh in Patna, India; and Biswajeet Banerjee in Lucknow, India, contributed to this report.\n\nCopyright 2020 The Associated Press.

        "body": "But the baby's father, Marco Mart\u00ednez, had died a month before from the novel coronavirus.\n\nMar\u00eda, who had an asymptomatic case of the virus, was giving birth to her first child, a daughter, at 24 in a special ward for mothers with COVID-19.\n\nPeru's National Perinatal and Maternal Institute has dedicated about half its facilities to care for infected pregnant women. Between April and the start of August, more than 2,000 infected patients gave birth there, with 120 newborns testing positive.\n\nOne in four people in Peru's capital of 10 million people could be infected with the coronavirus, according to a study published by health authorities in July, with more than 483,000 confirmed infected across the country of 32 million and more than 21,000 dead.\n\nDespite wearing personal protective equipment and taking other measures to avoid infection, 400 of the 2,000 workers in the institute have also been infected, said its director, Enrique Guevara.\n\nThe institute has barred partners or other relatives from attending births, and pregnant women are moved through the hospital in wheeled beds protected by transparent covers to block the virus from spreading.\n\nMart\u00ednez returned to Peru in November after five years working in an electronics store in Chile.\n\nAlvarez became pregnant, and after the coronavirus hit Peru, both went to work for a friend sewing face masks.\n\nMart\u00ednez became ill and died in June.

    "Analysis | The Health 202: British schools reopened with little covid-19 spread, new data show": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "The United Kingdom's new report, released yesterday, is the most comprehensive look yet at what might happen when hundreds of thousands of kids return to classrooms amid the coronavirus pandemic. The information could prove valuable and timely for schools in the United States, caught in the midst of a heated and politicized debate over the best approach for fall learning.\n\n\"I was surprised by how low the numbers were, to be honest,\" said Emily Oster, a professor of economics at Brown University, who analyzed the report. \"I thought they would be higher.\"\n\nThe data, collected by the country's public health agency, comes from reports from nurseries, preschools, elementary schools and secondary schools that reopened for a \"mini\" summer term in June after the country's spring shutdowns.\n\nAn average of 843,430 students and 519,590 staff members were at school facilities each day, according to the report. During the entire month, schools reported 70 cases among students -- but 30 of those students didn't seem to have acquired the virus at school, and none of the children were hospitalized for treatment of covid-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus.\n\nOut of 128 staff cases, one of the staffers was hospitalized and required intensive care. Thirty-seven of those cases weren't linked to a school, including a single case resulting in the death of a secondary school teacher who had acquired the virus from a household member.\n\nOverall, secondary schools appeared to experience wider transmission of the virus and larger outbreaks than primary schools or preschools -- a finding consistent with studies indicating older children are more likely to spread the virus than younger ones.\n\n\"The re-opening of schools was associated with very few covid-19 outbreaks after easing of national lockdown in England,\" wrote experts from Public Health England, the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and St. George's University of London.\n\n\"SARS-CoV-2 infection and outbreaks were more likely to involve staff members, emphasizing a need to improve education and infection control measures for this group both within and outside the educational setting,\" they wrote.\n\nChildren in England are preparing to return to school next week.\n\nWhile the governments in Scotland and Northern Ireland are requiring mask-wearing in schools, England's deputy chief medical officer said yesterday the evidence is \"not strong\" in favor of secondary school students wearing masks.\n\nBut Prime Minister Boris Johnson left open the possibility of changing the guidance dependent on medical advice, saying he was \"really pleased\" by the work being done to prepare schools for reopening.\"\n\nThat's particularly true in urban areas, and in politically blue states. The whole issue has been caught up in a heated and emotional public debate, further inflamed by President Trump's repeated insistence that schools must reopen.\n\nTeachers unions are threatening to strike in some school districts that are planning a return to the classroom. Yet districts insisting on a virtual approach have prompted concerns about the disastrous consequences for kids -- especially those who are disadvantaged -- if they're kept away from school for months on end.\n\nThere's also a frustration that many colleges and universities are opening up as elementary schools keep their doors closed.\n\nStudies have suggested teenagers spread the virus more easily than younger kids. And the consequences of virtual learning are clearly harsher for preschoolers and elementary-age children.\n\nMSNBC's Chris Hayes:\n\nThe country had largely gotten its outbreak under control by June and was enforcing social distancing and mask-wearing. There was a \"strong correlation\" between coronavirus outbreaks and regional incidence of the virus, the report says.\n\n\"I think we're increasingly getting a sense of when schools are opening, where prevalence is relatively under control, we're not seeing a lot of cases,\" Oster said.\n\nUnder this philosophy, you might expect more virtual school in high-transmission areas and more in-person school in low-transmission areas.\n\nSchool districts in northeastern states -- including New York, New Jersey and Massachusetts -- are going all-virtual, even though cases and deaths are well below the levels seen in April and May.\n\n\"I feel like in some ways the choice about reopening appears to be driven entirely by politics and very little by science,\" Oster told me.\n\nMany districts in Southern states have opened their doors but are already walking back in-person learning amid positive tests and outbreaks. These include K-12 schools in Georgia, Mississippi and Tennessee -- all states where daily new cases are still elevated well above levels in the spring.\n\n\"While a growing number of schools have backed off reopening, opting instead for online classes, others are hoping a host of new rules and adaptations can keep the coronavirus at bay,\" Hannah Knowles writes of colleges and universities.\n\n\"They are requiring masks, mandating testing and threatening students and campus groups with penalties for partying,\" she writes. \"Ohio State University alone said this week that it has suspended 228 students over virus-related violations.\"\n\nOn Night 2 of the RNC, Melania Trump praised the administration's efforts to combat the opioid crisis.\n\n\"Our administration has also devoted historical resources and produced lifesaving results by raising awareness around opioid addiction and drug abuse, especially for children,\" the first lady said.\n\nThe opioid epidemic, which did not receive much attention during last week's Democratic National Convention, got significant play on the second day of the Republican convention.\n\nRyan Holets, a police officer from New Mexico who was invited to speak at the convention, described his decision to adopt a baby from a homeless woman who was using opioids and his subsequent friendship with the mother.\n\nHolets praised the president's leadership in fighting the opioid crisis, pointing out that drug overdose deaths decreased in 2018 for the first time in 30 years. Recent data, however, does not look as optimistic. Drug overdoses may be increasing during the pandemic, possibly fueled by unemployment and less access to mental health and addiction resources.\n\nRepublicans also sought to rally anti-abortion voters.\n\nActivist Abby Johnson told the story of how she went from directing a Planned Parenthood clinic to becoming a leading voice against abortion. She praised Trump, saying that he \"has done more for the unborn than any other president.\"\n\nJohnson cited Trump's appointment of abortion-opposing judges and new rules that protect health care workers who decline to provide services for religious reasons.\n\nSusan B. Anthony List, a leading anti-abortion group:\n\nShe also praised the president's 2017 ban on federal funding for global health groups that promote or provide referrals for abortions. While a version of this rule has been in place under every Republican president since Ronald Reagan, the Trump administration expanded it to include global HIV funding, a decision that researchers have found led to disruptions in care in some places.\n\nIn her speech, Johnson also accused Margaret Sanger, the founder of Planned Parenthood, of being a \"racist\" and eugenicist. While Sanger was a feminist icon for many, she made appeals to eugenics in her push for birth control.\n\nPlanned Parenthood of Greater New York announced last month it was removing Sanger's name from its Manhattan health clinic.\n\nJohnson changed her views on abortion upon witnessing what an ultrasound-guided abortion. Details of the story - the inspiration for the 2019 film Unplanned - have been called into question by investigative reporters at the Texas Observer and Texas Monthly. Johnson has also courted controversy in the last few days for a video in which she claims that police are justified in racial profiling.\n\nWhile previous versions of the testing guidelines called for testing anyone who had close contact with an infected individual, the newest iteration released on Monday said that those individuals \"do not necessarily need a test.\" The guidelines make exceptions if testing is recommended by a health provider or by local officials, or if the person is high risk.\n\n\"The change is alarming experts who point out that a large share of transmissions occur before individuals develop symptoms,\" The Post's Antonia Farzan writes. \"Some individuals infected with the coronavirus never exhibit symptoms, but can still transmit the virus to others, too.\"\n\nThe CDC's revision comes as health experts push for more frequent and widespread testing.\n\nGlobal infectious-disease expert Krutika Kuppali:\n\nLeana Wen, an emergency physician and visiting professor at George Washington University's Milken Institute School of Public Health:\n\nA spokesperson from the Health and Human Services Department told the New York Times that the change reflected the best available evidence and was not due to any shortage in testing supplies.\n\nThe air quality in California is lower than that of New Delhi, an Indian megacity known to have high levels of pollution, and it's affecting people \"already at a high risk of pulmonary disease because of the COVID-19 pandemic,\" USA Today's Jorge L. Ortiz reports.\n\nExperts say that fine particulate pollution (PM2.5) spread by the fires can exacerbate chronic heart and lung disease. Declines in air quality have been seen across the Western United States and as far as the Midwest.\n\nSome scientists have an additional worry: Poor air quality could potentially make people more sensitive to the coronavirus.\n\nAir pollution is \"going to weaken the whole system,\" said John Watson, an expert on air quality at the Desert Research Institute in Reno, Nev. \"You're going to be more susceptible to any other disease just because your system is already overtaxed.\"\n\nThe National Weather Service has been sending out regular warnings showing the spread of the pollution:\n\n\"City and state leaders expressed fears Tuesday that the Trump administration may cease reimbursing some of their purchases of masks, gloves and other personal protective equipment, a move they said could tear new holes in their budgets while threatening public health,\" Tony Romm and Erica Werner report.\n\nThe Federal Emergency Management Agency, which is charged with disaster relief, has indicated that it may change its criteria for providing funds to cover coronavirus costs, even as local officials say they need more testing supplies and masks as schools and workplaces reopen. While the agency has not finalized its plans, the uncertainty has prompted a backlash from state and city officials.\n\nA letter from organizations representing state, city and county governments, sent to FEMA head Peter Gaynor on Tuesday, cited \"a troubling pattern of shifting costs and responsibilities onto states and localities when they can least afford it.\"\n\nThe letter also questions whether the agency is facing a budget strain because of a Trump program that directs money from the disaster relief funds to boost unemployment checks. The debate also comes as hurricane season kicks off in the United States and threatens to further stretch the agency's resources.\n\nEarly voting opened this week in the election, which pits liberal Holyoke Mayor Alex Morse against incumbent U.S. Rep. Richard E. Neal, the influential head of the House Ways and Means Committee.\n\nMorse, who supports Medicare-for-all, has attacked Neal for receiving money from health-care industry lobbyists and has accused his opponent of scuttling a bipartisan bill aimed at ending surprise medical billing, the practice in which patients are hit with exorbitant medical bills when unknowingly referred to an out-of-network doctor.\n\nThe latter allegation is supported by a 2019 BuzzFeed News investigation that found Neal tanked the momentum for the surprise-billing legislation by introducing a counterproposal at the last minute.\n\nNeal for his part claims that he has a plan to end surprise billing that will protect doctors and hospitals. He has also touted his work in passing the Cares Act.\n\nIf Morse wins, Neal will be replaced at the head of the Ways and Means Committee by the more left-leaning Rep. Lloyd Doggett (D-Tex.). The chair of the committee, which oversees the government budget, plays a key role in legislative health policy.\n\nPolitico health reporter Susannah Luthi on the race:\n\n\"Teva, the world's largest generic-drug maker by market value, is the most high-profile company to be charged in the Justice Department's probe into allegations that companies conspired with one another to prop up the prices of certain widely used medications,\" Bloomberg News's David McLaughlin reports. \"Nine of every 10 prescription drugs dispensed in the U.S. are generics.\"\n\nThe Justice Department charged that the U.S. unit of the Israeli-based company colluded with competitors to increase the prices of drugs used to treat cholesterol, seizures, hypertension, blood clots, brain cancer, arthritis and other conditions.\n\nFive other companies have settled charges with the Justice Department and agreed to pay $426 million in criminal penalties, while a sixth was charged in June, David reports. Teva was charged after the company refused to agree to a settlement that would require it to admit wrongdoing, a course that could potentially open it to civil litigation.\n\n\"Today's charge reaffirms that no company is too big to be prosecuted for its role in conspiracies that led to substantially higher prices for generic drugs relied on by millions of Americans,\" Makam Delrahim, the assistant attorney general for the department's antitrust division, said in a statement.",

    "Analysis | The Health 202: For Joe Biden, it's all about fixing the coronavirus pandemic": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "Biden briefly mentioned his plan for expanding health insurance, in an acceptance speech last night portraying the country as \"cloaked in darkness\" under President Trump and urging people to choose \"a path of hope and light.\"\n\n\"...My economic plan is all about jobs, dignity, respect, and community,\" the Democratic presidential nominee said, speaking from a ballroom to a mostly-empty room. \"Together, we can, and we will, rebuild our economy. And when we do, we'll not only build it back, we'll build it back better.\"\n\n\"With modern roads, bridges, highways, broadband, ports and airports as a new foundation for economic growth,\" Biden said. \"With pipes that transport clean water to every community. With 5 million new manufacturing and technology jobs so the future is made in America. With a health care system that lowers premiums, deductibles, and drug prices by building on the Affordable Care Act he's trying to rip away.\"\n\nPolitical speeches are often rife with hyperbole, as candidates try to paint their opponents in the worst possible light. However in the case of the coronavirus pandemic - which has taken nearly 180,000 American lives and stymied the economy for months - Biden's portrayal of the dire situation is hard to dispute.\n\n\"Our current president has failed in his most basic duty to the nation: He's failed to protect us,\" Biden said, hitting President Trump hard for his handling of the pandemic. \"He's failed to protect America. And my fellow Americans, that is unforgivable.\"\n\nBiden added: \"This president, if he's reelected, you know what will happen. Cases and deaths will remain far too high. More mom and pop businesses will close their doors -- and this time for good. Working families will struggle to get by.\"\n\nMuch of this had to the do with the nature of the convention: mostly virtual, with no opportunities for any delegates to cause disruptions on the convention floor or boo speakers. It was a tightly controlled event, with little divergence from the party line and no opportunity for reporters to catch delegates and politicians off-script.\n\nThe platform does hint at the recent public divisions on health care between moderates such as Biden and progressives such as Sens. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Kamala Harris (D-Calif.), now Biden's running mate.\n\nIt mostly reflects Biden's call for an incremental approach that preserves a broad role for private, employer-based coverage. It calls for a government health plan to be added to the Affordable Care Act's insurance marketplaces and expanding its subsidies for buying private coverage.\n\nIt clarifies that the public option should be run directly by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, instead of managed by a private insurer. It calls for lowering the Medicare eligibility age to 60 from 65. And it expresses support for those within the party who want a single-payer system.\n\n\"We are proud our party welcomes advocates who want to build on and strengthen the Affordable Care Act and those who support a Medicare for All approach; all are critical to ensuring that health care is a human right,\" the platform says.\n\nDivisions peeked through when a few progressive House members voted against the Democratic platform for excluding Medicare-for-all, but the platform otherwise received little scrutiny.\n\nAnd there was nothing but congeniality and praise for Biden, when seven of his former primary opponents joined a video chat to reminisce about the long primary battle.\n\nIn his speech to the convention Monday night, Sanders acknowledged his differences with Biden over health care but moved quickly past them.\n\n\"While Joe and I disagree on the best path to get to universal coverage, he has a plan that will greatly expand health care and cut the cost of prescription drugs,\" Sanders said. \"Further, he will lower the eligibility age of Medicare from 65 to 60.\"\n\nThis high-profile lawsuit was a top talking point for Democrats before the coronavirus pandemic sucked all the air out of the room.\n\nThe Supreme Court announced this week it will hear the case on Nov. 10, but the news got little attention, even though Democrats spent much of the 2018 election slamming the president for opposing the ACA's protections for patients with preexisting conditions.\n\nIn the case, which is supported by the Trump administration, Republican attorneys general say the Affordable Care Act is no longer constitutional because Congress reduced the tax penalty for not buying health insurance to zero. The insurance mandate was the basis upon which the court upheld the ACA in 2012.\n\nSen. Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.) gave a brief nod to the issue in her address last night.\n\n\"When I was 9 years old, I got sick. Really sick,\" Baldwin said. \"I got better. But the insurance companies didn't. They refused to cover me at any cost -- because I was marked 'child with a preexisting condition. We all have stories like this. Stories about a time when the system was rigged against us. When we were counted out, left out, pushed out.\"\n\nGov. Gretchen Whitmer (D) announced the settlement on Thursday. \"What happened in Flint should have never happened,\" the governor said.\n\n\"The settlement resolves a lengthy legal battle that began under her Republican predecessor, Rick Snyder, who was among the many public officials accused of ignoring or even denying the crisis in the poor, largely minority city of 95,000,\" Kayla Ruble reports.\n\nThe problems started when Flint switched its water source from Lake Huron to the Flint River, but officials failed to add corrosion controls and lead leached from the city's old pipes.\n\n\"Residents started complaining of discolored and foul-smelling water and then worse -- skin rashes after bathing -- but their concerns were largely ignored,\" Ruble writes. \"Among some children tested in 2015 at a local hospital, the percentage with lead poisoning doubled after the switch in water sources. In some neighborhoods, it tripled.\"\n\nEighty percent of the money will go to children under 18 at the time of exposure, and more than half of that amount to children under the age of 6, who are at greatest risk from long-term effects. The remaining money will go to plaintiffs who sued over other issues, such as property damage or lost revenue.\n\n\"The beef restaurant in the city of Changsha placed two large scales at its entrance this week. It then asked diners to enter their measurements into an app that would then suggest menu items accordingly,\" the BBC reports. \"Signs reading 'be thrifty and diligent, promote empty plates' and 'operation empty plate' were pinned up\" in the restaurant, the BBC reports.\n\nThe policy came after Chinese President Xi Jinping announced a campaign to decrease food waste.\n\nAfter the policy caused an uproar on social media, the restaurant posted an apology and said it was trying to help diners throw less food away.\n\n\"Our original intentions were to advocate stopping waste and ordering food in a healthy way. We never forced customers to weigh themselves,\" it said.\n\nThe restaurant was not the only one to respond to the national campaign. After the president announced the anti-food waste initiative, a Wuhan catering group suggested limiting the number of plates per dinner group, and Chinese state TV criticized social media celebrities who film themselves eating large amounts of food, the BBC reports.\n\nAfter a rocky rollout of a separate federal database earlier this summer, the head of the White House coronavirus response said the CDC is building -- and will eventually run -- a new data system for hospital coronavirus data.\n\nBirx's comments, made during a visit to the Arkansas Governor's Mansion on Monday, suggest a reversal for the administration, which told hospitals in July that they should no longer send data to the CDC, NPR's Pien Huang reports.\n\nInstead, hospitals and state public health agencies were required to send data directly to a new database managed by the Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees the CDC. The decision was widely criticized for sidestepping the CDC, placing too many technical requirements on overburdened hospitals, and leading to erratic and inconsistent data.\n\n\"The announcement sparked hope among some public health advocates that the current, controversial system of reporting hospital data around COVID-19 would soon be canceled and that data collection would be restored to the CDC,\" Pien writes.\n\n\"Some public health experts warned the shift could result in unreliable coronavirus tests on the market, potentially worsening the testing crisis that has dogged the United States if more people get erroneous results,\" Laurie McGinley and Yasmeen Abutaleb report.\n\nThese experts say the testing problems are primarily due to lack of supplies and chemical reagents, rather than bureaucratic requirements.\n\n\"But supporters cheered the change as long overdue, saying it could help get new and more innovative tests to market more quickly. They said that the FDA review process sharply slowed testing at the beginning of the pandemic and that the new policy could ensure such bottlenecks don't recur,\" Laurie and Yasmeen write.\n\nThe decision, which affects laboratories regulated under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments program, sparked intense disagreement between HHS Secretary Alex Azar and FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn.\n\nSome FDA backers also see it as a way to pin blame for early testing mistakes on the FDA. The agency relied on a faulty test developed by the CDC but was criticized for being slow to allow other tests on the market. During the early months of the pandemic, the FDA was also criticized for being slow to review coronavirus tests developed in laboratories, Laurie and Yasmeen write.\n\n\"The new inquiry is the work of Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Robert P. Casey Jr. (D-Pa.), who issued a battery of letters to CVS, Walgreens and other top providers on Thursday to determine whether their customers had experienced delays in recent weeks,\" Tony Romm writes. It comes as Democrats hammer the Trump administration for cuts to the U.S. Postal Service.\n\n\"Millions of Americans with diabetes, high blood pressure and heart disease, asthma, and other chronic conditions, illnesses or health care needs rely on the USPS for delivery of their prescription drugs and are at grave risks if President Trump's efforts to degrade mail service results in delays and disruptions,\" the senators wrote.\n\nThe senators say they have received thousands of messages expressing concerns about postal delays, and anecdotal reports about delayed medication are rampant in news reports and on social media. Many pharmacies, however, have reported that they are not experiencing any unusual disruptions of service.\n\n\"Our understanding of COVID-19 has accreted around the idea that it kills a few and is 'mild' for the rest. That caricature was sketched before the new coronavirus even had a name; instead of shifting in the light of fresh data, it calcified. It affected the questions scientists sought to ask, the stories journalists sought to tell, and the patients doctors sought to treat,\" the Atlantic's Ed Yong writes.\n\nBut some of these so-called mild patients report extreme fatigue, erratic heartbeat, memory loss, and other symptoms lasting for months, and these patients are largely not reported or tracked in the current system.\n\nIn response many patients with lasting symptoms set up their own networks, support groups and research projects, Ed reports.\n\nNew data and reporting suggests that the long-term effects are rampant. Ed cites an Italian study in which 87 percent of hospitalized patients had symptoms after two months and a German study that found three-quarters of patients had heart abnormalities after two or three months.\n\n\"These findings, though limited, are galling. They suggest that in the United States alone, which has more than 5 million confirmed COVID-19 cases, there are probably hundreds of thousands of long-haulers,\" Ed writes.\n\nThe CDC's website, however, does not mention long-term symptoms, and patients who report them frequently encounter disbelief from doctors.\n\nNisreen Alwan, a public health professor at the University of Southampton who has had covid-19 since March 20, told Ed that she thinks officials should stop referring to nonhospitalized cases as \"mild\" and should agree on a definition of recovery beyond getting released from the hospital and testing negative for the virus.\n\n\"We cannot fight what we do not measure,\" she told Ed. \"Death is not the only thing that counts. We must also count lives changed.\"",

    "Analysis | Understanding the Virus and Its Unanswered Questions": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "It's taken scientists time to understand that the novel coronavirus that emerged late last year in central China behaves differently than similar pathogens, producing missteps in the response. The list of known symptoms of Covid-19, the disease it causes, also has grown, complicating efforts to diagnose and treat it. And the virus has yet to give up all its mysteries, creating uncertainty about when the pandemic might end.\n\nUnlike the coronavirus responsible for the 2002-2003 outbreak in Asia of severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, this new one can spread via people who are infected but have yet to develop symptoms, or don't at all. Researchers at the University of Oxford estimated that a third to half of transmissions occur from such carriers. What's more, the new virus has a relatively long incubation period -- the time between infection and the appearance of symptoms -- enabling it to spread silently in a community before being detected. The interval is about five days compared with two days for the flu, which spreads the same way and is the most common cause of pandemics. The stealthy nature of the coronavirus wasn't well understood at first and contributed to the staggered and uneven quality of the response.",

        "body": "Big 12 Commissioner Bob Bowlsby said no decisions on the season has been made, but conceded the outlook has not improved.\n\n\"Are we in a better place today than two weeks, ago?\" he said. \"No, we're not.\"\n\nBowlsby cited \"growing evidence and the growing pool of data around myocarditis.\"\n\nMyocarditis is inflammation of the heart and it has been found in some COVID-19 patients. There is concern it could be a long-term complication of contracting the virus even in young, healthy people, a group that has usually avoided severe cardiovascular symptoms.\n\nAlso Sunday night, the Big Ten's university presidents and chancellors were having a previously unscheduled meeting, a person with knowledge of the meeting told The Associated Press. The person spoke on condition of anonymity because the meeting was not announced by the conference.\n\nThe final call on whether major college football will played this season rests in the hands of the university presidents who oversee the largest conferences.\n\nAll this activity comes a day after the Mid-American Conference became the first among 10 leagues that play at the highest tier of Division I college football to cancel fall sports because of concerns about keeping athletes from contracting and spreading COVID-19.\n\nThe MAC's decision came less than a month before the first games are scheduled to be played and raised questions if other conferences might follow.\n\nAlso on Saturday, the Big Ten slowed its ramp up to the season, announcing its teams would not be permitted to start full contact practices until further notice. The Big Ten season is scheduled to start Labor Day weekend.\n\nMeanwhile, college football players took to social media Sunday to push for the season to go on, led by Clemson quarterback Trevor Lawrence with a series of tweets.\n\n\"People are at just as much, if not more risk, if we don't play,\" Lawrence tweeted. \"Players will all be sent home to their own communities where social distancing is highly unlikely and medical care and expenses will be placed on the families if they were to contract covid19.\"\n\nPenn State tight end Pat Freiermuth had a similar message.\n\n\"Since day one coming back to campus the Penn State Football staff and medical experts have put our health and safety first, above anything else,\" he tweeted. \"The guidelines put into place keep us safe while playing the game we love. We are ready to play and we want to play.\"\n\nOther players tweeted with the hashtag #WeWantToPlay.\n\nThe parents of Ohio State football players weighed in, too, posting a letter saying they were confident in the university's plan to keep their sons safe.\n\n\"We believe that this age group represents some of the healthiest individuals, while we recognize the risk cannot be eliminated, we believe the risk is minimal and the season can safely and responsibly occur,\" wrote the Football Parents Association at Ohio State.\n\nNotre Dame athletic director Jack Swarbrick said he has heard the same from Fighting Irish football players. Notre Dame has had only two COVID-19 cases since it began testing athletes.\n\n\"I've been around our guys and they thinks it's safe and they want to try and play,\" Swarbrick said. \"If we change course, we better be able to articulate the reason for doing so to our student-athletes. They are going to want to know why.\"\n\n___\n\nFollow Ralph D.

        "body": "Chin'ono's application for bail was approved by a magistrate who stipulated that while he awaits trial he must not post on social media such as Facebook or Twitter. The charges against Chin'ono stem from the support he expressed on Twitter for an anti-government protest.\n\nChin'ono had previously been denied bail three times and his lawyers say prison authorities forced him to mingle with other prisoners despite showing symptoms \"consistent\" with COVID-19.\n\nHe has become ill in prison this week, according to his lawyers who say he is suffering from \"a headache, fever and distorted taste,\" symptoms consistent with COVID-19. Lawyers are still waiting for results of tests carried out this week.\n\nOne of his lawyers, Taona Nyamakura told a magistrates' court during a routine remand hearing Tuesday that prison authorities had tricked Chin'ono to think that he was going to see his private doctor but then bundled him into a waiting prison van and forced him to attend court.\n\nThis was despite a warning by Chin'ono's personal physician that the reporter was a risk to other inmates due to the symptoms he is exhibiting and should be isolated from other prisoners until the results of his test are known.\n\nProsecutors denied Chin'ono is a risk to other inmates, claiming that prison doctors have ascertained that he wasn't showing any signs of COVID-19.\n\nChin'ono has been in detention for more than a month after he was arrested together with opposition politician, Jacob Ngarivhume, and accused of inciting violence for publishing on social media his support for an anti-government protest. That protest was foiled by the military and police on July 31.\n\nThe duo's lawyers have previously told the courts that they fear for their clients' safety as overcrowding, poor diet and lack of protective equipment put their health at risk.\n\nJournalists' organizations, western embassies and human rights groups say Chin'ono is being punished for exposing government corruption on Twitter.\n\nChin'ono had alleged corruption involving a $60 million purchase of protective equipment for health workers. President Emmerson Mnangagwa later fired the health minister, who has been formally charged with corruption.\n\nCopyright 2020 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

    "COVID-19 lockdowns blocked flu in some places but fall looms": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "But there's no guarantee the Northern Hemisphere will avoid twin epidemics as its own flu season looms while the coronavirus still rages.\n\n\"This could be one of the worst seasons we've had from a public health perspective with COVID and flu coming together. But it also could be one of the best flu seasons we've had,\" Dr. Robert Redfield, director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, told The Associated Press.\n\nU.S. health officials are pushing Americans to get vaccinated against the flu in record numbers this fall, so hospitals aren't overwhelmed with a dueling \"twindemic.\"\n\nIt's also becoming clear that wearing masks, avoiding crowds and keeping your distance are protections that are \"not specific for COVID. They're going to work for any respiratory virus,\" Redfield said.\n\nThe evidence: Ordinarily, South Africa sees widespread influenza during the Southern Hemisphere's winter months of May through August. This year, testing tracked by the country's National Institute of Communicable Diseases is finding almost none -- something unprecedented.\n\nSchool closures, limited public gatherings and calls to wear masks and wash hands have \"knocked down the flu,\" said Dr. Cheryl Cohen, head of the institute's respiratory program.\n\nThat not only meant lives saved from flu's annual toll, but it \"freed up our hospitals' capacity to treat COVID-19 patients,\" Cohen added.\n\nIn Australia, the national health department reported just 36 laboratory-confirmed flu-associated deaths from January to mid-August, compared to more than 480 during the same period last year.\n\n\"The most likely and the biggest contributor is social distancing,\" said Dr. Robert Booy, an infectious diseases expert at the University of Sydney.\n\nThe coronavirus is blamed for about 24 million infections and more than 810,000 deaths globally in just the first eight months of this year. A normal flu year could have the world's hospitals dealing with several million more severe illnesses on top of the COVID-19 crush.\n\nBack in February and March, as the worldwide spread of the new virus was just being recognized, many countries throughout the Southern Hemisphere girded for a double whammy. Even as they locked down to fight the coronavirus, they made a huge push for more last-minute flu vaccinations.\n\n\"We gave many more flu vaccinations, like four times more,\" said Jaco Havenga, a pharmacist who works at Mays Chemist, a pharmacy in a Johannesburg suburb.\n\nSome countries' lockdowns were more effective than others at stemming spread of the coronavirus. So why would flu have dropped even if COVID-19 still was on the rise?\n\n\"Clearly the vigilance required to be successful against COVID is really high,\" said CDC's Redfield. \"This virus is one of the most infectious viruses that we've seen.\"\n\nThat's in part because 40% of people with COVID-19 show no symptoms yet can spread infection, he said.\n\nFlu hasn't disappeared, cautions a World Health Organization report earlier this month. While \"globally, influenza activity was reported at lower levels than expected for this time of year,\" it found sporadic cases are being reported.\n\nPlus, some people who had the flu in Southern countries might just have hunkered down at home and not seen a doctor as the coronavirus was widespread, WHO added.\n\nBut international influenza experts say keeping schools closed -- children typically drive flu's spread -- and strict mask and distancing rules clearly helped.\n\n\"We don't have definitive proof, but the logical explanation is what they're doing to try to control the spread of (the coronavirus) is actually doing a really, really good job against the flu as well,\" said Richard Webby of St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, who is part of a WHO committee that tracks flu evolution.\n\nIn contrast, the U.S. and Europe didn't impose coronavirus rules nearly as restrictive as some of their Southern neighbors -- and in many cases are reopening schools and relaxing distancing rules even as COVID-19 still is spreading and the cooler months that favor influenza's spread are fast approaching.\n\nSo the U.S. CDC is urging record flu vaccinations, preferably by October. Redfield's goal is for at least 65% of adults to be vaccinated; usually only about half are.\n\nThe U.S. expects more than 190 million doses of flu vaccine, about 20 million more than last year. States are being encouraged to try drive-thru flu shots and other creative ideas to get people vaccinated while avoiding crowds.\n\nIn an unusual move, Massachusetts has mandated flu vaccination for all students -- from elementary to college -- this year. Typically only some health care workers face employment mandates for flu vaccine.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, Prime Minister Boris Johnson likewise is urging widespread flu vaccination.\n\nTo be clear, the flu vaccine only protects against influenza -- it won't lessen the chances of getting the coronavirus. Vaccines against COVID-19 still are experimental and several candidates are entering final testing to see if they really work.\n\nBut for coronavirus protection, Redfield continues to stress vigilance about wearing masks, keeping your distance, avoiding crowds and washing your hands.\n\n\"Once one stops those mitigation steps, it only takes a couple weeks for these viral pathogens to get back on the path that they were on,\" he said.\n\nWhile the U.S. has been mask-resistant, most states now have some type of mask requirement, either through statewide orders issued by governors or from city and county rules.\n\nMeanwhile, countries where flu season is ending are watching to see if the Northern Hemisphere heeds their lessons learned.\n\n\"It could be very scary -- we honestly don't know. But if you're going to get the two infections at the same time, you could be in big trouble,\" said Booy, the Sydney infectious diseases expert.\n\n___\n\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute's Department of Science Education.

The center, in Hyattsville, is run by the nonprofit Georgetown Hill Early School, which operates 11 preschools in Prince George's, Montgomery and Frederick counties.\n\nThe case is the first at any of the 11 centers since the pandemic began, said Kristen Till, regional director for Georgetown Hill. No additional cases related to Greenwood have been reported, Till said, and the positive employee was not on site while symptomatic.\n\n\"We followed every single protocol,\" she said. \"We took extra steps that go above and beyond CDC guidelines to ensure children's and teachers' safety.\"\n\nStatewide, a total of 38 covid-19 outbreaks in child-care facilities have been reported to the Maryland Department of Health amid the pandemic, according to state data compiled Wednesday.\n\nTwenty-five outbreaks were in child-care centers and 13 were in family child-care homes, according to the data. More than 105 confirmed cases are associated with the outbreaks.\n\nThe child-care center at Greenwood, which has a contract to serve federal employees, was operating with 20 staff members and about 50 children; it typically enrolls children from infancy to age 5.\n\nIts safety measures included temperature and health checks before any child or staff member entered the building. No parents or visitors were allowed inside. Staff members changed clothes and shoes as they arrived, and children changed shoes.\n\nBins of toys and art supplies were kept separate for each child. Hand-washing and sanitizing -- of toys and play equipment, among other things -- were frequent. Social distancing was a constant, Till said. Staff and children ages 3 and older wore masks.\n\nTwo of Georgetown Hill's 11 centers opened in April to serve essential workers, and the other nine resumed operations, with reduced class sizes, in June.\n\nThe center has asked Greenwood staff and families to inform them if symptoms arise, so that center can notify health officials. A deep cleaning has already been done, Till said. All staff will be tested for the coronavirus before returning.\n\nReopening is set for Sept. 8, following approvals from state and county authorities.\n\nPrince George's health officials confirmed the positive case at Greenwood and that it closed for two weeks \"for a deep cleaning and disinfection of the facility and for students and staff to quarantine.\"\n\nAs the pandemic continues, Till said, child-care providers that remain open know they may see cases.\n\n\"That is why it is so important to catch them early and limit spread,\" she said. \"It's a balance of meeting the needs of the parents and the children while doing all we can to mitigate the unavoidable risks.\"",

        "body": "MCALLEN, Tex. -- The grotto of St. Jude Thaddeus is covered in handwritten petitions for protection against the coronavirus, pinned funeral cards, hospital bracelets and photos of the sick and dying.\n\nGraveyard workers lower caskets into the earth three or four times a day instead of once or twice a week. Masked mourners surround fresh mounds of dirt by the hour. Curanderas perform cleansing rituals for the grief-stricken. A parish priest cannot remember how many times he has rung the funeral bell. Helicopters swoop in, as if in a war, to spirit away the critically ill.\n\nA friend watched her neighbor plead silently for prayer on live video days before she stopped breathing. A son waited with clasped hands every evening in the hospital parking lot with half a dozen other faithful, sending supplications heavenward.\n\nTeachers. Janitors. Bankers. Politicians. Neighbors. Colleagues. Children.\n\nFew here in Texas's lower Rio Grande Valley have been left untouched by the pandemic's lethal reach, as the virus has ripped through the border region, infecting tens of thousands of people and killing more than 1,500 just in the months after Texas thought it had escaped the virus's grip and started to reopen, according to Washington Post data.\n\nThe region of more than 1.2 million people in four counties accounts for approximately 15 percent of all of the state's virus-related fatalities. Though the governor has surged resources here, the pandemic has plunged the Valley into a state of perpetual grief.\n\n\"We just can't take another emotional step,\" said Ivan Melendez, Hidalgo County's health authority and a practicing doctor in McAllen. \"There's not been one day in the last three months that someone hasn't asked me: 'Did you hear who died?' \"\n\nThe Rio Grande Valley is a place that thrives on the closeness of family, community and social connectedness, one of the main reasons that a virus that feeds on intimacy has been so crippling here.\n\nWhile adversity is no stranger to the people along the Mexican border -- an area bearing the trauma of centuries of resource scarcity, systematic exclusion and stifling poverty -- people here have overcome those challenges by coming together. The best ways to protect against the virus violate every instinct of Valley life.\n\nWhere there isn't death yet, anxiety permeates. The knees of prayer warriors are bruised. Friends trade recipes for home elixirs to ward off covid cough. Botanicas and yerberias offer curbside service. Some seek solace in rituals and faith to quiet the sense of dread that five pages of death notices in the local newspaper bring.\n\nMelendez has watched his sixth-grade teacher, his mother's best friend and pillars of the community come through coronavirus wards to die.\n\n\"Nobody wants a doctor who cries,\" he said, \"but I break down all the time.\"\n\n[Pandemic's weight falls on Hispanics and Native Americans, as deaths pass 150,000]\n\nThe latest came after he promised an old friend that he wouldn't let him succumb to covid-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus. The man was unrecognizable beneath a breathing mask, his body swollen and frail. He called out playfully to Melendez, taking off his mask: \"Don't you recognize me, bro?\"\n\n\"Whoa, you look old,\" the doctor responded. \"And you got fat,\" the man joked.\n\nIt was Albert. The same nurse who, 25 years earlier, had started with Melendez in the emergency room. The nurse's condition worsened over several days, and the last chance for survival was placing him on a ventilator. The man begged the doctor not to do it.\n\n\"I told him, 'You're gonna die if I don't,' \" said Melendez, who also tested positive for the coronavirus and has recovered. \"I told him not to worry and that I wouldn't let him die. But he told me with his eyes that he knew I was lying.\"\n\nThe coronavirus has spread relentlessly inside multigenerational households -- among the poor, the vulnerable and the undocumented -- and silently infected multitudes. Many are waiting too long to seek treatment out of fear that they will not leave the hospital alive.\n\nData from The Post shows the Valley has some of Texas's highest death rates and youngest victims, including a 19-year-old and a minor of unknown age reported recently. They were classified as Hidalgo County's first two pediatric deaths.\n\nThe borderlands also have some of the highest rates of uninsured people in the country. Hidalgo County is home to more than a dozen private hospitals, but they are too expensive for most residents, who suffer high rates of diabetes and obesity.\n\nNelda Garza, who works with the McAllen Primary Care Clinic, spends most of her time stringing together solutions for people on the fringes of her community. Her phone number gets passed around the colonias -- impoverished rural communities that lack basic infrastructure -- when someone needs a coronavirus test or is afraid they are sick.\n\nGarza tried to persuade Norma Vasquez to visit a doctor when she contracted the virus, but Vasquez refused. They chatted by video during the 15 days she was ill, fighting off symptoms with home remedies. Vasquez made tea from eucalyptus and guava leaves, and tonics of chamomile mixed with Topo Chico. She sent her son over the border into Mexico to buy cheap fever-reducing medicine -- Paracetamol -- and shared the recipes with neighbors.\n\n\"I won't go to the hospital,\" said Vasquez, 50. \"You leave worse off than when you enter.\"\n\nWhile Vasquez beat the virus, her neighbor did not. Olivia Castro had been nursing her husband through the virus when she became gravely ill. She filmed herself live on Facebook from her hospital bed and peered into the camera for 10 minutes, because she could not breathe enough to speak. She waved, nodded her head and pressed her hands firmly together, silently asking for prayers while friends posted encouraging messages.\n\nWhen Castro tried to respond to the questions from family, she mouthed words with a murmur. Vasquez told Castro, 40, to hang on. She died Aug. 2. The colonia is helping the family raise money for funeral expenses.\n\nAs death has pervaded almost everything here, the death business is struggling to keep up.\n\n[Hispanic, Black children at higher risk of coronavirus-related hospitalization, CDC finds]\n\nOn a recent afternoon, two funeral home workers needed a break and sought shade under a tree in a Hidalgo graveyard. They started talking while staring at the fresh heap of dark brown dirt at their feet.\n\n\"It's super confusing,\" said Daniel Contreras, 29, as he wiped his forehead. \"It's everywhere. I look at the families and can see that people are being taken away too early.\"\n\nThe men operate a lowering device that places caskets into graves. Their job often forces them to stay on site for most of the services.\n\n\"I know, man. I do think about getting sick a lot. But we have to keep working,\" replied Ysmael Ybarra, also 29. \"I've done so many of these that I already know all the mariachi songs well enough I can judge how well the bands played it.\"\n\n\"And you don't even know Spanish,\" Contreras said.\n\nThe specter of sickness also torments. Once it arrives, emptiness and bitterness follow. Debts and bills arrive.\n\nDanielle L\u00f3pez's am\u00e1 warned her about \"La Gran Ansiedad\" -- the Great Anxiety. Her elderly mother had a way of flourishing advice with mystery. Her point was simple. A day was coming when society would be gripped by anxiety, and her daughter needed to be ready.\n\nThe pronouncement was prophetic for L\u00f3pez, 36, who practices curanderismo, which combines elements of Indigenous, African and European healing traditions. Folk medicine is deeply embedded in Tejano history, as decades of neglect and the absence of formal health care in the region brought forth spiritual healers. When the virus started killing, L\u00f3pez, a doctoral student, left college to return to her border community.\n\n\"When you start seeing several obituaries for people who were in your high school senior class, you know something has gone terribly wrong,\" she said.\n\n[The number of pregnant Latinas with covid-19 is staggering. And a warning sign, doctors say.]\n\nFew people will admit to consulting a curandera in the Valley because of the stigma it carries, but local experts say many do as part of their wellness routine or because they trust a folk healer more than physicians.\n\n\"The overwhelming majority of people who go to see a curandero or curandera are seeking help with an emotional health problem,\" said Tony Zavaleta, a retired anthropologist who has written about the practice.\n\nL\u00f3pez encourages her clients to visit doctors and follow science. But the maladies plaguing them are more than physiological. She uses oils, medicinal herbs and incense for a cleansing ritual involving prayer and pl\u00e1tica, or talk therapy. She has built such trust with families that they consult her about everything from wearing masks to canceling events.\n\n\"Aqui no hay pena, aqui no hay dolor,\" L\u00f3pez chanted as she circled Maria Martinez with an incense burner and swiped her with a bushel of herbs, saying that there was no pain there with them. \"Cry, mama. If you need to, cry.\"\n\nMartinez, who requested the ritual before taking her mother to be tested for the coronavirus, burst into sobs that built into wails. L\u00f3pez gave Martinez a rosary to take with her.\n\nGloom cloaked Cindy Candia after her brother, Samuel Candia, died unexpectedly in late July. She wanted to blame someone. She wanted to break things. But most of all, she had wanted a chance to fix things between them.\n\nThe siblings were close but had argued about how far to take the pandemic precautions, and they stopped talking for a while. He teased her about the jug of hand sanitizer in her truck. She dressed him down for hosting a party at his house. Samuel Candia was a dialysis patient with a penchant for gallows humor.\n\n\"He would joke that if anyone got the 'rona that they should give it to him,\" said Candia, 49, of Harlingen, who knew her 50-year-old brother was tired of his illness.\n\nCindy Candia's brother was pronounced dead inside an ambulance hours after she learned he was sick. She said she nearly destroyed her house in a tequila-fueled rage.\n\n\"I needed to get the darkness out, and I knew I couldn't get it out on my own,\" Candia said after calling L\u00f3pez for help.\n\n\"The rage is gone; it's just more grief now,\" she said after the visitations with L\u00f3pez. \"I asked my brother to forgive me for being selfish. I think he heard me. So now I am focusing on my brother's wife and kids.\"\n\nThe Catholic Diocese of Brownsville closed parishes such as Our Lady of Guadalupe Church in Mission, Tex., early in the pandemic. The pastor, Roy Snipes, has presided over more than 84 funerals in the past few months. Some people he knew from regular parish services, others were a few degrees from acquaintance, but all of them hurt as he hears the unmistakable guitar chords of the mournful ballad \"Amor Eterno\" over and over again.\n\n\"We are wounded, worried and weary,\" Snipes said.\n\nWhen it gets to be too much, the priest heads down to the Rio Grande at sunrise with his three rescue dogs, Charlotte, Bendito and Wiglet. At the river's edge, he said he tries to be receptive to the signs of normal life around him. Birds singing. Water lapping. Dogs splashing.\n\nSnipes realized his parishioners needed their own spiritual respite. Mass is virtual, and coming in for confession isn't safe. But a \"walk-in Communion\" could succor souls, he thought.\n\nOn a recent August afternoon, Snipes slipped on his priestly robes, played a cowboy country song over the parish speakers and walked to the pulpit. About 20 parishioners were waiting. His pups wore bandannas of purple -- the color of mourning.\n\nOn one wing of the sanctuary is an altar memorializing military members. Snipes thinks he will soon need a \"corona altar\" for the other wing.\n\n\"We ask you for a miracle, O Lord!\" Claudia Lozano prayed into a microphone. \"Take away this scourge for all the sick people in the hospital.\"\n\nA few members of an evangelical church gathered together to sing and pray every evening in an eerily empty Rio Grande Regional Hospital parking lot, their words reverberating through a speaker. The lot is usually filled with cars full of families crowding the waiting rooms and visiting the sick.\n\nAlejandro Machain can't go inside to see his 75-year-old mother, Eunice Machain. So he looks up at the windows from his truck every evening. He's been doing it since July 12. \"She doesn't like to be alone,\" he wept.\n\nRick Vega and Marco Urive set up a 10-foot-tall cross near the singers. Urive has been to seven funerals in 45 days. Ten people close to him have tested positive or have been sick. The calamity, the men said, has been humbling for the Valley.\n\nThe mosquitoes were biting furiously after Hurricane Hanna swept through a week earlier. But that August night, Vega and Urive stayed late to pray, because they wanted those fighting for their lives to know that someone was close by.\n\n\"If we have breath in our lungs, we'll proclaim hope,\" Urive said. \"This has been humbling for the Valley, and it's been the most humbling experience of my life.\"",

    "Coronavirus invaded the District and Maryland multiple times in March, genetic analysis shows": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "The study, from Johns Hopkins University scientists, highlights the challenge in preventing the arrival and spread of the highly contagious virus within a region that anchors the Northeast Corridor and boasts three international airports and a highly mobile population.\n\nThe researchers report high levels of genetic diversity in the 114 genomes they completed, based on samples from patients treated in Johns Hopkins-affiliated hospitals in Maryland and the District from March 11 to March 31. The research has not yet been published in a peer-reviewed journal but has been posted online at the preprint server medRxiv.\n\nThere are five major genetic groupings, known as clades, of the novel coronavirus, and all five were represented in the viral samples from patients. That suggested a single introduction could not have triggered all of those March infections. Instead, the virus must have been arriving at many different times.\n\nAnother important finding: The different genetic profiles of the virus infecting people in the Washington region did not correspond to any clear difference in disease severity among patients.\n\nWhere the virus came from is not covered by the report, and the researchers could not tell if the introductions came directly from places overseas or from points within the United States. A study by scientists at New York University showed that much of the early coronavirus spread in New York City was due to introductions from Europe.\n\n\"There were probably five or more introductions sometime before the end of March,\" said study co-author Shirlee Wohl, a genomics expert at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. \"Even as early as March, the first three weeks of the outbreak, we were already seeing diversity rivaling the global diversity of this virus.\"\n\nThis latest study and others preceding it provide clear evidence that the United States, and certainly big cities on the East Coast, were dealing with community spread of the virus well in advance of major shutdown efforts, including the Trump administration's decision to ban travel from most European countries starting March 13.\n\n\"The number of introductions that occurred would make it difficult to enact a travel ban, would make it difficult to do anything except screen everybody with a diagnostic test,\" said study co-author Peter Thielen, a molecular biologist at Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory.\n\nThe diversity of virus in the national capital region \"highlights the connectedness of the region to both the national and global epidemic, and the challenges that would likely confront any control strategy predicated on low rates of introduction,\" the report states.\n\nThe NYU study found that the virus may have been spreading in New York as early as late January. A scientific conference attended by international travelers in Boston in late February has been dubbed a \"superspreader\" event that seeded the virus in many places in the United States.\n\nAccording to the new Hopkins report, Maryland reported its first case of covid-19, the disease caused by the virus, on March 5. Two days later, the District and Virginia reported their first cases. Those patients were probably infected many days before, Thielen said.\n\nOnly 22 percent of the patients studied by the Hopkins researchers had traveled to places with known outbreaks of the virus, the report said.\n\nAll viruses mutate, and by the time the coronavirus reached the national capital region, it had mutated slightly. The Hopkins scientists counted a total of 153 genetic mutations in their virus samples, compared with the reference sample from Wuhan, China, where the outbreak is believed to have ignited.\n\nBut most mutations actually impair the fitness of the virus or have no effect at all. The Hopkins research did not find evidence that the variants of the virus led to any difference in patient outcomes, regardless of sex, race, symptoms or underlying conditions.\n\n\"The diversity of virus genetics, clinical symptoms, and patient outcomes suggests that viral mutations are not the main driver of clinical presentation,\" the new study states.\n\nSeveral recent studies have suggested that one mutation, known as D614G, has altered the structure of the spike protein of the virus in a way that could potentially facilitate transmission. That mutation is now seen across the planet, including in many of the virus samples in the national capital region, but the scientific community has not endorsed the conjecture that the virus has become more contagious.\n\nThielen pointed out that, without a vaccine, and with relatively few people having been exposed and having antibodies to the virus, the coronavirus is sailing along with no natural or artificial obstacles.\n\n\"Right now, with no immunity in the population, there's not much pressure on the virus to evade immunity, which is what would drive transmissibility,\" Thielen said.",

    "Covid-19 surges back into nursing homes in coronavirus hot spots": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "The development is a discouraging result of widespread community transmission of the virus in many parts of the country and in hot spots where it is even less controlled. With staff -- and in some cases patients and visitors -- entering and leaving facilities, the community-acquired infection almost inevitably finds its way inside.\n\n\"The strongest predictor of whether or not we'll see cases in [a particular setting] is community spread,\" said David C. Grabowski, a professor of health care policy at Harvard Medical School, who studies long-term care. \"We saw that in the Northeast and now, unfortunately, we're seeing it in the Sun Belt states.\"\n\nFederal data cited by two long-term care associations this week show that the number of new cases in nursing homes bottomed out at 5,468 during the week of June 21 and has climbed steadily upward to 8,628 for the week of July 19, the last week available. That is a 58 percent increase that roughly parallels the rise in U.S. cases overall during that time.\n\nDeaths in nursing homes from covid-19 dropped sharply to 1,324 for the week of June 28 before leveling off over the next three weeks, according to the American Health Care Association and the National Center for Assisted Living, which represent long-term care facilities. But a rise in deaths usually lags several weeks behind an increase in cases, and officials are watching for signs of increased fatalities.\n\nOn Thursday, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) spoke directly to that issue, warning that more covid-19 deaths at nursing homes and assisted-living facilities may be on the way, even as total caseloads have begun to decline. Florida has suffered a huge outbreak of coronavirus cases in recent months and has a sizable population of elderly residents.\n\n\"Over the next couple weeks, I'm concerned of seeing kind of a tail where we start to see some of these long-term-care deaths,\" DeSantis said Thursday at a forum in Tallahassee.\n\nA separate analysis of 35 states released July 21 by the Kaiser Family Foundation found that cases in long-term care facilities jumped 11 percent in the two weeks ending July 10. But in 23 hot spot states, they rose 18 percent, compared with just 4 percent in 12 states that had the virus under better control. That review included nursing homes, assisted-living facilities and other kinds of long-term care.\n\nCovid-19 is particularly dangerous for the elderly, who live in close quarters in many nursing homes and assisted-living facilities. Once an infection takes hold, it can race through a care home. One of the most memorable examples is the outbreak in a Kirkland, Wash., nursing home in February, which killed 43 people near the start of the pandemic.\n\nWhile the numbers have shifted a bit, residents of nursing homes account for roughly 35 percent to 40 percent of all covid-19 deaths in the United States. At least 163,000 people in the United States have died of covid-19, according to a Washington Post analysis of data.\n\nThe problem in the early days of the pandemic was the unrecognized lethality and transmissibility of the virus. But long-term care facilities today face a threat from the sheer amount of coronavirus in the community surrounding them. Many states across the South and West that reopened early and quickly, before they controlled the virus, have been hit by a wave of new cases.\n\nMuch of the surge is blamed on younger adults who flocked to bars, restaurants, beaches and parties, where some picked up the infection. Many of them displayed no symptoms but were highly infectious to others -- including the staff and visitors of nursing homes.\n\nLike the pandemic itself, the phenomenon is both urban and rural at this point. In 26 Mississippi counties, many of them sparsely populated, deaths in long-term care centers account for more than half the total covid-19 deaths, state records show. Mississippi currently has 178 outbreaks in long-term care facilities.\n\nIn Lauderdale County, for example, 56 of the 94 deaths were in nursing homes, mainly during the early days of the pandemic, said coroner Clayton Cobler. Twelve of the county's 13 nursing homes saw at least one death, he said.\n\nNow, with the virus surging again, Cobler said he is wary of another surge in deaths. \"We've gotten noncompliant,\" he said, citing younger people partying, particularly at the beach.\n\nSome states also relaxed nursing home visiting rules in the late spring as conditions improved. And the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released a study this week showing that residents of a Maryland nursing home who received dialysis treatment outside the facility became infected in much greater numbers than those who did not receive that care.\n\nWhen a team led by Grabowski examined nearly 3,000 nursing homes for the factors that led to a covid-19 outbreak, they found some circumstances had more influence than others. Facilities were more likely to have at least one case if they were in urban areas, were not part of chains and had a larger percentage of residents who were African American. The state where a nursing home is located also mattered.\n\nBut the odds of having an outbreak were not affected by having a prior infection violation, a large number of residents on Medicaid or receiving a five-star rating, the highest available, from federal reviewers. Ownership of a facility also did not appear to factor into whether an outbreak was likely.\n\nAnother recent study found that nursing homes with larger staffs were better able to limit outbreaks when they occur. Usually, this is done by separating infected and uninfected residents and stepping up other infection control measures, Grabowski said.\n\nMark Parkinson, president and chief executive of the American Health Care Association, said about 10 percent of the staff in the 14,000 long-term care facilities his group represents still have virtually no N95 masks. Those face-coverings filter out about 95 percent of airborne particles and are usually reserved for health-care personnel.\n\nBut, the bottom line, Parkinson said, is that widespread community transmission and a poor testing regimen are far more critical in sending the virus into long-term care facilities.\n\n\"The number one way we can reduce covid in nursing homes is if everybody in the country would wear a mask,\" he said. \"When people make the conscious decision not to wear a mask, they are making a decision that will kill older people.\"\n\nSome experts hope that, having learned lessons from the early days of the pandemic, nursing homes may be able to limit fatalities more effectively than they did in the first part of the pandemic.\n\nParkinson said the development of the treatments remdesivir and dexamethasone, which have proved effective in reducing the severity and duration of some cases, and other medical techniques may help during this new surge.\n\nBut with testing still inadequate and protective equipment for workers lacking in some places, it is still too early to know, said Vincent Mor, a professor in Brown University's School of Public Health who studies long-term care. Community spread is still having the strongest influence.\n\n\"The exact same phenomenon that [took place] in New York, New Jersey and Seattle is working here,\" Mor said.",

New Orleans Saints Coach Sean Payton disclosed in March that he tested positive. He said soon thereafter that he had recovered.\n\nNFL officials have said they expect to deal with positive tests and coronavirus cases as they attempt to conduct the 2020 season during the pandemic. Teams have opened their training camps with strict protocols in place, although the NFL is not operating in a single-site \"bubble\" environment like the NBA is doing in Florida.\n\nCoaches, like players and some staffers, are being tested daily for at least the first two weeks of training camp. That can be adjusted to every other day thereafter, based on the rate of positive tests.\n\nNFL looking into how to handle potential team shutdowns, game postponements\n\nUnder the treatment procedures sent to NFL teams last month, a person who tests positive but has no symptoms cannot return to the team facility for 10 days or until he or she tests negative twice at least five days after the positive test.\n\nA person who tests positive and exhibits symptoms must be kept away from the team facility for at least 10 days and for at least 72 hours since symptoms last occurred. In each set of circumstances, doctors must approve the return of anyone who tests positive.\n\nPlayers, coaches and staffers are wearing tracking devices in team facilities to assist with distancing measures and contact tracing. Anyone known to have been in contact with an individual who tests positive is subject to monitoring and testing.",

    "Facing a coronavirus crisis, Israel calls in the army": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "As head of the Israeli army's Home Front Command, Gordin is now overseeing the military's coronavirus \"task force,\" formed last month to bring one of the developed world's worst outbreaks under control. Its main responsibility is taking the lead in contact tracing and breaking chains of infection.\n\n\"This is a operation on a different scale,\" Gordin told The Associated Press, speaking in his first interview since taking over the Home Front Command in May.\n\nIsrael appeared to be a model of crisis management last spring, when the coronavirus first arrived. Authorities quickly sealed the borders and imposed tough lockdown measures, bringing the number of new infections down to just a handful each day in May.\n\nBut officials reopened the economy too quickly, and the virus soon returned. Throughout the summer, the rate of new cases has remained at record levels, while the death toll has steadily climbed to over 900 people.\n\nUnder heavy public pressure, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in July appointed Dr. Ronni Gamzu, a respected hospital director and former Health Ministry director, as the national \"coronavirus project manager.\"\n\nOne of Gamzu's first acts was to turn to the military for help, giving it the critical mission of cutting the chain of infections.\n\n\"You have to have the best operational forces, and in Israel, it's the IDF,\" he told journalists recently, referring to the Israel Defense Forces.\n\nFounded in the wake of Iraqi Scud missile attacks on Israel during the 1991 Gulf War, the Home Front Command serves as Israel's civil defense force. It helps maintain the country's network of bomb shelters and air raid sirens, and is trained to assist civilians during wars and natural disasters. It has sent rescue teams around the world to help countries coping with earthquakes, tsunamis and other emergencies.\n\nFor months, the command has been managing a network of coronavirus hotels, providing both isolation facilities and recovery services for infected people with mild symptoms. Its soldiers have also distributed food and supplies in hard-hit areas -- including communities that have had little contact with the military, such as Arab towns and ultra-Orthodox Jewish neighborhoods.\n\nMorad Ammash, the head of the municipal council of the Arab town of Jisr al-Zarqa, said the command worked well with his community when it dealt with an outbreak in March.\n\n\"They helped us with public information, managing the system, handing out food to the needy,\" he said. \"A good connection was formed.\"\n\nGordin said public trust in the military is perhaps his most important asset. He said the army's experience in emergency management and its bottomless pool of manpower also are key strengths.\n\nWorking under the direction of the Health Ministry, his task force acts largely as a coordinator and support body for civilian authorities in four key areas: expanding the number of tests; working with labs to speed up the results; interviewing those who are infected to identify who has been in contact with them; and quickly placing those at risk into quarantine.\n\nIt is also working closely with municipalities, other government ministries, medical rescue services, police and public and private labs to help streamline the national response.\n\n\"It's like the management of one large factory,\" Gordin said. \"I can bring them all to one table and cooperate effectively and synchronize them in an effective manner.\"\n\nAt the Home Front Command's headquarters in central Israel, the task force has already set up a situation room. On a recent day, masked military officials sat alongside officials from the Health Ministry and other government ministries, representatives of municipalities and health-care providers, plotting strategies as they analyzed data on large TV screens.\n\nUpstairs was the \"hotel unit,\" where workers keep tabs on the thousands of people staying in the 25 facilities the force is managing. In nearby military tents, dozens of uniformed soldiers sat in front of computer screens, interviewing newly infected patients to retrace their steps and contacts.\n\nEpidemiological experts from the Health Ministry, including an Arabic speaking Druze nurse, hovered about to offer guidance and answer questions. The contact-tracing data is fed in real time to the Health Ministry.\n\n\"Our goal is to stop the chain early on,\" Gordin said. \"If you don't do it fast enough, it's not relevant.\"\n\nIsrael is not the first to enlist the military in the war on the coronavirus. Throughout Latin America, soldiers have delivered food, monitored traffic and and enforced stay-at-home orders, while in China, the Communist Party's military wing brought some 1,400 doctors, nurses and experts to the city of Wuhan, the epicenter of the pandemic, to build two hospitals and treat patients early this year.\n\nA military-led task force in Australia has helped local authorities with contact tracing, and Spain announced last week that the military is offering 2,000 soldiers to regional governments to assist in contact tracing.\n\nGiven Israel's relatively small size of just 9 million people, the new task force appears to be among the world's most ambitious efforts. It already has enlisted 2,300 soldiers and expects to soon hit 3,000, in addition to the many civilian local officials and medical professionals.\n\nWhile the task force is still in its early stages, Gordin said it has already been able to increase the number of daily tests and shorten the time for receiving results. Soldiers have conducted almost 2,000 interviews.\n\n\"I think that by Nov. 1 we should be in control of the situation. That's our desire,\" he said.\n\nDespite the ambitious goals, the country faces some serious obstacles.\n\nMedical professionals say the nation's epidemiological system is overstretched after years of government neglect.\n\nGamzu, the national coronavirus czar, has also found himself feuding with politicians and powerful interest groups, all while trying to avoid another national lockdown.\n\nHe has been clashing with politically powerful religious parties, for instance, over his refusal to allow traditional September pilgrimages to the grave of a revered rabbi in Ukraine. Arab communities continue to hold large weddings -- a popular custom despite the high infection rate plaguing the Arab population. The reopening of schools and upcoming Jewish high holidays also will present challenges.\n\nDr. Nadav Davidovitch, chairman of Ben Gurion University's school of public health and a member of a board of advisers helping Gamzu, said there is no guarantee of success, but agreed that bringing in the army is a good move.\n\n\"If the right balance is achieved with the oversight and guidance and training by the Ministry of Health, I think that's the right way of doing it,\" he said. \"This should have been done long ago.\"\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Rod McGuirk in Canberra, Australia; Christopher Sherman in Mexico City and Aritz Parra in Madrid contributed to this report.\n\nCopyright 2020 The Associated Press.

    "Facing unmasked diners and sick colleagues, restaurant workers worry about safety  --  and their livelihoods": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "On June 17, Jennifer Moreau received a text that said Senate Blue Ash, the suburban Cincinnati restaurant where she worked as a cook, would be closed the following day. All employees would be required to get tested for the coronavirus on their day off, the owner and executive team wrote. According to the restaurant, a line cook had just tested positive.\n\n\"Obviously discretions [sic] is key so please refrain from related posts on social media, as it would affect all of our livelihoods,\" the text explained, according to a screenshot Moreau shared with The Washington Post.\n\nMoreau dutifully got tested but didn't visit the recommended clinic. She found one closer to her home. Moreau thought it also provided same-day results. It didn't. Executive chef Leroy Ansley, who declined to comment for this story, was not happy. He exchanged texts with Moreau, which she shared with The Post, indicating that her decision had put him in a bind, as the restaurant reopened on June 19 with less than half its kitchen staff. Ansley even sent Moreau a photo of chef and co-owner Daniel Wright in a black mask.\n\n[Bars, strip clubs and breweries discover how to survive during the pandemic: Reopen as restaurants]\n\n\"I have to have Dan come in and peel potatoes,\" Ansley texted. \"It is what it is.\"\n\nMoreau, 49, never returned to Senate Blue Ash.\n\nShe had reasons, starting with her son, Alex Allen, who was a cook at a sister restaurant and who tested positive for the coronavirus on June 23. Even though she tested negative, Moreau was required to quarantine for two weeks because she lives in the same house with her son. But Moreau was also put off by the way Queen City Hospitality Group, the parent of Senate Blue Ash, handled the situation. She didn't like the social media blackout on the restaurant's positive employee. She worried, too, the workplace wasn't safe after a 24-hour shutdown and a round of rapid-response tests, which have a 20 percent false-negative rate. She, after all, has elderly parents, including her mom, who already had contracted the virus.\n\n\"Our customers have the right to know that the people serving their food have been exposed to covid,\" said Moreau, who contacted Restaurant Opportunities Centers United, an advocacy group for hospitality workers, and filed a complaint against Queen City with the National Labor Relations Board.\n\n\"It's highly likely that some of them that tested negative were actually positive, which made me even more afraid to go back to work,\" added Moreau, who worked next to the cook who tested positive. \"None of these tests are 100 percent.\"\n\nSenate Blue Ash restaurant. (Amy Powell for The Washington Post)\n\nWright, the co-owner of Queen City, denies the accusations and says his company is \"doing everything that we can to keep our restaurants safe.\" He instead points a finger instead at Moreau. He alleges she has been drumming up charges, and faking a coronavirus-positive result, just to collect the extra $600 a week in unemployment, back when it was still available. \"Some people just don't want to work,\" he said.\n\nAcross the country, many hospitality workers are afraid to work right now in an industry that's fighting for survival with limited resources, conflicting reopening guidance from government and a significant portion of the population that continues to think the coronavirus is no worse than the seasonal flu. The reopening of restaurants, as Moreau's example shows, has also further frayed the already-fraught relationship between worker and employer.\n\n[Coca-Cola plans to debut an alcoholic Topo Chico, entering the hard-seltzer market]\n\nWorkers' fears are as individual as their situations. Some have loved ones who are immune-compromised, and they can't risk bringing the virus home. Some have their own health issues that make them vulnerable. Some work in a part of the country where people don't believe in wearing masks. Some worry their employers are not taking the pandemic seriously. Some have to interact with tourists who may be traveling from hot spots.\n\nSome also have enough savings to try to ride out the pandemic without stepping back into restaurants and bars. But some, such as Lena Schlegelmilch, don't have that luxury. The jobs that offer the flexibility that Schlegelmilch needs -- the 20-year-old is a junior at the University of Nebraska at Kearney -- are mostly in the restaurant industry, so she continues to work as a server, cook and bartender at Thunderhead Brewing, where her father, Jamie, is general manager.\n\nSince June 22, Gov. Pete Ricketts has allowed most Nebraska restaurants to operate at 100 percent capacity. The Republican governor has also encouraged, but not mandated, mask-wearing among residents. At Thunderhead Brewing, Schlegelmilch said, only about 10 percent of her customers wear masks at any time in the restaurant, creating many more opportunities every shift for the virus to pass from patron to staff. Those who don't wear a mask will sometimes mock her when she does. They'll say she's wearing a \"face condom\" or explain that \"it doesn't protect you as much as you think that it should,\" she said.\n\n\"I used to talk back,\" Schlegelmilch said, \"but I have to make money somehow, so usually I just stay silent, because if you piss them off enough they're not going to tip you.\"\n\n[Acclaimed chef Jerome Grant taught black history through food. Now he wants to tell his own story.]\n\nSchlegelmilch has not only stopped talking back. She's also stopped wearing a mask. Her decision has led to some direct benefits. She made $30 or $40 a night in tips while wearing a mask, and it's now \"over $100 in tips every shift,\" she said.\n\nThunderhead recommends employees wear masks and has coverings available for staff, but they're not required, said Jamie Schlegelmilch, the GM. \"It's just basically up to the customer\" to wear a mask, he added. \"The best thing we can do is encourage them and hope it will be okay.\"\n\nYolanda Scott, a server at the Coffee Shop at Treasure Island in Las Vegas. (Joe Buglewicz for The Washington Post)\n\nMegan Lombardi, 20, can identify with Lena Schlegelmilch. She's a server at the Foggy Bottom location of Duke's Grocery, a small chain of neighborhood pubs in Washington. To save money, Lombardi said, the restaurant cut the hostess who usually would greet customers and remind them about the city's policy requiring them to wear masks except when they're eating or drinking. Without that line of defense, Lombardi spends part of her shift reminding customers to mask up. Some don't listen, such as the table of five who vaped inside and ignored her request to don masks when leaving. Her tip on their $75 tab? Zero. A woman from Florida, without a mask, got in Lombardi's face and mocked her to fellow patrons. Her party left a few singles on a $120 check.\n\nWith the bad tips and the lack of customers, Lombardi figures she's making about minimum wage, down from the $30 an hour she used to count on to make rent. Duke's Grocery owner Daniel Kramer declined to comment when asked about Lombardi's complaints.\n\nYolanda Scott, 51, is a member of the Culinary Workers Union Local 226, which represents 98 percent of the servers, cooks, bartenders, room attendants and others who work on the strip in Las Vegas. Scott has worked as a server at Treasure Island since the casino opened in 1993. When Treasure Island reopened in June, Scott was back on familiar turf in the Coffee Shop, but under unfamiliar circumstances. The new mandated distance between tables has been hell on her arthritis.\n\n[A spate of new food memoirs promised something different. But the lack of diversity is the same old story.]\n\nBut her bigger problem is the customers, most of whom are tourists. Scott serves between 50 and 80 people a day, she said, and none wear masks. Scott said they should put them on while interacting with her, not just for her well-being but for those who share her home. Her partner, Scott said, has a bad kidney and heart, and she is \"very nervous\" about bringing the virus home from diners who might be visiting Las Vegas from a hot spot.\n\n\"You don't know where people are coming from,\" Scott said.\n\nHer customers' behavior places the burden on Scott to keep her partner and two children safe. She has developed protocols when returning from work. Before greeting anyone, \"I take my shoes off at the door and then I go straight to the restroom and remove my clothing and shower.\" She stuffs her work clothes in a bag to have them cleaned at the casino.\n\n\"We require all our guests and employees to wear masks unless eating and drinking,\" a casino spokesperson said in a statement. \"TI employees, including managers, waitstaff and bussers, are tasked with reminding guests to follow procedure for the safety of everyone on property. We take the security of our employees and guests very seriously.\"\n\nChef William Morris at Cherry in 2019. (Dayna Smith for The Washington Post)\n\nWilliam Morris, 47, hasn't worked in professional kitchens since March 9. He misses, and fears, them. He has been cooking at restaurants for more than 25 years, including stints as head chef at Vermilion in Alexandria and Cherry, the restaurant inside the W Hotel in downtown Washington. But as a cancer survivor, he's vigilant about his health and the conditions that may impact it. His mother, Jewelyn, recently died of covid-19, the disease the virus causes. She went quickly, Morris said. He didn't get to say goodbye.\n\n\"You'll have to excuse me,\" he said, starting to choke up. \"My mom was my world. She was my everything.\"\n\nMorris's concerns are compounded by what he knows about kitchens. They're built for efficiency, not to protect workers from a virus. Kitchens are often compact, designed to limit the number of steps for the cooks who work the line. They're often hot, too, the kind of place where few would want to wear a mask for prolonged periods. Workers will show up even when ill, Morris adds, usually because they don't have sick leave or can't afford the time off.\n\n\"You think about the amount of line cooks that are working two jobs,\" Morris said. \"You could be very safe in one restaurant and taking every precaution. But is everybody at all the restaurants going to be the same way?\"\n\n[The Goya boycott could impact the brand, experts say -- just not the way you think]\n\nIn Cincinnati, the case of the Senate Blue Ash employee who tested positive for the coronavirus was never reported to Hamilton County Public Health, as required, said Mike Samet, public information officer for the department. The notification of a positive rapid test would have initiated contact tracing by the department, Samet said, but the restaurant would not have been required to shut down or to test employees.\n\n\"There are a lot of questions about that rapid test right now,\" Samet said. Many of those questions were generated after Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine (R) tested positive following a rapid-response test, only to learn he didn't have the virus when administered the more accurate polymerase chain reaction test. Hamilton County has not mandated which test to use, Samet said.\n\nMoreau, 49, has not returned to her job at Senate Blue Ash. (Amy Powell for The Washington Post)\n\nWright, co-owner of Senate Blue Ash's parent company, said Queen City Hospitality is testing all 150 employees monthly, or more frequently, at a cost of thousands of dollars per round. It's \"incredibly offensive that I even have to answer this stuff, given the things that restaurants are going through right now and the levels that we are actually putting forward in order to keep people safe,\" Wright said to The Post. \"We did call the health department. Why they don't have a record, I don't know.\"\n\nQueen City Hospitality, Wright said, never told employees they couldn't say anything about the coronavirus-positive cook at Senate Blue Ash. Wright sent The Post a new text -- not a screenshot of the original -- that he said was the approved message forwarded to all 60-something Senate Blue Ash employees on June 17. It did not include two sentences in the text screenshot that Moreau had forwarded, including the line that asked employees to refrain from related posts on social media.\n\nWhen The Post forwarded the text screenshot from Moreau, Wright responded, \"I'm honestly done explaining things.\"\n\nWright said Queen City had alerted the public about the sick employee at Senate Blue Ash, though there were no mentions on the restaurant's Facebook or Twitter accounts. Nor did Wright say anything on his personal Facebook page, but on June 23, four days after Senate Blue Ash reopened after testing all employees, Wright wrote a lengthy Facebook post about an employee who \"likely tested positive\" at sister restaurant Pontiac in the Over-the-Rhine neighborhood. The employee was Allen, Moreau's son, a cook at Pontiac before he was recently fired for making what Wright said were \"transphobic\" comments on social media. (Allen confirms the reasons for his termination.)\n\nSome media outlets in Cincinnati wrote stories based on Wright's Facebook post, which the owner pointed to as evidence that the public was notified about Senate Blue Ash. But none of the stories found by The Post mentioned a sick employee at Senate Blue Ash.\n\nMoreau disputes Wright's characterization of her motives. Moreau said she has been in recovery from heroin addiction for almost six years, a constant self-monitoring process that includes a brutal honesty to \"keep my end of the street clean.\" Even though she tested negative, Moreau stayed away from work because she continued to have symptoms, during which time she collected unemployment for five weeks before starting a new job Tuesday at a hotel restaurant.\n\n\"I'm the last person that anybody would ever describe as a disgruntled worker. Work was my happy place. I loved my job,\" Moreau said.\n\n\"My customers are more important,\" Moreau added. \"If we had to close down, we all could have got unemployment. We didn't have to lie to the customers and put them at risk. That was wrong.\"\n\nEmily Heil contributed to this report.\n\nRead more on Voraciously:\n\nWelcome to the new buffet, which isn't a buffet anymore\n\nBon App\u00e9tit video stars leave the Test Kitchen series due to alleged racial discrimination\n\nWho makes the best tortilla chips?

        "body": "Acute flaccid myelitis, which may be caused by any of several viruses, is marked by sudden weakness or paralysis in the limbs. Since surveillance began in 2014, prevalence of the syndrome has spiked every two years in even-numbered years, often afflicting children about 5 years old.\n\nThe disease is very rare, but a quick response is critical once the weakness sets in; the disease can progress over hours or days and lead to permanent paralysis or respiratory failure, according to a report issued Tuesday by the CDC. Among 211 patients who were struck by the disease in 2018, 98 percent were hospitalized, 54 percent required intensive care and 23 percent were placed on ventilators to help them breathe.\n\nLimb weakness, difficulty walking and limb pain are often preceded by fever or respiratory illness, usually by about six days, the CDC said. Hundreds of U.S. children have been affected and many do not fully recover.\n\nA number of viruses -- including West Nile virus, adenovirus,and nonpolio enteroviruses -- are known to produce the symptoms in a small number of people, who become infected by those pathogens. Enterovirus, particularly one dubbed EV-D68, appears to be the most common cause.\n\nThomas Clark, deputy director of CDC's division of viral diseases, said the coronavirus pandemic may force doctors to evaluate patients by phone or telemedicine but warned they should not delay if they suspect the syndrome.\n\nIt's unclear whether mask wearing, social distancing and other measures that have been taken against the coronavirus will limit the outbreak of acute flaccid myelitis expected this year.",

    "First covid-19 reinfection documented in Hong Kong, researchers say": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "The study, by a team at the University of Hong Kong and accepted by the international medical journal Clinical Infectious Diseases on Monday, purports to be \"the world's first documentation\" of a patient who recovered from covid-19 subsequently being reinfected although he had no symptoms the second time suggesting he had some protection from the virus.\n\nThe case has potential implications for vaccine development, as well as policies based around the concept of herd immunity that presume those who recover from the virus are not likely to be reinfected. But some experts noted that it was also in line with what immunologists would expect.\n\n\"[T]his is a textbook example of how immunity should work,\" Akiko Iwasaki, an immunology expert at Yale University, tweeted on Monday.\n\nThe 33-year-old man, an unnamed IT worker from the city, was first hospitalized in late March after testing positive for covid-19. His symptoms included a fever and a cough.\n\nThe man was released from hospital in mid-April after testing negative for the virus and having no further symptoms. But after visiting Spain in August, he tested positive again upon returning to Hong Kong, despite appearing asymptomatic.\n\nPhysicians at first thought he might be a persistent carrier of the virus, the study's authors write, but they sequenced the genome of his first and second infection to show the virus strain was different, indicating he had been reinfected.\n\nIf the man's reinfection is confirmed, it may suggest that the level of immunity after an infection may be lower than many had hoped or it could simply indicate that immunity occurs on a spectrum and while the man had no signs of illness -- likely a sign of partial immune protection -- he did test positive.\n\n\"Many believe that recovered Covid-19 patients have immunity against re-infection because most developed a serum neutralizing antibody response,\" a news release announcing the study noted. \"However, there is evidence that some patients have waning antibody level after a few months.\"\n\nKwok-Yung Hyuen and other study authors suggested in their paper that their \"results suggest SARS-CoV-2 may continue to circulate among humans despite herd immunity,\" using the technical name of the novel coronavirus.\n\nThe study's authors conclude that herd immunity is unlikely to eliminate covid-19 on its own and that a potential covid-19 vaccine may not provide lifelong immunity to the disease.\n\nThey also recommend that even those who have recovered from the coronavirus should continue to comply with social distancing rules and other measures such as wearing a mask.\n\nIwasaki, the Yale expert, said that study's findings were \"no cause for alarm,\" noting that the second infection was asymptomatic implying that while immunity was not enough to block reinfection, it protected the person from disease.\n\nThe paper also found that the patient who had no detectable antibodies at the time of the second infection he developed antibodies afterward, Iwasaki wrote on Twitter. \"This is encouraging,\" she said.\n\nStudies that look at antibodies after a covid-19 infection have reached differing conclusions about the level of immunity that can be expected months later. Experts have noted with the common cold, another illness caused by a coronavirus, people are often reinfected each season.\n\nWhat may be important is understanding how widespread reinfection is and whether subsequent infections carry as many risks as the first infection, researchers say.",

    "Health-care workers are opening their mailboxes and finding their own portraits": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "While the perils of the pandemic have taken a universal toll, health-care workers have been facing the virus head-on.\n\nSteve Derrick was moved by the images they were posting and decided to document this critical period in history, while also thanking the front-line workers. He decided to paint them and send them the portraits to let them know that others do notice and care.\n\nAlthough Derrick, 54, works full time as a video game developer, he spends his spare time at an easel, stroking colors onto a canvas until he forms the exhausted faces of front-line workers around the world -- none of whom he's met in person.\n\nWhen the pandemic hit, Derrick was holed up at his home in Clifton Park, N.Y., restless and lonely. Though he continued to work remotely, he felt unmotivated and unhappy, he said, wishing there were more he could do to help heal the ailing world around him.\n\nIn early April, Derrick stumbled upon an Instagram account called @frontlinehealthheroes_ -- which chronicles the experiences of health-care workers during the pandemic, depicting their harrowing tales.\n\n\"I was completely moved by health-care workers and what they're dealing with,\" Derrick said, adding that reading their stories made his own pandemic-induced isolation feel inconsequential.\n\nAfter scrolling through the stories and images, Derrick settled on one -- an Italian health-care worker, whose goggles and mask had left prominent bruises on her face.\n\nHe gathered his tools -- palette, paintbrushes, acrylics and canvas -- and started painting. The finished piece embodies the fear, fatigue and strength he saw in the stranger's face.\n\nAfter completing his first painting, Derrick immediately moved on to the second, then the third, and the fourth. His pile of pandemic portraits quickly grew.\n\nHe started directly contacting medical workers he found on social media, asking whether he could paint their portraits and mail them the finished product, free of charge.\n\nThey enthusiastically accepted.\n\nDerrick contacted Meredith Borzotta, 42, a nurse in Philadelphia, who posted a powerful photo on Instagram on a particularly troubling day when she listened to a daughter say goodbye to her mother over the phone.\n\n\"Listening to the love in the daughter's voice was the most beautiful and heartbreaking experience. I could not hold back the tears,\" she wrote in the post. \"I silently promised that I would care for this woman as if she was my own mother. I am so sorry we can't save everyone. I am so sorry for the families left behind in the wake of this. I am so sorry that some people continue to believe that this is 'just a flu'. I am so sorry that I can't do more.\"\n\nBorzotta said she was humbled when Derrick contacted her and asked to re-create that moment -- and delighted when she finally received the painting, which she said was clearly made with immense care.\n\n\"He included every detail,\" Borzotta said. \"He even got the clip on my shirt.\"\n\nLeah White, 35, also received a painting.\n\n\"I was completely surprised when he contacted me,\" said White, who has been an intensive care nurse for nearly 13 years.\n\nAt the beginning of April, she traveled from Houston to work at a hospital in Brooklyn, where cases of the novel coronavirus were mounting.\n\n\"It was like nothing I had ever seen before,\" White said. \"They were so understaffed, and these patients were very, very sick.\"\n\nBut for White, Derrick's gift served as a light in an otherwise devastating time in her life.\n\n\"The portrait is beautiful,\" said White. \"I will always keep it close to my heart.\"\n\nEventually, the roles were reversed, and medical workers, their family members and even their patients began asking Derrick for portraits.\n\n\"I started getting requests from Italy, the U.K. and Spain,\" Derrick said. \"The interesting thing is, the requests followed the pandemic peaks. There were also a lot from New York, and now Texas, Arizona, Florida and Brazil.\"\n\nNuman Rashid, 43, a pulmonogist at Saratoga Hospital, in Saratoga Springs, N.Y., had heard about Derrick's paintings through his colleagues, some of whom had received portraits.\n\nWhen Derrick offered to paint Rashid, he was honored, he said.\n\n\"It was truly amazing,\" Rashid said. \"I gave it to my mom. It was a big deal for her to see a painting of her son.\"\n\nRebekah Maciorowski, 26, became one of Derrick's subjects, too.\n\nThe nurse from Denver tested positive for the novel coronavirus in early June after transferring to a New York hospital to work. Maciorowski, who developed the illness covid-19, said she still has a chronic cough and other residual symptoms of the virus.\n\nWhen she received her portrait from Derrick, \"there were tears,\" she said. \"It's the nicest thing anyone has ever done for me.\"\n\nOnce a professional artist, Derrick -- a father of four -- ultimately traded his passion for a more stable career many years ago, although he never gave up art. He dabbled in drawing as a hobby and typically did not show his work to others, he said.\n\nBut now, sharing his art with health-care workers has become his greatest source of joy.\n\nSince the end of April, Derrick has painted more than 120 portraits of health-care workers, with more than 200 left on his list.\n\nOther artists from around the world have also been using portraiture as a means of honoring essential workers.\n\nIn Britain, one artist started painting NHS [National Health Service] workers' portraits free, and hundreds of other artists began to do the same.\n\n\"At the beginning of lockdown, I felt rather disillusioned and couldn't see much point in doing my usual work,\" said Andrew Dibben, an artist based in England, who has completed nine paintings.\n\nA similar trend has emerged in Canada.\n\n\"A pair of local artists started #FrontlineFacesNL, and I thought what a great way to say thank you to these people,\" said Heather Coughlan, an artist in eastern Canada, who contributed to the initiative.\n\nWhile Derrick's goal is to honor health-care workers, his paintings have also brought perspective to others beyond the medical community, as his work is being showcased virtually at a gallery in Albany, N.Y.\n\nFor Derrick, forming a bond with front-line workers and understanding their experiences has been the most rewarding aspect of his portrait project.\n\n\"Their stories are just incredible,\" he said. \"Hearing them is what has kept me going.\"\n\nA TV reporter learned she had cancer after a viewer sent her a concerned email\n\nHe asked to play a piano at a store. His performance went viral, and the owner gave him his first piano.",

    "Here's how to get a haircut during the coronavirus pandemic, according to salons and health experts": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "And a few (including this writer) decided to just avoid mirrors like a contagious disease.\n\nBut now hair salons are operational in all but two states -- California and Hawaii -- with partial openings, according to hair expert website Behind The Chair, leaving the shaggier among us wondering: How safe is it to get a trim?\n\nAs the coronavirus, which causes the disease covid-19, is mostly transmitted via close contact, public health experts advise against prolonged time with people outside of your family, especially indoors. But epidemiologists say that proper protective equipment and other precautions can ensure the virus is not transmitted if you need to be near others.\n\nFor instance, mask wearing was credited by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for two cases where infected hair stylists did not pass on the coronavirus to their clients -- a promising sign for people harried about the risk of transmission.\n\nNancy Pelosi just entered history's salon of politically perilous haircuts and hairdos\n\nEven House Speaker Nancy Pelosi got her hair done at a salon in San Francisco. But when surveillance video released Monday revealed she went maskless after her shampoo and rinse, Pelosi was in hot water.\n\n\"I don't wear a mask when I'm washing my hair,\" Pelosi said in a press briefing to respond to the backlash, mainly from conservatives. \"Do you wear a mask when you're washing your hair? I always have a mask.\"\n\nPelosi taking her mask off is contradictory to best practices, according to Erin Bromage, a biology professor at the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth who authored a blog post that garnered millions of views about the coronavirus transmission risks associated with everyday activities.\n\nYou must wear a mask at all times when you are in the salon chair, Bromage said, adding that it's possible to hold your mask to your face while your hair is washed or cut.\n\n\"There are plenty of ways to do this but taking a mask off and being indoors for an extended period is the best way to become infected,\" he said.\n\nOut of 139 people that visited two Missouri stylists in May who later tested positive for the coronavirus, no one contracted covid-19 symptoms, according to a CDC study in July. The findings indicated that the city and businesses' masking policies worked effectively, the authors wrote.\n\nThe outbreak that didn't happen: Masks credited with preventing coronavirus spread inside Missouri hair salon\n\nBromage said his family resumed getting haircuts in early June, with the family going together to reduce the risk. Their hairdresser offers her services outdoors, but Bromage said he would trust being inside a salon if there are few people and doors and windows open for ventilation.\n\nFor people with underlying medical conditions, booking an early appointment is the safest bet that the surfaces are disinfected, Bromage recommended.\n\nLicensed stylists receive training in health safety and have regularly sanitized their equipment since before the pandemic, according to Steve Sleeper, executive director of the Professional Beauty Association, a trade group for salon owners. There are also oversight agencies that regulate these businesses in every state.\n\nSalons have ramped up purchasing more disinfectants and protective equipment. However, a majority of these businesses are independently owned, and another round of shutdowns could send them spiraling into greater financial peril, Sleeper said.\n\nAnother comfort is that salons report their clients are generally following masking rules because they typically know their stylist, Sleeper said, unlike other retail spaces like big box stores where customers might feel anonymous and confrontational.\n\nSleeper estimates that there are two small groups of people who are either \"die-hard\" customers back in the chair as soon as they could or people who refuse to step into a salon until there is a vaccine. But the majority, according to Sleeper, are in between those extremes: people who are reluctantly returning for fewer services or vacillating on whether to make an appointment.\n\n\"I know a lot of folks want to get back there and get their color touched up, get a good haircut, feel a little pampered,\" Sleeper said. \"They miss that human interaction. I think that's what makes our industry so unique. There's a strong human connection.\"\n\nNationwide, foot traffic to barbershops and hair salons has increased 6 percent, comparing the week of July 5 to the week of Aug. 16, according to aggregated and anonymized cellphone data tracked by Safegraph, a data firm that analyzes where people are traveling.\n\nThis data doesn't account for all devices -- only those with one of the apps that Safegraph uses to track GPS location. Since the data relies on GPS pings and official building footprints, it doesn't account for people who don't have phones or those who are visiting outdoor setups, bootleg salons or their stylists' homes, which has become increasingly common amid restrictions.\n\nDIY haircuts during the pandemic: Experts weigh in and offer tips\n\nCalifornia's foot traffic to barbershops and hair salons jumped by 28 percent from the week of March 22 -- the week after the statewide shutdown order -- to the week of July 5, according to Safegraph.\n\nIn Los Angeles, celebrity stylist and salon owner Ted Gibson unknowingly opened the embodiment of a socially distanced salon in 2019 with his co-owner Jason Backe. Their salon STARRING is a business designed to cater to celebrities and those seeking privacy.\n\nVisitors of the salon can use an app to book their appointment but also to select services and products and pay.\n\n\"It's just like a rideshare service,\" Gibson said. The styling chair is in a \"cloud,\" a 13-foot tall by 9-foot wide futuristic walled-off space complete with LED light strips that change from daylight to rainbow with a simple verbal command. The two entrances remain locked, and there is no receptionist, meaning that the only person a visitor interacts with is their stylist and colorist.\n\n\"We wanted to build the salon of the future,\" he said, \"and we ended up really building the salon of the future.\"\n\nSince reopening at 25 percent capacity in August in defiance of Gov. Galvin Newsom's order to close salons, Gibson said he's added steps to keep himself and his clients safe: Visitors now get temperature checked and a squirt of hand sanitizer with their hot towel. If they don't have a face covering -- or the mask's straps go around their head instead of looping behind their ears -- Gibson offers one.\n\n\"We're in a predicament where do we save our small business or do we follow the guidelines about salons being open,\" he said.\n\nAmbushed Salon in Gahanna, Ohio, was booked eight weeks in advance before the virus closed businesses in the state, owner Amy Bush said. When she reopened in mid-May, Bush said appointments were filled immediately, and the steady stream of clients has continued to visit.\n\nIn addition to a \"no mask, no service\" policy, her salon asks screening questions, requests that clients wash their hands when they enter and no longer uses hand blow dryers.\n\nFor guests returning to salons, Bush recommends checking with the stylists to see if any policies have changed instead of assuming normalcy as guidelines continue to evolve during the pandemic. She also said that people who want additional treatments aside from a cut should make sure their salons still offer those services.\n\nIt's also courteous to give your hairdresser a heads up instead of walking in due to capacity restrictions, said Susan Brinkhaus, executive director of the Salon and Spa Professional Association in Minneapolis.\n\n\"Lastly, be patient with the stylist and staff,\" Bush said, \"and know that everyone is doing their best to take care of you because they do care and want to see you enjoy your visit and have that place where you can relax.\"",

The city, which has 7.5 million people, has conducted over 1.2 million coronavirus tests so far.\n\nA new surge in infections which started in July has more than tripled the number of cases in the city to 4,632.\n\nBusinesses such as beauty salons and bars have been temporarily shuttered and there is a ban on dine-in services after 6 p.m. as part of social distancing measures. The city's economy contracted 9% in the second quarter of this year, marking a full year of recession due to last year's anti-government protests and the pandemic.\n\nLam said the testing was possible because of support from Beijing, which is providing resources such as laboratory staff to boost testing capacity in the semi-autonomous Chinese city.\n\nThe city's government has faced pushback from skeptical residents and critics who are worried about privacy issues, given that the program is supported by the Chinese Communist Party. Some fear the tests will be used to produce DNA records of residents.\n\nCriticism of the mainland government has grown since it imposed a new national security law in Hong Kong which has been viewed as an attack on the \"one country, two systems\" framework under which the city has been governed since its return to China in 1997.\n\nLam brushed aside such concerns, saying that no matter what the government does, there will always be people who come up with conspiracy theories.\n\nDr. Gagandeep Kang, an infectious diseases expert at the Christian Medical College in Vellore in southern India, said universal testing can help wipe the virus out provided that those who test positive are immediately isolated and frequent retesting is conducted to ensure that the tests do not miss people who fall sick later.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Aniruddha Ghosal in New Delhi contributed to this report.\n\nCopyright 2020 The Associated Press.

Both said they feel terrible their alma mater isn't playing this fall and understand the outrage the Big Ten's decision has caused in this state of 1.8 million.\n\nMidland's league, the Great Plains Athletic Conference, announced July 21 it would attempt a football season starting Sept. 12. The NAIA is allowing each team to play nine games, two fewer than usual, but playoffs won't be held until spring.\n\nGillespie said Midland is following GPAC protocols and local health department guidelines to mitigate the COVID-19 risk.\n\n\"There doesn't seem to be any consensus nationally on what the right thing to do is (as far as playing), and you can get a lot of different opinions on that,\" Gillespie said. \"It's not completely safe, and we're never going to make it completely safe. We're trying to make it as safe as possible and take an abundance of caution wherever we need to and can.\"\n\nMidland football players are required to wear masks indoors. Outdoors, they need to social distance as much as possible when not participating in a drill and use hand sanitizer frequently.\n\nPlexiglass barriers have been installed in the cafeteria and other areas of the athletic facilities. Players shower at their residences instead of in the locker room. There are temperature checks and screening questions every day. Lunches are prepared for takeout. For meals eaten in the cafeteria, players sit 6 feet apart.\n\nThe challenge of maintaining the quasi-bubble increases with school starting Thursday. Midland will hold in-person and online classes.\n\nGillespie said coronavirus testing is done if an athlete shows symptoms. He said there had been a \"handful\" of positive tests among more than 200 fall athletes. Jamrog said one football player has opted out because of COVID-19 concerns.\n\nBlum said he and his teammates are grateful to have a fall season to look forward to even if it comes with some minor inconveniences. Only 145 of 765 teams in the NAIA and across three divisions of the NCAA are scheduled to play at least one game this fall (19%). Another 57 junior colleges have moved their seasons to the spring.\n\n\"I know there are hundreds of thousands of people across the country not getting to play,\" he said. \"That's been a motto for us this year starting out: Every day is a blessing to be able to play.\"\n\nThe Warriors enters the season with momentum. They won six straight to end 2019 and are picked third in the GPAC.\n\n\"If we got shut down,\" Blum said, \"everybody would have been heartbroken.\"\n\nJamrog, beginning his fifth year at Midland, said he would love it if football-starved Huskers fans wanted to adopt his Warriors as their team for 2020 when they kick off 50 miles from Memorial Stadium. More than 100 of his 150 players are from Nebraska. And in a kidding-not-kidding comment, he invited ESPN's College GameDay show to visit Fremont.\n\nHeedum Field will be limited to 75% capacity. Midland drew about 1,200 fans per game at the 5,000-seat stadium in 2019, meaning there should be plenty of room.\n\n\"Hey, Nebraska fans, you guys come out and support us,\" tight end Austin Harris said. \"We're going to be playing ball this fall.\"\n\n___\n\nMore AP sports: https://apnews.com/apf-sports and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\nCopyright 2020 The Associated Press.

    "In a divided Capitol, lawmakers can't agree on coronavirus safety measures  --  down to the best kind of thermometer": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "Other safety issues have been punted to the Office of Attending Physician of Congress, run by a reclusive doctor who is only accountable to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.). That has meant health and safety guidance that often differs depending on location, with masks mandatory on the House floor and only recommended for the Senate.\n\nCongressional leaders can't even agree on what type of thermometer to use to monitor lawmakers and aides for coronavirus symptoms: Many businesses and doctor's offices use a touchless forehead model, but some lawmakers say they're not accurate enough, meaning that only oral or ear thermometers are used sporadically in the complex.\n\nAlmost five months after the pandemic landed in the Capitol, lawmakers remain divided and in a sense of limbo over coronavirus safety measures -- worrying about an outbreak within their own ranks or among their staff. In the past week alone, three lawmakers announced positive tests for the coronavirus, including Rep. Rodney Davis (Ill.), the top Republican on the House Administration Committee.\n\nOn Thursday, House Majority Leader Steny H. Hoyer (D-Md.), bucking Pelosi, stepped out to formally endorse a widespread testing of everyone working on the campus.\n\nThe internal debate has turned into an upside-down version of what is happening with the partisan fights over coronavirus testing on the national stage. Republicans -- who have been hesitant to challenge the Trump administration's unwillingness to adopt a national testing strategy -- have pushed for a comprehensive strategy inside the Capitol.\n\n\"I'm sure we could implement it on the Senate side and we've got tentative plans that would allow us to do that, assuming they all work out, and I hope the House would be able to have a similar plan,\" Sen. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.), chairman of the Senate Rules Committee, told reporters.\n\nDemocrats, who have embraced Pelosi's \"testing, tracing and treatment\" mantra for a national strategy to fight the virus, say such an approach won't work for the Capitol. Pelosi and Democrats have advocated continuing social distancing measures that include requiring thousands of staff to work from home and allowing lawmakers to participate by video at committee hearings and also voting remotely.\n\nPelosi has dismissed the idea of an expansive testing program in Congress as impractical because there are so many support staff who should also be tested.\n\n\"You think of members of Congress -- oh, there are 535 -- no. There are about 20,000 people who make the Capitol run,\" Pelosi told reporters last week.\n\nShe also acknowledged that there is a concern about the image of members of Congress getting tested while much of the nation continues to face delays in getting test results.\n\nAcrimony spikes on Capitol Hill amid negotiation for virus relief\n\n\"There are many people in the country who should be tested, should have access, in order to quantify the problem, but also to trace and to treat so that people don't die. And I don't think it's a good idea for members of the Congress to say we should have it,\" Pelosi said.\n\nUltimately, she placed the decision on the shoulders of Brian P. Monahan, a cancer specialist who has led the attending physician's office since 2009. \"As far as I'm concerned, it's up to the Capitol physician,\" she said.\n\nAn aide to Monahan said Thursday that he does not answer any questions from the media on any topic, including his current health and safety advice for those who work in the building.\n\nWhen some House members asked to use their office funds to purchase touchless thermometers to test their staffs, House officials told them those were not reliable and they should instead purchase under-the-tongue or ear-canal thermometers.\n\n\"We asked the Attending Physician whether contactless thermometers should be purchased for use in the House and he said no. As with the other COVID related health measures, we implemented his guidance,\" Rep. Zoe Lofgren (D-Calif.), chair of the House Administration Committee, said in a statement.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.), along with Davis, disagree with Pelosi and Loefgren's assertions that wider-scale testing would not be effective because the model used at the White House has been shown to produce false-negative tests.\n\nRepublicans note that the only reason Rep. Louie Gohmert (R-Tex.) tested positive and is now quarantining is because he was supposed to travel with President Trump on Air Force One. Similarly, Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine (R) announced Thursday he has the virus after taking a required test because he was supposed to meet Trump in his state.\n\nAt least one company, One Medical Group, has offered to provide testing services on Capitol grounds, according to two people familiar with the discussion. The company ran a mass outdoor testing site in New York City at the height of the pandemic there and has similar setups in the Washington area.\n\nStay safe and informed with our free Coronavirus Updates newsletter\n\nRepublicans have argued that, as long as the public is forbidden from visiting Congress, large areas of the U.S. Capitol Visitor Center would be well suited as testing sites.\n\n\"We have space for it,\" Blunt said in an interview, suggesting it could be implemented on the Senate side by the end of the month.\n\nEarlier this year, the Trump administration offered three rapid-testing machines and 1,000 cartridges required for the test, according to Democrats and Republicans.\n\nDemocrats dismissed that as only enough capacity for about two days. And some worry that a widespread testing plan would just prompt lawmakers to bring more staff back into office buildings, creating more potential spread and requiring even more testing and building more logistical hurdles.\n\nLawmakers say their initial mitigation steps helped avert a full-blown outbreak inside the Capitol, which began with staggered roll call votes so that few lawmakers would be on the House or Senate floor at the same time. A vast majority of staffers now work from home.\n\nMasks were encouraged and, on the Senate side, became nearly universal. Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) is perhaps the only senator or staffer who never wears a mask because he contracted the coronavirus in the spring and claims he has immunity, though medical experts caution that is far from certain.\n\nAfter last week's announcement that Gohmert had the coronavirus, Pelosi ordered masks to be mandatory because Gohmert has been among the two dozen or so House Republicans who have regularly eschewed face coverings.\n\nConfusion is the best description for what comes next in terms of trying to get better practices into the Capitol. As the virus surged this summer across the South and West, lawmakers began to express concern about the lack of testing.\n\nUnder current policy, staff are not granted tests, and some who felt like they had come in close contact with Gohmert, or aides working for him, were turned away and told to go the public testing site at the Capital One Arena in downtown Washington, according to Republicans.\n\nSome rank-and-file lawmakers suggest Congress has been lucky to avoid an outbreak such as those plaguing some U.S. sports teams that have tried to restart operations.\n\nThe House and Senate are now adjourned from legislative session, sending hundreds of lawmakers home to pandemic hot spots such as California, Texas, Florida and Georgia, while Pelosi, McConnell and the administration continue to negotiate another coronavirus relief package.\n\nIf they reach a deal, close to 500 lawmakers will return to the Capitol, flying in from across the nation, with few ever being tested for the virus.\n\nDavis cited his own experience in a national TV appearance Thursday, explaining that a small spike in his daily temperature checks prompted him to get his test while back home in Illinois. Without that test, he might have infected his family and constituents and, if he had been in Washington, plenty of staff in the Capitol hallways, he said.\n\n\"It's not just about us members of Congress. It's about the staff, the essential workers that are there on Capitol Hill even when we're not there,\" Davis said on CNN.",

    "In college towns and neighborhoods, permanent residents brace for students' return": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "\"We have three highly compromised people in my house,\" Dollymore said. \"Where am I supposed to go to the grocery store?\"\n\nAlthough most -- and in many cases, all -- of their classes will be held online, students at District-area universities are still flocking to neighborhoods in and around the city, stoking fears -- and questions -- of permanent residents who are anxious about young people spreading the novel coronavirus.\n\n\"They're already drinking, maskless, downtown. No one cares,\" Dollymore said.\n\nWhen Asher Price, 21, and his roommates signed their leases two months ago for a pale yellow townhouse near George Washington University, they expected to take some of their classes on campus. Since then, the university has retracted parts of its reopening plan and will conduct the fall semester online.\n\n\"In our minds, it's either go home and pay rent for a year in a place we don't live in or, at least, live in D.C. and follow the guidelines,\" said Price, who is from Houston. He also moved near the university before D.C. Mayor Muriel E. Bowser imposed travel restrictions that require travelers from coronavirus hot spots, including Texas, to self-quarantine for two weeks.\n\nMonitoring the actions of young people in college towns will require collaboration between universities, local officials and law enforcement, said state Sen. Jim Rosapepe (D), whose district includes College Park.\n\n\"Our residential campus is a lot like a cruise ship on land. A high concentration of people who like to socialize,\" Rosapepe said. \"Before the pandemic, if you live in College Park, you see a good bit of not-very-responsible behavior, and so I think people are concerned about whether the students who come back, as opposed to those who don't come back, will be on their best behavior.\"\n\nLocal leaders near Georgetown University hope a compact that asks students to agree to follow public health guidelines -- including logging symptoms on a daily basis, practicing good hygiene and participating in coronavirus testing required by the university -- will quash any tension between students and residents. The university is providing free tests to students and employees who live or work on or near the campus.\n\n\"I really do believe the relationship between Georgetown students living in the neighborhood and the residents is very good,\" said Rick Murphy, chairperson of the Advisory Neighborhood Commission that represents neighborhoods surrounding Georgetown's campus. \"My expectation is that the group homes we've already leased for the academic year will be occupied.\"\n\nAbout 175 houses around the university are typically leased to students and house as many as six people at a time, Murphy said.\n\nDisputes between residents and students are rare, said James Moorman, 82, a Georgetown resident of 35 years. He ended a Sunday afternoon walk through the historic neighborhood by tugging at some weeds in his front yard.\n\nMoorman said he's not concerned for himself -- he's been socially distant and stays away from nearby restaurants on Georgetown's crowded main street -- but the presence of the virus makes him concerned for the students.\n\n\"They're going to come from all different places. It would be hard to imagine if nobody came back that had an infection at all,\" Moorman said about the students. \"And, of course, periodically the students go home or go places, and I see it as a problem of how you manage that. How do you make sure that your student body is safe from that one or two persons who comes back and is infected and may not even know himself or herself?\"\n\nIn College Park, residents have reservations.\n\n\"I have as much faith in them as I had in myself between 17 and 21,\" Aaron Springer, who has lived in College Park since 2001, said about students. He's already noticed some students, mostly athletes, around the city. The first day of classes is Aug. 31.\n\nThe 51-year-old arts educator admitted he's \"less comfortable\" with going to the grocery store. Not just because his neighbors are part of a group that tends to have mild, if any, symptoms upon contracting the coronavirus and are likely to pass the virus to older adults, but also because there will be more people in his neighborhood in general.\n\n\"There are more vectors that I could be exposed to,\" Springer said. \"I'm just concerned that people need to be adequately tested, people need to be adequately wearing masks and social distancing.\"\n\nOfficials at the university are requiring students and employees returning to College Park -- or any of the other 11 institutions within the University System of Maryland -- to get tested for the coronavirus within two weeks before arriving to campus. And people who live and work on campuses are being asked to monitor their symptoms daily.\n\nTo limit the number of people in the city, Patrick L. Wojahn, mayor of College Park, is asking property owners and landlords to allow students to break their leases.\n\n\"I know that landlords themselves are going through difficult and challenging times right now, but I hope they will consider this as a matter of safety and the health of our community,\" Wojahn said.\n\nMore than 20,000 U-Md. students typically live on and around campus, but that number will be much smaller this fall, Wojahn said. The university housed about 40 percent of its undergraduates -- more than 11,000 people -- on campus last fall, university data show. That number will be cut roughly in half this semester, Wojahn said. About 80 percent of classes this semester will be conducted online, and the university has limited on-campus housing.\n\nWhile residents worry too many students will crowd their neighborhoods, businesses that operate near schools are concerned there won't be enough. In Tenleytown, a D.C. neighborhood that attracts students and employees from American University, restaurants and coffee shops have been suffering since the onset of the pandemic.\n\n\"The absence of that student population, the faculty population is definitely going to be felt by our businesses,\" said Leigh Catherine Miles, executive director of Tenleytown Main Street, a nonprofit that works with neighborhood businesses. Miles added that businesses typically see an uptick in sales toward the end of August, when roughly 14,000 undergraduate, graduate and law students make their way back to school.\n\nArea businesses, like Seoulspice, partner with AU and accept electronic payments from students' university accounts. Last year those payments accounted for about 5 percent of the fast-casual Korean restaurant's Tenleytown sales, said Danielle Wilt, vice president of Seoulspice.\n\n\"So we're just expecting that to not be there at all,\" Wilt said.\n\nJoseph Oh, owner of Coffee Nature, said he saw sales decline in March, when AU shuttered and the D.C. government started issuing stay-at-home guidance.\n\n\"I'm not sure if I'll get the customers back to 100 percent by the fall because of covid,\" said Oh, who has been in Tenleytown for about eight years. \"All the students, most are staying at their homes, and they're not coming back.\"\n\nBut college students add more to their communities than their dollars, said Amy Patronella, a rising senior and former resident adviser at GW.\n\n\"Many of my fellow college students babysit and pet sit for people in D.C., work in D.C. restaurants and stores or are part of D.C. social groups and athletic leagues,\" said Patronella, who recently lost her on-campus housing after GW paused the resident adviser program. \"And some even run for local office.\"\n\nPatronella, who lives in Houston, said she's looking for new housing in D.C. Her life is in the District, she said, and she plans to stay after she graduates with a degree in political communication in December.\n\nBut she also understands the risk she could pose to the community and will have to self-quarantine for 14 days under the recent city order.\n\n\"While I've been following social distancing guidelines in Houston, I understand traveling by air and coming from a hot spot for covid-19 cases necessitates a self-quarantine,\" she said. \"It's a minor inconvenience in the grand scheme of things, and I would want others to follow the same guidelines if I were in the other position.\"\n\nPatronella said there's \"some truth\" in images that depict young people as willing to shirk public health guidelines. But the people she knows are more concerned about escaping unsafe situations at home or returning to the connections they've forged in the District.\n\nFor Price, it was important he not only finish his lease, but his senior year at GW, in the city.\n\n\"We don't go to parties. We don't usually congregate in groups above eight at any given time,\" Price said. \"We're still very mindful of all the precautions.\"",

    "In the pandemic, we had to move to our new home. This is how we did it.": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "I can't say how many times I washed my hands while five mostly masked men huffed and puffed past me carrying out my sofa, bed, table, chairs, nightstands, dressers, and boxes upon boxes of books, dishes, pots and pans.\n\nEvery time I touched a doorknob or a surface that one of the movers might have breathed or coughed on, I lathered up for two rounds of Happy Birthday. Three hours into the nine-hour move, the skin on my hands stung, and I felt newfound sympathy for germaphobe Howard Hughes, or at least Leonardo DiCaprio's depiction of him in \"The Aviator,\" scrubbing his hands until they bled.\n\nBefore the move, I talked to public health experts to design as fail-safe a plan as possible.\n\n\"We have to evolve to understanding we're living with this virus,\" said Kirsten \u00adBibbins-Domingo, chair of the department of epidemiology and biostatistics at the University of California at San Francisco. \"We're in this for the long haul. You're going to have to move.\"\n\nAlthough I had to move despite the novel coronavirus, millions of Americans relocated this year because of it, a Pew Research Center survey found. They moved out of housing they could no longer afford, out of areas they perceived as dangerous and out of abruptly closed college dormitories.\n\nPacking up and moving themselves might be the safest course, especially for strong, fit \u00ad20-somethings, said Megan Ranney, associate professor of emergency medicine and public health at Brown University.\n\n\"Life goes on, even during this crazy period,\" she said. \"It becomes a question of weighing risks and benefits. In some ways, doing it yourself is potentially safer.\"\n\nOn the other hand, as an emergency physician, she regularly cares for patients after they drop a couch on their foot or throw out their back hoisting a brick-heavy carton.\n\nMy husband and I concluded that -- given my meager strength, his diminished muscularity since gyms closed here three months before and our advancing ages -- we'd be more likely to stay out of the hospital if we hired movers to transport our belongings.\n\nPlus, we have an upright piano.\n\nRanney and Bibbins-Domingo said that with movers, the best defense against the coronavirus is the same arsenal of \u00advirus-resistance tools as those public health officials tout for a trip to the grocery -- face coverings, physical distance and good hygiene.\n\nAnd you want to hire movers taking the utmost precautions.\n\n\"The most important thing you're doing is to make sure the people who are helping you move have the lowest risk of having the virus,\" Bibbins-Domingo said. \"The emphasis should be on making sure it doesn't enter your house to begin with.\"\n\nVia FaceTime, I grilled the estimator about coronavirus safety measures his moving company was taking. None of the company's 20 movers had been sick, he said. Everyone who came to my house would wear a face covering, would have his temperature taken that morning and would have access to unlimited hand sanitizer.\n\nWhat about gloves?\n\nThe movers found it difficult to grip furniture while wearing gloves, and they were more likely to cross contaminate surfaces in gloves than if they regularly washed their hands and applied sanitizer, he said.\n\nBibbins-Domingo stressed the value of testing essential workers, like movers, for covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus.\n\nI asked the estimator whether the movers had been tested. Although they had access to free covid-19 testing through the local public health department, none had been tested. Regrettably, I saw it as unlikely that I'd find a company that was having their workers tested and could move me in time.\n\nEven if the movers had all been tested, the possibility remained that one of them, or I, could be carrying the virus and remained presymptomatic or asymptomatic.\n\n\"The best practice is to go through the world as if everybody has covid, including yourself, because you just don't know,\" Ranney said.\n\n\"I think we have to acknowledge that a significant proportion of coronavirus is in asymptomatic people,\" Bibbins-Domingo said.\n\nWhile researchers are still waiting for a gold-standard study of asymptomatic transmission, a June review of the research in the Annals of Internal Medicine suggests that as many as 45 percent of people with covid-19 infections have no symptoms and can transmit the virus to others for possibly two weeks or longer.\n\nMy husband and I assumed that we could be carrying the virus and strapped on our Army green cloth masks as soon as we heard the moving trucks pull into our driveway. By then I had opened every window in both the old and the new house in an effort to keep the air flowing and to flush out any virus-laden particles that we, or the movers, might shed.\n\nIn addition, at the suggestion of my cousin who moved the same week, I designated one bathroom at both houses for the movers to use exclusively.\n\nFlushing the toilet can lift the virus up from the bowl, a June study found. For those who have only one bathroom, insisting upon closing the toilet seat before the movers flush could help contain the problem.\n\nI felt grateful that I could direct the moving men to a bathroom I did not need to use, in part because I felt no control over most everything else.\n\nWhen the movers arrived, only one of the five was masked. They did all put on face coverings before entering my house. But most wore them as chin guards while grunting and groaning and pushing the 500-pound piano up three flights of outside steps.\n\nOne of the movers had a persistent peek-a-boo problem. Every time he looked down, the blue fabric fell below his nose. I lightheartedly mentioned the malfunction to the supervisor, who said he would try to find another mask. But he never did.\n\nAt the urging of Rochelle Ereman, an epidemiologist for Marin County, where I live, I packed absolutely everything before the movers arrived. I also packed suitcases with clothes and bedding for three days and transported them and enough kitchen items for a few days to the new place in my car.\n\nThere was no good science for waiting 72 hours before taking clothes out of my dresser or sleeping on my bed. It was likely overkill. But nobody ends up on a ventilator because of overkill.\n\nThe first night in our new house, my exhausted husband and I looked longingly at our unmade bed.

        "body": "Marmer taught herself to play the guitar at a young age and fell into music wholeheartedly. She had \"very good ears to music and had taught herself guitar because she wanted to be able to play Bonnie Raitt songs,\" said Ira McDonald, a former bandmate.\n\nMarmer died June 30 of covid-19. She was 64. Her family suspects she contracted the novel coronavirus during a hospital visit for an unrelated health issue earlier that month.\n\n\"She never developed significant symptoms,\" said her brother, Dennis Marmer.\n\nMarmer was a lawyer by trade and a musician for fun. Born and raised in Silver Spring, Md., Marmer was the youngest of four children. Her father worked at the Treasury Department, and her mother stayed at home to raise her and her older siblings, Dennis, Richard and Kathie.\n\nDennis Marmer described his sister as someone unafraid to speak her mind.\n\n\"We knew that she was going to be a piece of work when she was a sophomore at Montgomery College,\" Dennis Marmer said. \"All of 19 years old, she went to a county council meeting and just wore out a county executive about some issue.\"\n\nMarmer attended Montgomery College and then transferred to the University of Maryland where she studied political science. It was around this time that she started playing in a band, later called the Semantix, covering Bonnie Raitt, Joni Mitchell, Linda Ronstadt and others.\n\n\"We were an adamantly nonprofit operation. We played for our own fun,\" said James Wheeler, a friend, and bandmate, who said he and Marmer spent long hours playing music in his basement. \"I think the band was her social life -- it was kind of mine too.\"\n\nA college newspaper article from 1974 that reported on her band said Marmer's musical performance \"struck an emotional chord in the audience. Nearly everyone listened in appreciative silence and applauded each song enthusiastically.\"\n\nAlthough her siblings describe her as \"prickly\" her bandmates saw Marmer's vulnerable side.\n\n\"She was a really very sensitive person -- a really empathic person and that came out in her interpretation of songs that were tear-jerker songs,\" McDonald said.\n\nAfter college, Marmer attended Georgetown Law School and started her own practice in the late 1990s called Abstract Solutions Inc., where she focused on real estate law.\n\n\"She could be prickly at times, but she was also incredibly generous,\" Lee said. \"There were times during my life where I went through some rough patches. She was always there for me.\"\n\nLee said Marmer would give generously to the homeless and had a habit of taking in stray cats.\n\n\"She was a complete cat nut. She would adopt any stray cat that came along,\" said Lee.\n\nMarmer never married and eventually gave up her law practice to care for her ailing mother and later, her brother. Friends and family recall her as an independent spirit who had a way of making you feel like you had known her for years.\n\n\"We were just so linked,\" Lee said. \"It's like my best friend is gone.\"",

        "body": "RIO DE JANEIRO -- Two men were going to the hospital, unsure of whether they'd return. It was April, when Brazil's worst fears about the novel coronavirus were beginning to be realized. The disease had started to kill all over the country. Now it had come for them, too.\n\nThe coronavirus has played a game of Roulette across the world: Who lives? Who dies? In most countries, a familiar set of variables -- age, sex, preexisting conditions -- has helped make at least some sense of the confounding disease. But in Brazil, one of the most unequal countries in the world, another crucial deciding factor has been class. The poor are dying at a much higher rate than the wealthy.\n\nIn Rio de Janeiro, the rich and poor live on top of each other. Hillside favelas tumble down to oceanfront condominiums. Maids sleep in the homes of their employers. People of all classes come together at the beach. But despite the proximity and intimacy between the classes, two people who are the same in every other way -- age, sex, health, city -- can end up having completely different experiences with the virus.\n\nOne goes into the private health system, which can rival any in the developed world. The other heads into the public health system, where shortages in equipment and personnel can mean the difference between life and death.\n\nThe story of the two systems -- and two Brazils -- was the story of Lemos and Guedes. They were roughly the same age: Lemos is 37, Guedes, 38. They lived in neighboring communities in Rio de Janeiro. They grew into adulthood in a Brazil that was ascendant, where a better life was there for the taking. Each of them had seized it, rising above the conditions into which they were born.\n\nBut there were key differences.\n\nLemos has private health insurance. Guedes doesn't.\n\n[Brazil ignored the warnings. Now, while other countries fret over a second coronavirus wave, it can't get past its first.]\n\nLemos, a physician, lives in the wealthy community of Barra da Tijuca, where President Jair Bolsonaro also maintains his home residence. Guedes has spent his life in nearby Rocinha, the largest favela in Brazil, where he owns an optical shop.\n\nWhen the virus came to Rio, their lives collapsed around a shared experience: Each man in the prime of his life, neither with preexisting conditions, being taken to the hospital as his lungs failed.\n\nOne entered the private medical system. The other, the public system. And from there, their lives diverged, once more.\n\nMonths into the world's second-worst outbreak, the coronavirus has become one more metric to measure inequality in Brazil. The coronavirus has reached 98 percent of cities and infected more than 3 million people. On Saturday, officially recorded deaths passed 100,000.\n\nBut the destruction has not been distributed equally. Among intensive care patients, people without education have been three times more likely to die than those with college degrees, researchers found. The rate of transmission has been three times greater in poor neighborhoods than wealthy ones. Black patients are at greater risk than Whites.\n\n[As coronavirus kills indigenous people in the Amazon, Brazil's government goes missing]\n\nWhen explaining these discrepancies, researchers have pointed to differences in health and living conditions. The poor tend to live in dense slums, grapple with more infectious diseases and die a decade earlier, on average, than the wealthy. But others have highlighted the failures in the public health-care system.\n\nThat system has been hailed as a marvel in the developing world, serving more than 150 million Brazilians. But despite its size and resources, it has failed to keep pace with the coronavirus. As its hospitals reached capacity, the mortality rate among intensive-care coronavirus patients exceeded 50 percent, according to the Brazilian Society of Intensive Care. In the private system, the rate was 29 percent.\n\nProblems that plagued it before the pandemic -- inefficiency, corruption and insufficient capacity -- have been magnified during it. Disorganization and bureaucracy have left the health ministry unable to spend the money it's had on hand. Even as the virus maimed the country, the ministry deployed only a third of its coronavirus budget.\n\n\"The Brazilian health ministry never prepared itself,\" said Miguel Nicolelis, a prominent physician and scientist tracking the outbreak here. \"By the time it hit Brazil, it didn't have enough professional equipment, masks and -- to our surprise and shock -- enough basic medicine.\"\n\nThe fallout has been particularly acute in Rio de Janeiro, where plans to expand the public system were undone by incompetence and corruption, the line of coronavirus patients awaiting treatment reached nearly 1,000 people -- and where Rodrigo Guedes was returning home one day when he started to cough.\n\nGrowing up, Guedes thought little about class. He was poor, that much was clear. Living at the top of Rocinha, with its view of the luxury buildings far below, he had a sharp understanding of what he had and what he didn't.\n\nHe says he never begrudged the wealthy, not when he saw those buildings, nor when he washed their cars or sold them snacks. Everything he'd ever wanted -- his family, an open view of sea and mountains -- was in the favela, and he swore he'd never leave.\n\n[Video and photos show Brazil's Bolsonaro defied health guidelines before testing positive for the coronavirus -- and after]\n\nEven after gangs seized control, and the police started killing more people, it remained home, where he and his wife, Jailma, wanted to raise their daughter and open a small shop selling eyeglasses.\n\nHe never anticipated the coronavirus. Or that everything about Rocinha -- its poorly ventilated passageways, its unreliable water system, its residents who had to keep working to survive -- would make it an explosive breeding ground. One-fourth of its residents would contract the disease.\n\nThe first symptom was a cough. Then body pain, fever and exhaustion. He went to a clinic, but the doctor said it was nothing and sent him home. Jailma couldn't believe it. She was watching this heavily muscled man wither to nothing. He could barely stand beneath the shower head long enough to get wet. She made him go to another clinician, who said it wasn't nothing -- it was covid-19. His lungs had been chewed up by the disease.\n\nThe public hospital was overrun with patients. \"It's going to be okay,\" Jailma said, but Guedes wasn't sure. For one of the first times in his life, he says, he experienced a pang of class envy. He no longer felt like the upwardly mobile businessman, but once more the poor kid selling snacks on the beach, invisible to everyone.\n\nTiago Lemos strode through a private hospital in west Rio, feeling uncertain. He'd spent weeks reading medical journals and health guidelines. He'd worked the H1N1 pandemic. He felt ready.\n\nBut this disease was unlike any he'd known. How subtly it took hold, how suddenly it killed, how unpredictable its selection of victims.\n\nLemos did everything he could to protect himself, but he believed infection was inevitable. Still, the odds were on his side -- he was young and healthy -- and when it did come, he felt almost relieved. He could get it out of the way and get on with his life. But when his cough didn't improve, and he didn't bounce back, he realized how foolish he had been.\n\n\"Never so wrong in my life,\" he said.\n\n[In Brazil, a dying man and a desperate search for an open bed]\n\nHe'd always believed in the cool application of logic and reason. The son of a small-business owner and civil servant, he'd grown up middle class, playing beach soccer with the children of doormen and janitors. He rose above his station by using his intellect to think through complex problems. But this was one he couldn't figure out.\n\nBut he understood the coronavirus in a way she didn't. His insurance plan was one of the most comprehensive in Brazil, and it would help him get the best care available. But it might not be enough. He thought of a family he knew, all infected. The parents had gone into the private system, where he treated them. The son went into the public system. All had died.\n\nGuedes couldn't bring himself to tell Jailma everything. He'd seen her desperation when they arrived at the emergency health clinic CER Leblon. No one came to check on him. She had to fetch his wheelchair herself. She began to shout: \"My husband can't breathe, and no one is helping us!\"\n\nThe center was in disarray. Health inspectors found it had no pandemic contingency plan. No surgical masks for patients. Insufficient gloves, masks and disinfectant. The Rio de Janeiro Nursing Council said it had de-prioritized the care of patients to protect its staff.\n\n\"Nobody believed the potential of the virus,\" said Ana Teresa Ferreira de Souza, a contributor to the report. \"Isolation wasn't happening.\"\n\nHealth officials who oversee the clinic say equipment shortages have hobbled medical systems everywhere. Brazil was \"an example of what has happened all over the world,\" they said in a statement.\n\n[Limits on coronavirus testing in Brazil are hiding the true dimensions of Latin America's largest outbreak]\n\nThere were no beds for Guedes, so he was rolled into a hallway. It was filled with patients, all struggling for breath. There was only one oxygen catheter, so they took turns: One person would breathe for a minute or two, then pass it on. Nine hours passed that way -- five minutes of oxygen every half-hour -- before he was taken upstairs to a room stuffed with patients.\n\nHe reached for the oxygen catheter beneath his bed and found it was broken.\n\n\"I'm fighting for my life,\" he messaged Jailma.\n\nJailma, pacing back home, hounded the hospital with phone calls. She was told his condition had deteriorated. That night would decide whether he lived or died.\n\nLemos thought it might have been easier if he weren't a physician. He wouldn't have known how quickly he was failing. Next would come intubation, then the ventilator and a plummeting chance of survival.\n\nAnxious in his private room at CopaStar -- which compares itself in promotional materials to a five-star hotel -- he placed video calls to Juliana and his doctors. They almost always answered.\n\nHis lead physician, Rafael Pottes, hoped to envelop him in \"multi-professional treatment.\" The hospital administered a battery of medications -- corticoid, azithromycin, chloroquine -- and physical therapies, and checked on him frequently.\n\n[Coronavirus collides with Latin America's maid culture -- with sometimes deadly results]\n\nPottes knew one of the most important components in treatment of coronavirus patients was mental care. \"The fear of the unknown, of a disease that had been killing so many people in the world,\" Pottes said. \"He almost had a panic attack as he got sicker.\"\n\nPottes asked Juliana to come to the hospital, hoping she might calm him. When she arrived, her hopes for a quick recovery vanished. Lemos was disoriented, on an oxygen tank and barely able to communicate. If he got any worse, the doctors warned, they'd intubate him.\n\nLemos thought it might be the last time he'd see his wife. But he couldn't marshal the strength to speak.\n\nAfter six days at the clinic, slipping in and out of consciousness, Guedes stabilized and was transferred to another hospital. Now he was in a room with four other patients, all in worse shape. He watched as one begged for food left just beyond his reach.\n\nIf anyone needed help, the nurses said, he simply had to shout. But no matter how much he called, nobody appeared. Hours went by without anyone entering. After days feeling like a \"dog abandoned in the road,\" he understood: The nurses, short on protective equipment, were scared. Sometimes one would rush in with food, set it down and scamper away -- without making sure the patient could reach it.\n\n[Brazil's favelas, neglected by the government, organize their own coronavirus fight]\n\n\"This happens a lot,\" said Alexandre Telles, a physician at the hospital. \"There are patients who develop hypoglycemia because they aren't fed well.\" So many workers had been infected that basic services were being neglected: \"It was, sincerely, humanly impossible.\"\n\nGuedes looked at the patient, unsure if he had the strength to help.\n\nHe rose and wobbled over. He dragged the man's table closer to his bed. He pulled the top off the food. He sprinkled on some salt. Then Guedes asked him what he would like to eat first.\n\nAnd then the illness lifted. Lemos could breathe easier. His strength returned. He couldn't say what happened -- why he survived, when others haven't.\n\nOn the day he was released from the hospital, he asked his wife to drive him down to the beach. He looked out the car window. It looked the same as always: Filled with people drinking, people without masks, people enjoying another beautiful day in Rio.\n\n[While other countries look to open up, Brazil can't find a way to shut down]\n\nHe knew the disease would devastate Brazil. The news would continue to be nightmarish -- public hospitals failing, ambulances with nowhere to take patients, equipment shortages, the dead piling up in the tens of thousands.\n\nLemos had to get back to work.\n\nGuedes spent 11 days in the hospital. He passed much of the time flipping through his phone, seeing images of the hospitals treating the rich and famous. \"Everything was so beautiful,\" he said. \"Not at all what we were going through.\"\n\nHe eventually recovered. But for weeks afterward, Jailma would suffer anxiety -- unable to read news about the coronavirus, reaching out in the night to check his breathing. All of this might have been different, Guedes believed, if he'd gone to a private hospital.\n\nHe returned to Rocinha, embraced his daughter, reopened his shop. He trekked to the top of the hill, to the house where he was raised, where his mother still lived. He stared out into that familiar view, where sky and sea became one, and where the sprawl of the favela collided with luxury below.",

    "Orwell's nightmare? Facial recognition for animals promises a farmyard revolution": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "Having mastered facial recognition for humans to an alarmingly precise degree, even picking out wanted criminals from huge crowds, Chinese tech whizzes are turning their attention to furrier faces.\n\n\"We've been using it for sheep, pigs and cows,\" said Zhao Jinshi, who studied at Cornell University and founded Beijing Unitrace Tech, a company developing software for the agriculture industry.\n\n\"For pigs, it's more difficult because pigs all look the same, but dairy cows are a bit special because they are black and white and have different shapes,\" Zhao said as he checked on the technology installed in a pilot project here at a farm in Hebei province, outside Beijing.\n\nChina has led the world in developing facial recognition capabilities. There are almost 630 million facial recognition cameras in use in the country, for security purposes as well as for everyday conveniences like entering train stations and paying for goods in stores.\n\nBut authorities also use the technology for sinister means, such as monitoring political dissidents and ethnic minorities.\n\nChina has a new facial recognition app -- for pandas\n\nOne Chinese AI company, Megvii, which has been blacklisted by the Department of Commerce for alleged involvement in the Chinese government's repression of Uighurs in Xinjiang, is applying its technology to a program to recognize dogs by their nose prints. Other tech companies around the world have had a go at identifying chimpanzees, dolphins, horses and lions, with varying degrees of success.\n\nChinese entrepreneurs see an opportunity to apply this know-how to agriculture as farms become bigger and more commercialized, and as the rural population ages, limiting the number of people able to do manual work.\n\nFor humans, facial recognition works by measuring distances between features like eyebrows and lips. But for cows, the software detects patterns and shapes on the animals' faces and hides. With 50 photographs from different angles, Zhao's software can tell a Daisy from a Bessie.\n\nFarmers load information such as health conditions, insemination dates and pregnancy test results into the system, which syncs up with cameras installed above troughs and milking stations. If everything works, farmers can amass valuable data without lifting a finger.\n\n\"We can monitor how long the cow is drinking for, how much it's eating, how many times a day it visits the trough,\" Zhao said as the cows walked in a row from their outdoor pen toward the milking shed.\n\nSigns of illness or unusual behavior can be detected using artificial intelligence and treated quickly by a human, rather than relying on farmers to inspect the herd for potential problems.\n\nChina's lethal milk scandal reverberates a decade later\n\n\"This system is very powerful and it will definitely make our work easier,\" said He Ye, the manager of the farm in Hebei province. The farm has to buy the cameras, but Zhao's company has been providing the technology for free while it irons out the wrinkles.\n\n\"When the weigh scale is installed, I will be able to monitor them in real time,\" he said. If a cow shows symptoms of illness or any other problem, He gets an alert on his phone.\n\nThis kind of information for each animal used to be collected from electronic tags punched through their ears or worn around their ankles. The problem was that the cows were always trying to remove them -- and often succeeding.\n\nIt's a challenge to install the cameras in a farmyard, where there is water and mud everywhere. But even more challenging is the fact that cows are very curious, said Zhao.\n\n\"If you make a little change, they will notice it. If you put up a sign or change anything at all, the cow will notice,\" he said. Then the cow will often try to nuzzle or lick or otherwise check out the new item.\n\nThis initiative fits nicely with the Hebei provincial government's goal to double milk production within two years and improve safety.\n\n\"The milk industry has completely changed,\" said He, the farmer. \"The standards for milk production increased so much -- it's become must more rigorous, with requirements about sterilization and other sanitation regulations.\"\n\nLong before the coronavirus -- which scientists believe began in bats then jumped through an intermediate host, probably pangolins, to humans working in an exotic meat market -- China was known for low food standards and repeated scandals, such as melamine added to baby formula.\n\nMillions of pigs were culled during a swine flu outbreak over the past year, and there have been several cases of bubonic plague, linked to marmots.\n\nChina is now paying more attention to food hygiene. With the spread of the coronavirus, China's government has banned the trade and consumption of wildlife such as civet cats and bamboo rats.\n\nBeijing bets on facial recognition in a drive for total surveillance\n\n\"Intelligent farming\" is beginning to change how the agricultural sector operates, and China's technological giants are getting in on the action, focusing on pork, China's favorite meat.\n\nAlibaba, the tech behemoth, has been developing voice recognition technology for pigs to try to detect if the animals are in pain or trouble, while online retailer JD.com has been working on an A.I.-powered system to develop feeding plans for individual pigs.\n\nThis kind of technology could be useful on farms, said Gosia Zobel, a scientist with AgResearch, a New Zealand government institute.\n\n\"There are obvious constraints -- like the technology working properly on farm, appropriately validating what is being monitored, and data handling -- but these challenges are worth tackling if they bring animal welfare benefits,\" she said.\n\nWhile farmers in other parts of the world are increasingly turning to technology to offset aging populations and labor shortages, China is mainly motivated to produce more domestically, said Salah Sukkarieh, a professor of field robotics at the University of Sydney.\n\n\"These technological advances are driving individual plants to get the most out of each square meter of land, to increase yields and reduce variability,\" Sukkarieh said. \"In China, this is mostly about food security and growing more on its national land.\"\n\nChina feeds 22 percent of the world's population with only 10 percent of the world's arable land. That creates extra incentive for China to improve food standards and production, including through the use of advanced technology.\n\nIf only those cows would leave the cameras alone and the pigs would develop more distinguishing features.\n\nWhy TikTok was destined to land in Trump's crosshairs\n\nA new Chuck E. Cheese children's ride but no one to ride it",

        "body": "\"There was a lot of division,\" Reynolds told AP early Monday morning.\n\nReynolds got on a call with Lawrence and the star quarterback's Clemson teammate, Darien Rencher, and within a matter of hours the summer of athlete empowerment found another gear.\n\nCollege football players from across the country united Sunday in an attempt to save their season and ensure they will no longer be left out of the sport's biggest decisions.\n\nLawrence, Ohio State quarterback Justin Fields, Oklahoma State All-America running back Chuba Hubbard, Alabama running back Najee Harris and numerous other players from Florida State to Oregon posted a graphic on social media with #WeWantToPlay and #WeAreUnited.\n\n\"We came to the conclusion, We Want to Play, their message might have been conveyed differently but at the end of the day the message wasn't too far off from what Big Ten United wanted to promote,\" Reynolds said. \"Which is we all want to play sports this fall. Every athlete, I'm pretty sure, wants to play their sports. They just want to do so safely.\"\n\nThe #WeAreUnited hashtag was used a week ago by a group of Pac-12 players in announcing a movement they say has the support of hundreds of peers within their conference. They have threatened mass opt-outs by players if concerns about COVID-19 protocols, racial injustice in college sports and economic rights for athletes are not addressed.\n\n#BigTenUnited arrived on the scene a couple days later, a movement that claimed the backing off 1,000 Big Ten football players. Their demands were more targeted, strictly related to health and safety in dealing with COVID-19.\n\nSunday night, the call with Reynolds, Rencher and Lawrence led to a Zoom meeting -- of course -- with some of the Pac-12 players involved in \"WeAreUnited.\"\n\nWashington State defensive lineman Dallas Hobbs got to work on a graphic and now the movement is officially nationwide.\n\n\"Just started bouncing ideas off each others' heads and kind of discussing where we go from here and we ended up coming up with that statement,\" said Reynolds, a senior from South Orange, New Jersey.\n\nUnder the logos of each Power Five conference -- ACC, Big Ten, Big 12, Pac-12 and SEC -- the players pronounced their platform:\n\n-- We all want to play football this season.\n\n-- Establish universal mandated health & safety procedures and protocols to protect college athletes against COVID-19 among all conferences throughout the NCAA.\n\n-- Give players the opportunity to opt out and respect their decision.\n\n-- Guarantee eligibility whether a player chooses to play the season or not.\n\n-- Use our voices to establish open communication and trust between players and officials: Ultimately create a College Football Players Association.\n\nAll of this capped a weekend during which the adults who run college sports seemed to be moving toward shutting it all down because of the pandemic.\n\nA day after the Mid-American Conference became the first of the major college football leagues to cancel the fall season, Power Five conference commissioners met Sunday. They discussed mounting concerns about whether a season can be safely conducted with the pandemic still not under control in the United States.\n\nBig 12 Commissioner Bob Bowlsby said no decisions on the season have been made, but conceded the outlook has not improved.\n\n\"Are we in a better place today than two weeks, ago? No, we're not,\" he said.\n\nBowlsby cited \"growing evidence and the growing pool of data around myocarditis.\"\n\nMyocarditis is inflammation of the heart and it has been found in some COVID-19 patients. There is concern it could be a long-term complication of contracting the virus even in young, healthy people, a group that has usually avoided severe cardiovascular symptoms.\n\nAlso Sunday night, the Big Ten's university presidents and chancellors held a previously unscheduled meeting, a person with knowledge of the meeting told The Associated Press. The person spoke on condition of anonymity because the meeting was not announced by the conference.\n\nAnother person with direct knowledge of the meeting, speaking on condition of anonymity, said no votes were taken or decisions made about the college football season.\n\nThe final call on whether major college football will played this season rests in the hands of the university presidents who oversee the largest conferences.\n\nWith doom and gloom hanging over college football, Lawrence, who has become the face of the sport in a summer of strife, tried to push back the tide with a series of tweets.\n\n\"People are at just as much, if not more risk, if we don't play,\" Lawrence posted. \"Players will all be sent home to their own communities where social distancing is highly unlikely and medical care and expenses will be placed on the families if they were to contract covid19.\"\n\nPenn State tight end Pat Freiermuth had a similar message, and the parents of Ohio State football players weighed in, too.\n\nReynolds wants athletes to have a say in the meetings that are deciding the fate of their sports -- starting now.\n\n\"All college athletes through unifying and not being afraid to speak our minds and having social media to kind of mobilize, I think that box on a Zoom call is something that is pretty attainable,\" he said. \"Especially, in the near future.\"\n\n___\n\nFollow Ralph D.

Madrid was among cities which also wanted to host the reshaped mini-tournament.\n\nPortugal, a country of 10.3 million people with an economy that relies heavily on tourism, saw a surge in outbreaks that raised concerns a few weeks ago and prompted the return of some restrictions in some places. But the numbers came down again recently and have been mostly under control in the run-up to the Champions League knockout stage.\n\nThere were also concerns when Spanish club Atl\u00e9tico Madrid reported two positive cases in its squad ahead of its trip to Lisbon. The entire team had to be tested again and the club was cleared to travel only after negative results came back.\n\nNone of the other seven clubs involved in the quarterfinals have reported positive tests among players.\n\nIn Lisbon, they will have to comply with UEFA's 31-page return-to-play protocols for international matches. Players will be tested before departure for a host city and a day before games. Anyone who has had either a coronavirus diagnosis or \"any suspicious symptoms or contacts\" will be subject to pulmonary function testing and, in severe cases, \"organ-dependent examinations.\"\n\nThe venues are Benfica's Stadium of Light and Sporting Lisbon's Alvalade Stadium.\n\n___\n\nMore AP soccer https://apnews.com/Soccer and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports\n\n___\n\nTales Azzoni on Twitter: http://twitter.com/tazzoni\n\nCopyright 2020 The Associated Press.

Half the group showed no symptoms, he said, and the worst case was like a very bad flu where the player sweated \"through the sheets.\"\n\nAll the players who have tested positive are receiving full cardiac workups, the coach said.

He thought the team was doing well and suddenly it was sidelined.\n\n\"It was like getting hit by a 2-by-4 when all the cases happened,\" Schiano said.\n\nThere are estimates the lack of a football season will cost Rutgers $50 million. Schiano said there will have to be some belt tightening. He said he has talked to athletic director Pat Hobbs and he will keep his 10% salary cut in place.\n\nSchiano did not want to talk about how the pandemic has affected the team, noting that many people have either died or suffered a family tragedy.\n\n\"We are going to be fine,\" Schiano said. \"A lot of people lost loved ones who are not going to be with them, so I have tried to share that with our players.

Jun Kwang-hun's huge church in northern Seoul, which has emerged as a major cluster of infections amid growing fears of a massive outbreak in the greater capital region.\n\nOfficials are concerned that the virus's spread could worsen after thousands of demonstrators, including Jun and members of his Sarang Jeil Church, marched in downtown Seoul on Saturday despite pleas from officials to stay home.\n\nHealth Ministry official Seong Yeon-il said a coronavirus test for Jun came out positive on Monday, but couldn't immediately confirm whether he was exhibiting any symptoms.\n\nSouth Korea reported 197 new cases of the virus on Monday, the fourth straight day of triple-digit increases. Most of the new cases in the past few days have come from the densely populated Seoul metropolitan area, home to about half of the country's 51 million people.\n\nChurches have been a constant source of infections, with many failing to require worshipers to wear masks, or allowing them to sing in choirs or eat together.\n\nHealth workers have so far linked 319 infections to Jun's church after completing tests on about 2,000 of its 4,000 members. Police are pursuing some 700 church members who remain out of contact.\n\n\"The rate of positive tests (among church members) has so far been high, at 16.1%, so the situation requires quick testing and isolation,\" Vice Health Minister Kim Gang-lip said during a virus briefing. He urged anyone who participated in the weekend protest to come forward for testing if they experience fever or other symptoms.\n\nJeong Eun-kyeong, director of South Korea's Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said there's concern that the outbreak at the church could spread nationwide through its members' activities, and health workers are tracing the contacts of the church's virus carriers.\n\n\"We believe we are in the early stage of a major outbreak,\" she said.\n\nPresident Moon Jae-in's government has strengthened social distancing restrictions in the Seoul metropolitan area -- a move it had resisted for months out of economic concerns -- and urged residents to avoid visiting other parts of the country for two weeks.\n\nJun's church has become South Korea's second-biggest virus cluster, behind a branch of the secretive Shincheonji Church of Jesus in the southeastern city of Daegu that was tied to more than 5,000 cases following a surge of infections in the region in late February and March.\n\nThe country managed to stabilize the outbreak in Daegu and nearby areas by April after concentrating public health resources and personnel nationwide. Health workers were able to quickly ramp up testing and aggressively trace contacts by extensively using cellphone location data and credit-card records, allowing the country to weather the outbreak without major lockdowns.\n\nBut the resurgence of the virus in the greater capital area -- which has 10 times more people than Daegu -- has been a rude awakening for a country that had been eager to tout its gains against the virus.\n\nWhile it had been easier for health workers to contain the outbreak in the Daegu region, where infections were mostly tied to the Shincheonji church, they are now struggling to track transmissions and predict infection routes in the Seoul area, where clusters have been popping up from churches, restaurants, schools and other places.\n\nMoon's government is pressing charges against Jun for allegedly disrupting disease-control efforts by ignoring orders to self-isolate, discouraging worshipers from getting tested and under-reporting the church's membership to avoid broader quarantines.\n\nJun's lawyer, Kang Yeon-jae, denied the accusations during a news conference Monday, insisting that he only received self-isolation orders after returning home from Saturday's rally.\n\nDuring Saturday's protest, Jun, who is known for provocative speeches that are often filled with bizarre claims, said the outbreak at his church was a result of an attack, accusing an unspecified opponent of \"pouring\" the virus onto the church. The protesters, who sporadically clashed with police, shouted slogans accusing Moon of policy failures, corruption and kowtowing to North Korea.\n\nThere's a possibility that Jun could be arrested for the second time this year, with prosecutors asking a Seoul court to revoke his bail.\n\nJun was indicted in March on charges of violating election laws ahead of April's parliamentary elections by allegedly asking participants at his rallies to vote against Moon's party, which would be illegal because the official campaigning period hadn't yet started. Jun's bail was granted on condition that he doesn't take part in rallies that could be related to his pending case.\n\nShincheonji's 88-year-old chairman, Lee Man-hee, was arrested earlier this month over charges that the church hid some members and under-reported gatherings. Lee and his church have steadfastly denied the accusations, saying they're cooperating with health authorities.\n\nCopyright 2020 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

        "authors": [],
        "body": "When he arrived in Washington two decades ago, he found a living in construction. He mastered drywall installation and learned carpentry and plumbing. He painted numerous homes and offices in D.C., Maryland and Virginia.\n\nA resident of Prince George's County, Rodriguez was a fast learner and hard worker who didn't miss a day of work, his family and friends said.\n\nWhen the Washington region shut down because of the coronavirus, he continued to get up each morning before dawn, putting on his work boots and vest, and head to jobs.\n\nRodriguez, 45, died July 4 at MedStar Washington Hospital Center of complications from covid-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus.\n\nHis wife of 23 years, Rosy Rodriguez, described him a jovial man who loved God, lived to care for his family and fixed anything that needed fixing in the home.\n\n\"He always said, 'My family is my top priority,'\u2009\" Rosy Rodriguez recalled.\n\nRodriguez was born in a humble home in Moraz\u00e1n, a department in the northeast part of El Salvador. Because his family had very limited economic means, Rodriguez juggled multiple jobs as a teenager. By the age of 20, he was managing several food kiosks and a movie theater in Moraz\u00e1n's capital city, San Francisco Gotera.\n\nHe met his wife when she interviewed for a job at one of the kiosks he managed and courted her while she worked there selling fruity ice pops. She was 18. He was 20. Years later, he confessed to her that the day of her job interview, he thought to himself: \"That beautiful girl will be my wife.\"\n\nThose we have lost to the coronavirus in Virginia, Maryland and D.C.\n\nThey married two years later, and the arrival of their first child drove Rodriguez to make a life-changing decision to leave behind El Salvador for a future in the United States.\n\n\"He wanted to give me and our kids a better life,\" Rosy Rodriguez recalled. He planned to stay three years, save enough to build a house back home, then return to his family. But two years after he arrived in Washington, he became sick and underwent a kidney transplant. Rosy Rodriguez made the journey to Washington to take care of her husband.\n\nOne of his proudest moments, Rosy Rodriguez said, was the day they moved into their Hyattsville home 15 years ago -- and realized a dream to become homeowners. Seeing their children -- Enrique, 21, and Stephanie, 14 -- graduate from college was his other dream, she said. He never stopped telling people about his children's achievements, the awards they earned in school and each graduation.\n\nRosy Rodriguez said the unexpected loss of her husband has left her, her children and many who knew him brokenhearted. Rosy Rodriguez and the children also tested positive for the coronavirus; they showed only mild symptoms.\n\n\"We are all so heart broken for their family,\" Dawn Crothers, founder of Something Vintage Rentals and Rosy Rodriguez's employer, said on a GoFundMe page she created to help the family with the unexpected funeral costs and other financial needs.\n\nHas someone close to you died of covid-19? Share your story with The Washington Post.\n\nWhen Rodriguez wasn't working, spending time with his kids, invested in a home-improvement project or in his garden, he was volunteering with his church, Iglesia de Dios Pentecostal Nueva Vida. He drove the congregation's buses for church services and events and would volunteer to work on church construction projects, his pastor, Carlos P\u00e9rez, said.\n\n\"Brother Santos was a very friendly person. A family man who always took care of his wife and children. He was always willing to help. Always happy. Always had a smile on him,\" P\u00e9rez said. Rodriguez was one of two members of the church who died of covid-19 in July.\n\n\"He was passionate about his work,\" said longtime friend, co-worker and brother-in-law Rigo Saenz. \"And he had learned every aspect of the remodeling business.\"\n\nRodriguez, he said, taught him carpentry skills and how to install doors and windows.\n\n\"He was like my older brother, a mentor who took care of me and walked me through life,\" said Saenz, 36. \"He was a good person and always very attentive.\"\n\nAt work, when the crew got together for their lunch break, Rodriguez would bring his co-workers water or hand out napkins. He would stay behind to clean up after the crew dispersed, Saenz said.\n\nWhen a pipe broke in the home, Rosy Rodriguez said, she didn't worry, because her husband \"knew how to fix it.\" He would come home from work every afternoon to spend time in the garden. The couple would then sit on the deck, look at their plants and drink coffee.\n\nDays before he was taken to the hospital, he pulled out a can of gray paint and gave the deck a fresh coat. Then he made the patio furniture look like new with a coat of bright red paint -- his wife's favorite color.\n\n\"He was happy in our home,\" she said. \"He used to say, 'Seeing you happy makes me happy.'\u2009\"",

    "Skepticism, fear helps fuel virus on Mexico City's outskirts": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "Even if they had acted earlier, the family members might have struggled to protect themselves. Three generations share a home in a southern borough of Mexico City. The modest house opens onto a street market -- and the family sells clothes right outside their door. Bedrooms double as storerooms. Every space was a potential play area for four kids.\n\nThe family's story helps explain why five months into Mexico's COVID-19 epidemic, poor neighborhoods like San Gregorio Atlapulco persist as hot spots while other parts of the capital see a modest improvement.\n\nIn San Gregorio and many places like it, fear of hospitals, deep-rooted distrust of authorities, difficulties accessing medical care, and the pressure to make a living amid economic uncertainty are fueling the spread of the virus.\n\n\"A lot of what is happening is because of how families are handling it,\" said the Serraldes' son, Jos\u00e9 Juan, 47, who says his parents were skeptics and took few precautions, though he and his wife were more careful. Many people \"don't accept what is happening and don't want to accept that they are dying of COVID.\"\n\nIn the span of a month, Jos\u00e9 Juan Serralde buried his parents and an aunt, and fell ill himself and recovered, as did his wife and their daughters.\n\n\"The family crypt filled up in less than a month,\" he said.\n\nMexico has confirmed more than 443,000 infections and over 48,000 deaths -- putting it in third place for fatalities worldwide.\n\nDue to a lack of widespread testing, many deaths in Mexico remain uncounted. But a recently released report gives a sense of the scale of the outbreak: From April 19 to June 30, the capital city saw over 17,800 more deaths than usual.\n\nMexico recommended that people self-quarantine starting in mid-March. Serralde complied, and as a nonessential employee of the Xochimilco borough where he lives, stopped going to work. But his parents continued visiting markets to sell the plants they grew in a greenhouse, and they did not wear masks. The family continued to live in tight quarters.\n\nSuch living conditions are common in San Gregorio, an impoverished neighborhood of some 30,000 residents where it's common to see farmers in rubber boots pushing carts of produce from nearby fields. Large, multigenerational households and the fact that many people work in the informal economy mean it's hard for many residents to self-quarantine.\n\n\"You couldn't isolate at home, we all shared the place,\" said Serralde. \"It was a mistake on our part, but no one explained it to us until after what happened to my dad.\"\n\nMexican health officials have been holding daily televised news conferences about the pandemic for months. Still, they have given mixed messages on the necessity of wearing a mask, and President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador himself has worn one only occasionally.\n\nSerralde wasn't sure how to implement health officials' recommendations until a friend who is a doctor explained after his father died that the family should use disposable plates and plasticware, clean the bathroom with bleach after each person used it, and get everyone in the house, except his youngest daughter, tested.\n\nBy June, Mexico City Mayor Claudia Sheinbaum had paired a cautious reopening with expanding testing and contact tracing. In July, she added an information campaign that sent government workers door to door in the most affected areas. The city of about 10 million -- with another 10 million living in the surroundings -- is now testing about 4,000 people a day.\n\nBut these efforts came too late for the Serralde family. At the beginning of May, they learned their neighbor had died of the virus. Soon after, Serralde's 73-year-old father developed diarrhea and his 69-year-old mother complained of pain around her kidneys. Neither's symptoms made the family suspect COVID-19.\n\nBy the time they buried the older man, half the family had symptoms. Serralde's mother began to struggle to breathe.\n\nBut she was afraid to go to the hospital because of the common belief that those who go in never come out, her son explained.\n\nDr. Jorge Esteban Ballesteros, director of the San Gregorio Health Center, said such neighborhoods are often hotbeds of distrust and misinformation, creating the perfect conditions for the epidemic to grow.\n\n\"It's a difficult population of deeply rooted customs, resistant toward authority, who say the virus is something made up by the government,\" Ballesteros said. \"They've even said we're spreading the virus as we sanitize.\"\n\nSerralde still breaks down thinking about trying to navigate the health system while also suffering from the illness.\n\nWhen the family finally convinced the older woman to go to the hospital, they struggled to find one that would take her. A military hospital turned them away, and they ended up in a hard-hit neighboring borough.\n\nOnce she was hospitalized, the family had to secure an oxygen mask because the hospital did not have one -- and they even had to hunt down their own acetaminophen.\n\nBallesteros, the doctor, says authorities need to reinforce the measures they have taken, like providing more economic support to struggling families, expanding testing and continuing to knock on doors to give information in hard-hit neighborhoods.\n\nSerralde acknowledges that his family didn't take enough precautions and now tries to persuade everyone to take such measures -- his wife is even selling masks -- but he also believes authorities need to be more strict. For instance, he wishes they would enforce the virus-control measures that businesses are supposed to implement and make face masks mandatory.\n\n\"I feel like this is slipping out of the hands of the government, the mayor, the president, everyone,\" he said.\n\nCopyright 2020 The Associated Press.

    "The coronavirus disarms the foot soldiers of the immune system. Scientists theorize that boosting them could fight covid-19.": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "Until now, early-stage treatments have remained elusive. But an improved understanding how the virus disarms some of the body's immune fighters, called interferons, is creating excitement among scientists who theorize they might be able to counter that process and prevent infections from developing into severe disease.\n\nInterferons are immune proteins that normally interfere with a virus' life cycle -- hence the name, interferon. In addition to their antiviral properties, they summon natural killer cells, \"the best soldiers, as it were, of the innate immune system,\" Anthony S. Fauci, director of NIH's National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said in an interview.\n\nThat system is both the body's whooping air-raid siren and its emergency responders rushing to the scene. The virus's ability to hamstring this system may be one of the keys to its success.\n\nNow, several trials are underway in the United States and elsewhere to see whether giving interferon to coronavirus patients early on might prevent severe disease, or hasten recovery, if administered later.\n\nDriving the trials are a spate of recent studies showing that interferons are weakest in the worst coronavirus cases. Scientists in France came to this conclusion after examining cells in the blood of 50 covid-19 patients who had spent 10 days in the hospital, as they wrote in a study published Aug. 7 in the journal Science.\n\n\"We found that the more severe the patients were, the less interferon type-1 they were producing,\" said Benjamin Terrier, a professor of internal medicine at the National Reference Center for Rare Systemic Autoimmune Diseases in Paris's Cochin Hospital, referring to a subset of the proteins normally deployed against viruses.\n\nThis spring, Benjamin tenOever, a microbiology professor at the Icahn School of Medicine at New York's Mount Sinai Hospital, and his colleagues came to similar conclusions after studying the virus in samples taken from humans, ferrets and infected cells grown in a lab. Interferons, as they reported in the journal Cell, were lacking in all of those.\n\n\"The virus is very actively repressing both the production of and the sequencing of interferons,\" meaning the process by which the body makes these proteins, tenOever said.\n\nThis weakening happens not only in patients' lungs but in their blood, according to new research by Bali Pulendran, an immune system expert at Stanford University School of Medicine, and his colleagues.\n\nThe team isolated immune cells from the blood of patients with severe covid-19, placed them in petri dishes and tried to provoke them with bacteria and viruses. Normally, such provocations would cause the immune cells to erupt in a shower of interferons and other defensive molecules.\n\nBut, as the scientists reported in a paper published Aug. 11 in Science, those cells in covid-19 patients were inert. It was as though the coronavirus, or a consequence of its infection, had snipped their fuses.\n\n\"After eight days or so, the type-1 interferon system is completely absent, and silenced, by the infection,\" Pulendran said.\n\nInterferon's therapeutic possibility\n\nResearchers caution that many questions remain unanswered about interferon's use in coronavirus patients. Past clinical studies that tested it to treat SARS and MERS showed little or no benefit.\n\nBut there are promising early signals. Preliminary results from a small randomized clinical trial, publicized in a news release in late July by the British company Synairgen, suggests that inhaled interferon reduced the odds of developing severe covid-19, compared with receiving a placebo. Experts cautioned that trial was small, just 101 patients, and the results were not yet published in a peer-reviewed study.\n\nIn France, investigators plan to test interferon if cases continue to rise. But they are currently too low to enroll enough patients in a clinical trial, Terrier said.\n\nA large, NIH-sponsored clinical trial launched this month will test interferon as a drug injected in patients hospitalized with covid-19. Those patients will receive interferon beta-1a, a synthetic molecule identical to the protein our bodies make, every other day for the first week of their hospital stay.\n\nThe trial is recruiting about 1,000 patients from 100 hospitals around the world. The patients will be sick but not so ill as to require ventilators to breathe. That speaks to the goal of treating the disease before worsens.\n\n\"What you're likely going to see, as more antivirals come along and then the monoclonal antibodies come along, will be a propensity to treating as early as you possibly can to prevent people from getting into the hospital,\" Fauci said.\n\nThe patients in the study will also get remdesivir, an antiviral agent the FDA authorized in the spring. Researchers will compare their recovery against that of covid-19 patients who received remdesivir alone. \"The purpose of it is to determine whether you get added value,\" Fauci said. The trial is slated to run through November 2023.\n\nShould interferon beta-1a prove useful, Fauci doubted there would be shortages because it is already widely used, for instance, to treat multiple sclerosis. Interferon drugs were also previously used as a standard treatment for hepatitis C, though newer, more effective therapies have largely replaced them.\n\nDespite their potential, interferons may not be a panacea, scientists cautioned.\n\n\"In principle, you could think, why don't we just give it to everybody who has a viral infection ever,\" said Tufts University microbiologist Marta Gaglia. \"But in reality, it has proven less effective than we would like.\"\n\nA critical factor may be getting the timing right. The new studies suggest interferon would be most helpful in the earliest stages of the disease, but that window may close before most people are hospitalized and doctors can treat them.\n\n\"Interferon also has a lot of side effects,\" Gaglia pointed out. These include muscle aches, fever and other ailments associated with flu infections. \"So we wouldn't want to use it unless we think it's going to be beneficial.\"\n\nShe said she would like the NIH-sponsored trial to answer whether giving interferon to hospitalized patients is helpful, and what dosages yield the best results.\n\nWhat's more, pitting these virus fighters against coronavirus too late in the process could actually worsen symptoms, according to animal models cited in a recent review of interferon studies.\n\nMissing interferon, severe symptoms\n\nScientists theorize that the virus's ability to disarm interferons early on may explain other aspects of the disease, such as the out-of-control inflammation reaction that develops in some patients.\n\nAs the immune system mounts an inflammatory defense -- but there is too little interferon to quickly contain the virus -- the body's response can spiral out of control, several scientists said. In some cases, this uncontrolled inflammation becomes deadly.\n\nSome experts also suggest that a person's ability to mobilize interferons to wage a strong immune response at the start of the infection process may predict less severe disease.\n\n\"We know that individuals differ in their ability to mount an interferon response,\" said pediatrician Petter Brodin, who studies the immune system at the Karolinska Institute in Sweden.\n\nWhen otherwise healthy people fall ill, Brodin said, \"it makes me wonder at least, do they have a genetic susceptibility, an underlying immunodeficiency that we haven't picked up yet, which gives them this response, potentially because they failed to induce interferons?\"\n\nThere's preliminary evidence for this, such as a case study of four men under age 35, who had rare genetic variants associated with impaired interferon response, who were hospitalized in the Netherlands with severe covid-19.\n\nCause-and-effect is very difficult to determine in the human immune system. The Science papers used a variety of techniques to examine the virus, but they described only single points in time.\n\n\"You are getting more of a snapshot,\" said Gaglia, who was not involved with these reports. What happens on the third day of an infection may not be what happens on the tenth. \"And so you are trying then to make an inference of the sequence of events.\"\n\nAdditional studies of the immune system can help unravel the stages of infection. Pulendran said his team is collecting blood samples at regular, frequent intervals \"to map out the trajectory of this disease.\" The race to understand and shore up our inner defenses continues.\n\nWartime doctors battling covid-19 rush to treat the ill -- but without knowing what really works\n\nTrump urges people who have recovered from covid-19 to donate blood plasma",

    "Therapy llama 'Caesar the No Drama Llama' calms tensions at protests   ": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "Caesar, better known as \"Caesar the No Drama Llama,\" is a retired 6-year-old Argentinian grand champion show llama that now works as a therapy llama and \"llamactivist.\" One of his best talents is offering emotional-support hugs, which people line up to give him at protests and other places where Caesar shows up.\n\nLlamas generally are not known to be cozy with humans, and at 5 foot 8 and 350 pounds, Caesar could appear intimidating. But Caesar doesn't turn from affection or back away from chaos. When people meet Caesar, they tend to melt in his calm presence, said his caretaker Larry McCool, who lives in Jefferson, Ore., on the Mystic Llama Farm.\n\n\"I don't care how big, how staunch, how intense that somebody is -- it could be a big marcher in total riot gear, and he will come up and give Caesar a big hug,\" said McCool, 66. \"It's all I can do to just keep him from snuggling.\"\n\nCaesar and McCool were at a Portland protest late last month, standing in Pioneer Square with 10,000 protesters when violence broke out in the distance. People were shouting and flash bombs were being deployed by police. McCool said he quickly moved Caesar, emphasizing that he is careful about Caesar's safety.\n\nHe said that when protesters later saw Caesar -- his long, regal neck making him the height of a person -- they stopped to pet his soft wool. His calm demeanor rubbed off on them, said McCool.\n\n\"They'll be clapping, chanting, stomping, and all of the sudden I'll get up with Caesar and the next thing I know, everyone will just band around Caesar,\" said McCool, who spent four hours there, leaving at 11 p.m.\n\nPolice sometimes react to Caesar the same way protesters do, McCool said. During a recent large protest in Portland, Caesar and McCool ambled by a group of Portland police officers who were stationed in a parking lot near the unrest. The officers pet Cesar and asked to take photos, McCool said. The same thing happened at the Salem Women's March this year.\n\n\"Caesar brings calm, and diffuses tension within these extremely volatile situations because everyone loves him as much as he loves everyone,\" said McCool.\n\nSo far this year, Cesar and McCool have attended 10 Black Lives Matter protests in Oregon, including five in Portland's epicenter, to offer support and a tranquil presence to protesters. In recent years, they have attended more than 50 marches in support of a variety of civil and environmental causes.\n\nMcCool says he's never felt either of them has been in danger during the protests.\n\n\"We've been there and heard the flash bombs going off, we've smelled the tear gas, but we make sure that we get out safely,\" he said, adding later, \"I will remove him before anything like that could become dangerous.\"\n\nWhen they were at a recent march in Portland, leaders of the Black Lives Matter movement came up to them, concerned about Caesar, to make sure that he was doing okay.\n\n\"Everyone is looking out for our best interests as much as we're there for them,\" said McCool. \"We don't want to detract from anything. We don't want to lessen the magnitude of the BLM movement. We recognize how important it is.\"\n\nMcCool has owned the Mystic Llama Farm for about 20 years and cared for dozens of llamas. But when he met Caesar in 2015 he immediately noticed that Caesar was unusual.\n\nMcCool purchased him and showed him at the Oregon State Fair for a year before transitioning Caesar into becoming a therapy animal.\n\nCaesar genuinely enjoys interacting with people, McCool said, and radiates a sense of warmth similar to some dogs.\n\n\"He's a magical creature,\" McCool said. \"I wish I could take some credit for him, but he's developed all on his own. I've been his tutor and his guide, but sometimes I'm the one following him.\"\n\nWhen they're not protesting, McCool and Caesar go to retirement homes to visit residents outside their windows. Before the pandemic, they would go to schools, malls and visit foster children and people with special needs. The visits are on a volunteer basis, though sometimes McCool accepts donations to offset transportation and other costs.\n\n\"As a llamactivist, we also do a lot of social and charity functions outside of our presence at protests,\" McCool said.\n\nOregon-based artist AnnMar\u00e9 Cruz and her toddler son met Caesar in January 2019 while they were recycling their Christmas tree at Mystic Llama Farms. Cruz was taken aback by Caesar's gentle demeanor with her son, and was inspired to create a drawing of Caesar and McCool, which McCool uses as his Facebook profile image.\n\n\"He's just the softest, most adorable llama that's lovely to be around -- and he gives an especially good hug,\" Cruz said. \"He inspires a calming presence, one of happiness.\"\n\nAnother Caesar fan, Trish Conlon, has met Caesar twice -- first at the Women's March in Salem a few months ago, and again, more recently at a Black Lives Matter protest in Salem.\n\n\"There's a 'lightness' in the air when he's around, and that's what people especially need right now,\" Conlon said. \"People would see him and just smile. Not that you could see a smile as well, behind a mask -- but you could tell that their faces would just light up.\"\n\nMcCool said he is willing to spend the time and money that it takes to participate in these activism events. It's about a 150 mile round-trip drive to Portland from the farm where they live, but McCool doesn't mind making the journey, and Caesar \"travels in style\" behind McCool's truck.\n\n\"He has his own trailer behind my truck that he travels in, with two inches of foam padding. He doesn't rough it too much -- he's a pretty pampered llama,\" McCool said.\n\nMcCool said Caesar is able to go to protests and other events that some people might not be able to attend because of the novel coronavirus or other reasons.\n\n\"He's doing what other people can't do -- he's able to get out to these events and do this for them if they can't make the trip, themselves. His goal in life and his purpose is to soothe people,\" said McCool. \"I have to believe that he and I were put together for a reason. I'm not just his caretaker -- we're partners.\"\n\nA medical student couldn't find how symptoms look on darker skin. He decided to publish a book about it.\n\nPhotographer brings American historical figures to life with portraits of their descendants",

        "body": "Assistant coach Sean Morey, a former NFL player, at practice with the Lawrenceville School football team in Lawrenceville, N.J., in November 2019.\n\nRed and yellow were bad. Blue and green were good. The rest, Sam Gandy explained, remains unclear.\n\nIt was December 2015, and Gandy, a neurologist at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York, was showing a former National Football League player named Sean Morey scans of his brain. A professional athlete for 10 seasons, Morey retired from the NFL in 2010 after doctors told him he had suffered too many concussions.\n\nMorey subsequently became a behind-the-scenes health and safety advocate, co-chairing an NFL Players Association committee devoted to brain injuries and leading a mid-2010s effort to improve the settlement terms of a class action concussion lawsuit brought by retirees against the league. Just 39 years old, he also was suffering debilitating headaches, memory lapses, angry outbursts and other symptoms associated with chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), a neurodegenerative disease linked to repeated blows to the head.\n\nWhile CTE had been found in the brains of dozens of former players, including Pro Football Hall of Fame members Mike Webster and Junior Seau, there was no way to know if Morey had it. The disease could be diagnosed only posthumously.\n\nGandy was working to change that. To try to identify CTE, he was using an experimental technique to scan the brains of retired football players and soldiers. The scans were color-coded. Healthy people's brains appeared mostly blue and green, like grassy islands surrounded by sea. By contrast, probable areas of damage looked yellow and red, as if fires were burning on those same islands. The images Gandy was showing Morey were the results of brain scans done seven months earlier using a positron-emission tomography (PET) machine. They were unlike any brain images Gandy had seen before. (He would go on to publish his case study of Morey, one of the first of its kind, in a scientific journal in 2016.)\n\nMuch of Morey's brain was green. But some areas were red. Bright, flaming red. And those areas corresponded to the damaged areas found in the autopsied brains of Seau, Webster and others with CTE. \"I knew they would find something,\" Morey told me later. \"The question was, what was the extent of it?\"\n\nGandy strongly suspected CTE. Yet he couldn't say for sure and cautioned Morey not to draw sweeping conclusions. The pictures were merely snapshots, produced by a new and unverified method of peeking through the skull to spot a very specific thing. They didn't indicate that Morey indisputably had the disease, or that his condition would worsen over time. To know anything with certainty, Gandy explained, many more people would need to be scanned. And much more work would need to be done. Morey's images were not the last word; instead, they were an important step toward solving a medical puzzle. Namely, can CTE be diagnosed in living people?\n\nNow a 44-year-old assistant high school football coach living in Princeton, N.J., and still coping with the damage done by his professional career, Morey knows better than anyone what an answer could mean -- both for a sport grappling with the disease and for the lives of the people who play it.\n\nSuppose you're a football player. Here's what happens when doctors suspect that you've torn a knee ligament: They use a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) machine to look at the tissues inside your leg, determine if and how they've been damaged, and use that information to prescribe a course of treatment and recovery. By contrast, here's what happens when doctors suspect you're suffering from CTE: They wait for you to die. After that, they carefully remove your brain from your skull, slice certain portions of it into small, thin pieces, stain those pieces with special chemicals and then place them under microscopes to look for the disease's biological signature: tangles of a toxic, abnormal variation of a protein called tau in the depths of the sulci, which are the crevasses between the brain's many wrinkles. Then, and only then, can it be said conclusively that you had CTE -- and not some other neurodegenerative disease or type of brain injury.\n\nThis is a problem. Like society at large, football is now coping with the coronavirus pandemic. But the sport has been gripped by an ongoing health crisis since 2005, when a neuropathologist named Bennet Omalu published a study identifying what he believed to be CTE in Webster's brain. His discovery inspired the 2015 Will Smith film \"Concussion.\" A 2017 Boston University study of the brains of 202 deceased former football players found that 110 of the 111 who had played in the NFL had the disease, as did lower percentages of athletes who stopped playing in college (48 of 53) and high school (3 of 14).\n\nLinked to aggression, depression, suicidal thoughts, impaired judgment, impulse control problems and dementia, CTE was found in the brain of Tyler Hilinski, a 21-year-old Washington State University quarterback who died of suicide in 2018, and in the brain of Aaron Hernandez, a 27-year-old former NFL player who in 2017 hanged himself in prison while serving a life sentence for murder. The disease sparked thousands of individual lawsuits that led to the NFL's settlement, which already has awarded nearly $790 million to retirees with cognitive impairment or conditions such as Parkinson's or Alzheimer's. CTE was a major factor in a similar settlement between former college athletes and the NCAA and is a key part of a second wave of football-related suits against the association and various athletic conferences and schools.\n\nConcerns about CTE also have contributed to a nationwide decline in high school and youth tackle football participation, local and state-level efforts to ban both activities, and a number of NFL and college players walking away from the game. \"The impact of CTE has been dramatic,\" says former San Francisco 49ers linebacker Chris Borland, who in 2015 retired from the NFL at age 24 following his rookie season because of concerns about the disease. \"We're seeing players take it into consideration more and more. And it calls into question a lot of the circumstances surrounding football: How much public money should be contributed to the game, whether or not college athletes should be compensated for doing a risky job, if it's an appropriate activity for young children.\"\n\nScientists believe that repetitive brain trauma -- not just concussions, but also less severe subconcussive blows like the hits football linemen absorb on every snap -- is a precondition for CTE. Last year, Boston University researchers found that for football players, both the risk of developing the disease and its severity increase with the number of years playing the sport; athletes whose youth-to-pro careers lasted more than 14.5 years were 10 times as likely to have CTE as those who played fewer.\n\nYet because there's no way to identify the disease in the living, many basic and important questions remain unanswered. Researchers don't know why some people who suffer repeated head hits develop CTE while others do not. They don't know how many hits are too many. They don't know exactly how the disease first arises, or how and why it spreads across the brain over time. They don't know why individuals develop different symptoms with different levels of severity. They don't know how common CTE is, nor how risky football and other contact sports truly are. Most of the brains given to Boston University and other research institutions for study come from donors and families who were experiencing problems during life, which creates selection bias in studies and means headline numbers like 110 of 111 NFL brains skew high.\n\nMoreover, the inability to detect the disease in people such as Morey makes developing effective therapies almost impossible. But with detection, \"We'd be able to begin clinical trials for new compounds to be able to treat the disease once it starts -- and hopefully even prevent it if we can detect it early on,\" says Robert Stern, the director of clinical research for Boston University's CTE Center and an expert on the disease. \"So the next critical step is to diagnose it during life.\"\n\nGandy joined the quest to find a way to detect CTE in the living after studying Alzheimer's for decades. He helped to discover the first drugs that reduce the formation of beta-amyloid, a sticky protein that builds up in the brains of Alzheimer's patients. His interest in brain disease was intellectual, rooted in a desire to go from \"no understanding of a situation\" to \"that sudden flash of insight.\"\n\nIt also was personal. One of Gandy's earliest memories is of riding in his parents' car, following a police cruiser that was taking his grandmother to a South Carolina hospital to be institutionalized for dementia. She would confuse her grandson with his father. She would leave her single-story brick cabin and walk down the highway until police picked her up. Before her death in the late 1960s, she spent her final years largely confined to a rocking chair, singing hymns to herself. \"I knew something was going on, clearly stressful and important, but I didn't really understand,\" Gandy says.\n\nGandy, 63, now believes that his grandmother had Alzheimer's, which wasn't considered to be a major disease until the 1970s. Gandy's mother later was diagnosed with the disease. Before her death in 2018, she became paranoid and absent-minded; nurses often found her on the floor between her wheelchair and bathroom after she would call for assistance, forget that help was on the way, and then unsuccessfully try to reach the toilet herself. \"I'm sure that all had an effect on me,\" Gandy says. \"At some level, [brain disease] almost never leaves my mind.\"\n\nIn the 1990s, Gandy was part of a research team that discovered professional boxers carrying a particular gene known to increase Alzheimer's risk were more likely to suffer long-term brain damage from prizefighting than their peers. Over the next decade, he closely followed the emerging connection between football and CTE, in part because one of the researchers who helped find the disease in Webster's brain, Steve DeKosky, was a longtime friend and colleague.\n\nIn 2014, Dave Herman, a 73-year-old retired NFL player with memory problems, wanted to join a Mount Sinai clinical trial for an Alzheimer's drug. Problem was, the five doctors who examined Herman couldn't agree on a diagnosis. Based on his symptoms, three believed he had the disease. Two suspected CTE. Gandy, who later published a paper on Herman's case, scanned Herman's brain twice with a PET machine, which detects radiation. For the first scan, Herman was injected with a radioactive chemical, called a tracer, that binds to beta-amyloid, the protein involved in Alzheimer's. For the second scan, Herman was given a tracer that binds to the tau protein. In healthy brain cells, tau acts like a kind of scaffolding and is essential to normal functioning; but in CTE, an abnormal variation called p-tau clumps in the valleys of the brain's wrinkles, killing cells and disrupting function.\n\nHerman's first scan came back negative: greens and blues, indicating minimal beta-amyloid concentration. Alzheimer's was ruled out. By contrast, the second scan showed yellow and red. The tracer was sticking to p-tau. Gandy thought it was likely Herman had CTE, but the quality of the scans made it hard to tell whether the p-tau was concentrated in the same brain valleys as seen in autopsies of people who had the disease. To reach a more definitive conclusion, Gandy would need better scans. And he would need more subjects.\n\nMorey never planned on becoming a medical case study. Undersized at 5-foot-11 and 193 pounds, he played his way from practice squads to the 2008 Pro Bowl as a hard-hitting special teams standout for the Arizona Cardinals. After football, Morey figured, he would put his Brown University degree to use and become an athletic director. Or perhaps go into politics like Steve Largent, a former NFL receiver who served in Congress. \"I wanted to do something positive and serve other people,\" Morey says. \"Make sure they are not forgotten or misrepresented.\"\n\nBrain injuries derailed those ambitions. Morey estimates that he suffered more than 20 concussions over his career, most of them undiagnosed, and countless other blows to the head. Following the 2009 season, he began having blind spots in his vision and excruciating headaches that would leave him immobilized for hours at a time. \"I played in the NFL with ripped-off toenails, dislocated fingers, separated shoulders, broken ribs, patellar tendinitis, torn ligaments in my ankle, a torn biceps,\" he says. \"But I had never experienced that kind of pain.\"\n\nWhen two doctors advised Morey to retire in the summer of 2010, he knew enough to take their advice. Two years earlier at the Super Bowl, he had had a long conversation with Chris Nowinski, a former Harvard University football player and professional wrestler who was trying to warn the sports world about the potential dangers of concussions and repetitive brain trauma, including CTE. First identified in 1928, the disease had been studied in boxers for decades. But football's medical community largely hadn't paid attention. \"When Chris and I first spoke,\" Morey says, \"I couldn't even pronounce 'chronic traumatic encephalopathy.' \"\n\nMorey was a quick study. He co-chaired the NFL Players Association's first brain injury committee and recruited scientists to advise it. He read every study he could get his hands on and co-wrote a 90-page report outlining health risks faced by players. During 2011 collective bargaining negotiations between the league and the union, he helped create a return-to-play protocol for concussed players and helped secure more than $300 million in new player health care and research funding. (Morey later resigned from the union committee because he felt that the programs the union chose to spend that money on did not adequately study or treat retirees with brain injuries. The NFLPA, which is funding a large and ongoing medical study of former players through Harvard University that includes brain injury research, declined to comment on Morey's resignation.)\n\nAll the while, Morey's own symptoms were intensifying. His headaches, he says, felt like \"being beaten in the head with a rubber mallet. Like someone is squeezing your eyeballs together. Every time the blood pumps through your skull, you literally feel it.\" He would lose his train of thought mid-conversation, miss appointments, struggle to sleep and find words, leave the stove on, drive away from gas stations with the refueling nozzle still in his sport-utility vehicle. At his daughters' sports practices, Morey says, he would \"show up and introduce myself and ask [other parents] their names, and they would look at me like I'm crazy -- because I take them to practice every week, and I'm asking every week.\"\n\nWorse still were the explosions of rage. In locker rooms, Morey took pride in being calm and thoughtful. Now he was erupting at his wife, Cara, and their three young daughters, \"dropping f-bombs and screaming at the top of my lungs,\" he says. Anything could trigger an outburst, like his children arguing in the back seat during a drive to their grandparents' house. The fallout left Morey confused and ashamed. \"I would think to myself, 'What the f--- did I just say?' \" he says. \" 'How can I do this?' \"\n\nFive years ago, when Gandy first saw the images of Morey's brain scans, a single thought went through his mind. That's it. That's CTE. The scans were negative for beta-amyloid and positive for p-tau; more important, they were at a higher resolution than Dave Herman's scans, which meant Gandy could see more clearly that the p-tau in Morey's brain was concentrated in the areas associated with the disease.\n\n\"I was amazed,\" Gandy says. Ensuing research has produced a more complicated picture, indicating that a CTE test will take a while to develop. To wit: Since 2016, Gandy and his team have scanned and examined 25 combat veterans and 25 former collision-sport athletes. Of the 20 patients suffering clinical symptoms associated with CTE, 16 have scans showing excess retention of the tracer that indicates tau tangles.\n\nHowever, the other four do not -- perhaps because they don't have the disease, Gandy says, or perhaps because they have CTE but haven't yet accumulated enough p-tau in their brains to register on scans. \"The positives were in people who had obvious symptoms, who already had seen a neurologist or a psychiatrist and were being medicated,\" he says. \"So, is this technique sensitive enough to see if you have a lower level of [p-tau] or early CTE? Would it be useful in screening NCAA [football] players? Probably unlikely.\"\n\nA 2019 Boston University scanning study that compared 26 former NFL players suffering from symptoms associated with CTE and 31 people with no history of head injuries or symptoms was similarly suggestive -- and similarly inconclusive. At the group level, the football retirees had higher p-tau levels in their brains than the non-players; among individuals, retirees who had played the longest had the highest levels. However, some of the retirees had the same levels of p-tau as individual non-players, and researchers found no correlation between p-tau levels and symptom severity.\n\nStern, the Boston University researcher and one of the study's co-authors, believes that the tracer used to detect p-tau, a compound called flortaucipir, may prove inadequate for a reliable CTE test. \"It can bind to stuff in and around the brain that is not abnormal tau,\" he says, \"and that may alter how the scans are interpreted.\" Improved compounds are being developed; last year, British scientists found that the p-tau in CTE has a unique atomic structure compared with the p-tau that can build up in other neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's, a discovery that they believe could lead to a CTE-specific tracer.\n\nEven if that happens, doctors still will need to scan a large number of suspected CTE patients, track them over time and examine them after death to validate that the yellow and red areas seen in scans correspond to what's actually inside their brains. That process will likely take years. When researchers previously worked to validate the PET scans now used to detect beta-amyloid in the brains of Alzheimer's patients, Gandy says, they were able to move relatively quickly because it is easier for doctors to find patients with Alzheimer's near the end of their lives. By contrast, he says, there are \"fewer people with CTE. And the disease isn't necessarily going to kill them within the next six months.\"\n\nBut Stern feels a sense of urgency and wants to speed things up. He is heading the largest and most thorough study designed to identify CTE in living people. The seven-year, $16 million project funded by the National Institutes of Health has put 180 former NFL and college football players and 60 noncontact-sport control subjects through a series of tests including two PET scans; two other types of imaging; blood, saliva and spinal-fluid collection; genetic evaluations; neuropsychological testing; and clinical examinations and histories.\n\nOne of the study's goals is to use imaging alongside the other biomarkers to create a detection tool kit for CTE -- if a scan alone isn't enough to diagnose the disease, then perhaps a scan plus, say, high levels of a chemical in the blood that indicates brain trauma will be. Researchers also hope to find a simple, inexpensive screening method to help doctors determine which patients need costly PET scans and other diagnostic procedures, the way doctors looking for prostate cancer use blood tests to decide who needs more thorough examination. \"There are great stretches of the world where you can't plug in a PET scanner,\" Gandy says. \"Having a blood test [to screen for CTE] would make it more available and convenient.\"\n\nInitial testing in Stern's study was completed in late February, just days before the coronavirus pandemic shut down college campuses and research labs across the country. Working from home and conferring regularly via video chat, researchers in the study are analyzing the data that they've collected and expect to submit the first papers reporting their findings to medical journals before the end of the year. \"It's a long road,\" Stern says. \"The more neuroscience moves forward making discoveries about the brain, the more we realize how complex it is.\"\n\nOn a cool and sunny Saturday afternoon last fall, Morey stood on the sideline at the Lawrenceville School in Lawrenceville, N.J., holding a kickoff coverage play sheet he designed himself. Since 2016, he has been an assistant football coach at the private prep school, which has been playing the sport since the 1800s. Outside the Lawrenceville locker room, players lined up to take the field. It was Senior Day. \"Let's do it one more time!\" someone yelled.\n\nWhat Morey loved most about football was community: the relationships with teammates and coaches, the shared sense of sacrifice, the pursuit of a common goal. Brain injuries often have left him isolated. Over time and by himself, Morey has shuffled through doctors and medications, searching for relief. Today, brain injury specialists have prescribed that he take a stimulant for focus, an antidepressant that he says \"lengthens the fuse\" on his blowups, and a blood pressure medication that softens his migraines. He says that he spends roughly $20,000 a year on treatment. He has worked for the athletic department at Princeton University, where his wife coaches the women's hockey team, and held speed training clinics for local athletes. He also advises Maven Diagnostic, a company working on rapid covid-19 testing in sports. But a full-time job isn't feasible.\n\nMaybe the hardest thing about his condition, Morey says, is its invisibility. When you have a bum knee, others can see the swelling in the joint, the brace around your leg, the crutches you're using to get around. Nobody says that you're faking a limp, or that your inability to climb stairs is all in your head. Not so with a battered brain. After Morey retired from football, a neurologist who examined him in 2012 for a workers' compensation claim concluded that while \"multiple concussions can certainly result in some cumulative cognitive impairment,\" Morey's problems were \"substantially if not completely the result of his psychological state\" -- and not the result of brain damage from getting hit in the head. The neurologist based that conclusion, in part, on MRI and electroencephalogram (EEG) scans of Morey's brain that did not \"confirm the presence of a structural brain injury.\" But those types of scans are less sensitive than the ones used by Gandy and Stern.\n\nThe NFL publicly touts its commitment to player health and safety, and four years ago announced plans to donate $100 million toward technological and medical research aimed at improving helmet safety and better understanding brain injuries. \"It is clear there can be long-term health risks associated with repetitive head injuries, particularly if they are not treated properly,\" NFL chief medical officer Allen Sills said in a statement. \"Close attention needs to be paid to these research findings and collectively the research community must work together to seek more answers. Specifically, researchers and clinicians continue to work together to answer important questions about CTE, including how and why the disease manifests itself, who is at risk, and why.\"\n\nHowever, the NFL also spent years downplaying and denying the damage its product can cause, conducting since-discredited scientific research in the 1990s and 2000s that, in part, claimed concussions \"are not serious injuries\" and admitted only in 2016 that there is a link between football and CTE. Similarly, the league's concussion settlement, which covers roughly 20,500 retired players, only pays CTE claims to the families of players posthumously diagnosed with the disease between 2006 and April 2015. It also does not compensate mood and behavior disorders associated with CTE. Lawyers who negotiated the deal said it was the best they could do given that the disease can't be diagnosed in the living; between 2014 and 2016, Morey organized an unsuccessful legal challenge that attempted to remove those restrictions.\n\nAll of this made Morey eager to have his brain scanned by Gandy, because seeing, he says, is believing. \"So much of the imaging that was discussed or debated or referenced for years and years was simply not sensitive enough to identify the damage that players had been sustaining,\" Morey says. \"Doctors and lawyers could point to that and suggest there were no long-term outcomes from football, even though guys were suffering.\n\n\"There must have been so many people experiencing these issues who were painted as bulls---ting or crazy. Don't f---ing call us crazy. We're not crazy. We're hurting and we need help.\"\n\nA viable CTE test for living people could prompt a deeper and more widespread reckoning within football. What happens when someone scans the brains of every player on an NFL, college or high school roster? Autopsies have found the disease at every level of the sport. How much red is too much? \"People in football are making a similar choice right now with covid: At what point is it not safe for me to play, or let my kids play, this sport?\" Morey says. \"Having some sort of objective scientific test for CTE could help inform the decision-making process for coaches and administrators determining the appropriate time to begin playing, and of athletes who want to understand the extent of the injuries they've sustained and when it's time to walk away. ... I love football. Unapologetically. But you don't want to sacrifice more than you're willing to in order to compete.\"\n\nThe existence of a test may also force other decisions, such as whether you even want to know you have CTE before there are effective treatments. For decades, Alzheimer's researchers have focused on imaging beta-amyloid within the brain and creating compounds to get rid of it. They have succeeded at both, yet have failed to cure the disease. \"We have a drug that purges your brain of amyloid, and your symptoms still get worse,\" Gandy says.\n\nGandy has faced this testing dilemma himself. Last year, he applied to participate in an Alzheimer's prevention clinical trial -- not as a researcher, but as a subject. For the first time in Gandy's life, his brain was scanned. Ultimately, the test came back negative. But the week-long wait for results was excruciating. Gandy felt helpless. He thought about his grandmother and mother, and all of the patients he had seen over his long career -- all of the suffering he could not alleviate, all of the jigsaw pieces he had yet to connect. \"The whole week,\" he says, \"I was thinking, 'How am I going to live with knowing that my head is full of amyloid?' \"\n\nBut Morey says he would still want to know whether he has CTE. When you're afraid of what you might find, he says, it's easier not to look. Yet while seeing his scans was sobering, it also was oddly comforting. \"I always perceived [my scans] as the first step in a process,\" Morey says, pausing to find the right words. \"A process of trying to gain, like, the truth.\"",

    "These are the top coronavirus vaccines to watch": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "July 27 | Vaccines developed by Pfizer and biotechnology company Moderna begin the last phase of testing: 30,000-person trials\n\nThe worldwide effort to create a vaccine for the novel coronavirus kicked off in January, soon after scientists in China posted online the genome of a virus causing a mysterious pneumonia. Vaccine development usually takes years and unfolds step by step. Experimental vaccine candidates are created in the laboratory and tested in animals before moving into progressively larger human clinical trials.\n\nThese steps are now overlapping in the race to find a vaccine for a global disease that has killed hundreds of thousands of people. Human testing began in some cases before animal studies were finished. As companies launch small Phase 1 trials intended to establish the correct dose, they already are planning the Phase 3 trials that evaluate whether the vaccines are effective and safe.\n\n[A vaccine, or a spike in deaths: How America can build herd immunity to the coronavirus]\n\nNo steps are being skipped, top government officials have repeatedly promised, and vaccines will not be considered for approval in the United States until after a large, Phase 3 trial. The Food and Drug Administration, which has the ultimate say on whether a vaccine has been proved safe and effective, says a vaccine for covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, will need to prevent disease or decrease symptoms in at least 50 percent of those who receive it. The effectiveness of the flu vaccine ranges from 40 to 60 percent, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nOther countries may use different standards or authorize vaccines without waiting for proof they are safe and effective. Russia announced it would begin using its vaccine in people at high risk for the virus in August, before starting its Phase 3 trial. China has authorized a vaccine for use in members of the military.\n\nResearchers in the United States set an audacious goal in January to develop a coronavirus vaccine within 12 to 18 months. This would be a world record. The mumps vaccine is considered to be the fastest to move, in four years, from scientific concept to approval in 1967. The quest for an HIV vaccine continues, 36 years and counting.\n\nCoronavirus vaccines are moving much faster, partly because governments are taking on the financial risk of developing a vaccine that may not work. Through Operation Warp Speed, the U.S. government has invested about $9.5 billion to speed up development and jump-start manufacturing before research is finished.\n\nAdvancements in science and technology have given researchers new tools to try against the coronavirus. Scientists can deliver genetic material into the body's cells, turning them into vaccine factories and skipping time-consuming steps such as manufacturing viral proteins or growing the whole virus in chicken eggs.\n\nThe core of the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 is a single strip of ribonucleic acid (RNA) surrounded by a protein shell. The virus is named for the iconic spikes that project from its center like a crown, or \"corona\" in Latin. These spike proteins aren't just decoration. They are critical for the virus to get inside cells and make copies of itself.\n\nVaccines work by teaching the body's immune system to recognize and block viruses. Each category of vaccine technology works under this basic principle. Vaccines aim to activate the immune system's T-helper cells, which are responsible for detecting the presence of a virus. They instruct B-cells to create antibodies that block the virus from being able to replicate and T-killer cells to destroy infected cells. Some vaccines may activate only part of this immune response.\n\nHere is a look at how different vaccine technologies being developed around the world would ideally elicit an immune response to prevent SARS-CoV-2 in humans. Each vaccine may vary somewhat in how it works, but each would generally follow these steps.\n\nDNA vaccines contain genetic material that carries the blueprint for the spike protein. To get the DNA into cells, researchers use an electrical pulse to disrupt the cell membrane. Once inside, the DNA is used as a template to create spike protein.\n\nRNA vaccines contain a strip of genetic material within a fat bubble. Once inside the cell, the RNA generates a protein found on the surface of the virus. The immune system, presented with the protein, learns to recognize the virus.\n\nThese vaccines have the advantage of speed -- they can be quickly designed and manufactured. But they have never been approved for use outside of medical research and will likely require two doses.\n\nSome vaccines use a virus that has been engineered to be harmless to ferry a gene from the coronavirus into cells. The gene codes for a distinctive part of the coronavirus, and the immune system learns to recognize it.\n\nViral-vectored vaccines can be designed quickly. One concern is that people can develop immunity to the viral vector, making this approach potentially less useful if booster shots need to be given.\n\nSome traditional vaccines work by delivering viral proteins to cells. The technologies to manufacture those protein fragments vary, but companies are using insect cells and yeast. The hepatitis B vaccine relies on a viral protein created by genetically engineered yeast.\n\nIn a more old-fashioned approach, the virus is weakened so that it does not cause disease, but still triggers the immune system's defenses. The vaccine for measles, mumps and rubella uses this approach.\n\nInactivated virus vaccines contain dead virus, incapable of infecting people but still able to instruct the immune system how to mount a defensive reaction against an infection. The polio vaccine invented by Jonas Salk used this approach, and flu vaccines use this technology.\n\nThese vaccines typically take longer to manufacture.\n\nInformation on the technology platform being used was not available for all the experimental vaccines. Some vaccines being tested do not specifically target the coronavirus, but aim to increase the body's first line of immune defenses.",

        "authors": [],
        "body": "On Wednesday, Google is making county-level data on symptom searches in the United States available to researchers and the public. The information goes back three years and includes up to 400 symptoms and conditions, not just those known to be associated with covid-19. It will have information on searches for things such as stress and diabetes so experts can learn more about secondary health impacts.\n\nWhat it's like to suffer from the coronavirus's weirdest symptom\n\nThe company has done some work to clean up the data for researchers, such as figuring out which search terms all describe a single symptom. For example, few people are going to type in \"anosmia\" when they lose their sense of smell or taste. They're more likely to type something like \"loss of smell covid\" or \"why can't I taste this cantaloupe.\"\n\nAll the data is anonymized and not connected to individual users, says the company. Instead of actual numbers of people looking up a symptom in a single area, Google will present the volume of searches for each symptom as a range.\n\nGoogle aims to stop terrifying you with its responses when you search medical symptoms\n\nThe company tried to do something similar with symptom search data in the past. Google Flu Trends was a program that launched in 2008 to use symptom searches to predict flu outbreaks. It was originally accurate, but after a number of years, the results diverged from what was being found by public health organizations such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nEventually the program was shut down. However, Google has continued to provide flu and other health search data to researchers who have used it to monitor things such as Lyme disease and the spread of foodborne illnesses.\n\nWith the coronavirus data set, Google says it is not trying to make any predictions itself, but allow outside researchers to dig in, combine it with other data for increased accuracy and learn more about what is still a relatively new disease.",

        "authors": [],
        "body": "The 2,015 new daily infections is the state's highest daily total, but includes numbers that should have been reported Wednesday and Thursday. Distributing the cases among recent days still lifted Virginia's seven-day average caseload to 1,142 -- second only to a record set May 31.\n\nThe spike fueled the greater Washingon region's third-highest daily number of infections since the start of the pandemic. It also dented progress in the region, which has seen caseloads plateau in recent days after more than doubling in July.\n\nCoronavirus cases plateau across D.C. area as region's caseload surpasses 200,000\n\nVirginia's cases reported Friday were from across the state and were enough to lift Northern Virginia's seven-day average to its highest level since June 13. Prince William and Fairfax counties reported the most new cases in the state.\n\nThe Virginia Department of Health blamed the reporting problem on a technical issue in its covid-19 database. Officials said it was discovered late Thursday by the state's Office of Information Management and the problem was fixed.\n\nThe state's one-day spike comes the day after known coronavirus cases in D.C., Virginia and Maryland surpassed 200,000. Health experts have said the region could be turning a corner after slight case declines in hot spots such as Virginia's Hampton Roads region and the Baltimore metro area.\n\nEven with Friday's increase, infections in the Hampton Roads area have generally ticked downward in recent days.\n\nAnn Monroe, an epidemiologist at George Washington University's Milken Institute School of Public Health, said the Washington area continues to see ups and downs in its caseloads, and residents should continue to be cautious.\n\nThe seven-day average of new daily cases in D.C., Maryland and Virginia more than doubled during July, ending above 2,000. Monroe called the increases over the past month \"disheartening.\"\n\n\"There are still groups of individuals who are congregating without masks and in close quarters,\" she said.\n\nMonroe said some people are traveling out of the D.C. region to attend gatherings in parts of the country considered hot spots, then returning home and testing positive. She said other spread is happening locally among essential employees such as health-care workers, grocery store clerks, and bus drivers.\n\n\"They're doing their best, but their jobs just put them at higher risks,\" Monroe said.\n\nThey got tested for coronavirus. Now, they wait. Growing delays have put lives in limbo.\n\nShe worried that a lengthy turnaround time on getting test results could be discouraging people from getting tested. Some patients in the Washington region who were told their tests would take a few days have waited longer than two weeks to get results, which loses the opportunity for meaningful contact tracing.\n\nMonroe urged anyone with possible exposure or who is showing symptoms to get tested and quarantine until results come back.\n\nHealth experts are also looking at whether cases increased after weeks of protests in the capital region around the death of George Floyd, but Monroe said initial findings indicate there wasn't a surge of positive cases. She noted that some people who didn't show symptoms or get tested still could have passed the virus to others.\n\nCoronavirus cases and metrics in D.C., Maryland and Virginia\n\nThe number of cases since the start of the pandemic in D.C., Maryland and Virginia reached 204,277 on Friday, with 2,887 new cases and 34 new deaths.\n\nThe District reported 71 new cases and two deaths, while Maryland had 801 new cases and 14 deaths. In addition to Virginia's record daily caseload, the state also added 18 deaths.\n\nMaryland's seven-day coronavirus test positivity rate declined Friday for a third consecutive day, dropping below 4 percent for the first time. Montgomery County's rate hit a record low of 2.5 percent.\n\nIn Baltimore, a mayoral executive order to retore indoor dining at limited capacity with social distancing measures in place will go into effect at 5 p.m. Friday. The decision from Baltimore Mayor Bernard C. \"Jack\" Young (D) comes two weeks after he suspended dining inside bars and restaurants to battle a growing virus caseload in the city.\n\nThe city's seven-day average caseload dropped to 150 on Friday, its lowest level since July 26.",

Their desks are spread far apart and senators are required to wear masks.\n\nSchaar and a staffer built a three-sided plexiglass box before the Senate's one-day session in April to provide extra protection for Sen. George L. Barker (D-Fairfax), who had open-heart surgery and pneumonia last year.\n\nA second box appeared last week for Sen. Amanda F. Chase (R-Chesterfield), who has worn a mask in the past but lately has said she has a medical condition that prevents her from wearing one. She has declined to discuss the condition.\n\nSenators plan to reconvene beginning Wednesday for the session, which Gov. Ralph Northam (D) called to address budget, policing and criminal justice issues raised by the pandemic and the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis police custody.\n\nVirginia lawmakers haggle over details of meeting in special legislative session\n\n\"I cannot imagine that Anthony Fauci himself could walk through the chamber and not approve,\" said Jeff Ryer, spokesman for the Senate GOP caucus, referring to the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. \"The clerk's office has scrupulously and strictly and stringently followed every guideline that the CDC offers.\"\n\nHouse Speaker Eileen Filler-Corn (D-Fairfax) has taken a different course to try to keep the state's 100 delegates safe. The House kicked off the special session on a basketball arena at Virginia Commonwealth University, but after that, Democrats muscled through a vote to allow the House to convene online.\n\nAfter Reeves's condition became known, Filler-Corn tweeted that the House wishes him \"a full recovery. We hope that all Senators and staff are in good health and remain safe at the General Assembly handles the important business of this Special Session.\"\n\nReeves, who unsuccessfully sought the GOP nomination for lieutenant governor in 2017, said he thinks he may have picked up the virus by touching \"a gas nozzle or a door somewhere.\"\n\n\"I have zero symptoms of a fever, chills, or anything,\" he said in a text message. \"Literally I thought it was my seasonal allergies or a light cold. ...

    "Virginia to study presence of coronavirus antibodies in N.Va. children": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "The study will look at as many as 1,000 people under 20 who are receiving care at participating clinical sites. It is being conducted with Inova Health System and will determine the proportion of children and teens with covid-19 antibodies.\n\nScientists have tested people's blood to see whether a person may have antibodies that provide immunity to the coronavirus, but there is uncertainty as to how long that immunity lasts or if people may just get less severe symptoms.\n\nA July study that included Virginia adults found that about 2.4 percent of residents in the state have covid-19 antibodies. That number jumped to 4.2 percent of residents in Northern Virginia.\n\nGov. Ralph Northam (D), a pediatrician, said in a statement that children are \"impacted by the disease in a different way than adults.\" He added that the study will provide insight into how covid-19 spreads among different ages and demographic groups.\n\nNorthern Virginia was selected because of its number of pediatric covid-19 cases and because of the region's socioeconomic and racial diversity, officials said. The data will also be used to determine how many children have been infected with the virus who might have had mild or asymptomatic infections.\n\n\"It's important to recognize that more than 95 percent of Virginians have not yet been exposed to the covid-19 virus and remain at risk of infection,\" Virginia health commissioner M. Norman Oliver said in a statement.\n\nCoronavirus cases, deaths and the latest metrics in the Washington region\n\nD.C., Maryland and Virginia reported 1,942 new infections Thursday, bringing the total number of cases since the start of the pandemic to 214,806. It's the highest daily total in the greater Washington region since Saturday.\n\nThe three jurisdictions also added 20 new fatalities.\n\nD.C. added 65 new cases and one death, Maryland added 776 new cases and eight deaths, while Virginia added 1,101 new cases and 11 deaths. Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan (R) touted the state's record-low seven-day average test positivity rate, which dropped to 3.49 percent. In Baltimore, it dropped to a record low of 4.32 percent.\n\nThe greater Washington region continued to see jobless claims rise as the pandemic hits the economy, although the increase was slower than in recent weeks.\n\nThe Labor Department announced Thursday that 24,024 unemployment claims were filed in D.C., Maryland and Virginia for the week ending Aug. 8, down from 37,003 one week earlier. More than 1.5 million people in the region have filed for unemployment benefits since the start of the pandemic.\n\nNationally, about 960,000 workers filed jobless claims last week. It was the first time the number has dropped below 1 million since mid-March.",

    "WHO: Children aged 6-to-11 should wear masks at times, too": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "The recommendations presented Monday follow the widespread belief that children under 12 are not considered as likely to propagate the virus as much as adults. Children in general face less severe virus symptoms than do adults, with the elderly the most vulnerable to severe infection and death.\n\nNow WHO says decisions about whether children aged 6 to 11 should wear masks should consider factors like whether COVID-19 transmission is widespread in the area where the child lives; the child's ability to safely use a mask; and adult supervision when taking the masks on or off.\n\n\"Luckily, the vast majority of children who are infected with the virus appear to have mild disease or asymptomatic infection, and that's good news,\" said Maria Van Kerkhove, technical chief of the U.N. health agency's emergencies program.\n\nShe still cautioned that some children can develop severe cases of coronavirus and even die.\n\nThe shift comes as confirmed COVID-19 infections worldwide have surpassed 23 million and confirmed deaths have passed 809,000, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University. Experts say the tally understates the true toll of the pandemic due to limited testing, missed mild cases and other factors.\n\nThe U.N. health agency for months trailed many governments in backing the widespread use of masks, a point not lost on critics, who said WHO was too slow to get on board with the benefits of general mask use. WHO had expressed concern that people who put on masks might unwittingly spread the virus from an unclean hand to their face, and insisted that health-care providers needed masks first amid some shortages.\n\nSince then, researchers have found that the virus can be transmitted through aerosols -- tiny droplets emitted when people talk, laugh, sing or sneeze -- and mask-wearing can cut down on the amount of virus that people are exposed to.\n\nSome policymakers, including public transport authorities in Europe and elsewhere, have set the bar for mask-wearing in crowded places like buses and trains at age 12 -- with everyone older required to put them on.\n\nAcknowledging gaps in both research and understanding of the virus, WHO said kids under age 6 should not wear masks, while those 12 to 18 should wear them just like adults should -- notably in cases where physical distancing cannot be ensured and in areas of high transmission.\n\nWHO advises a \"risk-based approach\" for kids aged 6 to 11 that balances various factors.\n\n\"Everyone agrees how important it is that schools are operating safely,\" Van Kerkhove said. \"We've outlined how that can be done in terms of physical distancing and hand hygiene stations, respiratory etiquette, the potential use of masks by either the workers or the children themselves.\"\n\nWHO said the current evidence suggests virus cases reported from kids stemmed mostly from transmission within households and that \"documented transmission among children and staff within educational settings is limited.\"\n\nParents, health officials and educators in countries around the world have been wrestling with the safety questions posed by having millions of children go back to school during a pandemic.\n\nOver the weekend, Britain's top public health officials issued a joint statement saying that children were more likely be harmed by staying away from school than from being exposed to COVID-19.\n\nThey said children are less likely to catch COVID-19 than adults and have \"an exceptionally low risk'' of dying from the disease. By contrast, they said studies show that not going to school limits children's ability to succeed in life and may worsen physical and mental health problems.\n\n\"Very few, if any, children or teenagers will come to long-term harm from COVID-19 due solely to attending school,'' the medical officers said. \"This has to be set against a certainty of long-term harm to many children and young people from not attending school.''\n\nThe recommendations by WHO on Monday also noted lingering uncertainty about the effectiveness of transparent face shields, with WHO calling for more research into their use in response to COVID-19.\n\n___\n\nDanica Kirka in London contributed to this story.\n\n___\n\nFollow AP's pandemic coverage at http://apnews.com/VirusOutbreak and https://apnews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak\n\nCopyright 2020 The Associated Press.
