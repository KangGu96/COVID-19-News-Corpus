    "#WeAreUnited to COVID-19 whistleblowing: College athletes speak out": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "The issues have been simmering in college sports for decades -- festering cracks in the foundation of a multi-billion dollar industry.\n\nAthletes have long had concerns about their health and well-being. They've long questioned a financial model that bars them from receiving outside income. They've long shown passion for issues of racial injustice and inequality.\n\nYet in the past few months -- and, in particular, the past week -- athletes have raised their collective voices to address these issues like rarely before, fueled by health concerns stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic and a belief that unity can lead to structural change.\n\nOver the past four days alone, a group of Pac-12 football players have published a list of demands and threatened to opt out of the upcoming season if they are not met. An athlete-led group called College Athlete Unity wrote a letter purportedly on behalf of more than 1,000 Big Ten football players to call for the adoption of uniform COVID-19 protocols. And at individual schools from Colorado State to Eastern Kentucky, football players have spoken out about what they describe as lax or unenforced COVID-19 safety protocols, alleging disinterest or negligence from coaching staffs.\n\nMore: Opinion: Athletes are paying attention, don't like what they hear in push to start college football\n\nMore: Opinion: College football programs fighting another opponent in pandemic: mental health\n\n\"Players are exerting their own voice,\" said Ellen Staurowsky, a professor of sports management at Drexel University who has long been an advocate for athletes' rights. \"I really think that this is a moment that speaks both to the failures of the system as well as to the circumstances of the time.\"\n\nAthletes in the Pac-12 were the first to seek specific changes on a conference-wide level this week, demanding everything from a share of revenue and uniform COVID-19 countermeasures to the creation of a permanent civic-engagement task force to address racial injustice.\n\nThe group, which also counts Cal cross-country athlete Andrew Cooper among its leaders, met with officials from the California governor's office Tuesday and hopes to meet with Pac-12 leadership to discuss its concerns.\n\n\"Each day that the Pac-12 delays ... it continues to put our health at serious risk,\" USC cornerback Chase Williams, one of the group's members, said in a statement Wednesday.\n\nMembers of the group, which uses the hashtag #WeAreUnited on social media, said the movement has only continued to grow in the days since it made its demands public Sunday and has burgeoning support across the college sports landscape.\n\n\"It's something that's spreading quickly, kind of like a wildfire at this point,\" Washington State defensive back Pat Nunn told USA TODAY Sports earlier this week. \"Everybody and anybody (is) hopping on board if they agree with it.\"\n\nZachary Carter, a defensive lineman at Florida, is among dozens of players outside the Pac-12 who have been amplifying the movement on social media. He told USA TODAY Sports he is trying to inform other college football players, including those at Florida and other Southeastern Conference schools, about the Pac-12 group's core issues -- safety and health during a pandemic, racial justice and compensation for players.\n\n\"I'm just trying to speak up,\" said Carter, who added he has been in touch with about 100 other players from a variety of Power Five conferences who have been discussing the same issues in group chats.\n\n\"I'm not in the Pac-12, so technically I'm not part of the movement. But I support what those guys are doing and I'm just trying to bring light to these issues.\"\n\nRamogi Huma, founder and president of the National College Players Association, said he has worked with the Pac-12 athletes in an advisory capacity and expects the movement to pick up steam.\n\n\"I can say that for sure,\" Huma told USA TODAY Sports on Monday. \"I think a lot of this will be fluid. You see players retweeting all around the nation from other schools, so who knows. But I think there's a lot of interest. You can see it just on social media.\"\n\nSeveral Football Bowl Subdivision players have opted out of the upcoming season due to concerns about COVID-19 or other issues outlined by the #WeAreUnited group, including Nunn and two of his Washington State teammates.\n\nIn the Big Ten, a similar movement -- using the hashtag #BigTenUnited -- has not threatened opt-outs en masse but did release a series of proposals Wednesday. The group said it had \"started a dialogue in good faith with the Big Ten\" and hoped to provide input to the NCAA, too.\n\n\"The NCAA -- which is known for its zeal for regulations and enforcement -- has had ample time to prepare for the safe return of its athletes to competition, yet it has done nothing,\" the group wrote in the letter, which was published by The Players' Tribune on Wednesday.\n\nLess than an hour later, the NCAA Board of Governors announced a series of requirements for its member schools related to COVID-19, several of which were in line with demands from the Pac-12 and Big Ten groups. Among them: Schools must ensure athletes who opt out of competition due to COVID-19 be allowed to retain their scholarships, must cover COVID-19 related medical expenses and cannot require athletes to sign COVID-19 liability waivers in order to play.\n\nThe #WeAreUnited leaders from the Pac-12, who said they had been in touch with the Big Ten group and encouraged their efforts, hailed the developments as \"important victories\" in a news release distributed Wednesday evening.\n\nOther athletes, meanwhile, have made their voices heard by speaking out about situations at individual schools.\n\nIn a story published Tuesday by The Coloradoan, which is part of the USA TODAY Network, 10 players and staff members alleged that coaches have shown a lax attitude toward COVID-19 protocols -- or, as one player alleged, even told players not to report symptoms. (Colorado State president Joyce McConnell has since said the school will investigate the athletic department's handling of COVID-19 safety protocols.)\n\nMeanwhile, at Eastern Kentucky, kicker Landon White wrote on Instagram that he was leaving the team because \"the coach and some staff, do not care about player safety.\" He claimed, among other things, that the team continued to practice even when some players showed symptoms of COVID-19.\n\n\"This is a tough day for me, but somebody has gotta tell the truth on what us athletes are going through during this pandemic,\" White wrote.\n\n\"The health, safety and overall well-being of our student-athletes will always be a primary priority,\" EKU athletic director Matt Roan said in a statement Wednesday. \"Head Football Coach Walt Wells and I have met continuously to ensure that football operations continue to adhere to local, state and health organization guidelines.\"\n\nThe recent efforts to shed light on perceived misconduct, often on social media, follow similar instances earlier this summer, amid the country's racial reckoning in the wake of the death of George Floyd.\n\nAt Iowa, for example, university leadership commissioned an investigation into the football program after current and former players alleged misconduct and racial bias within the staff -- including allegations against strength and conditioning coach Chris Doyle, who later left his post. And at Oklahoma State, star running back Chuba Hubbard publicly rebuked coach Mike Gundy for his support of a right-wing news network.\n\nMichael Hausfeld, the lead attorney in former UCLA basketball star Ed O'Bannon's antitrust lawsuit against the NCAA, said that while college athletes potentially face risks in coming forward, they are becoming bolder about challenging the current system.\n\n\"They have a great deal at stake,\" Hausfeld said, \"but they realize that there's been a great exploitation of the imbalance between the athletes and the association and it needs to be righted.\n\n\"You're dealing in an environment where a lot that has previously been suppressed in terms of such imbalances or inequities is being voiced more openly. I think the athletes are right on in terms of coming forward visibly.\"\n\nContributing: USA TODAY Sports' Steve Berkowitz; The Louisville (Ky,) Courier-Journal, Associated Press",

    "A flu shot doesn't always protect you. But amid the COVID-19 pandemic, it is more important than ever.": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "Producers are boosting supplies of the flu vaccine this year to meet what they expect will be higher demand. CVS stores already have the flu vaccine in stock and vaccines are available as of Monday at Walgreens.\n\nVaccine maker Sanofi plans to hold a news conference Monday morning announcing that it will produce 15% more vaccine than in a normal year.\n\n\"Flu vaccines work and they can take a big burden off our medical infrastructure,\" John Shiver, global head of vaccines research and development for the company, said last week. \"Let's keep people out of the hospital with flu while we deal with a likely upswing in COVID infections.\"\n\nThe flu shot isn't always effective, but it's much better than nothing, said Dr. Shira Doron, an infectious disease physician and hospital epidemiologist at Tufts Medical Center in Boston.\n\nThe U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that everyone six months and older get a flu vaccine every year. The agency did not respond to a request for comment about this year's situation.\n\nThe CDC recommends people get a flu vaccine by the end of October - because it takes a few weeks for the vaccine to become fully protective - but also encourages people to get vaccinated later rather than not at all.\n\nIt's hard to know how the flu will interact with COVID-19. The flu season has been mild in the Southern Hemisphere which is usually six months ahead of the U.S. But it isn't clear whether that's because of the flu strains circulating this year, or because the same public health measures that prevent COVID-19 - masks, social distancing and frequent hand washing - also stop flu outbreaks.\n\nSo far, not many people have contracted the flu at the same time as COVID-19. Those sick with both seem to have mild to moderate symptoms, though at least two deaths have been reported.\n\n\"What will co-infection mean is a big area of concern,\" Brownstein said. Considerable research is now underway.\n\nIn 2018-2019, there were about 490,000 people hospitalized because of the flu and more than 35,000 died, in what was considered a \"moderate\" year for the flu. Since March, more than 345,000 Americans have been hospitalized and 170,000 have died from COVID-19.\n\nDr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said in a recent conversation with Cardiology Magazine it's hard to predict what this flu season will look like.\n\n\"The worst-case scenario is we have a very active flu season that overlaps with the respiratory infection of COVID-19,\" he said. \"Worst-case because that would really complicate matters from a diagnostic standpoint, from a therapeutic standpoint, and the standpoint of putting a lot of stress on the health care system.\"\n\nThere are at least three reasons to get the flu vaccine this year, Doron said: for yourself, for others and to reduce fear.\n\nIf the surge in COVID-19 cases continues into flu season, it will be very hard to tell the two apart, she said, \"because they look the same.\"\n\nAnyone who shows up at a hospital with flu-like symptoms, will be treated as a COVID-19 patient. \"People tend not to come near you\" if they think you have COVID-19, she said, so a patient sick with the flu might be denied visitors and treated at a distance, at least at first, she said.\n\nPlus, hospitals are already at risk of being overwhelmed by COVID-19 patients. Adding flu patients on top of that will risk everyone's health, Doron said. \"If we don't have beds or ventilators, you're going to wish you didn't have the flu,\" she said.\n\nDr. Steven Abelowitz, medical director of Coastal Kids, a five-office pediatric practice in Southern California, added another concern: getting students back to school. Reducing cases of flu should make it easier to reopen schools and keep them open, he said.\n\nMost of the parents in his practice have been open to the idea of getting their children vaccinated, he said, though about 20-30% of his patients remain behind in their vaccinations because of closures this spring and avoidance of medical offices during the pandemic.\n\nHis practice has made a point of identifying children who are behind and reaching out to their families with emails, texts and calls, Abelowitz said.\n\nBut he worries if kids remain behind on their vaccines, when the pandemic recedes and people resume more activities, it will give other viruses and bacteria a chance to take hold.\n\nGetting a flu shot may be a little different this year, with some clinics moving out of doors, and shuttered workplaces not offering vaccines.\n\nBut Doron said getting a flu shot at a local pharmacy is just as good as anywhere else.\n\n\"Wherever the lines is shortest and whoever has it first is the right place to get it,\" she said.\n\nAnyone looking to get a vaccine at Walgreens will need to be masked and be checked for a fever, and pharmacists will wear face shields and masks, the drugstore chain announced Monday.\n\nWhile many hospitals make the flu vaccine a condition of employment, except in the case of a diagnosed allergy, Tufts has not yet, Doron said. But 97% of employees have been vaccinated in recent years.\n\nThere's a theoretical chance that getting a flu vaccine when you are currently infected with COVID-19 could make the infection worse, but no one has ever seen this reaction, said Sanofi's Shiver.\n\nAnd that theoretical risk is \"not a good reason to avoid getting the flu vaccine,\" Shiver said. It's just as plausible that ramping up the immune system with a flu vaccine will help someone who is currently fighting COVID-19, he said.\n\nHopefully, efforts to contain COVID-19 will minimize the risk of flu this year, Doron said.\n\n\"I would totally expect that what we're doing with distancing and mask-wearing and hand hygiene and certain businesses being closed - it has brought down COVID in Massachusetts and elsewhere, and there's no reason it won't have the same effect on flu,\" she said, adding that flu vanished earlier than usual with the lockdown in March.\n\nBut Brownstein, of Boston Children's, said people shouldn't use that as an excuse not to get their flu shot.",

    "Acute flaccid myelitis: CDC anticipates AFM case increase in 2020": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention anticipates 2020 will be another peak year for cases of acute flaccid myelitis, or AFM, the mysterious polio-like illness that causes paralysis in children.\n\nThe agency attributes this increase in cases to enteroviruses, particularly EV-D68, according to the CDC Vital Signs report released Tuesday. It's the most common virus identified among patients with AFM.\n\nResearchers had pinpointed enteroviruses in the past, suggesting the devastating disease could be caused by this strain of respiratory virus. Results of a fall study were published by the University of California, San Francisco, in the peer-reviewed journal Nature Medicine in October 2019.\n\nThe CDC said the disease has peaked every two years between August and November in the United States since 2014, when the CDC first began AFM surveillance.\n\nFewer than one in a million children are affected by AFM, but cases have grown over the years.\n\nWhile other countries have reported cases, including Canada, France, Britain and Norway, the size and pattern of the U.S. outbreaks have been more pronounced. More than 550 Americans have been struck this decade. The oldest was 32. More than 90% were children, most around 4, 5 or 6 years old.\n\nAFM cases are still exceedingly rare, but the results are devastating. It can paralyze a child's arms and legs. Some need ventilators to breathe. It can also cause muscle weakness, slurred speech and difficulty moving eyes and swallowing.\n\nWhat parents should know: About the polio-like paralyzing disease the CDC is warning about\n\nMany families say their children have regained at least some movement in affected limbs, but stories of complete recovery are unusual.\n\nWhile symptoms of the disease resemble polio, the CDC said all AFM patients tested negative for the poliovirus.\n\nThe agency also reported 35% of patients weren't hospitalized until two or more days after limb weakness in 2018, delaying care that could be vital to patient treatment.\n\n\"Recognition and early diagnosis are critical,\" said CDC director Dr. Robert Redfield. \"CDC and public health partners have strengthened early disease detection systems, a vital step toward rapid treatment and rehabilitation for children with AFM.\"\n\nDr. Thomas Clark, deputy director of the CDC's division of viral diseases, says the COVID-19 pandemic may require clinicians to perform evaluations by phone or telemedicine. However, he urges doctors not to delay hospitalization when they suspect AFM.\n\nDr. Robert Glatter, emergency physician at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City, said there has been a sharp decrease in emergency room visits not related to COVID-19.\n\nHe predicts the pandemic's impact on the health care system and access to medical care will \"most likely have an adverse effect on our ability to detect, refer and rapidly evaluate patients with AFM.\"\n\n\"While we recognize that parents are concerned about the risks of COVID-19 when making a visit to the ER, the greater risks of permanent paralysis and mechanical ventilation resulting from AFM should take precedence,\" he said.\n\nCommon early symptoms of AFM include difficulty walking, neck or back pain, fever and limb pain. There is currently no specific test, proven treatment or prevention method for AFM.\n\nContributing: Mike Stobbe, Associated Press. Follow Adrianna Rodriguez on Twitter: @AdriannaUSAT.",

    "After Kenosha: Guns, militia inject chilling dimension into protests": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "As Kyle Rittenhouse secured a legal team Friday after being charged in the fatal shooting of two men at a protest against police brutality, demonstrators and law enforcement grapple with how the deadly gunfire in Kenosha, Wisconsin, has injected a chilling and long-feared dimension into protests.\n\n\"We have been very fortunate that shootings have been rare at demonstrations where emotions are already running high, but (Kenosha) is an example of a lot of people's worst fears,\" said Gil Kerlikowske, a former Seattle police chief who also served as Customs and Border Patrol Commissioner during the Obama administration. \"We are living in unbelievably unsettling times.\"\n\nDuring a chaotic night of demonstration sparked by the police shooting of Jacob Blake, Rittenhouse told reporters prior to the deadly confrontation that he was armed with a rifle to protect a local parking lot. Wisconsin law allows for gun-owners to carry their firearms in public, though it is unclear whether the Illinois 17-year-old would have been prohibited as a minor.\n\nIllinois authorities said Friday that attorney John Pierce was now representing Rittenhouse, whose first scheduled court hearing was postponed Friday. Pierce could not be immediately reached for comment, but he vowed on Twitter to assemble a \"Seal Team\" of former federal prosecutors and defense attorneys to assist the teenager.\n\nTIMELINE: Detailed unfolding of events in shooting of Jacob Blake, Kenosha protesters\n\nOn the streets, rocks, bottles, Molotov cocktails and fireworks served as protesters' weapons of choice against bursts of tear gas and rubber bullets. But handguns and rifles, similar to the one Rittenhouse wielded Tuesday night, are increasingly appearing at demonstrations in gun-friendly states that allow their open display -- dangling from holsters and shoulder slings. They also loom as potential game-changers for social justice advocates promoting peaceful resistance.\n\nEarlier this week, at least one protester was wounded by gunfire near Bedford, Pennsylvania, in an encounter with local residents, as marchers were passing through on their way to a weekend demonstration in Washington, D.C. In Idaho, an 18-year-old man was sentenced to four days in jail this month for discharging a weapon near a demonstration in Boise.\n\nOne of the most unsettling events played out in Michigan this spring when armed protesters crowded inside the state Capitol to oppose a statewide coronavirus lock-down. No one was injured in the demonstration, but the images raised a troubling concern for the security of future demonstrations where firearms are readily available.\n\nBrian Levin, director at California State University San Bernardino's Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism, called the introduction of weapons during a contentious demonstration \"a recipe for disaster.\"\n\n\"We have to make sure that police departments have policies on how to manage situations when these (armed) people show up,\" Levin said. \"But unfortunately, the horse seems to have left the barn on that point.\"\n\nThe dreaded mix of guns and large crowds has been a persistent and growing concern for law enforcement for years.\n\nEd Davis, a former Boston police commissioner, said the the violence in Kenosha is the \"inevitable outcome\" when private citizens - armed with military-grade weapons and driven by visceral reactions - take to the streets to assume the role of law enforcement.\n\n\"The utilization of these weapons and the type of response that we've seen in communities like Kenosha, it's just unacceptable,\" Davis said, adding that the risk to life is \"very high when you have untrained individuals utilizing weapons like this.\"\n\nDavis said the unrest on display in Kenosha is a symptom of the most profound racial and political division he has seen in the country in more than three decades in law enforcement.\n\n\"I don't see an easy solution to this,\" he said. \"I think we're in for a tough time between now and November. Hopefully after November ... we can move forward and try to heal, no matter who wins.\"\n\nIn the run-up to the 2016 party conventions, the country was jolted by a pair of deadly shootings that targeted police officers: an ambush in Baton Rouge where three officers died and an attack at a Dallas protest in which five police officers were killed by a gunman who set out to kill white officers following fatal police shootings of Alton Sterling, Philando Castile and other black men.\n\nThe conventions, which featured waves of protesters, were never seriously threatened. Yet the potential risk posed by the introduction of weapons at large, contentious gatherings looms even larger in a country riven by political and racial animus, analysts said.\n\nLast year, as the Secret Secret Service began finalizing its preparations for the 2020 presidential campaign season, cut short by the coronavirus pandemic, a spate of mass shootings added a daunting worst-case scenario to the planning effort.\n\nAgency officials sought the guidance of law enforcement and medical authorities who responded to the 2017 Las Vegas attack on an outdoor music festival in what stands as deadliest mass shooting in American history. The attack, carried out by a single shooter from a hotel room overlooking the music venue, left 59 people dead and more than 400 wounded.\n\nIn a new season of civil unrest and in the midst of another contentious presidential election campaign, \"nothing is so simple anymore and that includes protests,\" said Oren Segal, vice president for the Center on Extremism at the Anti-Defamation League.\n\n\"It used to be that demonstrations involved protesters and counter-protesters. You knew what sides people were on,\" Segal said. \"Now, it's a challenge for law enforcement because you don't know who is coming in; you don't what side they are on. And some of them are carrying guns.\"\n\nSegal said the increasingly \"complicated\" scenario raises a serious question: \"Should we even be allowing people with weapons into spaces like this?\"\n\nAsked why he felt the need for a gun in the midst of social justice protest, Rittenhouse was ready with an answer: \"People are getting injured and our job is to protect this business,\" Rittenhouse told a Daily Caller reporter in video interview. \"And my job also is to protect people. If someone is hurt, I'm running into harm's way. That's why I have my rifle; I've gotta protect myself, obviously. But I also have my med kit.\"\n\nThe encounter would prove more meaningful when it was revealed that Rittenhouse was later charged in connection with the fatal shootings of two men and the wounding of a third victim.\n\nWHAT WE KNOW: The men killed in Kenosha, one 'got along with everybody,' the other leaves behind a young daughter\n\nThe alleged violent encounters appear to be captured in darkened, yet stunning, video showing a rifle-toting man, a cap turned backward on his head, trotting down the middle of a Kenosha street apparently pursued by others before stumbling to the asphalt.\n\nFrom a sitting position, the gunman opens fire and at least two people fall wounded, while protesters scream in fear.\n\nAfter the shooting, video shows the gunman walking quickly toward approaching law enforcement vehicles with his hands up, only to have police pass him by.\n\nThe image, juxtaposed with a separate video of police, guns drawn on Blake before he was shot just days earlier have come to represent in stark relief law enforcement's disproportionate response to Black suspects, analysts said.\n\nFACT CHECK: Jacob Blake did not 'brandish' knife\n\n\"The irony is very difficult to swallow,\" Segal said. \"The images are significant.\"\n\nRittenhouse was far from the only person carrying a gun during Tuesday's protests.\n\nEarlier Tuesday, a local militia, known as the Kenosha Guard, posted their intent to join the protests in a Facebook message that appeared to be directed at local police.\n\n\"We are mobilizing tonight and have about 3,000 RSVP's. Our effort has made the national media. I ask that you do NOT have your officers tell us to go home under threat of arrest as you have in the past. We are willing to talk to KPD and open a dis cussion. It is evident, that no matter how many Officers, deputies and other law enforcement officers that are here, you will still be outnumbered.\"\n\nRittenhouse's own social media posts included references to his strong support of police and his affinity for weapons. An image of Rittenhouse and another man is framed in a blue circle that contains the words: duty, honor, courage and \"Blue lives matter.\" But it was unclear whether the shooting suspect is connected to the militia group.\n\nKenosha County Sheriff David Beth acknowledged the intent for an armed intervention, saying that he fielded an inquiry earlier this week.\n\n\"I had a person call me and say, 'Why don't you deputize citizens who have guns to come out and patrol the city of Kenosha?'\" Beth said Wednesday. \"And I'm like, 'Oh Hell, no.' What happened last night is the perfect reason why I wouldn't.\"\n\nGuy Relford, who has devoted his legal practice to protecting the Second Amendment and recently started a gun rights group in Indiana, acknowledges the right to bear arms to protect their businesses and themselves. (Rittenhouse was not protecting his own business.) But the tense situation in Kenosha raises a lot of uncertainties, especially when guns carried by private citizens are introduced to the mix.\n\n\"If you're looking for a confrontation with a gun, then yeah, that's not going to end well a lot of times,\" Relford said, cautioning that he's not drawing conclusions about the intentions of Rittenhouse. \"And it doesn't shed a good light on those of us who want to responsibly own and use guns and defend ourselves.\"\n\nElizabeth Brown, an advocate for grieving families in Wisconsin, said the fatal shooting of protesters in Kenosha only makes her more determined to continue raising her own voice.\n\n\"I've been a black woman in America; every day is violent for me,\" she said. \"(I want) to go out there and stay out there longer because I just don't want this to be my daughter's or my grandchildren's future. I go out there because I don't want it to come to my doorstep.\"\n\nBrown and other activists drove to Kenosha from Milwaukee in a caravan on Monday, where they joined with local activists. That day, Brown protested alongside Anthony Huber, one of the two protesters fatally shot Tuesday night.\n\n\"It tore me apart. I seen it online when it actually happened. It was the same way I felt when I saw Mr. Blake get shot. The same way I felt when I saw Mr. Floyd die,\" Brown said. \"A tightening in my chest, in my gut. Anxiety. Rage. Fear.\"",

    "Amid coronavirus drama, don't forget nightmarish death toll in America": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "Every 80 seconds another American dies of coronavirus, according to a running average from the past week. That's more than a thousand lives lost every 24 hours, a staggering rate. America's tally of now more than 170,000 COVID-19 deaths is expressed in various ways: nearly 60 times the loved ones lost on 9/11; more than the combined U.S. combat deaths of World War I and the Korean, Vietnam, Iraq and Afghanistan wars; and more than any other country in the world.\n\nYet America's horrific toll from the pandemic too often gets overshadowed amid news of racial discord, hurricanes, wildfires, political party conventions and an endless drumbeat of COVID-related controversies, such as inadequate testing or fears about going back to school.\n\nIt's important not to become inured to the mounting toll -- to remember that behind each death from the virus is the story of an American life prematurely cut short:\n\n\u25baIt is Dar'Yana Dyson, who loved music and dance. At 15 in May, she became the youngest person in the national capital region to succumb to coronavirus.\n\n\u25baIt is Las Vegas police Lt. Erik Lloyd, who died in July during his 30th year in uniform, leaving behind a wife, two daughters and five grandchildren. Because of his extensive community work, the department characterized his death as in the line of duty.\n\n\u25baIt is Michelle Villarreal, a cafeteria manager at Leon Valley Elementary School in Texas. After she died in July, the school issued a statement about her passion for her students, her ever-present smile and how her baking was inspiring.\n\nAs calamitous as the deaths have become, many survivors of the disease are suffering from extended misery.\n\nWhile further scientific study is needed, evidence already seems clear that COVID-19 patients are more prone to blood clots, a dangerous condition that can lead to heart attacks, strokes and pulmonary embolisms. There's evidence that overwrought immune systems triggered by the virus permanently weaken heart muscles. And people who have suffered symptoms for weeks, or even months, talk about how they can't hold a thought or idea, a condition doctors have described as a persistent brain fog.\n\nIn times of trauma, Americans look for national leadership, yet President Donald Trump has consistently underestimated the severity of the virus and shied away from talking about the mounting toll.\n\nSome medical experts now predict that U.S. deaths could reach 300,000 by the end of this year. And the true count might already have surpassed 200,000, given the unusually high number of fatalities across the country since the epidemic started.\n\nThe United States, with about 4% of the world's population, has 22% of the world's deaths from COVID-19. \"There's no way to spin that in a positive light,\" Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, observed last Friday.\n\nOver time -- with more immunity, better treatments and hopefully vaccines -- the awful daily toll will recede. Until then, Americans have an obligation to reject any suggestion that the continuing, shameful carnage is normal or acceptable.",

    "Apple and Samsung are in Fitbit's sights with newest smartwatches": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "Digital Ads, Print Ads, Packaging, Signage, Channel, Social, Email, Web, OOH, PR\n\nFitbit on Tuesday unveiled a pair of smartwatches, most notably the Sense, a compelling, feature-filled device that signals the wearables pioneer may finally be ready to go toe-to-toe with high-end heavyweights Apple and Samsung.\n\nFitbit also introduced the Versa 3, a worthy follow-on to its successful mainstream smartwatch line. But the real news is in the premium segment, where Fitbit hasn't managed a viable contender since the Apple Watch first lit up the category five years ago. On paper, at least, the Sense appears to be up to the task.\n\nEarlier this month, Samsung also aggressively upgraded its premium offering with the Galaxy Watch3, which like Fitbit's Sense is packed with all the state-of-the-art features plus its own unique additions. Which begs the question, what will Apple do in late September, when it's expected to show off what presumably will be dubbed the Series 6 watch?\n\nTaken together, the sudden burst of capability could translate into one of the most interesting smartwatch seasons in several years, serving up a deliciously difficult selection of stocked devices for prospective buyers.\n\nFitbit's new lineup: Fitbit Sense is a smartwatch that might pick up fever, stress symptoms\n\nSamsung Galaxy Watch3: Device kicks off fall smartwatch season with health and wellness features\n\nNearly three years after unveiling the Ionic, a flawed and ultimately unpopular premium-priced smartwatch, Fitbit's upcoming Sense is nothing short of a total reboot. And it couldn't come at a better time.\n\nFitbit's fitness trackers popularized the wearables category more than a decade ago. But a one-two punch of inexpensive trackers from China combined with the company's own difficulties in transitioning to the fast-growing smartwatch segment have proved challenging for Fitbit. Versa, the company's popular mainstream smartwatch series, has helped keep the company afloat. But the lack of a competitive premium offering has stunted growth and profitability.\n\nOn the positive side, Fitbit has stayed relevant thanks to its accessible and engaging metrics, even as it struggled to keep pace in the hardware department.\n\nAnd now the Sense has no obvious weaknesses, integrating just about all the capabilities a state-of-the-art smartwatch should have today, along with some intriguing new ones like a stress gauge that monitors minute changes in skin moisture and a temperature sensor that can, among other things, help watch for early signs of sickness. In the COVID-19 era, that could prove invaluable as healthcare looks for ways to identify and isolate the highly contagious disease.\n\nApple Watch, Fitbit: Tests expand on whether wearables could predict coronavirus\n\nTropical Storms Laura and Marco: What tech you need when disaster strikes\n\nAnd, true to form, Fitbit is advancing its app with new-and-improved health and wellness features, particularly in the areas of heart health and stress.\n\nThe only omission of any consequence is the lack of built-in LTE, which both Apple and Samsung have offered for years. That said, both competitors also offer versions of their smartwatches without costly cellular integration. Which means the Sense should have no trouble competing with more moderately priced premium watches from the market leaders.\n\nThe Sense does offer plenty, including:\n\nBoth the Sense and Versa 3 will be available in late September. The Versa 3 costs $229.95, and the Sense $329.95, which puts it at the bottom end of the high-end segment. Premium smartwatches from Samsung and Apple both start at just under $400.\n\nAside from adding SpO2 capability, indications are that Apple is planning a more subdued upgrade to its watch lineup this fall. The upcoming version of watchOS 7, which the company previewed at its annual WWDC developer event in June, features some cosmetic enhancements. But there is little indication the company is doing much to address the Apple Watch's two biggest shortcomings: battery life and sleep.\n\nYear after year, the latest Apple Watch devices consistently last barely a day on a charge, compared to at least two days for Samsung's Watch3 and nearly a week for the Sense. On the one hand, battery life improvement would help convince users to wear the Apple Watch overnight to track sleep, rather than drop it on the charger.\n\nOn the other hand, Apple Watch's sleep tracking offers precious little value to make users wish that battery life was better. At WWDC, Apple signaled it hears the complaints about the lack of sleep tracking, and introduced a new sleep feature. But the feature, called \"Wind Down,\" doesn't track sleep. It helps users get to bed on time. Sleep tracking itself continues to be little more than lie-down tracking, remarkably unsophisticated given the advanced biometrics built into Apple Watches.\n\nSo Fitbit and Samsung advances could put some pressure on the category leader, Apple. But how much, given a fan base that is so loyal and forgiving?\n\nEven so, if you're in the market for a new smartwatch - and you're not wearing a pair of iBlinders as you shop - then this year's bumper crop is destined to please, no matter which device you select.\n\nCoronavirus: Could wearables like Apple Watch, Fitbit fitness trackers help detect the virus?\n\nTracking COVID-19: Are coronavirus contact tracing apps doomed to fail in America?",

    "Arizona State University won't release COVID-19 data after parties": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "PHOENIX - The first weekend after classes started at Arizona State University brought parties and people in groups not wearing masks while hanging out together on campus. Tempe Police cited multiple off-campus parties over the weekend.\n\nBut the public won't know whether these parties and group activities, or even students gathering in classes or dorms, have resulted in additional COVID-19 cases.\n\nArizona State will not disclose how many cases it has on campus or among its students and employees, nor the locations of any cases or exposures, to the general public, citing \"privacy issues.\"\n\nThe Arizona attorney general has previously said universities can disclose cases as long as the information doesn't identify any individuals. Experts on government transparency say there's no reason this information should be withheld.\n\nAnd other universities across the country are publicly disclosing case numbers.\n\nNot only can the number of cases be disclosed, but the university should also release this information, said Frank LoMonte, director of the Brechner Center for Freedom of Information at the University of Florida.\n\n\"First of all, families need to know whether there are four cases or 400 cases so that they can make an educated decision about whether it's safe to go there,\" LoMonte said.\n\n\"Also, the public needs to be able to evaluate whether the government officials who run this public institution are making wise decisions or not. Only by seeing the data that the administrators have can the public adequately evaluate whether they are doing their jobs properly.\"\n\nStudents partied, the school wasn't ready: How Notre Dame's back-to-campus plan unraveled\n\nElsewhere, Ohio State had not shared plans for how it will communicate about campus coronavirus cases or data as of midday Tuesday, the first day of classes.\n\nThe lack of university coronavirus data dates to earlier this summer. Citing privacy concerns, the university would not release testing data or positive test numbers when Ohio State football players resumed workouts in June.\n\nSince then, Ohio State has been ramping up its testing program to test all of its nearly 12,000 on-campus students each week.\n\nOhio State spokesman Ben Johnson said this week the university hopes to begin sharing coronavirus testing data \"in the next several days.\"\n\nUSA TODAY vaccine panel: Experts see progress on a COVID vaccine, but worry about who gets it first and how it gets to them\n\nTempe police issued nine party citations over the weekend, including six that were related to students gathering, according to the Tempe Police Department.\n\nThe department did not provide further information about the incidents, or what this weekend's citations were specifically for. Citations are typically issued for loud music, littering, parking violations and underage drinking.\n\nPolice officers are conducting weekend patrols in the neighborhoods hoping to crack down on loud or large gatherings, the city said in a news release Monday.\n\nThe patrols are intended to educate hosts and attendees on local and state laws and officers will take enforcement action if needed.\n\nCitation fines are $250 for the first time an officer responds to a home for a party, $1,000 for the second offense and $1,500 for each offense after that. Students who attend or host parties could be disciplined by the school, too, the city said.\n\nIn addition to the weekend patrols, officers are visiting downtown businesses to encourage owners and customers to follow the city's mask ordinance and physical distancing guidelines.\n\n\"It is vital that college and university students in Tempe wear masks in public, avoid large groups and use physical distancing,\" said Mayor Corey Woods in a statement on Monday.\n\nAn Arizona State University police spokesperson said they were not aware of any gatherings reported on campus this weekend, so no citations were issued. Off-campus parties would be under the jurisdiction of local police departments.\n\nCalifornia's air quality is worse than India's: That's not good in a pandemic\n\nArizona State students shared photos and videos on social media over the past several days showing parties and groups gathering in common areas without masks. Masks are required on campus.\n\nUnverified reports of positive COVID-19 cases on campus are circulating as well. Two parents told a local television station that their children, who are Arizona State students, were exposed to positive cases in the dorms in Tempe.\n\nOne student, Kevin Redifer, posted a video showing dozens of young people lined up outside a house party near Arizona State's Tempe campus on Saturday night. He told The Arizona Republic, part of the USA TODAY Network, that he doesn't just blame the students involved, but university administrators who \"knowingly put students and the community in a position where this behavior is inevitable.\"\n\nMya Vallejo, a junior studying criminal justice, is taking her classes all online this semester, but still lives and works near campus. She's witnessed people walking in groups of multiple people, unmasked, on campus. She saw posts about parties on Snapchat and Instagram this weekend.\n\n\"Should I email one person not wearing a mask to (Arizona State President) Michael Crow? It feels like there's not a lot that I can do,\" she said. \"And I mean, I see people every day not wearing masks, so there's no enforcement, it feels like.\"\n\nThe school's messaging has focused on personal responsibility and imploring everyone to follow COVID-19 protocols, she said, but it's not clear who's enforcing them. She's not sure if she's supposed to report potential violations to the university, or whether it would be worth the time.\n\n\"I don't want to blame the students, because I think this is on ASU for opening up and giving people the chance to not wear masks and go to parties,\" she said. \"So I think it's mostly on ASU, but I just wish that students would take more responsibility.\n\nConor McGill, a sophomore studying sports journalism, attends the Arizona State campus in Phoenix. He said the campus has been quiet, and everyone seems to comply with health protocols. Classrooms and campus feel safe and distanced, and he's glad to be back to in-person learning.\n\n\"It's just been very calm at downtown, and hopefully the Tempe students don't ruin it for the downtown students, because we're taking a lot of measures to go in person and I hope no one ruins it for other students who want to get an education,\" he said.\n\nLoMonte, the transparency expert, said many universities across the country have provided information on cases tied to campus without getting in trouble with the U.S. Department of Education over violating the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act, the law often cited to prevent disclosure of student records.\n\n\"They seem to have really wedded themselves to this legal interpretation, but it's certainly not the prevailing legal interpretation around the country,\" he said.\n\nThe Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, which prevents the disclosure of private health information to outside parties, also doesn't apply to releasing an aggregate total of cases at a college, he said.\n\n\"There's almost certainly no privacy law that forbids disclosing these statistics,\" he said.\n\nAs long as information released doesn't allow a person without knowledge of the case to track it back to an individual, it should be able to be disclosed, he said.\n\n\"Nobody is going to be able to Sherlock Holmes their way into figuring out the name of a student from a number like one, two or three. No one is able to reverse-engineer numbers like that,\" he said.\n\nArizona State's position that there are privacy concerns differs from many colleges throughout the country, and also from some within the state, including one that is also overseen by the Arizona Board of Regents.\n\nThe University of Arizona is publishing the number of cases on campus. So far, of the more than 8,000 people tested as part of UA's reentry plans, 27 have tested positive, the school's website shows.\n\nNorthern Arizona University's position is aligned with Arizona State. NAU has not released the number of positive cases on campus.\n\nIn March, in response to a question from a lawmaker, Attorney General Mark Brnovich wrote an opinion saying there was nothing preventing universities from disclosing information on cases as long as they didn't release information that was identifying, particularly during a health emergency.\n\n\"Nothing, however, prohibits the universities from disclosing additional information, such as the campus, buildings or dorms frequented by the student during the incubation period and/or while exhibiting symptoms,\" Brnovich wrote. \"Protecting the public is paramount during times of crisis, and transparency should be the rule rather than the exception.\"\n\nFifteen years and $15 billion since Katrina: New Orleans is more prepared for a major hurricane - for now\n\nThis weekend, Arizona State told The Arizona Republic it would not disclose any positive cases or related information due to \"privacy issues.\" The school has yet to respond to questions regarding the legal justification for withholding the information. The response aligned with Arizona State's position to not release case information since the pandemic began. The university had one of the first confirmed cases in the country.\n\nCrow has occasionally given some information on cases since then. In March, he said the school had 15 cases. Earlier this month, he told The Arizona Republic that 40 students who were tested before moving into the dorms had tested positive before arriving on campus, out of the thousands of students who were tested. Of those who tested when they came to campus to live in the dorms, only one has tested positive, he said.\n\nBut Arizona State is not providing any centralized or consistent information on the total cases or their locations.\n\nThe school reports its cases to the Arizona Department of Health Services, as required by the state. People can track the ZIP codes where Arizona State campuses are located, a spokesperson said.\n\nHolly Poynter, a spokesperson for the Arizona Department of Health Services, said address information can be updated throughout a case investigation. A case's ZIP code is based on the person's primary residence, she said.\n\nIf someone lives in a dorm, that would typically be considered their primary residence, she said. Sometimes, this may not be identified until later in an investigation because a different home address is used for insurance, she said.\n\n\"It is important to note that cases in a particular ZIP code do not necessarily indicate that the infection happened in that ZIP code,\" Poynter said.\n\nContributing: Jennifer Smola, Columbus Dispatch; Emily Wilder, Arizona Republic\n\nFollow reporter Rachel Leingang (@rachelleingang) and Paulina Pineda (@paulinapineda22) on Twitter.\n\n'The hardest message': American Airlines to lay off 17,500 front-line workers due to coronavirus travel slump\n\n'People are not going to stop': 57 years later, thousands to gather for another March on Washington on Friday",

    "Arizona leads nation in pediatric COVID-19 infection rate": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "PHOENIX - Arizona is leading the country with its rate of COVID-19 infection among children, a national report says, though there are some limitations to the data.\n\nThe report, from the American Academy of Pediatrics and the Children's Hospital Association, is updated weekly, with the most recent update published on Aug. 6. In both its July 30 and Aug. 6 rankings, Arizona led the nation in COVID-19 infections in children.\n\nArizona's pediatric rate is reflective of its overall COVID-19 infection rate, which remains one of the highest in the country when all age groups are included.\n\nArizona's rate of cases in children and young adults ages 19 and younger is 1,206.4 per 100,000 people in that age group, and it's the only non-Southern state in the top five.\n\nThe states with the top rates, in order, are Arizona, South Carolina, Tennessee, Louisiana and Mississippi.\n\nMost cases of COVID-19 in children are less severe than they are in older people and do not require hospitalization, but Arizona and some other states have reported cases in children of what appears to be a rare post-COVID-19 infection called multisystem inflammatory syndrome.\n\nIn Arizona, 12% of COVID-19 infections are in those 19 and younger, according to the report. Arizona was among 27 states reporting that 10% or more of all their cases were children.\n\nThe report relies on data from states. Because some states have reporting gaps, and others are using different age groups, metrics and formats, there are some limits to the report, its authors say.\n\nArizona, for example, collects its data using the age range 19 and younger, which likely includes a fair number of non-pediatric young adults who are in high risk groups, said Dr. Sean Elliott, a Tucson infectious disease physician and a member of the Arizona Chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics.\n\nArizona's results should be considered, along with the weight of ongoing community data, as various school districts consider re-opening plans for in-person school entry, said Elliott, an emeritus professor of Pediatrics at the University of Arizona College of Medicine -- Tucson.\n\n\"In general, children represent around 8% to 10% of a total community's infection rates, but the percentages may increase in areas where there is higher community spread like Arizona,\" Elliott said.\n\n\"So, our 12% of total positives in patients younger than 20 years old likely reflects the robust transmission we just experienced in the preceding month in Arizona communities.\"\n\nIn Florida, the pediatric breakdown is for kids ages 14 and younger, and some states' breakdowns were 20 and younger. Others were 17 and younger or 18 and younger.\n\nArizona was one of 30 states in the report, plus Guam, Puerto Rico and the District of Columbia that used 19 and younger for its age breakdown.\n\nA total of 49 states, New York City, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and Guam provided age distributions of reported COVID-19 cases for the report. New York state did not provide age breakdowns for its cases -- only New York City did.\n\nIn hard-hit New York City, the rate of pediatric COVID-19 infection, at 390.5 cases per 100,000 chlidren, is much lower than the Arizona rate of 1,206.4 cases per 100,000 kids, the report says. New York City's age range for pediatric cases is birth through 17 rather than the Arizona classification of birth through 19, the data shows.\n\nAlabama's age range data included individuals up to the age of 24, which is why it does not have a rate per 100,000 children in the report.\n\nIt also explains why 22.5% of COVID-19 infections in Alabama are in children, and why Alabama's percentage in that category ranked highest.\n\nThere are two likely explanations for the high Arizona ranking in the recent report, Elliott said.\n\nFirst, health care providers are able to test more patients now than earlier in the pandemic, when some states were hit hardest. Arizona was hit later than East Coast states.\n\n\"Patients young and old who present with mild symptoms only or even just a suspected exposure now can be tested and included in the totals,\" he said.\n\nSecond, Arizona just came through a period of extremely high infection rates, and the large number of adult patients will drive increased numbers of pediatric patients because of community and at-home exposures, Elliott said.\n\nCOVID-19 hospitalization rates in Arizona have been going down, but infection rates remain high.\n\nThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's COVID-19 tracker says Arizona has one of the highest overall COVID-19 infection rates in the country.\n\nAs of Wednesday, Arizona's rate of COVID-19 infections was third in the country behind Louisiana and New York City, according to the CDC tracker, which separates New York City and New York state.\n\nArizona's overall COVID-19 infection rate is 2,632 cases per 100,000 people. The U.S. average is 1,562 cases per 100,000 people, the CDC's Wednesday numbers show.\n\nThe number of deaths of Arizonans age 19 and younger has not changed since the Aug. 6 data: It remains at 11 and one of the higher numbers in the nation, the report says.\n\nThe highest numbers of pediatric deaths were in New York City and Texas, which both reported 13 deaths, though New York City's data was for kids 17 and younger and the Texas data took into account deaths of kids and young adults ages 19 and younger.\n\nEighteen states and the District of Columbia had not reported any pediatric COVID-19 deaths as of the Aug. 6 report.\n\n\"What we do know from these data is that, in children, deaths continue to remain much lower than in older age groups,\" Dr. Sean O'Leary, vice chair of the American Academy of Pediatrics' Committee on Infectious Diseases, said in a news release.\n\n\"But as case counts rise across the board, that is likely to impact more children with severe illness as well.\"\n\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics began collecting data on kids and COVID-19 in April.\n\nOther findings in its latest report:\n\n\"If nothing else, this report should serve as clear notice that COVID-19 remains quite active in many parts of the U.S. and that we all need to work together to control the virus, protect ourselves and navigate safe re-openings of schools and other sources of exposure like bars and gyms,\" Elliott said.\n\nThe report was \"one more source of information about COVID-19 attack rates in children\" for pediatricians to use to more successfully treat their patients, Elliott said.\n\nIt suggests the U.S. should not be cavalier about the risk to teachers and children in reopening schools, he said.",

    "Arkansas poultry plants hit hard by COVID. Hispanics bear the brunt.": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "This story is part of a collaborative reporting initiative between the Midwest Center for Investigative Reporting and USA TODAY Network and is supported by the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting.\n\nMaria Romero's phone rang one day in June with the terrifying sound of her mother gasping for air.\n\nThe 59-year-old Arkansas poultry plant worker struggled in a weakened whisper to tell her daughter she'd been rushed to the emergency room, where she was diagnosed with COVID-19. Romero could barely understand the words, but she knew her mother was frightened and confused.\n\n\"She knew something was wrong, but she didn't know what was going on,\" Romero, 36, said. \"I could sense that she was scared.\"\n\nRomero's mother, who asked that her identity be protected for fear of losing her job, is among at least 4,627 Arkansas poultry workers to have been infected by the novel coronavirus since the start of the pandemic.\n\nMore than half of them, like Romero's mother, are Hispanic.\n\nAmericans rely on low-wage workers to produce a steady supply of beef, pork and poultry. But as the coronavirus sweeps through meatpacking plants across the country, minorities like her have disproportionately borne the brunt of the disease's spread.\n\nHispanics, Blacks and recent immigrants staff eight out of every 10 of the nation's frontline meatpacking jobs, the Center for Economic and Policy Research found.\n\nAnd they now account for 90% of the country's meatpacking-related coronavirus cases, based on a 21-state analysis by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. More than half of them are Hispanic.\n\nNowhere is that more evident than Arkansas, the second largest poultry producing state by weight in the nation. Unlike many other states with large outbreaks in meatpacking plants, Arkansas collects coronavirus case count data for the meatpacking industry by race and ethnicity.\n\nThat data, obtained by the Midwest Center for Investigative Reporting and USA TODAY, shows Latinos accounting for 33% of all poultry workers in Arkansas but roughly half of all COVID-19 cases in poultry plants.\n\nThe news outlets asked for the same data from several other states with large outbreaks at meatpacking plants, including Kansas, Iowa and Nebraska. The states said they didn't maintain it.\n\nThe Midwest Center for Investigative Reporting and USA TODAY spent two months interviewing workers, plant officials and health experts about the disproportionate rate of minority infection among meatpackers. They also examined hundreds of pages of government records and reports as part of this story, which was funded by a grant from the Pulitzer Center.\n\nCheap chicken, beef came at a cost:How American meat plants bred coronavirus hot spots.\n\nEven before the pandemic, these employees faced long hours in dangerous conditions for meager pay. For years, the federal government has detailed the industry's systemic problems while doing little to correct them.\n\nBut now, with a deadly virus plaguing these plants, the government has taken an even more hands-off approach to worker safety. The Trump administration in late April provided guidance on how to safeguard plants from the pandemic but stopped short of mandating or enforcing the measures.\n\nEven as case numbers in poultry plants soared, pleas from workers and activists for basic safety measures were met with months of inaction and indifference from the government and meatpacking companies.\n\nIn northwest Arkansas, the heart of the state's poultry industry, a CDC investigation found widespread transmission of the disease and faulted the state government for the disproportionate impact on the Latino and Pacific Islander communities.\n\nJennifer Dillaha, state epidemiologist with the Arkansas Department of Health, said the state is trying to implement as many of the CDC's recommendations as possible and recently contracted two companies to conduct contact tracing.\n\nBut with limited government oversight of COVID-19 safety measures in plants, churning out packages of chicken breasts and nuggets has come at the expense of workers' lives, workers and advocates said.\n\n\"This is a nationwide, multi-company problem. The meatpacking plants were not prepared for this epidemic,\" League of United Latin American Citizens president Domingo Garcia said. \"There was a failure early on from the management and owners of the five major meatpacking players to respond to it as fast as they could, and it did cost lives.\"\n\nSpokesmen for two of the largest meatpacking operations in the country told reporters they're taking every precaution to protect workers by implementing safety measures like temperature checks and plastic workstation barriers.\n\nDerek Burleson at Tyson, which operates 20 poultry plants in Arkansas, said the company's first priority is the health and safety of workers and the community. He said the company has implemented a variety of safety measures and done large-scale testing of its Arkansas workers.\n\nCameron Bruett of JBS, which operates one plant in the state, provided a similar statement.\n\n\"We are doing everything we can to provide a safe working environment for our team members who are producing food for the country during these unprecedented times,\" Bruett said.\n\nSuch measures did not prevent Romero's mother from falling ill. The Midwest Center for Investigative Reporting and USA TODAY is not naming the plant where she works to protect her identity. But state records show her facility has hundreds of COVID-19 cases.\n\nThe day her mother was hospitalized, Romero was so busy interpreting her mother's Spanish and fielding calls from anxious relatives she didn't cry until after she put her children to bed.\n\nThen, she said, she broke down in tears and begged God to keep her mother alive. She hadn't asked God for anything in four years -- since the day she found out she was pregnant with twins. She promised then not to ask for another favor. Now as relatives across the country prayed the rosary for her mother, Romero sank to her knees too.\n\n\"Don't do this. I need her,\" she recalled having said while praying. \"I need her to make it through. I need her to have recovery so we can hang out again and live this life that you have for us.\"\n\nArkansas has deep roots in the poultry industry dating back to the late 1800s with the formation of the Arkansas Poultry Breeders association and is home today to one of the largest poultry producing companies in the U.S. - Tyson Foods, based in Springdale.\n\nThe state has nearly 6,000 poultry producing farms and more than 60 poultry processing plants that collectively employ some 40,000 workers. About a third of them are Latino. More than one in five are Black or Asian.\n\nAs of mid-August, 30 Arkansas poultry plants have had outbreaks, according to state data. At least seven have now seen hundreds of employees test positive for COVID-19.\n\nYet despite calls from workers to temporarily shut down plants for deep cleaning, the state hasn't ordered any plant closures. Tyson, the largest chicken processing company in the U.S., hasn't idled any of its facilities in the state. It instead implemented a series of measures like installing dividers between workers, providing masks to employees and designating monitors to enforce social distancing. The company has also announced it will test some employees for COVID-19 weekly.\n\nAlthough its spokesman, Burleson, said the company meets or exceeds CDC safety guidelines, workers' rights groups filed a civil rights complaint in early July against the two largest meatpacking companies in the U.S., saying the companies' lax safety measures during the pandemic disproportionately exposed minority workers to COVID-19 and amounted to racial discrimination.\n\nAlfredo, a 37-year-old machine operator in a Tyson poultry plant, said he has seen firsthand how the company responded to the coronavirus outbreak. He deemed it insufficient.\n\nA Mexican immigrant, Alfredo said he and other workers often can't afford to stay home when sick and are pressured by their supervisors to return to work. He asked to be identified only by his first name out of fear of being fired.\n\n\"There are people coming in sick to work,\" he said through an interpreter.\n\nA 2016 Government Accountability Office report also noted a reluctance on the part of undocumented and immigrant workers to report sickness and injuries.\n\nAlfredo's elderly parents tested positive for COVID-19 and believe they contracted the disease through their jobs at poultry plants. His children cried as his parents broke the news to them, convinced their grandparents would die.\n\n\"It's really overwhelming,\" he said.\n\nLess than two weeks after his mother tested positive for COVID-19, the Tyson plant where she worked called her multiple times urging her to return to the production line, he said. His mother, still coughing and running a fever, refused to work until she tested negative.\n\nBurleson, the Tyson spokesman, said employees are not allowed to work if they show symptoms.\n\n\"If the team member tests positive, they receive paid leave during the quarantine period required by the CDC and may return to work only when they have met the criteria established by the CDC and Tyson,\" he said.\n\nHowever, Alfredo said Tyson workers aren't paid to self-quarantine unless a company doctor sends them home or they receive a positive COVID-19 test. Workers and activists have said employees are usually cleared to work as long as they don't have a fever.\n\nWorkers who have come in contact with someone who tested positive do not have to self-quarantine and can keep working as long as they have no symptoms, Dillaha, the state epidemiologist, said.\n\nPoultry activists have said employees are expected to work even if they were exposed to someone with COVID-19, a concern when the virus can be spread by asymptomatic people.\n\nWorkers are often reluctant to admit they've tested positive for COVID-19 or have symptoms, said Lorena Quiroz, founder of the Mississippi-based Immigrant Alliance for Justice and Equity.\n\n\"They will go into work if they're asymptomatic because they're fearing they're going to get fired or the community is going to treat them differently or even affect their immigration status,\" she said.\n\nAbout 91% of Arkansas poultry workers lack paid sick leave, and two-thirds reported working while sick before the pandemic began, according to a study led by the Northwest Arkansas Workers' Justice Center. For poultry workers, staying home can mean losing weeks' worth of pay or even their jobs.\n\n\"The company is exposing them to get sick, and they don't care for their health or lives,\" Magaly Licolli, founder of the Northwest Arkansas-based poultry workers' rights group, Venceremos, said.\n\nMore than 120 social justice groups including Venceremos launched a week of action demanding that Tyson offer paid sick leave, slow line speeds and provide regular testing for workers. For months, Venceremos has held protests and circulated petitions calling for the shutdown of Arkansas plants with COVID-19 cases.\n\n\"It is clear that the main reason workers feel compelled to go to work when they're sick is that they don't have access to paid sick leave,\" said Angela Stuesse, anthropology professor at the University of North Carolina and author of the book \"Scratching out a Living: Latinos, Race, and Work in the Deep South.\"\n\nThe Families First Coronavirus Response Act that guaranteed paid sick leave for employees with COVID-19 excluded companies with more than 500 employees, meaning the handful of large companies that dominate the meatpacking industry are exempt from the requirement.\n\nUndocumented immigrants and their families have so far been excluded from receiving assistance from the federal stimulus package intended to reduce the financial pain caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, according to Vox.\n\n\"We need our immigrants who feel symptoms to not work, and many of them don't have that option because they don't have access to safety net programs and they were left out of the economic stimulus,\" said Mireya Reith, the executive director of the immigrant rights group, Arkansas United.\n\nAfter 10 days in the hospital, Romero's mother returned home lightheaded, achy and fatigued. Facing a looming medical bill, she returned to her job at the poultry plant that provides some of the only work left in her rural town, where she loads uncooked chicken into plastic foam trays and onto a conveyor belt, the mother said.\n\nA doctor's note has put her on light duty -- a result of lingering weakness from her bout with the virus as well as the searing back and shoulder pain she accumulated from 13 years of repetitive movement on the production line. Now, she lifts three pounds at a time instead of seven.\n\nAlthough her plant has installed plastic barriers between workers and increased the distance between employees, she worries about getting sick again when workers crowd together in the cafeteria and as they stream out of the plant, Romero's mother said.\n\nRomero said she wonders if her mother's body could endure another fight with the virus. In a plant where hundreds of workers have contracted the virus, her mother makes around $11 an hour and has received no hazard pay, she said.\n\nMeanwhile, at the Tyson plant, Alfredo works shoulder-to-shoulder with other employees, separated from them by a thin plastic sheet or nothing at all, he said. Although workers have their temperatures checked and are given masks and face shields, they are crowded together when they clock in, change clothes and use the bathroom.\n\nThe plant installed a handful of hand sanitizer stations, but Alfredo said it doesn't clean or disinfect inside, even as an increasing number of workers test positive. He worries that the virus lingers on the machinery, common spaces and in the air, alongside the tangy smell of rotting meat.\n\n\"I don't feel safe,\" he said. \"I always feel nervous when I'm there and afraid of working because they never closed the plant to disinfect or to clean. The virus is still inside.\"\n\nHe works six days a week, nine hours a day grinding blocks of frozen chicken into a pulp used to make chicken nuggets. By the end of the day, his mask is damp with sweat. He rubs hand sanitizer over his face and hands and strips his clothes onto the lawn before walking into his home.\n\n\"What I'm worried about the most is one day I will go to work, and then I will get sick and eventually I will get my kids, my family, all sick,\" he said.\n\nThe meatpacking industry has been notorious for low pay, high injury rates and few benefits. Now during a pandemic, Alfredo said it's become more clear how much the industry ignores worker safety. As workers emptied out of the plant by testing positive, self-quarantining or simply leaving, working mandatory overtime exhausts him, he said. He said his children won't work in poultry like their parents and grandparents.\n\nHe knows workers who have gotten sick and two that have died, some of whom came from the same small town in Mexico where Alfredo was born.\n\n\"Instead of getting better, it's just gotten worse,\" he said. \"I feel impotent for not being able to help. The only thing that I can do is pray for them.\"",

        "authors": [],
        "body": "AUBURN, Ala. -- Auburn's preseason schedule ground to a halt this past week.\n\nThe Tigers haven't practiced since Tuesday after the team returned nine positive COVID-19 tests and had to quarantine seven more, coach Gus Malzahn said Sunday. In all, 16 players are currently sidelined.\n\n\"We had a pretty challenging week last week,\" he said.\n\nMalzahn declined to go into specifics about who tested positive or which positions they played, but did say that two position groups were hit hard enough that \"we just didn't feel like we had enough guys to be able to practice\" on Wednesday. The team also did not hold scheduled practices on Thursday or Saturday, missing three in all.\n\nIssues of social injustice nationally also played a role -- Malzahn said players were \"extremely upset\" about the events that took place in Kenosha, Wisconsin, where 29-year-old Black man Jacob Blake was shot seven times by police and 17-year-old white teen Kyle Rittenhouse allegedly shot and killed two protesters, and that \"our coaches and our staff felt the same way.\"\n\nThe players decided they did not want to attend meetings on Thursday, which Malzahn said he fully supported. The team met on Friday, and Malzahn made the decision then that Auburn would not hold a scheduled scrimmage inside Jordan-Hare Stadium on Saturday.\n\n\"I just decided it wasn't best for us to practice,\" the coach said. \"My number one concern is the mental and physical well-being of our players. I just felt real strong that we needed the weekend off. I think it was a good decision.\"\n\nAuburn plans to resume practice this week after another off day Monday. It will be on the field Tuesday, Wednesday and Friday before scrimmaging Saturday. Thursday is set aside for COVID-19 testing, which the program now plans to do twice per week before the SEC-mandated three tests per week begins two weeks before the Tigers' Sept. 26 opener against Kentucky. Malzahn believes the team still has time to get ready for that game, but there is more urgency now.\n\nThat's especially true when you consider that those 16 players will be absent this week and beyond. The nine who tested positive -- Malzahn said Auburn is using the \"gold-standard test\" -- must go through a mandatory 10-day quarantine (per the SEC guidelines) and then a seven-day reacclimation period (per the guidelines put in place by Auburn's medical staff). The other seven will be quarantined for 14 days and cannot test out of it.\n\nThe Tigers have enough players to practice without them -- there are 122 on the roster in all -- but will have to adjust to having some position groups being thinner than others. If it were a game week, Malzahn said, the team would have just had \"to find a way to play with what you've got.\"\n\nFortunately, \"very few\" of the players who tested positive for COVID-19 have had any major symptoms, Malzahn said, with the rest having minor symptoms or none at all. But the program is taking each situation very seriously.\n\n\"The bottom line is the health and safety of our players is always going to be first,\" Malzahn said. \"When you're going through this, there's a competitive side, but we're always going to put our team first; the mental and physical health of our players. Yeah, we understand we're four weeks out. We feel like we have time to prepare. But like I said, we'll take it day by day and do the best we can.\"\n\nAuburn previously had gone through two consecutive rounds of testing (Aug. 9 and Aug. 16) without any new cases. Malzahn said there was \"not one event\" that caused a flare-up this week, but indicated that the fact that the rest of the university's student body returned to campus to start the fall semester on Aug. 17 could have been a factor.\n\nThe Auburn University Medical Clinic reported 202 new cases in students out of 901 tests conducted from Aug. 14-21.\n\n\"You bring the students back on campus, you know -- if you live off-campus, you have a roommate, you got to have your mask on, you got to stay on the other side of the house,\" Malzahn said. \"It's just a learning process. I believe our guys are going to do everything they can to be healthy and keep our team healthy.\"\n\nIn terms of addressing social injustice, Malzahn said, Auburn has \"a couple of things we're going to do as a team moving forward\" but is \"still working through those.\"",

    "Auto expert: 'About 2 years' for sales rebound to pre-pandemic level": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "It's going to take at least two years for auto manufacturers to restore the sales and production numbers seen before the start of the coronavirus pandemic, an industry expert told Michigan lawmakers in Lansing on Wednesday.\n\nDespite successful efforts from suppliers and manufacturers to keep their doors open and employees safe, staffing shortages and some overall drop in demand means the industry needs to keep adapting and working collaboratively, said Carla Bailo, president and CEO of the Ann Arbor-based Center for Automotive Research.\n\n\"Everyone is predicting this year about 13 million (vehicles sold), pre-COVID we were about 17 million. We expect it's going to take another two years, but that's predicated on a good recovery and continued recovery throughout this year,\" Bailo said during a legislative hearing.\n\n\"Should we have another hit in the fall, we'll have to adjust those figures. So about two years to come back to where we were.\"\n\nCOVID-19 pandemic: Crisis likely to leave legacy of fear and uncertainty that holds back economy for decades\n\nRecycle your car seat: Target's event returns Sept. 13. Here's how to trade in a seat for a 20% discount\n\nBailo joined Michigan manufacturers and industry authorities in briefing lawmakers on the pandemic's impact on the automotive world. Every speaker agreed the auto industry's ability to produce personal protective equipment helped save lives and jobs, but there are real and practical problems that operating during a pandemic will present for the foreseeable future.\n\nThe discussion comes as every industry tries to maintain a tenuous grasp on operating during a pandemic.\n\nAutomotive manufacturing shut down like most industry in March, even as suppliers and large manufacturers looked for ways to produce vital health and safety equipment to fight COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus.\n\nAny new halt in production, even a short one, would be crippling, said Brian O'Connell, General Motors regional director of state government relations.\n\n\"The shutdown had a huge impact on our industry and our company. And we cannot afford a shutdown. We cannot afford a week shutdown,\" O'Connell said.\n\nDemand for new and used vehicles is down, but Bailo said the drop was not as much as some expected. Although overall vehicle sales were down 25%, sales of pickups are down only 10%.\n\nAt the same time, there are 20,000 fewer jobs in the automotive industry compared to the second quarter of last year. Michigan's jobs in the industry are down 18%. Bailo said that's the lowest level since 2009, during the Great Recession.\n\n\"There was a lot of doomsday forecasts early on, but the automotive industry has stayed resilient and most of the plants have been able to stay open,\" Bailo said.\n\nNow GM, Ford Motor Co. and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles say they continue to follow strict testing and quarantine protocols for employees who may be sick or who came in contact with someone who has COVID-19.\n\nThe UAW, which represents roughly 150,000 workers from the Detroit Three, repeatedly advocated for strict safety practices and heralded the manufacturer's recent decision to continue testing employees even if they showed no symptoms of the virus.\n\nWorkers must be healthy and feel safe to keep production moving, noted John Walsh, president and CEO of the Michigan Manufacturers Association. Manufacturing in the state has rebounded since the start of the pandemic, but as of July there are roughly 69,000 fewer Michiganders employed in manufacturing than the 628,000 who had a job in the industry in July.\n\nWhile working from home or virtually may not substantially disrupt other industries, it's essentially not an option for most manufacturers, Walsh said. Bailo and others agreed that finding and keeping an employee who can work on site while handling the daily rigors of life during a pandemic is difficult.\n\n\"This is going to continue to be an issue. It's a strain on the manufacturing sustainability and keeping the production line running,\" Bailo said.\n\n\"You don't have the option to work remotely when you're on the line. And if you're a single parent trying to educate children, that's a significant problem.\"\n\nAlthough Rep. Vanessa Guerra, D-Saginaw, agreed GM and other companies may have strong safety plans, she questioned whether they're always followed. Without providing specifics, she said she's heard from constituents saying some employees are not informed when colleagues are sick and companies are not doing enough to adequately clean sites where infected people may have worked.\n\nGM relies on the safety practices every day, requiring masks at all times while on site, O'Connell said. Echoing comments from other speakers, he said the company prioritizes employee health in a way that ensures operations can continue.\n\n\"We cannot have an outbreak at our plants. It shuts us down. It shuts our suppliers down. The impact is tremendous on us,\" O'Connell said.\n\n\"We have not had a transmission at our plant where people are following safety protocols. Now, have we had employees who had it? Yes, but it was when they were home over the weekend and not working.\"\n\nShape Corp. President and CEO Mark White said his company employees about 3,500 people worldwide, including approximately 1,000 on any given day in Grand Haven. The supplier, which designs and builds components that manage the forces that occur when a vehicle is in a crash, instituted temperature checks and socially distanced work sites for its facilities, White said.\n\nThe company had 168 potential cases of the coronavirus among employees and 16 confirmed cases in Grand Haven, White said. Many were either prevented from entering a facility due to a potential fever or reported symptoms, or left work after reporting symptoms during a shift.\n\nWhite said his company is working with its employees to provide flexibility for those who do have child care and other needs. He also said they provided across the board raises. But he said concerns about child care, catching the coronavirus and \"the financial security of the enhanced unemployment benefits\" is causing unprecedented absenteeism and turnover.\n\n\"Our government needs to develop incentives to work, not incentives to stay on unemployment,\" White said.\n\n\"With respect, the incentives created to stay home go beyond physical well-being. They create a false sense of financial well-being, and keep people from coming to work at Shape and other good employers.\"",

    "Back to school, COVID testing: Why screenings not enough to stop virus": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "INDIANAPOLIS -- A child returning to school this fall might go through the following morning routine: their parent checks them for COVID-19 symptoms, they take a socially distanced bus ride, and a faculty member, like a school nurse, conducts a final screening at the school entrance before letting them through the door.\n\nAs students return to class, many school districts have introduced routine symptom screenings into their reopening plans. But their effectiveness and feasibility in stopping the spread of COVID-19 in schools remain unclear.\n\nAdam Karcz, director of infection prevention at Indiana University's Riley Hospital for Children, said screenings are limited for a variety of reasons, including that the novel coronavirus shares many symptoms with common illnesses like the flu and not everyone with COVID-19 will have symptoms.\n\n\"COVID-19 is unique with the challenge,\" Karcz said, \"that you can spread that without being or showing signs that you're actually sick.\"\n\nThough screenings might help in preventing the spread of coronavirus, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention doesn't recommend universal health screenings or COVID-19 testing at schools because of these limitations.\n\nThat's why Karcz says school districts should pair symptom screenings with other mitigation tactics.\n\n'Like saying I don't love her': Parents torn as some schools face greater reopening risks\n\n\"Screenings are one part of the puzzle,\" Karcz said. \"The other parts of that puzzle that you can see that schools are putting in place are the universal masking, the social distancing, the hand hygiene and the additional disinfection.\"\n\nBut symptom screening shouldn't all be on the schools. Karcz said parents should partner with districts to stop community spread.\n\n\"We all have a public and social responsibility as part of helping reduce COVID-19 and the community,\" Karcz said. \"If a child is sick or showing signs or symptoms, parents are going know best.\"\n\nVarying circumstances for schools might make this image unrealistic, said Linda Mendonca, president-elect of the National Association of School Nurses.\n\n\"With screenings to enter the building on a daily basis,\" Mendonca said, \"logistically, it's a lot.\"\n\nParents taking part in screening their child for symptoms also helps take some of the burdens of contact tracing off school nurses, who Mendonca says will be spread thin as schools reopen.\n\nAbout three in 10 schools in the Midwest don't have a nurse, and about one in three have a nurse working full-time in 2017, according to data from the Journal of School Nursing.\n\nThough the Indiana Department of Education reported about 70% of school nurses working full-time at one building in 2018, it tallied only about half of the state's schools in its survey.\n\n\"How do you open a school without a school nurse?\" Mendonca said. \"That's a challenge.\"\n\nCoronavirus and schools: Trump says open them. Teachers say not until they're safe. As cases rise, unions may win.\n\nA lack of funding for school nursing programs won't only make school nurses susceptible to COVID-19 infections, Mendonca said. It'll also leave students vulnerable.\n\n\"The safety of students and staff is the priority here,\" Mendonca said. \"That's what needs to be taken into consideration when any decision-making is made.\"\n\nThat's why Mendonca believes schools should do whatever it takes to mitigate community spread, no matter what it takes.\n\n\"Things are changing every day,\" Mendoca said. \"Scientists are learning more about COVID-19 every day, so it's very hard to know how it's gonna play out in schools.\"",

        "body": "Cases of myocarditis, an inflammation of the heart muscle, appears to be prevalent among Big Ten athletes, said Penn State's director of athletic medicine, impacting roughly a third of all athletes who have tested positive for the coronavirus.\n\nWayne Sebastianelli, who is also the team doctor for Penn State football, said Monday during a meeting of the State College Area School District board of directors that cardiac scans of Big Ten athletes who contracted COVID-19 showed \"30 to roughly 35 percent of their heart muscles\" indicated symptoms of myocarditis.\n\n\"And we really just don't know what to do with it right now,\" he said. \"It's still very early in the infection. Some of that has led to the Pac-12 and the Big Ten's decision to sort of put a hiatus on what's happening.\"\n\nMyocarditis, which can be fatal, was a driver behind the Big Ten's decision to postpone the coming season with the possibility to return this winter or spring.\n\n\"There is simply too much we do not know about the virus, recovery from infection, and longer-term effects,\" Big Ten Commissioner Kevin Warren wrote last month. \"While the data on cardiomyopathy is preliminary and incomplete, the uncertain risk was unacceptable at this time.\"\n\nThe possibility of widespread instances of myocarditis may impact the conference's thinking at a time when Big Ten presidents and chancellors have come under pressure to reconsider last month's decision, particularly as three other Power Five leagues move ahead as scheduled with the start of their seasons this month.\n\nCOOL SEAT: Don't expect college football coaches to be fired this season\n\nMONTHS IN MAKING: How Southern Miss became first host of FBS game this season\n\nPenn State and the Big Ten did not respond to USA TODAY Sports' requests for comment.\n\nMany cardiologists, \"some high-level,\" Sebastianelli said, would come to the conclusion that the high percentage of myocarditis cases are incidental and \"may not warrant any further investigation or any further sort of concern.\"\n\nFor example, a report conducted in Germany in late July and used by the Big Ten to inform last month's decision has since come under increased scrutiny.\n\n\"I think it's important to know what's reliable and what's not and I think there are numerous issues with this paper and frankly it's inconsistent with some of the higher quality data that's out there in the pathology literature,\" Michigan associate professor of cardiovascular medicine and radiology Venk Murty told the Detroit Free Press.\n\nAccording to the Mayo Clinic, \"In many cases, myocarditis improves on its own or with treatment, leading to a complete recovery.\"\n\nEven in mild cases, however, the clinic suggests that \"persons should avoid competitive sports for at least three to six months.\"\n\nInflammation can lead to \"electrical malaise,\" Sebastianelli said, potentially causing arrhythmia, or an irregular heart rhythm.\n\n\"What has been seen across some of the schools is that some of the athletes affected haven't really recovered their full pulmonary function,\" he said. \"They just don't train as hard as they normally can.\n\n\"We don't know how long that's going to last. What we have seen is when people have been studied with cardiac MRI scans -- symptomatic and asymptomatic COVID infections -- is a level of inflammation in cardiac muscle that just is alarming.\"\n\nIn an email to the Centre Daily Times, which first reported his remarks, Sebastianelli said he had \"no direct conversation\" on the number of myocarditis cases with Penn State President Eric Barron, \"but needless to say we all have concerns for the health and safety of every (Penn State) student-athlete, as well as those at every level of competition; this is a public health issue.\"",

        "authors": [],
        "body": "The Big Ten will not play football in the fall with \"the possibility of competition in the spring\" due to health concerns related to the coronavirus pandemic. the conference said Tuesday.\n\nAfter a dramatic few days full of meetings among coaches, athletics directors and university presidents, the stunning decision marks a potential tipping point for the Bowl Subdivision to play a season amid the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nHours after the Big Ten's decision, the league was joined by the Pac-12, which postponed all sports until Jan. 1 at the earliest.\n\n\"The mental and physical health and welfare of our student-athletes has been at the center of every decision we have made regarding the ability to proceed forward,\" Big Ten Commissioner Kevin Warren said in a statement.\n\n\"As time progressed and after hours of discussion with our Big Ten Task Force for Emerging Infectious Diseases and the Big Ten Sports Medicine Committee, it became abundantly clear that there was too much uncertainty regarding potential medical risks to allow our student-athletes to compete this fall.\"\n\nThe Big Ten's decision also includes the postponement of all fall sports, including volleyball and men's and women's soccer.\n\n\"For many months, we had hoped that the return of fall collegiate sports might be an opportunity to restore some sense of normalcy and provide brighter moments for our university, our city and our state,\" said Wisconsin Chancellor Rebecca Blank and athletics director Barry Alvarez in a co-signed statement. \"Even so, today's decision by the Big Ten to postpone the fall 2020 sports season is the correct one.\"\n\nTHE LATEST: Updates on where the college football season stands\n\nNOT GOING ALONE: SEC commissioner say league unlikely to play if others cancel\n\nNot every Big Ten school signaled an alignment with the Big Ten's decision. In a statement attributed to the university, Nebraska said it was \"very disappointed in the decision by the Big Ten Conference to postpone the fall football season, as we have been and continue to be ready to play.\"\n\nOhio State athletics director Gene Smith said he was aligned with university president-elect Kristina M. Johnson \"in our efforts to delay the start of the season rather than postpone\" competition.\n\n\"This is an incredibly sad day for our student-athletes, who have worked so hard and been so vigilant fighting against this pandemic to get this close to their season,\" Smith said.\n\nOhio State said that all athletes will remain on scholarship and remain in the same COVID-19 testing, quarantine and isolation protocols. Athletes will still have access to team facilities and nutrition areas.\n\nOther fall sports included in the Big Ten's decision are men's and women's cross country, field hockey, football, men's and women's soccer, and women's volleyball. The conference said it would continue evaluating its options for these sports, as well as sports conducted in the winter and spring.\n\nOne significant concern for the Big Ten and other conferences was the potential long-term health issues that could arise among student-athletes who may otherwise dodge the primary symptoms of the coronavirus -- including myocarditis, an inflammation of the heart muscle that can impact the heart's ability to pump blood normally.\n\nDuring an appearance on the Big Ten Network, Warren said that myocarditis was \"not the primary reason\" behind the league's decision but one of a \"litany of reasons.\"\n\nAs the season seemed on the brink of cancellation for much of Monday, several Big Ten coaches shared statements or made public comments arguing to proceed as originally planned or delay the league's decision.\n\nAt least two Big Ten teams, Ohio State and Penn State, were considered to be among the nation's best, with several others ranked in the preseason Amway Coaches Poll. The Buckeyes were ranked second behind Clemson. Penn State came in at No. 7, Wisconsin at No. 11, Michigan at No. 15, Minnesota at No. 18 and Iowa at No. 23.\n\nRemoving the Pac-12 and Big Ten from the season does raise questions about the ability to conduct a hypothetical postseason and College Football Playoff without a complete roster of conferences.\n\n\"It's too soon to say what the implications will be,\" playoff executive director Bill Hancock told USA TODAY Sports. \"We will wait for guidance from the (playoff) board and management committee.\"\n\nIn all, four FBS conferences have decided against playing in the fall, with the Big Ten and Pac-12 joined by two Group of Five leagues, the MAC and Mountain West. Two independent programs, Connecticut and Massachusetts, have also decided to shift toward the potential for a spring season.",

        "body": "Oneonta: The entire football team and marching band at a small-town high school are under quarantine following exposure to the new coronavirus. Oneonta High School coach Phil Phillips told WBMA-TV that a fifth player has tested positive for the virus that causes COVID-19. It's the second quarantine of the summer for the team. \"I looked my wife in the eyes Monday night before I went to bed, and I said, 'You know, I sure hope we didn't kill anybody's grandmother today by having a football practice,' \" Phillips said. \"You're torn because the kids want to play so bad.\" The team stopped summer workouts in late July after two coaches and four players tested positive for the coronavirus. Band director David Bearden said one of 135 students tested positive in his group, so a quarantine was needed.\n\nAnchorage: A judge dismissed a lawsuit that alleged the method by which the state dispersed its federal coronavirus funds was unconstitutional. The lawsuit, brought by Juneau resident Eric Forrer, was filed after a legislative panel, instead of the Alaska State Legislature, approved an aid plan authored by Gov. Mike Dunleavy. The lawsuit threatened to hamper aid distribution when first filed, the Anchorage Daily News reports. In response, the entire Legislature reconvened to vote in favor of the plan in May. The state has received roughly $1.5 billion from the federal government as a part of the program, $1.2 billion of which could be used freely at the state's discretion. Under the plan, about half of the $1.2 billion will go to cities and boroughs, a quarter will fund the health care sector, and the last quarter is geared toward small businesses.\n\nPhoenix: Public health experts and officials in the state say a decline in coronavirus testing last month has made it challenging to understand the virus and implement measures to limit its spread. Diagnostic tests for COVID-19 dropped from an average of more than 107,000 tests a week from late June to early July to about 51,400 tests the week of July 26. Over the course of just three weeks in July, from July 12 to July 26, weekly testing decreased by more than half, according to a data dashboard from the Arizona Department of Health Services. Arizona is now testing at the level it was two months ago. The state has simultaneously been improving with a decline in hospitalizations, fewer new cases and a lower percentage of positive results, but experts say continued testing is an important way to monitor the virus.\n\nLittle Rock: Gov. Asa Hutchinson and education officials on Friday proposed setting aside $20 million for teachers who have to miss work because of the coronavirus as the state reported one of its biggest increases in confirmed virus cases since the pandemic began. Hutchinson proposed using federal coronavirus relief funds to provide up to two weeks of paid leave for teachers and staff who have to quarantine because of the virus. The proposal goes before a state panel next week. Teachers and staff would use this leave before using any of their own sick days or personal leave under the plan, state Education Secretary Johnny Key said. \"We don't want that to have to come out of their ordinary leave or their pocket,\" Hutchinson said. Arkansas public schools reopen later this month, despite objections from teachers and pediatricians about resuming on-site instruction during the pandemic.\n\nSan Francisco: A technical glitch that has plagued the data system on which the state relies to make decisions about reopening businesses and schools has been fixed, California's top health official said Friday. \"Our data system has failed,\" California Health and Human Services Secretary Dr. Mark Ghaly said, leaving up to 300,000 records backlogged, though not all of them are coronavirus cases, and some may be duplicates. California reported 8,436 new confirmed cases Friday and surpassed 10,000 deaths from the coronavirus. \"We apologize. You deserve better, the governor demands better of us, and we are committed to doing better,\" Ghaly said. County health officials said they have been flying blind, unable to conduct robust contact tracing or monitor health factors without timely information, especially at a time when parents are on edge about school plans.\n\nDenver: Health experts in the state warn that early 2020 data indicates a rise in overdose deaths during the coronavirus pandemic, even as the federal government has distributed grants to rural hospitals for prevention and treatment programs. Colorado's Department of Public Health and Environment recorded 443 overdose deaths between January, before the pandemic hit, and April 2020. That's more than 40% of the 1,062 total overdose deaths recorded in 2019 in the state. \"The starkest difference can be seen for both March and April - the first few months of the COVID-19 lockdown,\" wrote the Colorado Health Institute, a nonpartisan research center. In April, deaths jumped from 15.0 to 24.1 deaths per 100,000 people, according to the research center. The numbers confirmed fears that the overdose crisis, which includes fentanyl and methamphetamine use, might worsen due to social isolation, stress and job losses during the pandemic, the institute said.\n\nHartford: Gov. Ned Lamont said Friday that he's been personally assured by President Donald Trump that Connecticut will receive continued federal reimbursement for the National Guard's expenses during the COVID-19 pandemic. The Democratic governor said he spoke with Trump late Thursday night and asked about the state's request for an extension through Sept. 30. Connecticut was originally approved in March for full federal reimbursement of all costs associated with activating the National Guard, but that agreement was set to expire Aug. 21. Lamont said he credits the efforts of the Guard members during the pandemic as one of the reasons Connecticut currently has a low infection rate.\n\nDover: Two school boards in the state have voted to start the school year with virtual classes. The boards of the Capital School District in Dover and the Milford School District in Milford, about 20 miles south of Dover, voted in favor of the move Thursday, The Delaware State News reports. The Capital School District Board unanimously voted for the decision, while the board members in Milford decided in a 5-1 vote. The votes for the virtual launches come as school boards across Delaware are contemplating how to start the academic year after Gov. John Carney announced last week that schools can implement hybrid teaching formats. Students in Milford School District would take virtual classes for the first six weeks of the semester. Capital School District students will begin the year Sept. 8 and also take virtual classes for about six weeks, the newspaper reports. School officials in that district said they'll revisit their plans in October.\n\nWashington: Howard University will go completely virtual for the fall 2020 semester, university officials announced Friday. University President Dr. Wayne A. I. Frederick said campus residence halls will be closed, with the exception of The Axis, which is apartment living, WUSA-TV reports. Campus officials are working to rescind all housing assignments for students who were planning to stay on campus this fall. \"Unfortunately, the stark realities of the current state of the pandemic, district requirement that students from hot spot states would fully quarantine for 14 days, and challenges to safely get students to campus from throughout the nation and around the world without creating additional exposure and risk, have proven overwhelming,\" Frederick said.\n\nTallahassee: The state's coronavirus numbers remain high as in-person early voting begins ahead of the state's primary and some school districts prepare to reopen Monday. Florida reported 187 new coronavirus deaths Saturday, bringing the state's total to 8,238. That pushes the average number of reported deaths over the past seven days to 156, down from a high of 185. There were more than 8,500 new confirmed coronavirus cases, bringing the total to nearly 527,000 cases. The number of people hospitalized because of the virus continued to decline, with 6,836 late Saturday morning compared to 7,174 the day before. Miami-Dade County by far had the most COVID-19 hospital patients with 1,558. The numbers were reported the same day statewide in-person early voting began ahead of Florida's Aug. 18 primary election. In-person turnout appeared light, while there's been a significant increase in vote-by-mail ballots requested.\n\nAtlanta: A high school student said her five-day suspension for sharing images of crowded conditions on campus was lifted Friday after she appealed and said she was ready to take her case to court. Hannah Watters said her principal called her mother, apologized and completely removed her punishment, leaving her surprised and \"very grateful.\" She had been suspended for taking a photo and video that she shared with news organizations to raise an alarm after seeing that most of her fellow students weren't wearing masks to reduce the spread of coronavirus infections. Waters, a 15-year-old sophomore, posted the images Tuesday showing crowded hallways at the 2,400-student North Paulding High School in Dallas, northwest of Atlanta. \"There was no social distancing, a 10% mask use rate; it was chaos,\" she said as she began serving her punishment at home. Multiple football players at North Paulding tested positive last week.\n\nHonolulu: Amid an alarming spike of coronavirus cases in the state, public school students on Oahu will begin the academic year with distance learning only, officials announced Friday. Gov. David Ige said most students will spend the first four weeks of the school year learning online from home after originally planning to start the year with a mostly hybrid model in which students alternated between online and in-person classes. A handful of schools had planned to offer full in-person instruction. The state will go to the hybrid approach in September if community transmission of the disease is brought under control. Oahu, the state's most populated island, has seen the majority of new cases in recent weeks, filling up hospital beds and spurring officials to close beaches, parks and hiking trails.\n\nTwin Falls: More than 180 inmates at a county jail have tested positive for the coronavirus since July. The Twin Falls County Jail said 183 of its inmates have tested positive, The Times-News reports. As of Friday, 81 were in quarantine. One male inmate was sent to the emergency room in recent weeks after becoming seriously ill and was later released. Eight staff members tested positive for the virus, but none has shown symptoms, and one is still in quarantine. Jail staff who tested positive for the virus continued to work during the outbreak. Jail Cpt. Doug Hughes said more than 90% of the inmates who tested positive are asymptomatic. South Central Public Health District spokesperson Brianna Bodily said it is uncommon that the figure for asymptomatic cases is so high. Jail officials conduct their own disease investigations, she said. The jail facility is meant for 194 inmates but currently houses 266. Extra inmates are forced to sleep on the floor.\n\nSpringfield: Gov. J.B. Pritzker announced Friday that public health officials may issue fines to businesses where employees or patrons aren't wearing face coverings to slow the spread of the coronavirus. Pritzker said the emergency rules he filed focus on \"scofflaw\" businesses who flout the requirement since May 1 that people in public who are unable to keep 6 feet away from others must wear masks. Enforcement begins with warnings and can result in fines of $75 to $2,500. Since a reduction in infections in June prompted Pritzker to reopen businesses and allow for larger groups - up to 50 - to gather, the highly contagious and sometimes-fatal virus has been on a summerlong rebound. Enforcement begins with a warning letter that the business is not complying with social restrictions. A second warning could mean reducing the number of patrons in an establishment to meet maximum crowd guidelines. A third violation could mean a fine.\n\nIndianapolis: The state Senate president warned public schools in a letter that they could face budget cuts if they don't hold in-person classes this year, despite prior assurances from Gov. Eric Holcomb and other state leaders that schools would remain fully funded. Republican Rod Bray told school leaders in the letter sent Thursday that he wants to \"make sure they understand\" that state law currently caps per-pupil funding for students who take at least half their classes virtually to 85% of basic tuition support. That means school districts only offering online instruction to minimize the potential spread of COVID-19 could lose 15% of their basic per student funding, equivalent to losing $855 in funding per student. More than 30 districts are already planning to start their school years online, State Superintendent of Public Instruction Jennifer McCormick said during a Thursday webinar.\n\nAmes: An Iowa State University program to administer coronavirus tests as students move back to campus has found 66 testing positive, the university said in a statement Friday. That's about 2.2% of the 3,037 students who have moved in to residence halls and campus apartments and taken tests. About half of the students testing positive chose to return home to complete isolation, said Kristen Obbink, the university's COVID-19 public health coordinator. The university has isolation rooms set up for positive cases and quarantine rooms for those who are notified of exposure through contact tracing. The tests are one part of the university's coronavirus mitigation plan. The College of Veterinary Medicine's Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory is processing the COVID-19 tests and providing results within 24 hours.\n\nTopeka: Gov. Laura Kelly tested negative for the coronavirus Friday as a Republican legislative leader faced criticism from some Democrats for not telling colleagues until this week that he'd been infected and hospitalized before he, Kelly and other top lawmakers had a public meeting last month. Fellow Republican leaders defended House Speaker Ron Ryckman Jr., saying he took more than adequate precautions to prevent spreading the virus after learning he might have it July 10 and had been cleared by a doctor before attending a meeting with Kelly on July 29 at the Statehouse. They also accused the Democratic governor of politicizing his case. Senate Minority Leader Anthony Hensley, a Topeka Democrat, said he also would get tested, adding that the House speaker \"can't be trusted.\" Kelly has called Ryckman's attendance at the July 29 meeting \"reckless and dangerous.\"\n\nFrankfort: The state's teacher union is calling on school officials to delay the beginning of in-class instruction until the COVID-19 positivity rate drops. The Kentucky Education Association released a statement Friday calling on schools to start the year with virtual learning from home. The union said districts should avoid reopening until the positivity rate of the state and the school's county remain under 4% for 21 consecutive days. \"The coronavirus situation in Kentucky at this moment is far worse than it was in March,\" when schools and school-related activities were halted, the KEA wrote. \"If we all believed it wasn't safe to operate schools then, how can it possibly be safe to reopen now?\" Gov. Andy Beshear said Friday the state's positivity rate - a seven-day rolling figure reflecting the average percentage of tests coming back positive for COVID-19 - had increased to 5.57%.\n\nBaton Rouge: Gov. John Bel Edwards is questioning why the state must pay a portion of the costs to use the state's National Guard in coronavirus response work if the federal government is picking up the full tab in some other states, including Texas and Florida. The Democratic governor sent a letter Friday to President Donald Trump asking that the federal government continue to cover all costs of activating the Louisiana National Guard as it did earlier this year. If Louisiana has to pay a 25% cost share through December, that would cost the state $2.5 million a month, Edwards said. Louisiana is using 1,100 members of the National Guard to staff virus testing sites, support food bank operations and distribute protective equipment to hospitals, schools and other locations. In prior months of the coronavirus outbreak, Louisiana had full federal funding for the activation. But Trump changed the reimbursement terms in the latest authorization.\n\nPortland: The state's university system is providing gardening buddies. The University of Maine Cooperative Extension said it's launching a program to match gardeners of different experience levels. Gardening has emerged as a popular hobby during the coronavirus pandemic. The extension said the Garden Mentorship Program will match residents with master gardener volunteers to provide virtual technical assistance and coaching. Gardeners can get involved by filling out a Garden Mentor Request form on the UMaine website. The extension said the program is geared at gardeners ranging from novices to old pros.\n\nAnnapolis: The state is reporting a new low COVID-19 positivity rate statewide, but state officials are concerned about the rate in Worcester County on the Eastern Shore. Gov. Larry Hogan announced Sunday that Maryland's seven-day average positivity rate has dropped to 3.75%. The state says that's the lowest level reported since the pandemic began. The administration also says the daily positivity rate is at a record low as well. Out of a record 40,473 tests, 2.72% came back positive. The positivity rate is above 5% in Prince George's, Queen Anne's and Worcester counties. It's 5.53% in Prince George's and 5.05% in Queen Anne's. While the 6.23% positivity rate in Worcester has started to plateau, state officials say it remains a concern.\n\nBoston: The state is cracking down on larger gatherings, bars \"masquerading\" as restaurants and other events that could help spread the coronavirus as public health officials work to tamp down an uptick in COVID-19 cases, Gov. Charlie Baker said Friday. Baker also said he is postponing indefinitely step two of the third phase of the state's reopening plan. Baker said there have been recent reports of big parties that have helped the virus spread. \"These parties are too big, too crowded, and people are simply not being responsible about face coverings, social distancing,\" Baker said, pointing to a recent wedding in Gardner that drew together more than 300 people. Baker said he is rolling back the size of outdoor gatherings allowed from 100 to 50. Some bars have tried to skirt the regulation that allows restaurants to serve alcoholic drinks with meals prepared on site, according to Baker. Just offering pretzels and potato chips doesn't count, Baker said.\n\nLansing: Gov. Gretchen Whitmer on Friday extended the state's coronavirus emergency through Sept. 4, enabling her to keep in place restrictions designed to curb the spread of COVID-19. The governor, whose administration last week said new cases had recently plateaued, noted that they still remain higher than nearly two months ago and that many students will return to in-person instruction over the next month. The seven-day statewide average is up sixfold since June 10, to about 700 cases per day, according to an Associated Press analysis of data from Johns Hopkins University. The rate of tests coming back positive also has trended higher since early June. \"I will continue to use every tool at my disposal to protect Michiganders from the spread of this virus,\" Whitmer said in a statement.\n\nLake Park: Thirty grieving members of a family in a small northwestern Minnesota town have contracted the coronavirus after attending a funeral for a loved one. The family of 78-year-old Francis Perreault gathered at the Catholic church in the Becker County community of Lake Park in mid-July to celebrate his life. Yet despite wearing masks and taking precautions, 30 people contracted COVID-19, including five who were hospitalized, the Star Tribune reports. \"We tried to do everything right, but of course when you're grieving, you let your guard down,\" said Stephanie Schindler, Perreault's daughter. \"One of my friends that got sick was wearing a mask the whole time. But of course when you're crying, you're going to be rubbing your face.\" Schindler said several of those hospitalized have since been released. She said the positive tests have brought home the reality that COVID-19 is a threat even in places that aren't so densely populated.\n\nJackson: Gov. Tate Reeves has announced a $55 million initiative to create workforce training programs at community colleges and offer financial incentives to employers to hire individuals who have lost work due to the coronavirus. The aim of ReSkill Mississippi is to help ease the economic burden and uncertainty the coronavirus pandemic has created for Mississippi's workforce, Reeves said. Most of the ReSkillMS money will be used by the state's community colleges to expand capacity in high-demand programs and to offer free short-term training. Approximately $5 million will be used for employers willing to hire and train individuals who have been furloughed, laid off or hurt economically by the pandemic. Employers are eligible to be reimbursed for up to 75% of the individual's wages during the training period. The program requires a minimum fair wage threshold of $15 per hour.\n\nSt. Louis: A judge has ordered a halt to evictions in the city through the end of August, but a civil rights advocacy group says the moratorium should be extended due to the coronavirus pandemic. Circuit Court Presiding Judge Rex Burlison issued the order Thursday. It does not apply to commercial property or properties where illegal drug activity occurred. The St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports St. Louis Sheriff Vernon Betts stopped serving eviction notices Tuesday after meeting with housing advocates. ArchCity Defenders, a St. Louis-based nonprofit civil rights law firm, called the moratorium a \"good first step\" but urged a 120-day moratorium on evictions. \"Evictions jeopardize the safety and stability of vulnerable families, inflict trauma, and are incredibly difficult to recover from,\" ArchCity Defenders said in a statement. A previous moratorium on evictions in St. Louis began in March and continued through early July.\n\nHelena: Candidates clashed over the coronavirus response during the state's first U.S. Senate debate of the 2020 contest, as Republican incumbent Sen. Steve Daines faced his Democratic opponent, Gov. Steve Bullock, in a competitive race that Democrats hope to win in their quest to regain control of the Senate. As the number of coronavirus cases in the state remains high, the candidates agreed on the need to prioritize public health over the economy. But they diverged in their assessment of the response thus far. Daines applauded President Donald Trump's handling of the pandemic, saying Trump has \"led boldly.\" Bullock said the federal government has politicized the response, rather than focusing on public health. While Bullock earned praise for issuing a stay-at-home order that kept infection rates low early in the pandemic, Republicans have since criticized Bullock for being slow to distribute $1.25 billion in federal coronavirus relief funds.\n\nOmaha: The Omaha Public School District said Friday that students will all learn remotely and all athletics will be canceled for at least the first quarter of the school year in response to the coronavirus pandemic. The state's largest school district also delayed the start of the school year from next Tuesday to Aug. 18, to give teachers time to prepare for the changes. The first quarter will last through Oct. 16. The change to remote learning is in the best interests and for the safety of students, teachers and staff, Superintendent Cheryl Logan wrote on the district's website. \"We understand the important role extra-curricular activities play in a student's school experience,\" Logan wrote. \"This suspension is for the health and safety of everyone.\" The district had planned to start school by dividing students into two groups, with each group attending school in person part of the week and learning remotely the rest of the week.\n\nLas Vegas: The city has issued a civil penalty against a hotel for hosting a faith-based campaign event for President Donald Trump that violated a mandate intended to limit the spread of COVID-19 despite warnings from city and state officials. The event proceeded as planned Thursday despite Democratic Gov. Steve Sisolak's mandate, which limits gatherings to no more than 50 people in an indoor or outdoor area. The Evangelicals for Trump event was headlined by Trump's personal pastor, Paula White, and brought together more than 500 people at the Ahern Hotel. The hotel lobby's maximum occupancy is more than 1,600, organizers said. Masks were required, temperature checks were conducted, and a sign ordered anyone feeling ill to go home. The Trump campaign maintained that hotels are allowed to hold events at 50% occupancy and are not subject to the 50-person event cap placed on churches and other venues.\n\nWindham: State health officials are investigating a potential coronavirus outbreak linked to a church. The state Department of Health and Human Services said Friday that 16 people who have tested positive for COVID-19 have connections to the Windham Crossing Life Church. Health officials say anyone who attended events associated with the church since July might have been exposed to the virus and should be tested. That includes a YouthStorm Inc. camp event held July 16-18, the department said. \"The public should not attend events related to the Windham Crossing Life Church over the next week while DHHS investigates these illnesses further,\" the agency said in a statement.\n\nTrenton: Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy said Friday that the state's COVID-19 trends were heading in the right direction after climbing higher the week before. The rate of transmission dropped to 1.15 from 1.23, Murphy said Friday. The prior week, the rate - which represents to the number of people to whom one infected person passes the virus - reached nearly 1.5. The testing positivity rate dipped to 1.95%, down from 2.57% earlier in the week, Murphy said. But he stopped short of announcing any new reopenings for businesses. The state is currently in the second of three stages of reopening its economy since the virus hit New Jersey in March. Murphy also said his administration was setting up a $25 million loan program for small landlords aimed at alleviating economic pressure on them and renters. Lt. Gov. Sheila Oliver said the money would come from federal coronavirus relief funds.\n\nSanta Fe: State Public Education Secretary Ryan Stewart has returned to New Mexico and is self-quarantining as a precaution against coronavirus transmission after working remotely for several months from a home in Philadelphia, a state spokeswoman said Friday. Stewart's extended stay with family outside the state has prompted questions about the boundaries of remote work as much of the state's workforce is urged to work from home to slow the spread of COVID-19. Judy Robinson, a spokeswoman for the governor's office, said Stewart continues to use remote technology to conduct meetings with staff and meet other responsibilities while in isolation. New Mexico currently requires travelers to self-quarantine for 14 days when entering or returning to the state. In an advisory opinion Friday, the New Mexico State Ethics Commission said there is no residency requirement for Cabinet officials.\n\nAlbany: Schools can bring children back to classrooms for the start of the school year, Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced Friday, citing success in battling the coronavirus in the state that once was the U.S. heart of the pandemic. The Democratic governor's decision clears the way for schools to offer at least some days of in-person classes, alongside remote learning. Students will be required to wear masks throughout the school day. \"Everywhere in the state, every region is below the threshold that we established,\" Cuomo told reporters. He said New York can \"revisit\" if the infection rate spikes. Many New York school districts have planned to start the year with students in school buildings only a few days a week, while learning at home the rest of the time. The state has left tough decisions - on how to handle sick students, how much time children will spend in class, whether to delay in-person instruction - up to individual districts.\n\nCharlotte: The state will ease gathering restrictions for the Republican National Convention in the city this month after a push by the national party for the state to be more accommodating. But the Aug. 21-24 event culminating in President Donald Trump's nomination will be nothing like conventions of previous years in which prominent politicians and party leaders addressed thousands of enthusiastic supporters. The RNC has estimated it would have no more than 500 delegates per day at the Charlotte Convention Center and the Westin hotel. In a letter written to the RNC on Thursday, the state's health director and chief medical officer, Elizabeth Cuervo Tilson, said the Department of Health and Human Services understands more than 10 people may need to assemble indoors to conduct party business.\n\nFargo: The Spirit Lake Nation in northeastern North Dakota took measures in the spring to minimize the spread of the coronavirus, including the financially painful decision to close the casino where many tribal members work. COVID-19 numbers stayed relatively low. Then residents became complacent and attended gatherings over the July Fourth weekend, translating into a spike in cases, tribal officials said. The reservation's primary county, Benson County, has had the most confirmed new cases per capita in the state in the past two weeks, according to the COVID Tracking Project. Similar increases are being reported among other tribes in North Dakota, state Indian Affairs Commissioner Scott Davis said. Spirit Lake Chairman Douglas Yankton and other tribal leaders have been taking renewed steps to slow the spread of the virus. Spirit Lake is believed to be the first municipality in the state to issue a mask mandate, and the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa followed suit. Other tribes have instituted quarantine and curfew orders.\n\nColumbus: The state's high school football season will be shortened to six games this fall, and all teams will advance to the playoffs, if contact sports are approved by Gov. Mike DeWine, the state high school sports association announced Friday. The move follows a recommendation from DeWine's office to shorten the season out of concerns the coronavirus pandemic might spike in early winter, the Ohio High School Athletic Association said. If DeWine approves a football season, all teams will enter playoffs beginning Oct. 9, and state championship games will be played no later than Nov. 21, the OHSAA said. DeWine has promised an announcement next week on whether high school contact sports, including football, soccer and basketball, could go forward this fall. The change adopted by the OHSAA also allows schools to void their regular season football contracts with other schools.\n\nOklahoma City: State Treasurer Randy McDaniel said revenue collections by the state rose by more than 27% in July due to a delay in the state income tax filing deadline because of the coronavirus pandemic, but not enough to offset previous shortfalls. \"While July collections were strong, a different picture emerges when taking into account the delay of income tax filing,\" McDaniel said Wednesday. \"The details show the positive bottom line is concealing some less than favorable developments.\" The state collected $1.43 billion during the first month of the fiscal year, an increase of $306.1 million over July 2019, McDaniel said. Individual and corporate income tax collections rose by $699.5 million, a $360.5 million increase from July 2019, but short of a $414.4 million decrease in April, according to a release from the treasurer's office. The income tax filing deadline was delayed from April to July.\n\nSalem: The Legislature will meet for its second special session of 2020 beginning Monday to try to fix a $1.2 billion revenue hole due to the COVID-19 pandemic. While some lawmakers predict the session could be completed within a day or two, that time frame could be lengthened depending on whether the Legislature decides to focus on the budget or to also include bills altering policy, such as ones surrounding police reform following more than two months of sometimes violent protests in Portland after George Floyd's killing. \"I want to deal with the budget. That's it,\" said Senate President Peter Courtney, D-Salem. Democrats hold solid majorities in both the Senate and the House. Courtney said he does not oppose the proposed policy changes surrounding law enforcement but thinks the focal point should be on addressing the cuts and changes needed because of cratering revenues due to coronavirus shutdowns.\n\nHarrisburg: The governing body for school sports in the state on Friday delayed making, for at least two weeks, a decision about whether to follow the governor's recommendation and cancel sports until January. The board of the Pennsylvania Interscholastic Athletic Association said mandatory fall sports activities are on hold until its next meeting Aug. 21. The association hopes to use that time to discuss the matter further with Gov. Tom Wolf. Voluntary workouts can continue in the meantime. \"It is clear to PIAA, the unintended consequences of canceling fall sports need to be further reviewed,\" the association's statement said. The group maintains fall sports can be conducted safely. The board issued a statement that said it wanted Wolf and agencies under him \"to partner with us and work collaboratively to further discuss fall sports\" and hoped for \"insight and discussion\" from state lawmakers.\n\nProvidence: A federal appeals court has rejected a bid by Republicans to reinstate the state's witness requirement for mail-in ballots. A lower court recently suspended the requirement that those voting by mail have two witnesses or a notary sign their ballot envelope, a move that would require face-to-face and hand-to-hand interactions. Groups that sued over the rule said it unnecessarily puts people's health at risk during the coronavirus pandemic. The court's ruling applies to the September primaries and November general elections. Republicans urged the 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to put the lower court's decision on hold, but the appeals court rejected their request Friday. Rhode Island Secretary of State Nellie M. Gorbea called it \"another victory for voting rights and the safety of Rhode Islanders.\" \"No one should have to choose between their health and their constitutional right to vote,\" she said in a statement.\n\nColumbia: The doctor serving as the state epidemiologist said she regrets not speaking out publicly about her concerns as South Carolina reopened close-contact businesses during the coronavirus pandemic. Dr. Linda Bell said in June emails that Gov. Henry McMaster's staff misled the public to believe she supported the Republican governor's May decision to allow restaurants to resume dine-in service and barbershops and other businesses to reopen, The State reports. Bell has served as the public face of the state Department of Health and Environmental Control's effort to stem COVID-19. In an email to two agency colleagues June 21, Bell said she had tried to avoid any sign of public disagreement with McMaster during news conferences on the virus response, and the governor's staff had misleadingly framed her silence as support.\n\nSturgis: There aren't many signs of the pandemic at the massive annual motorcycle rally being held this week in this small city along Interstate 90 in western South Dakota. The scene Saturday at the 80th Sturgis Motorcycle Rally was familiar to veterans of the event, with throngs of maskless bikers packing the streets. Bars and nightclubs that line the city's main drag were filled with revelers as the sun set Friday. Organizers expected the overall crowd for the rally to be smaller, perhaps half the size of a normal year, when some half-million people from across the country roar into a town whose population is about 7,000. The sheer numbers raise the prospect that this year's rally could spread the coronavirus in a state with no special limits on indoor crowds, no mask mandates, and a governor who is eager to welcome visitors and their money. \"Screw COVID,\" read the design on one T-shirt being hawked at the event. \"I went to Sturgis.\"\n\nCookeville: More than 80 students in one school district have been quarantined during the first week of classes after a student tested positive for COVID-19, the illness caused by the new coronavirus, officials said. News outlets report a student at Cookeville High School tested positive, and others who were in close contact with the student have been told to quarantine for 14 days, according to the school district in mostly rural Putnam County. An additional seven teachers and staff and a bus driver are also at home due to a positive test or coming into close contact with someone who tested positive. Many of the contacts occurred outside of school, which started last week, the district said. \"As educators, we believe that in-person learning is best; however, we are keenly aware that there will continue to be positive cases in our schools and in our community,\" Director of Schools Corby King said in a news release.\n\nAustin: Gov. Greg Abbott on Saturday extended a statewide disaster declaration he first issued in March to allow the state to better respond to the coronavirus pandemic. \"Renewing this Disaster Declaration will provide communities with the resources they need to respond to COVID-19,\" Abbott said in a statement. \"I urge Texans to remain vigilant in our fight against this virus. Everyone must do their part to slow the spread of COVID-19 by wearing a mask, practicing social distancing, and washing your hands frequently and thoroughly.\" State health officials on Friday reported 481,483 people with the virus that has left at least 8,343 dead. The true number of cases in Texas is likely higher because many people have not been tested, and studies suggest people can be infected and not feel sick. Health officials also reported 7,872 people hospitalized.\n\nSalt Lake City: The Utah Board of Education has rejected multiple proposals requiring stricter precautions against the coronavirus as schools reopen across the state. The board voted 9-5 Thursday against a series of mandates, including one that would limit the number of students in a classroom if community spread spikes above the 5% reopening threshold set by the World Health Organization, the Deseret News reports. The board did move to require school districts to draw plans and protocols for how they would respond in the event of an outbreak. Each district must also decide how to balance education against current public health risks. Park City and 24 other districts - mostly in rural areas - will allow students to return full time. Another 16 will shorten days or divide students into groups attending in person on separate days. Only Salt Lake remains fully online.\n\nMontpelier: A new grant program has been set up to help child care providers during the coronavirus pandemic, Gov. Phil Scott said Friday. The program includes $12 million in federal CARES funds to help after-school programs, summer camps, and other child care programs offset expenses and losses. Applications are open now through Aug. 26; award notices are anticipated by Sept. 11. \"We are so grateful to the child care workers and programs who have stepped up to provide critical services to children and their families throughout this crisis,\" Scott said. The Child Development Division of the Department for Children and Families, in collaboration with Building Bright Futures, will host a live informational webinar for applicants Aug. 11. A separate opportunity for parent child centers and Children's Integrated Services' fiscal agents to learn about the grant process will be held the week of Aug. 10.\n\nRichmond: The state Supreme Court has granted a request from Gov. Ralph Northam to suspend judicial proceedings related to evictions for tenants who can't pay rent. The court ruled 4-3 on Friday to grant a moratorium on evictions through Sept. 7 as the state grapples with the coronavirus pandemic. That will give the General Assembly and governor time to pass a rent relief package in a special session that is set to start later this month. The high court instituted a moratorium in March but allowed it to expire earlier this summer. Northam requested another statewide moratorium in late July, noting that there had been 6,000 eviction hearings scheduled between July 20 and Aug. 7. He also said there have been \"concerning increases\" in cases in the Hampton Roads area and spikes in other parts of the state.\n\nOlympia: Health authorities in the state on Friday said there have now been 11 cases of a pediatric inflammatory illness associated with the new coronavirus reported in the state. Kristen Maki, a spokesperson for the Department of Health, said the cases occurred between April and July. She said according to the latest information available to state officials, most of the children were admitted to intensive care units but have since been discharged home. The Department of Health said Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children is defined as a patient under the age of 21 with a fever, laboratory evidence of inflammation and severe illness involving more than two organs that requires hospitalization. Patients must also have a positive COVID-19 test or exposure to a confirmed case in the four weeks before symptoms began, the department said.\n\nMorgantown: City officials have extended an outdoor dining program initially put in place as a coronavirus safety precaution. The no-fee outdoor dining permit program will now run until Dec. 31, according to a news release Thursday. Applications can be found on the city's website. Morgantown set up the program to allow businesses to operate outdoors while complying with virus rules issued in May. Restaurants must follow occupancy and social distancing rules as well as other local health department rules.\n\nMilwaukee: Three workers hired to help set up the Democratic National Convention in the city have tested positive for COVID-19, according to the event's organizers. Daily screening for people working at the Wisconsin Center began last week in preparation for the Aug. 17-20 convention. Organizers wanted to identify positive cases before the workers entered the venue and were around others. \"In consultation with public health officials and experts, the Democratic National Convention Committee has implemented stringent health and safety protocols - including daily testing for anyone accessing the convention complex and contact tracing,\" convention organizers said Thursday. Staff at the Wisconsin Center \"followed the guidelines set forth by our client regarding daily health screens,\" the center district said in a statement.\n\nLaramie: Wyoming football delayed the start of fall practice from last Friday to Tuesday amid plans to alter the game schedule because of the coronavirus pandemic. The Mountain West Conference plans to have each team play 10 regular-season games including up to two non-conference games. A final schedule is pending, but teams will play no sooner than the week of Sept. 26 under the league's current plan, the Casper Star-Tribune reports. All fall practices will be closed to the general public, including news media. Wyoming finished 8-5 last season. Returning starters include quarterback Sean Chambers and conference rushing leader Xazavian Valladay.",

One night I sweated through five shirts. I shook so much from the chills I thought I chipped a tooth. My chest felt like LeBron James was sitting on it. My fatigue made it feel as if I was dressed in the chains of Jacob Marley's ghost. I coughed so hard it felt like I broke a rib.\"\n\nPlaschke, 61, wrote that he thinks he became infected while meeting friends for two dinners at an outdoor patio with social distancing, in accordance with local ordinances. He also said he had been following rules of self-isolation and had been wearing his mask when needed.\n\n\"I would fall asleep in a chair and wake up terrified from a hallucinatory dream where I was chased through a playground by old women with giant heads,\" he continued. \"During phone calls I would get confused and just stop talking. I would begin crying for no reason. I lost my sense of taste, smell, and five pounds in the first four days.\"\n\nPlaschke also wrote about the mental toll from the virus, how it sparked a pang of fear over his future health, how he contemplated heading to the hospital.\n\n\"Nobody tells you about the dread,\" he wrote. \"From the moment my doctor phoned me with the test results, to the moment I am writing this column, I have been scared out of my mind.\"\n\nPlaschke said he was writing about his experiences to spread awareness of its effects. He also suggested that leagues and college conferences strongly consider altering their plans to play in the fall amid the pandemic.\n\n\"The novel coronavirus is not a statistic,\" Plaschke concluded. \"It's not an agenda. It's not a debate. COVID-19 is real enough to rise up and beat me senseless. We need to stop giving it license to do the same to others.\"",

    "CDC changes COVID-19 testing guidelines: This 'will kill,' experts say": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "Infectious disease experts are not only confused, but also troubled, by the recent change in testing guidelines made by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention who said people without symptoms may not need a test - even if they've been exposed to the coronavirus.\n\n\"Our work on the 'silent' spread underscored the importance of testing people who have been exposed to COVID-19 regardless of symptoms,\" tweeted Alison Galvani, director for the Center for Infectious Disease Modeling and Analysis at Yale School of Medicine. \"This change in policy will kill.\"\n\nBefore changes were made Monday, the CDC website previously said that testing was recommended \"for all close contacts of persons with SARS-CoV-2 infection.\"\n\nThe website now says that someone who was in close contact (within six feet) of a person with COVID-19 for at least 15 minutes but doesn't have symptoms does not \"necessarily need a test.\" The agency said exceptions are made for \"vulnerable\" individuals, or those who were recommended to take a test by a health care provider or local public health official.\n\nThe CDC estimates in its COVID-19 Pandemic Planning Scenarios that 40% of infections are asymptomatic and 50% of transmissions occur before symptoms appear. Experts worry that failing to test asymptomatic carriers could not only result in more infections but also hinder contact tracing efforts.\n\n\"If being in close personal contact with an infected person... isn't sufficiently important enough to get tested, I don't see that there's any value in contact tracing,\" said Peter Pitts, president of the nonprofit Center for Medicine in the Public Interest.\n\nA spokesperson at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services told CNN the change wouldn't \"undermine contact tracing or any other types of surveillance testing.\"\n\nRapid testing: Inaccurate results from rapid COVID-19 tests raise concerns about widespread screening\n\nCoronavirus vaccine: Should employers force workers to get COVID-19 vaccine? Some experts say they should\n\nWhile Pitts says that change in CDC guidelines \"is not permission to do away with testing,\" he's worried that some may take it that way. He said the agency should be encouraging more testing.\n\nArnold Monto, professor of epidemiology at the University of Michigan School for Public Health, said this might be a way of prioritizing testing based on location, availability of testing and community spread. But he thinks the statement needs clarification.\n\nAn HHS spokesperson told the New York Times that \"testing capacity has massively expanded\" and the country is \"not utilizing the full capacity that we have developed,\" saying the guidance was revised to reflect \"current evidence\" and \"the best public health interventions.\"\n\nNeither HHS nor CDC has responded to USA TODAY's request for comment.\n\n\"This type of statement from the CDC just shows they're really not in the game (with) aggressively combating COVID-19 and that's unfortunate,\" Pitts said.\n\nFollow Adrianna Rodriguez on Twitter: @AdriannaUSAT.",

    "CDC joins global movement to encourage use of face masks": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Pandemic Action Network are partnering with more than 40 organizations to host World Mask Week beginning Friday in an effort to increase the use of face coverings across the globe.\n\nWearing a mask in public spaces has been stressed by medical professionals as a primary way of slowing the spread of COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus.\n\nDr. Ali Nouri, President of the American Federation of Scientists, said the event will help normalize wearing a face mask.\n\n\"If you're not masking, you're not just putting yourself at risk but you're putting other people at risk,\" said Nouri. \"The more people that understand that and realize that their well-being depends on other people doing the right thing, that's going to generate more pressure, more momentum and more acceptability of masks.\"\n\nFace masks slow the spread of the virus by blocking the spray of respiratory droplets that come from sneezing, coughing, talking, singing or shouting.\n\nThe goal of World Mask Week is to encourage people around the world to embrace the use of face masks until a vaccine is available. The initiative will be promoted through social media challenges calling on all people, including celebrities, politicians and health care workers, to post a statement, pictures or videos of themselves wearing a mask with the tag #WorldMaskWeek.\n\nWhile medical professionals support mask wearing in public the issue has become controversial, with some in the U.S. protesting that mandating masks violates constitutional rights. President Donald Trump took to Twitter last month to promote masks for the first time.\n\nMore: Confrontations over face masks and the psychology behind why some people resist them\n\nNouri noted COVID-19 can be spread from people who do not have symptoms. He said normalizing mask wearing will save thousands of lives.\n\nA model projection of COVID-19 deaths by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington showed if 95% of people in the U.S. wore a mask in public spaces, nearly 34,000 fewer people would die from the disease.\n\nMichael Sheldrick, chief policy and government affairs officer at Global Citizen, hopes normalizing masks in public spaces and encouraging government officials to mandate them will help quell the pandemic.\n\n\"What we will continue to do is promote clear and consistent messaging to encourage governments also to promote public information campaigns around the effectiveness and importance of wearing masks in public,\" said Sheldrick. \"This will ensure that it's both a common sense measure and an act of national and global social solidarity.\"",

    "CDC walks back surprise coronavirus asymptomatic testing guidelines": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Thursday attempted to clarify controversial coronavirus testing guidelines published Monday that said people with no symptoms \"do not necessarily need a test\" even if they were exposed to an infected person.\n\nThe medical community had criticized the agency's looser guidelines, which some scientists said had been made for political rather than scientific reasons. President Donald Trump has claimed that the United States' large number of coronavirus cases is the result of widespread testing, though that hasn't been supported by the number of deaths and hospitalizations.\n\nPublic health officials say testing people who might have been exposed to COVID-19, whether or not they show symptoms, is crucial to knowing how many people in the United States are infected with COVID-19. It also makes it possible to do effective contact tracing and quarantining to stop the spread of the virus.\n\nPrior to Monday, the CDC website said testing was recommended \"for all close contacts of persons with SARS-CoV-2 infection,\" the virus that causes COVID-19.\n\nOn Monday that was changed to say that someone who was in close contact (within 6 feet) of a person with COVID-19 for at least 15 minutes but didn't have symptoms does not \"necessarily need a test.\"\n\nGuidance released Thursday by CDC Director Robert Redfield says those who come in contact with a confirmed or probable COVID-19 patient could be tested, even if they don't show symptoms.\n\nTesting people who have potentially been exposed to COVID-19 helps the public health effort to stop the spread of the virus, said Dr. Tom Frieden, president and CEO of Resolve to Save Lives, an initiative of Vital Strategies.\n\n\"How important is testing of contacts? Important - that way you can find, trace and stop chains of transmission,\" he said.\n\n\"There are still things we're learning about which contacts to test, when, and how best to use that information, but it's clear that if we don't test asymptomatic contacts, we will miss chains of transmission and weaken our ability to stop the virus,\" he said.\n\nWithout access to testing, contact tracing becomes very difficult because people are told to quarantine for 14 days without an opportunity to learn whether they're infected, said Dr. William Schaffner, a professor in the division of preventive medicine and infectious disease at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee.\n\nMonday's revision meant \"people were scratching their heads and a little taken aback,\" Schaffner said. \"We were looking to expanding testing, particularly among asymptomatic people.\"\n\nDr. Brett Giroir, HHS Assistant Secretary for Health, said during a news conference Wednesday that the change was meant to encourage more \"appropriate testing, not less testing.\"\n\nThe guidance released Monday said exceptions can be made for vulnerable individuals or those who were recommended to take a test by a health care provider or public health official.\n\nCDC faces second-guessing, political pressure\n\nCDC has faced tremendous pressure and second-guessing during the course of the pandemic. In part that's due to early missteps on faulty tests that didn't work and because of possible political input into its guidance on school reopenings.\n\nCNN reported Wednesday the change in testing criteria was due to political pressure from the upper ranks of the Trump administration.\n\nGiroir said Wednesday the looser guidelines had been reviewed by the Coronavirus Task Force, including Dr. Anthony Fauci. But Fauci told CNN he was under general anesthesia for surgery when the matter was discussed last week.\n\nTrump has suggested multiple times that the United States' higher testing levels is responsible for its high case numbers.\n\nThe United States leads the world in the number of reported COVID-19 cases, according to Johns Hopkins University. As of Thursday, the U.S. had about 24% of the world's reported cases and about 22% of COVID-19 deaths, but it has about 4% of the reported population.\n\nAt a rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma, in June, Trump told the crowd the United States had already conducted 25 million tests. \"When you do testing to that extent, you're going to find more people, you're going to find more cases, so I said to my people, 'Slow the testing down, please.'\"\n\nThe next day White House trade advisor Peter Navarro said Trump's comment was \"tongue in cheek.\"\n\nThis week's back-and-forth further undermines public faith in government health institutions just as it's most needed, said Dr. Peter Hotez, dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine.\n\n\"The original guidelines made no sense, as they were not supported by the science,\" he said. \"While it's good CDC is walking it back, this misstep comes at a price. The American people are losing confidence in the U.S. public health response to COVID-19.\"\n\nRedfield's Thursday statement said \"everyone who needs a COVID-19 test, can get a test.\"\n\nBut, he said, \"Everyone who wants a test does not necessarily need a test; the key is to engage the needed public health community in the decision with the appropriate follow-up action.\"\n\nPublic health doctors agreed with that statement, given that COVID-19 tests in the United States are still in short supply in some areas. Backlogs earlier this summer meant some people had to wait a week to get results, though the largest commercial labs say they now average two days.\n\nSo it makes sense to discourage people who are simply among the \"worried well\" from getting tested, Schaffner said. \"Just having Suzy or Frank walk in off the street, we can discourage that,\" he said.",

        "authors": [],
        "body": "Jayme Fraser, Sommer Brugal, Thomas Langhorne, Arika Herron and Rachel Fradette USA TODAY NETWORK\n\nAs children and teachers started returning to classrooms over the past few weeks, new cases of COVID-19 emerged, forcing some schools to temporarily shift to online-learning only and hundreds of students to quarantine at home until their health was assured.\n\nWhile those developments have been well-documented, it's what remains unknown that has been more troubling for some parents and educators.\n\nInformation that schools, health officials and state agencies share about known cases varies substantially, leaving some stakeholders to wonder how safe they or their children may be when new cases emerge.\n\nIn Gainesville, Florida, where several staff members working at an in-person summer program contracted coronavirus, the absence of a communitywide notification protocol allowed rumors and fear to spread. Despite assurances from district officials that they will share as much information as they can about cases this fall, some parents and teachers remain skeptical that they will learn enough, soon enough to feel safe.\n\n\"Are you going to tell us what's going on? How are we going to find out about cases?\" asked Janine Plavac, a nurse and teacher who serves as director of the Academy of Health Professions at Gainesville High School. \"Right now, I have no faith in transparency in this district.\"\n\nMelissa Tines, a mother of three children attending classes in Evansville, Indiana, said it is important that communication not be limited only to people with known exposures. She wants to know how many COVID-19 cases emerge in those schools -- even if they don't involve her kids.\n\n\"I would be able to discuss with my kids how to be cautious,\" she said. \"If it was something that became a problem where the number was creeping up, then I may be able to make the decision that school isn't a safe option, and we may have to bring them home.\"\n\nFederal law prohibits the disclosure of personal medical records by health providers, and no one is asking that people who contract the virus be identified on local news broadcasts. Yet in many cases, school leaders have prioritized personal privacy over the public right to know, even though HIPAA, the medical privacy law, does not apply to schools, and FERPA, the educational privacy law, does not bar schools from releasing case information so long as individuals aren't named.\n\nMost schools already practice balancing privacy and public health notifications. Principals send letters home alerting parents to cases of lice or providing guidance on meningitis symptoms when someone in the school has become ill. If attendance drops below normal because of the flu, schools sometimes advise parents to keep their kids home when ill and reinforce good hygiene habits.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Education this spring released additional guidance specific to the coronavirus, a global pandemic with risks and scale unmatched by the typical public health issues managed by schools.\n\nIn some cases, the agency said those extraordinary circumstances might mean that schools would even need to share details that could identify a person with coronavirus so others can \"take appropriate precautions.\"\n\nYet over and over again across the country, new cases emerge and some schools choose to notify only people who've had prolonged direct contact with the patient. No notice to others in the school building. No alert to parents. No answers for reporters seeking to confirm or deny local rumors.\n\nIn a recent case in Naples, Florida, school officials refused to say how many people had to quarantine at home afterwards. An emailed statement from the school district read in part, \"It is not appropriate for us to disclose sensitive medical information, which if we did, would otherwise conflict with our obligations under FERPA and HIPAA.\"\n\nCoronavirus and schools: Trump says open schools. Teachers say safety first. As cases rise, unions may win.\n\nIn other parts of the country, school officials have opted for as much transparency as possible. Several superintendents said it not only is the right thing to do but that it will help build trust in the community during a time of unprecedented anxiety and uncertainty.\n\n\"The greater good and the greater need for community health knowledge is superseding our usual complete and total protection of individual privacy,\" said Michael Lubelfeld, who is superintendent of North Shore School District 113 in Highland Park, Illinois. \"I don't want to shield them from the truth. We're all in this together. They have a right to know -- especially because we're a public school district funded by the public and they're entrusting us with their kids.\"\n\nTo better understand how local and state governments are balancing personal privacy with the public's right to know, USA TODAY surveyed the state health departments and education departments in every state and interviewed officials from dozens of schools across the country.\n\nReporters found that decisions about how to communicate about positive cases among students or staff have largely been left up to individual school districts, sometimes in coordination with local health departments, because state leaders often have not provided any guidance.\n\n\"That's been nonexistent,\" said Marlon Styles Jr., who is superintendent of Middletown City School District in Ohio. \"We've had limited communication from a state level, from our governor's office to the state health department. ... The primary source of anything health related has been from our city's health commissioners.\"\n\nSome parents and teachers say their faith in future decisions was harmed by limited communication about positive cases this summer.\n\nIn Alachua County, Florida, a paraprofessional working with students in several classrooms tested positive. A few weeks later in a separate outbreak, several bus drivers became ill and one died. Football players and cheerleaders who attended summer conditioning also contracted the virus.\n\nAlachua County Public Schools Communication Director Jackie Johnson said district officials notified people with known exposures and provided a schoolwide notification about the paraprofessional. In the case of the bus drivers, she said all active transportation staff members were notified, adding that the driver who died was \"case zero\" and had not gotten ill because school officials failed to notify employees about other cases.\n\n\"There was a lot of misinformation floating around,\" she said, brushing off critiques by some teachers and parents that the district was being secretive and ignoring staff members who disputed the official story at school board meetings. \"I've heard the same rumors you have.\"\n\n'It's a little nerve-wracking': Lunchtime for students looks different amid COVID-19\n\nShe pointed to a draft reopening plan published on the district's website as proof the district planned to be transparent this fall. The document generically says parents will be notified about new cases, which Johnson said includes the entire school and not just an affected classroom.\n\n\"We want parents to be aware when there is a case on their campus even if their child did not have significant exposure,\" she said.\n\nSchool officials have similar plans in Martin County, Florida. And they've already had to put them to the test.\n\nOn the second day of school, nine students were sent home to quarantine after a student exhibited signs of the virus. Within less than a week of classes resuming Aug. 11, the total number of students on quarantine reached 136. Only the parents of the students who were in close contact were notified by the district.\n\nDistrict Spokesperson Jennifer DeShazo said it was standard epidemiological practice to not notify anyone else about cases, pointing to contact tracing guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nBut the district's strict focus on contact tracing procedures ignores guidance from the federal departments of health and education that says it is legally allowable and recommended to notify the entire school community about cases of a communicable disease so families can watch for symptoms and manage personal risk factors.\n\nCOVID and schools: Teachers are drafting wills along with lesson plans; one even wrote her own obituary\n\nIndian River School District, another school district on Florida's east coast, plans to do things differently, district spokesperson Cristen Maddux said.\n\nIf there's a positive case on campus, she said, those in close contact with the student or staff would be notified with a direct phone call. In the interest of transparency, others on campus who were not in contact with the presumed positive case would still be notified, but via a robocall from the district.\n\n\"We didn't think it was fair\" to tell only a select few, she said. Many district officials and administrators are parents and \"we all agreed that if there was someone on our child's campus (who tested positive), regardless if our kid was near them, we'd still want to know. We made the decision to say, 'Hey, this has happened,' and parents can make the choice to send their child to school or keep them home. It gives them the option to do that.\"\n\nSome states have provided recommendations to school leaders.\n\nLubelfeld, the superintendent from Illinois, said he has appreciated the general guidance from state health and education officials but has been particularly grateful for his county health officer. For instance, she provided him with copies of form letters that can be used to notify parents and staff members about positive cases, including variations for known contacts, people in the same classroom and a more generic notification for the broader school.\n\n\"It's better to be open, authentic and transparent. That will help build trust even if it does create some anxiety,\" he said. \"This is a pandemic like we've never seen. We owe it to them.\"\n\nThe letters also provide another opportunity to remind families about precautions and school rules. He worries that if schools keep their cases secret, students, parents and teachers might have a false sense of security and be less likely to comply with safety protocols.\n\nIn Texas, the state education department did not make specific recommendations about how to handle communication, but Dallas Independent School District Superintendent Michael Hinojosa said they received general encouragement to be transparent.\n\nHis district has written a playbook for principals on what to do when they learn of a positive case so there is consistency about who receives what kind of information, when and how.\n\nKeeping parents in the loop is important, he said, to empower them to make informed decisions rather than basing them on rumors or fear.\n\n\"They're going to find out about it anyway, and then they're not going to trust you (if you didn't tell them). They're going to wonder what you're trying to hide,\" he said. \"People are so emotional and scared right now, and rightly so. ... The less we communicate, the more terrified people become.\"\n\nIn the absence of state guidance specific to coronavirus -- the most common situation across the U.S. -- local districts have had to develop their own plans. And that has resulted in stark differences even within a single state.\n\nIn school districts that have reopened classrooms in Indiana, USA TODAY Network reporters have tallied at least 158 cases among students and staff -- numbers that state officials are not sharing with the public.\n\nGiven a week to answer emailed questions from USA TODAY, the Indiana State Department of Health did not reply.\n\nAt the district level, communication policies have varied substantially.\n\nWill schools have enough masks?: Some superintendents wonder if there will be enough\n\nWhen asked last week to clarify whether a staff member who tested positive had been in any school buildings the week before the result, a Plainfield Schools spokesperson declined, saying only \"individuals considered to be close contacts\" will be notified when new cases emerge.\n\nJust 50 miles away, South Madison Community School Corp. Superintendent Mark Hall wrote more than 350 words in response to questions about positive cases over the summer involving student athletes, a choir singer and four staff members.\n\nOther Indiana districts have chosen not to release any information.\n\nFor instance, Zionsville Schools declined to clarify whether a positive case involved a student or a staff member out of concern for community stigma.\n\nIn an email, Janet Mann, spokesperson for the district, said children and adults are already experiencing stress and could feel shamed or pressured to consider self-harm because they view contracting the virus as letting others down or contributing to the disruption of a program or sport.\n\nCoronavirus Chronicles: Teachers, students haunted by fall 2020 back-to-school unknowns\n\nJason Woebkenberg, spokesperson for the Evansville Vanderburgh School Corp., said it relies heavily on the Vanderburgh County Health Department for the guidance it seeks -- and the health department is opposed to publishing school-specific COVID-19 data.\n\n\"It's like with a business. If there's a restaurant out there that has two employees that work at the restaurant (who test positive for COVID-19), we don't share that information because it's their information, and it's the employer's information,\" said Joe Gries, the department's administrator.\n\nBut Gries knows it isn't up to him.\n\n\"If there's guidance that comes down from (the state education or health departments) that says they feel people need to know how many cases within a school, then they're going to work with the school corporations to develop that,\" he said.\n\nFirst grade teacher Alyssa Fisher isn't sure whether her school in Mesa, Arizona, will return to in-person instruction or not. As the possible opening date in September grows near, her frustration grows with state officials.\n\n\"Gov. (Doug) Ducey shut down schools in March when we had 12 cases. Now, we're a hotbed, and he's letting the school boards decide,\" she said, sympathizing with local school boards and principals scrambling to decide what's best in the absence of state leadership.\n\nShe is particularly nervous about how local districts will decide to handle communication. In a previous job, she was scolded for telling parents that an unnamed student in the class had a chronic lice problem after two girls became infested.\n\n\"We had a staff meeting about how telling parents about lice is a violation of HIPAA and they likened it to HIV. To me, that was a stretch,\" she recalled. \"Now with COVID, all of us are like, what the heck will happen? Are we going to get a kid test positive and not be able to say anything?\"\n\nCoronavirus and schools: Nurses at reopening schools brace for 'uphill fight' to keep students safe from COVID-19\n\nThe 28-year-old said she is not overly worried about her health but is concerned for colleagues -- like the 68-year-old who taught her decades ago as a child -- and for parents who have to send their kids to school so they can work even if it creates risk for grandparents living with them.\n\n\"If anything can be an exception to the rule, it should be COVID because we don't have information on it,\" she said. \"It's not like HIV, where we have so much data about how it's not easily transmittable among children. Lice isn't a life or death type of situation.\"\n\nFisher admits she's not an expert on privacy laws or health issues. She just wants to know what local leaders decide for the fall so she can prepare for the inevitable conversations with parents -- whether that involves sharing basic school-approved information or not being able to say anything at all.\n\n\"It would be great to start getting an idea about how to navigate those obstacles,\" she said. \"But apparently mum's the word on that, too.\"",

    "COVID news: CDC testing guidelines for asymptomatic people": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has changed its COVID-19 testing guidelines. Now, the CDC says, people without symptoms \"do not necessarily need a test\" -- even if they've been exposed to the coronavirus.\n\nIn Hawaii, its most populous island is returning to stay-at-home orders in its fight against COVID-19, while Massachusetts is learning the startling story of the virus' arrival through new genetic data.\n\nMeanwhile, new research that has not yet undergone scientific peer review is tracking \"superspreader events\" that could help states decide what events or activities are safe during the ongoing pandemic.\n\nAlso Tuesday, Los Angeles County -- the county with the highest number of infections in the U.S. -- reported fewer than 1,000 cases for the first time since early June.\n\nSome significant developments:\n\n\ud83d\udcc8 Today's numbers: The U.S. has more than 5.7 million confirmed infections and 178,000 deaths. Worldwide, there have been more than 820,000 deaths and 23.9 million cases, according to John Hopkins University data.\n\n\ud83d\udcf0 What we're reading: USA TODAY's expert panelists, increasingly optimistic about the prospect of a readily available vaccine, are concerned about who will get it first, how doses will be shipped, and what messages the government must send so Americans trust getting one.\n\nThis file will be updated throughout the day. For updates in your inbox, subscribe to the Daily Briefing.\n\nNew genetic data helps tell the story of how COVID-19 arrived in Massachusetts, exploded across a hotel conference center, wormed its way into a nursing home, repeatedly struck a homeless shelter, and contributed to the virus' march around the globe.\n\nAlthough parts of the story have already been told and others remain elusive, genetic data from many of the COVID-19 infections in the Boston area in March and April helps fill some gaps.\n\nThe new research also tracks several \"superspreading events\" that may help public officials decide which activities are safe and which are dangerous, said Dr. Jacob Lemieux, who helped lead the study, which was posted online Tuesday but has not yet undergone scientific peer review.\n\nOne of the \"superspreading\" events took place in late February at a conference of the biotech company Biogen, which specializes in treating neurological diseases.\n\n- Karen Weintraub\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has changed its COVID-19 testing guidelines. Now, the CDC says, people without symptoms \"do not necessarily need a test\" -- even if they've been exposed to the coronavirus.\n\nSome health experts say the change can discourage people from getting tested. \"It seems as though this new guidance is actively discouraging people from seeking testing, even if they have a known exposure,\" Angela Rasmussen, a research scientist at Columbia Public Health in New York City, told NBC News. \"We need more testing, not less.\"\n\nThe CDC also changed its travel quarantine recommendation on Friday. It says that travelers returning from a trip outside of the U.S. or their state no longer need to quarantine for 14 days.\n\nAfter the Food and Drug Administration offered shaky data to justify its approval of blood plasma to treat COVID-19, some scientists are worried the agency could bow to pressure to approve a coronavirus vaccine before it's fully tested.\n\nSunday, President Donald Trump announced the FDA had issued an Emergency Use Authorization for blood plasma. The president, the Health and Human Services Secretary and the head of the FDA all said the treatment reduced deaths in COVID-19 patients by 35%.\n\nIt did not, and scientists immediately questioned FDA's claims about the data.\n\n\"You saw FDA be bullied by the president of the United States into approving something that they didn't want to approve earlier, because he wanted them to do that,\" said Dr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children's Hospital in Philadelphia, in an online interview Monday with the editor of the Journal of the American Medical Association.\n\n-- Elizabeth Weise\n\nHawaii's most populous island is returning to a stay-at-home order while officials strive to conduct 70,000 COVID-19 tests in two weeks amid a surge in cases. Oahu, where Honolulu is located, has seen daily triple-digit positive cases in recent weeks, an alarming spike after Hawaii had enjoyed the lowest infection rates in the nation per capita earlier in the pandemic.\n\nWith help from the federal government, Oahu officials will conduct mass testing across the island with the goal of testing 5,000 people daily for two weeks, Honolulu Mayor Kirk Caldwell announced Tuesday.\n\nThe tests will be free and no symptoms, health insurance or doctor referral will be needed, Honolulu Fire Chief Manuel Neves said.\n\nStarting Thursday, Oahu will be under a stay-at-home order with gyms and dine-in restaurants to be closed. Religious services will be allowed to continue. So-called essential businesses such as grocery stores, banks and childcare facilities can remain open. Most schools have been providing online instruction.\n\nThe nation's county with the highest number of COVID-19 infections is seeing a decline in confirmed cases. The Los Angeles County Public Health Department confirmed 989 new infections Tuesday, marking the first time it has reported less than 1,000 daily cases since the beginning of June.\n\nThe number of daily confirmed cases from mid to late July was about 3,200, officials said. However, Los Angeles County remains on California's coronavirus watchlist.\n\n\"Last week, we mentioned that we were showing progress on meeting the state's benchmarks for getting off the watchlist, and we are grateful for everyone's sacrifices that have resulted in slowing the spread,\" the county's public health director Barbara Ferrer said in a statement.\n\n\"Because of the lessons we learned from our explosion of cases in July, I need to ask that we continue to significantly modify our actions if we want to keep community transmission rates low,\" Ferrer said.\n\nCalifornia has the most COVID-19 cases of any state with 673,095 infections, according to the state's department of public health.\n\nMontana suspends inmate transfers due to COVID-19 outbreaks\n\nMontana officials said Tuesday they have suspended the transfer of state inmates out of three county jails because of COVID-19 outbreaks that have infected more than 90 inmates and staff.\n\nAt least 34 inmates at the Yellowstone County Detention Center in Billings and 53 inmates at two staff at the Cascade County Detention Center in Great Falls have tested positive for the coronavirus in recent days.\n\nThe movement suspensions will remain until the jails see a \"significant reduction in active virus cases,\" said State Department of Corrections spokeswoman Carolynn Bright.\n\nOn Facebook: There's still a lot unknown about the coronavirus.

    "COVID news: Sturgis Motorcycle Rally; cases in Europe; blood plasma": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "Thousands of people will gather in rural South Dakota yet again as the Sturgis Motorcycle Rally enters its second and final weekend.\n\nIn previous years, half-a-million people have showed up to the event. And despite predictions that the crowd would be halved this year, early arrest reports were keeping pace with past years.\n\nAmid fears of that and other large-scale events leading to a COVID-19 outbreaks, South Dakota's health department reported this week that only people showing symptoms or who were exposed to the virus will be able to get a test. That's despite some local officials in the state planning to conduct mass testing to help head off outbreaks. The move will ensure those who do get tested will get results fast, state epidemiologist Josh Clayton said.\n\nMeanwhile, the virus is again surging in Europe, leading to leaders to reimpose restrictions on travelers, closing nightclubs again, banning fireworks displays and expanding mask orders even in resort areas.\n\nHere are some significant developments:\n\n\ud83d\udcc8 Today's numbers: The U.S. has 5.3 million confirmed infections and more than 168,000 deaths. Worldwide, there have been more than 766,000 deaths and more than million cases, according to John Hopkins University data.\n\n\ud83d\udcf0 What we're reading: The coronavirus pandemic has Americans drinking more at home. How much alcohol is too much per week? Doctors say one key thing to keep in mind: Make sure alcohol consumption doesn't become a salve for discomfort or anxiety.\n\nMayo Clinic researchers reported a strong hint that blood plasma from COVID-19 survivors helps other patients recover, but it's not proof and some experts worry if, amid clamor for the treatment, they'll ever get a clear answer.\n\nMore than 64,000 patients in the U.S. have been given convalescent plasma, a century-old approach to fend off flu and measles before vaccines. It's a go-to tactic when new diseases come along, and history suggests it works against some, but not all, infections.\n\nThere's no solid evidence yet that it fights the coronavirus and, if so, how best to use it. But preliminary data from 35,000 coronavirus patients treated with plasma offers what Mayo lead researcher Dr. Michael Joyner on Friday called \"signals of efficacy.\"\n\nPeople who have had COVID-19 within the past 3 months and come in close contact with someone who is actively infected do not need to quarantine, according to updated guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\n\"People who have tested positive for COVID-19 do not need to quarantine or get tested again for up to 3 months as long as they do not develop symptoms again,\" the new guidance says. \"People who develop symptoms again within 3 months of their first bout of COVID-19 may need to be tested again if there is no other cause identified for their symptoms.\"\n\nBut antibodies may begin to decline sooner than that. A June study in the journal Nature found that antibodies may begin to decrease within 2 to 3 months after infection.\n\nBowling alleys, gyms, museums and other low-risk indoor cultural venues will soon be allowed to open in New York with strict COVID-19 rules, Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Friday.\n\nBowling alleys will be allowed to open Monday, being limited to 50% of occupancy capacity and forced to follow other rules, such as bowlers must have a face covering and every other lane will remain closed. Food and alcohol service will also be limited to wait service, reports USA TODAY Network's New York State Team.\n\nMuseums, aquariums and other low-risk indoor cultural venues will be allowed to open in New York City on Aug. 24 with various COVID-19 restrictions, including operating at 25% occupancy capacity. In upstate communities, museums and other indoor venues opened previously.\n\nThe opening date and rules for gyms will be revealed on Monday, Cuomo said.\n\n- David Robinson, New York State Team\n\nThe Canada-U.S. border will remain closed to non-essential travel for at least another month, Public Safety Minister Bill Blair said in a statement Friday, a day after Mexico announced a similar measure for its border with the United States. The land border restrictions aimed at controlling the coronavirus pandemic were first announced in March and have been renewed monthly.\n\nEssential cross-border workers such as health care professionals, airline crews and truck drivers are still permitted to cross. Americans and Canadians returning to their respective countries are exempted from the border closure.\n\n- The Associated Press\n\nLatinos are more likely than white, Black and Asian Americans to be worried about economic issues related to coronavirus as the nation continues to deal with the ongoing pandemic, according to a new survey.\n\nThe concerns aren't unfounded: Latinos are more likely than all other racial groups to have a spouse lose their job in the last year or have had a drop in household income in the last year, according to a survey from the Democracy Fund + UCLA Nationscape Project.\n\nRobert Griffin, research director for the Democracy Fund Voter Study Group, said that while some may initially think that disparity is caused because Latinos make up higher proportions of young people or have a different median income, that is not the case. \"Communities of color, and particularly Latino Americans, appear to be hard hit right now,\" Griffin said.\n\n- Rebecca Morin\n\nThe 1918 Spanish flu pandemic claimed an estimated 50 million lives worldwide, yet in some ways the COVID-19 pandemic has been worse, according to a study published Thursday in the medical journal JAMA Network Open.\n\nThe current pandemic has been linked to less than 1 million deaths. But the study compares the two months after the first recorded death of COVID-19 in New York City - the epicenter of the U.S. epidemic for weeks - with the deadliest two months of the 1918 calamity.\n\n\"They're comparable events in terms of magnitude,'' said Dr. Jeremy Faust, an emergency physician at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston and the lead author of the study. \"What our numbers show is that what happened in New York was pretty similar to what happened in the greatest modern pandemic.''\n\n- Jorge L.

        "authors": [],
        "body": "More Americans are getting their medications delivered to their homes instead of picking them up at a hospital or pharmacy to avoid possible exposure to COVID-19, the illness caused by SARS-CoV-2.\n\nBut as a surge in deliveries strain the postal system and the Trump Administration opposes additional funding for the U.S. Postal Service, some patients report delays in receiving their medications.\n\nAn Ipsos poll found one in five Americans got medication through the mail in the past week, and one in four of them - or 5% of all Americans - experienced a delay or non-delivery.\n\n\"I think with the COVID pandemic ... we've seen an increased interest in mailing and delivering medication,\" said Joe Gonzaga, director of retail pharmacy services at West Virginia University Medicine. \"Because of the demand, there's a delay because there's so many prescriptions that need to get mailed out.\"\n\nWest Virginia has an aging population living in mostly rural areas and is the third most reliant state on mail-order prescriptions in the country, according to data from before the pandemic collected by the Kaiser Family Foundation.\n\nHeidi Polek, a registered pharmacist and strategic program manager at health care tech company DrFirst, said prescription delays were an issue before the coronavirus pandemic. If it's gotten worse, she's worried these delays could harm patients.\n\n\"It may not sound like a lot but even one to two missed doses can really have an impact especially on medical conditions such as diabetes and heart diseases,\" she said. \"That would be the detriment, that they miss a dose and they're not getting the effectiveness of their therapy.\"\n\nGonzaga said pharmacies have had to rely on multiple methods of delivery such as FedEx, UPS and even their own courier service as a last resort. They also reach out to their patients when they see a refill coming up.\n\nPharmacy precautions: Walgreens, CVS pharmacists to check for coronavirus symptoms, wear face shields during flu shots\n\nMore: Pharmacists in 50 states can give childhood shots to prevent future outbreaks, officials say\n\nBut health care providers encourage patients to be proactive about their health if their prescription delivery is delayed. Here's what they can do:\n\nCall your pharmacy: Whether it's your local community or mail order pharmacy, experts suggest calling right away to find out the current status of your prescription. If it's already been filled and on its way, some pharmacies can work with your doctor and insurance company to sell you a limited supply until the medications arrive.\n\nCall your doctor: If you're not able to get a limited supply from your local pharmacy, where you will probably have to pay in cash, your doctor could have samples of that medication for you to take while waiting for your order to arrive.\n\nCall your insurance company: Before your prescription is delayed, find out if you can be prescribed a 90-day supply of the medication so you don't have to order a refill every month. Also, find out the earliest you can order a refill and call the pharmacy before your medications run out. Most insurance companies allow patients to refill their prescription seven to 10 days in advance.\n\nFollow Adrianna Rodriguez on Twitter: @AdriannaUSAT.",

    "COVID spread through air? Why to wear face masks in public bathrooms": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "Wearing a mask in public restrooms should be mandatory during the pandemic, researchers say, because there's increasing evidence that flushing toilets - and now urinals - can release inhalable coronavirus particles into the air.\n\nThe coronavirus can be found in a person's urine or stool, and flushing urinals can generate an \"alarming upward flow\" of particles that \"travel faster and fly farther\" than particles from a toilet flush, according to a study published in the journal Physics of Fluid Monday.\n\n\"Urinal flushing indeed promotes the spread of bacteria and viruses,\" researcher Xiangdong Liu said in a press release. \"Wearing a mask should be mandatory within public restrooms during the pandemic, and anti-diffusion improvements are urgently needed to prevent the spread of COVID-19.\"\n\nCOVID-19 symptoms: CDC adds runny nose, diarrhea, nausea to the growing list\n\nLiu and other researchers from Yangzhou University in China simulated urinal flushing using computer models and estimated that, within just five seconds of flushing, virus particles could reach a height of more than 2 feet off the ground.\n\n\"Potentially, it could contaminate other surfaces you would touch - the handle, the tap,\" said Charles Gerba, a professor of virology at the University of Arizona. \"The concern is also - was there anything left over from the person who was there before? Aerosolization from the previous user you may potentially inhale?\"\n\nSome of the same researchers released similar findings in June, focused on toilet flushing. Through another computer model, the researchers found that thousands of particles can come out of the toilet within 70 seconds of flushing, and that some can reach higher than a foot above the toilet bowl in half that time.\n\n\"It is reasonable to assume that the high-speed airflow will expel aerosol particles from the bowl to regions high in the air above the toilet, allowing viruses to spread indoors causing risks to human health,\" the researchers said at the time.\n\nThe studies are interesting but unsurprising, as research on particles kicked up in \"toilet plumes\" has been around for about two decades now, said Joshua Santarpia, a professor of pathology and microbiology at the University of Nebraska Medical Center specializing in bioaerosols.\n\n\"The more interesting thing to me was that I hadn't considered the urine issue - whether SARS-CoV-2 was shed in urine,\" he said.\n\nMany people aren't aware that toilets and urinals can release particles into the air, let alone that genetic material from SARS-CoV-2 - the virus that causes the disease known as COVID-19 - can be found in patients' urine and stool, Gerba said.\n\n\"It's probably been overlooked - urine contamination,\" Gerba said. \"Smallpox, Zika virus are excreted in the urine. What's surprising is that a respiratory virus can be excreted in the urine.\"\n\nAt least two studies - one in Tokyo and one in Guangzhou, China - have found coronavirus RNA in patients' urine. Studies published in the journals Gastroenterology and The Lancet also found coronavirus RNA in patients' stool, even weeks after the patients showed negative results in respiratory samples. One study in and around Beijing, however, did not find any evidence of virus in 72 urine specimens.\n\nCOVID-19 transmission: Air conditioning systems can facilitate spread\n\nIt's still unclear whether COVID-19 can transmit through urine and infect another person, Gerba said.\n\n\"Is there enough virus in the urine to worry about? Does enough get aerosolized? Those are questions we need to look at,\" he said.\n\nThe researchers at Yangzhou University argue that transmission in a public restroom has already happened. They cite local news reports of a couple, who work at a food market in Beijing, contracting the virus at a restroom nearby.\n\n\"What's worse, two of COVID-19 reemerging confirmed cases in Beijing have been reported to be infected from a public toilet, which practically proves the danger from the public restroom,\" the researchers wrote.\n\nHealth experts believe the virus mainly transmits through respiratory droplets when someone coughs or sneezes, but the World Health Organization says that \"short-range aerosol transmission . . . cannot be ruled out.\"\n\nResearchers measuring the amount of viral aerosols in different areas of two Wuhan hospitals found that while the concentration detected in isolation wards and ventilated patient rooms was very low, it was higher in the toilet areas used by the patients, according to an April study published in the journal Nature.\n\nThe researchers recommended that room ventilation, open space, sanitization of protective apparel, and proper use and disinfection of toilet areas could effectively limit the concentration of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in aerosols.\n\nAirborne transmission of COVID-19: Nearly 240 experts urge WHO, CDC to acknowledge it\n\n\"I think there's a lot of strategies and interventions that could be developed if it really turns out that there's significant risk,\" Gerba said.\n\nFor now, the next best step would be to put the researchers' computer model to the test to see if flushing a urinal actually kicks virus particles up into the air, Gerba and Santarpia said.\n\n\"Somebody should really validate some of this experimentally. It's a model, and there are a lot of assumptions,\" Santarpia said. \"More work needs to be done.\"",

        "authors": [],
        "body": "A new study adds to growing evidence that children are not immune to COVID-19 and may even play a larger role in community spread than previously thought.\n\nResearchers at Massachusetts General Hospital and Mass General Hospital for Children found that among 192 children, 49 tested positive for the coronavirus and had significantly higher levels of virus in their airways than hospitalized adults in intensive care units, according to the study published Thursday in the Journal of Pediatrics.\n\n\"Kids are not immune from this infection, and their symptoms don't correlate with exposure and infection,\" said Dr. Alessio Fasano, senior author and director of the Mucosal Immunology and Biology Researcher Center at Massachusetts General Hospital.\n\nThe study comprised of children from ages zero to 22 who arrived at an urgent care clinic or hospital and were suspected of having SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19.\n\nFasano said some children were brought to these settings after exhibiting symptoms, but others showed no symptoms and were brought in because they had been in contact with an infected person or lived in what was considered a high-risk area.\n\n\"During this COVID-19 pandemic, we mainly screened symptomatic subjects, so we have reached the erroneous conclusion that the vast majority of people infected are adults,\" he said. \"We should not discount children as potential spreaders for this virus.\"\n\nWhile the number of children who tested positive may come as a shock to some, Dr. Roberta DeBiasi, chief of Pediatric Infectious Diseases at Children's National Hospital in Washington D.C., said she's not surprised based on the patients she's seen.\n\n\"We know from other respiratory diseases, (children) are known to be vectors in the community,\" she said. However, she added this study is unique because it went a step further to quantify viral load.\n\nStudy authors challenged the current hypothesis that children are less likely to get sick from COVID-19 because they had fewer virus receptors than adults. The receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), binds to the coronavirus and enables it to infect healthy cells.\n\nWhile they found younger children did have fewer receptors, they still carried high levels of virus. This led researchers to think children are more contagious, calling them \"silent spreaders\" of COVID-19, regardless of their susceptibility to developing infection.\n\nAre the little kids alright?: Survey shows COVID pandemic is taking a toll now and will in the future\n\n'I don't know if I can do this': Parents brace for school year juggling jobs, remote learning amid COVID-19 pandemic\n\nScientists also discovered only half of the children who tested positive for the disease had a fever, leading experts to question the heavy reliance of non-contact thermal scanners at building entrances.\n\n\"How likely are you to pick up every case of COVID? The answer is only 50% of the time,\" DeBiasi said. \"You still have to put in all those other measures to try to prevent spread (because) children will be missed from screening methods.\"\n\nDr. Matthew Heinz, hospitalist at Tucson Medical Center in Arizona, has seen child-to-adult transmission firsthand. He said the study supports anecdotal reports.\n\n\"This is no way inconsistent from what I've seen in my own patients and their own families,\" he said. \"We're seeing people that are experiencing what the study is confirming for us in real time.\"\n\nAs the debate for schools to reopen continues, experts worry children may trigger another wave of coronavirus cases if schools solely rely on monitoring symptoms instead of wearing masks and social distancing. They say children could take the virus to multi-generational households and infect those more susceptible to severe illness.\n\n\"Kids are a possible source of spreading this virus,\" Fasano said. \"And this should be taken into account in the planning stages for reopening schools.\"\n\nFollow Adrianna Rodriguez on Twitter: @AdriannaUSAT.",

    "COVID test: How colleges plan to use them to track fall semester cases": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "COVID-19 outbreaks already are interrupting colleges' plans to reopen their campuses across the country. But just how big those interruptions are -- and whether the outbreaks can be contained -- hinges in part on colleges' plans to test students rapidly.\n\nAnd some campuses don't have much of a plan at all.\n\nThe approaches vary nationally. Some institutions, like the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, plan to screen thousands of people daily using new federally approved tests that rely on saliva rather than invasive nose swabs.\n\nOthers, like Notre Dame or Purdue, required students to test negative for the virus before they were even allowed to set foot on campus.\n\nBut the University of Northern Georgia skipped mass testing for students coming back to campus and is instead simply asking students who develop COVID-19 symptoms to stay home from class. And Liberty University's plan only to test people who have symptoms, without testing possibly asymptomatic carriers, has drawn criticism from other universities slated to play the Virginia institution in football. (The university\n\nNo college's approach is the same. That's thanks partially to contradicting federal guidance on mass testing for higher education. The Centers of Disease Control, in guidance updated June 30, said such efforts are unproven and that it \"does not recommend entry testing of all returning students, faculty, and staff.\"\n\nIn contrast, Dr. Deborah Birx, the White House coronavirus coordinator, recently said universities should implement entry tests and be prepared to test up to 10,000 people a day, the Center for Public Integrity reported.\n\nMost universities' plans fall somewhere between the no-testing and constant monitoring approaches. The consequences of each approach will play out in real time, said Amesh A. Adalja, a senior scholar at Johns Hopkins' Center for Health Security.\n\n\"This isn't something we have worked out,\" he said.\n\nAdalja questioned how effective a massive testing campaign would be if people were still allowed to come and go from the university when they pleased. (Many of the outbreaks on college campuses so far have been tied to off-campus gatherings.)\n\nCOVID-19 outbreaks: The virus will hit colleges this fall. So why reopen at all? Money is a factor.\n\nIn any case, most universities are unlikely to be able to reopen safely, no matter what their testing approach is, said A. David Paltiel, a professor at Yale's School of Public Health. He recently built a mathematical model to track the spread of the virus on college campuses. He found scenarios in which universities can open safely, he said, but \"it's an incredibly high bar. It's probably one that most universities can't reach.\"\n\nAnd one of the requirements for reaching that bar? Frequent testing, up to every two days in some cases.\n\nIn no scenario, the report reads, would \"symptom-based screening alone would be sufficient to contain an outbreak.\"\n\nWithout clear federal guidance, students and families must assess whether a college's plan is sufficient.\n\nCampuses are going to have cases, but that doesn't mean the situation is out of control, Adalja said. He said families may want to consider how robust a university's plan is compared with similar institutions. And he said colleges ought to set up their courses such that students can feel comfortable switching between in-person and virtual learning should they get sick.\n\nAs it is, universities' testing plans are changing frequently.\n\nTesting students before they came to campus was a crucial part of the University of Notre Dame's plan to launch in-person fall classes. The private Indiana university sent tests to roughly 12,000 people ahead of their return to campus. Less than 1% of them tested positive for the virus. The university said those results were encouraging.\n\nThey didn't last.\n\nAs the university reopened, cases climbed rapidly within the first week. Administrators blamed the outbreak on students who went to off-campus parties.\n\nTo slow the spread, the university paused in-person classes for two weeks and increased testing of random people on campus.\n\nWhat went wrong: How Notre Dame's back-to-campus plan unraveled\n\nPurdue University had planned to test students only before they came back, and then if they reported symptoms. But that institution has since altered its plans to try to test 10% of the population every week. The change in plans comes just days after the university suspended dozens of students in connection to an off-campus party.\n\nSmaller campuses are changing plans too, as outbreaks pop up at colleges around the country. The College of Charleston hadn't planned on requiring students to get tested before returning to campus, but has since required that those moving in to campus do so. The situation was the same for the University of the South in Tennessee, which now will require students to take a test on campus before they can move into their dorms.\n\nOthers plan to test their communities aggressively and require compliance for anyone who wants to be on campus. The University of Illinois started class Monday with plans to use a newly developed salvia test to run checks on up to 20,000 people a day. The method doesn't rely on nose swabs, and produces results in an hour, according to the university.\n\n\"The faster we can notify people, the faster we can stop the spread,\" said Rebecca Lee Smith, a pathology professor at the university.\n\nSome communities may be targeted more than others. For example, the University of Kentucky had already tested much of its student body, but it plans to retest students in Greek organizations. The university found these students have a higher rate of infection compared with their peers, after outbreaks last week started at fraternities and sororities around the country.\n\n'Safe but still having fun': Colleges hope off-campus housing doesn't doom fall semester\n\nOf course, not every university has the research capabilities of a public flagship university like Illinois.\n\nSome colleges are relying on third-party testers, like the Broad Institute, which is working with colleges in Massachusetts, or the Just Project, which has provided testing equipment to historically Black universities.\n\nStill others are taking a looser approach that transfers a large share of the responsibility for managing the virus' spread to its community members.\n\nThe University of Northern Georgia, for example, said its health services division will only test symptomatic patients. Officials have also asked that people planning to come to campus monitor themselves for high temperatures or COVID-19 symptoms. In explaining its testing policy, the university specifically cited the CDC guidance that said mass testing was not recommended.\n\nArkansas State University wants its students to fill out a form before receiving further instructions about if and where they should be tested. The University of Southern Indiana's plan asks that anyone who may have coronavirus to fill out a form, stay off campus and call their doctor.\n\nPaltiel said he is wary of universities relying solely on symptomatic tracking. That's like calling the fire department after a blaze has already consumed a building, he said. His team's research found no scenario where testing solely on symptoms was sufficient to prevent wider outbreaks.\n\n\"You can't play catch up with this virus,\" he said.\n\nPaltiel also criticized the CDC's guidance and said the agency was wrong in its assessment that mass testing wasn't necessary, given the large role that people without obvious symptoms play in spreading the virus.\n\nAnd a re-entry test alone is insufficient to prevent outbreaks, he said.\n\nUniversities that lack the capacity, or are unwilling, to test large numbers of people regularly, he said, \"have no business reopening.\"",

    "COVID testing crunch highlights inequities in who get results when": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "David Rohlfing, a Queens resident and high school English teacher, attended outdoor picnics, an outdoor bar and a Black Lives Matter protest earlier this summer. Though he did not feel sick, he wanted to get tested for COVID-19 before visiting his sister in Connecticut.\n\nOn July 6, he was tested at a city-run site and was told results could take a week. He checked a patient testing portal every day. On July 23 - 17 days after he took the test - he learned he did not have the disease.\n\nNow Rohlfing wonders whether there will be enough testing when he returns to the classroom in September. He wants a guarantee he can take a test with quick results if he interacts with an infected student or staffer. If there is no such assurance, and testing has not improved, he might not go back to class.\n\n\"I'm not going to do it,\" he said. \"I will join any effort to not open the schools if that part of the piece is not in place.\"\n\nThe slow turnaround time for patients like Rohlfing could harm efforts to curtail outbreaks. Professional athletes and private businesses that purchase lab testing can get access to quick tests. Teachers, students and others who rely on traditional retail clinics or doctors' offices, however, might wait days for results.\n\nFederal officials and private labs acknowledge they must prioritize the nation's limited supply of coronavirus tests for hospitalized patients, health care workers and other high-risk individuals. But many Americans worried about contracting the sometimes deadly virus often must wait in long lines and several days for results.\n\nWithout a national plan on how to best allocate hundreds of thousands of COVID-19 tests each day, there simply is not enough capacity now to screen Americans who might unwittingly pass the virus to others.\n\nAnd some warn the problem will be further strained when universities and K-12 schools resume classes, more companies bring employees back to the workplace and influenza testing spikes this winter.\n\nDr. Howard Koh, a professor at Harvard T. H. Chan School of Public Health and former Department of Health and Human Services Assistant Secretary during the Obama administration, said the testing shortage has created a pattern of unequal access.\n\n\"Some privileged parts of our country are getting daily access and others have no access at all,\" Koh said. \"We're never going to solve this pandemic until we give everybody access, particularly high-risk groups. That's the public health principle we always try to follow.\"\n\nDr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said testing delays are \"totally unacceptable\" and need to be fixed.\n\nSpeaking at forum hosted Wednesday by the Harvard public health school , Fauci said in some communities \"the gap between the time you get the test and the time you get the result, in some respects, obviates the reason why you did the test ... We've got to correct that.\"\n\nMore: 'States duking it out for supply': Lack of federal plan leads to coronavirus testing delays\n\nMore: 'Pushing the frontiers': Long lines for COVID tests, stressed labs delay results as demand spikes\n\nMore: FDA opens door to rapid, at-home testing for COVID-19\n\nThe federal government wants to expand testing on several fronts, including more \"point of care\" machines that can deliver results in minutes at a clinic or doctor's office. The National Institutes of Health has launched a $1.5 billion, Shark Tank-style competition called Rapid Acceleration of Diagnostics to bring capacity up to 6 million daily tests by December.\n\nSome want federal regulators to loosen oversight of rapid tests, similar to pregnancy tests, that can be taken at home and deliver immediate results, albeit without the sensitivity, or accuracy, of lab tests.\n\nStates also are taking more control. Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, North Carolina, Ohio, Utah and Virginia this week announced a pact with The Rockefeller Foundation to each purchase a half million rapid antigen tests from two manufacturers.\n\nThe nation's labs have never been asked to test such a large portion of the population, especially those without symptoms.\n\n\"We don't design tests normally for people who aren't experiencing symptoms,\" said Kelly Wroblewski, the Association of Public Health Laboratories' Director of Infectious Disease. \"It's not normally who you target when you're planning to test people.\"\n\nBut as officials race to expand testing, Assistant Secretary for Health Admiral Brett Giroir acknowledged not everyone will get results at the same time. Some patients must be prioritized.\n\n\"We are going to have more prioritization in the future,\" Giroir said last week in a call with reporters. \"There are certain people. I am not going to say it's an unnecessary test, but, you know, if you have to have a test to go on vacation somewhere, that's not the same priority as a nursing home or a person in the hospital.\"\n\nIn mid-July, Kathy Martin of Silver Spring, Maryland felt nauseous followed by a sore throat and extreme fatigue. She described her symptoms to her cousin, a doctor, as well as her actual doctor. Both recommended a COVID test.\n\nIt took her three days to find a clinic - a CVS drive thru where she received a kit, self-administered a swab, sealed the sample and dropped it off in a collection box.\n\nOver the following week, she isolated herself from others. She felt better by the time she received her negative results eight and a half days after she was tested.\n\nShe said the long delay makes the test \"not very good good for the purpose of treating you or contact tracing,\" Martin said. \"By then, you are either in a hospital on a respirator or you are all better.\"\n\nNow most test results from CVS take three to seven days, a spokeswoman said.\n\nWhile consumers like Martin struggle to get timely results, the same is not true for professional athletes who get tested several times each week by private labs with quick answers or expensive point-of-care machines with immediate results.\n\nMajor League Baseball is testing players several times each week with results typically available in a day or two. Tests are administered daily at the National Basketball Association's bubble near Orlando, Florida. And the National Football League's protocol calls for daily testing during the first two weeks of training camp.\n\nPrivate labs are conducting tests for these professional leagues. Terms of the agreements are not public, but one requirement is known. Labs must get results back to the leagues quickly enough so teams can take necessary steps if there's a positive test.\n\nOutbreaks among MLB teams such as the Miami Marlins and St. Louis Cardinals prompted the league to cancel games, adjust schedules and quarantine players until testing showed the teams cleared the threat. The goal: prevent infections from spreading to other teams.\n\nBusinesses also are looking for quick testing at private labs.\n\nDr. Rajaie Batniji is co-founder and chief health officer at Collective Health, a San Francisco firm that helps companies manage health insurance benefits. The company started a new app, Collective Go, for large companies to screen, monitor and test for COVID-19.\n\nBatniji said employers have the option to test at traditional sites such as a doctor's office, a pharmacy or community testing sites. But many employers and their workers are choosing at-home testing kits.\n\n\"That's the option we're seeing take off for a lot of organizations,\" Batniji said.\n\nAn employee orders the test through the app, and a test kit is mailed to their home. The employee self-administers a nasal swab, puts it in tube and mails it to the lab. Results are typically ready within two days, Batniji said.\n\nCollective Go offers choices beyond large commercial labs such as Quest and LabCorp traditionally used by doctors, hospitals and pharmacies. Other private labs, including ones set up to do genetic analysis, have the equipment and wherewithal to do thousands of tests each day. He describes these labs as \"alternative supply chains\" that he believes will become increasingly important as the nation ramps up testing.\n\n\"Where we as a country have fallen short is rapid turnaround testing in a health-care setting,\" Batniji said. \"I think (the nation is) going to need to tap into a lot of this alternative supply.\"\n\nUrban Sitter, a San Francisco-based service that matches families with child-care providers, began using the Collective Go recently. Families and sitters wanted the service as a way to learn about each other's COVID status, arrange testing and track daily health status.\n\nCo-Founder and CEO Lynn Perkins said hundreds of the company's 1 million families and sitters already have signed up for the service. The two driving things families and sitters want: convenience and quick testing.\n\n\"Having somebody in your home is crucial for getting parents back to work,\" Perkins said.\n\nThe varying turnaround times might be a symptom of a fragmented lab system. Public health labs are focused on tracking diseases in any given communities. Large commercial labs deliver accurate results to properly diagnose patients. And private labs can provide specific services to their customers.\n\n\"Because of the way the laboratory system is structured in the U.S., there is this ability to buy capacity for large corporations,\" said Wroblewski, with the Association of Public Health Laboratories. \"It does make it challenging to develop a thoughtful, strategic plan when you have this fragmented system that serves all these different goals.\n\nDr. Geoffrey Baird, interim chair of the University of Washington's Department of Laboratory Medicine, said labs that perform tests for pro sports leagues or businesses that require quick turnaround time must have access to chemical reagents and other testing materials that are in short supply.\n\n\"There is an implicit judgement in the idea that we would be testing some people over other people right now,\" Baird said. \"That's what happens when demand outstrips supply, which is the case right now. There's more demand than there is supply.\"\n\nWith all the challenges labs face, some academics and public health doctors say the time is right to change thinking on testing altogether.\n\nThese doctors argue at-home tests can be fast and cheap and provide instants results. The drawback is these test might not be as sensitive, or accurate, as lab tests.\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration set rules for rapid test manufacturers on accuracy and how samples must be collected and analyzed. No such tests have been approved yet.\n\nDr. Ashish Jha, director of the Harvard Global Health Institute, argues these at-home tests are a better option than \"flogging the system\" of lab tests.\n\nLab tests more accurately detect whether a person is infected with coronavirus. The rapid tests might miss some cases when a person has no symptoms or a mild case. But the test can detect when a person has higher levels of the virus and is more likely to infect others, Jha said.\n\nThe key is frequency. If these tests are widely used and cheap enough to take a couple of times each week, more people will learn they are positive, self-quarantine and reduce spread.\n\n\"The current system is missing so many cases, not because the tests are not sensitive, but we can only test so many people,\" Jha said. \"I'm worried our federal government is still stuck in a mental model that doesn't make sense for this pandemic.\"",

    "COVID testing: Mass rapid tests raise questions about accuracy, impact": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "Dozens of people who took quick-result coronavirus tests at a Manchester, Vermont, clinic in July were told they had the virus, only to be informed days later that more accurate lab tests concluded they didn't.\n\nBut last week, Quidel, the company that makes the rapid antigen test used by the clinic, stood by the original results. The top executive said it's \"highly likely\" his company's test was correct, and the state of Vermont's conflicting lab-based test was \"at risk of providing inaccurate results.\"\n\nAs companies and universities create their own strategies to widely test employees and students - even those with no symptoms of COVID-19 or no known exposure to the virus - experts warn such confusion over conflicting results is inevitable.\n\nWidespread testing can identify people who have the virus and halt the spread of some new cases. But because no test is infallible, some cases will be missed and some people will be forced to miss work due to false positives.\n\nOhio Gov. Mike DeWine this month said he tested positive on a rapid diagnostic to detect the COVID-19 virus before he was to greet President Donald Trump at a Cleveland airport. Two followup tests using a more precise, lab-based PCR test showed the governor didn't have the virus.\n\nIn Maine, 19 summer campers tested positive last month using a rapid antigen test, only to be cleared by the state's lab test, the Bangor Daily News reported.\n\nIt's a scenario that will \"come up over and over again,\" said Jennifer Nuzzo, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security.\n\n\"We are going to blanket the country with tests,\" said Nuzzo, an associate professor at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. \"A lot of the push around testing has really been approached from a tech-forward perspective with a goal of trying to reopen our economy and not necessarily thinking through what the consequences are.\"\n\nWithout a vaccine to prevent COVID-19, the nation has relied on testing to identify who has the virus and must be isolated. Everyone else is urged to keep their distance from others, wear masks and wash their hands.\n\nAssistant Secretary for Health Adm. Brett Giroir said the U.S. should have up to 90 million tests in September - an average of about 3 million tests each day. As many as 40 million tests will be \"point of care\" tests with rapid results.\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration has granted emergency use authorization to three rapid antigen test manufacturers to diagnose COVID-19: Quidel, LumiraDx, and Becton, Dickinson and Co.\n\nThe Trump administration last week invoked the Defense Production Act on federal contracts with Quidel and Becton to expedite production of antigen testing machines that can provide immediate results for 14,000 nursing homes. The effort \"is our highest priority to save lives,\" Giroir said.\n\nThe National Institutes of Health is issuing grants through a $1.5 billion \"Shark Tank\"-style competition called Rapid Acceleration of Diagnostics. The goal is to bring capacity up to 6 million daily tests by December.\n\nMore: 'States duking it out for supply': Lack of federal plan leads to coronavirus testing delays\n\nMore: COVID-19 testing capacity and supplies are strained, so some labs turn to sample pooling to meet demand\n\nMore: 'Totally unacceptable': Testing delays force labs to prioritize COVID-19 tests for some, not others\n\nBut lab experts worry the push to test millions of Americans every day, without policies on how to use and interpret results, could confuse people who get conflicting answers, such as the case with the Vermont clinic.\n\nPCR tests detect the virus's genetic material. Considered more sensitive because they find even low levels of the virus, these have been the diagnostic test for public health and clinical labs since the beginning of the pandemic.\n\nAntigen tests detect specific proteins on the surface of the virus. Testing materials are cheaper and more plentiful. And the tests are fast, delivering results in 15 minutes. But they're considered less sensitive than PCR tests and more likely to miss a case.\n\nBecause no test is always accurate, doctors who analyze test results must consider other factors, such as how widespread the virus is in a community. If someone tests positive but shows no symptoms, has no known exposure and lives in a community with relatively few cases, it's difficult for a doctor to interpret that result.\n\n\"The false negative and false positive rates for any test are never zero,\" said Dr. Dwayne Breining, executive director of Northwell Labs.\n\nOn July 1, an 18-year-old on a family vacation from New York, who had displayed symptoms for four days, tested positive at Manchester Medical Center. Five more people tested positive on July 10. Those initial cases emerged during the town's busy tourist season, potentially infecting others at gatherings such as barbecues, soccer games, restaurants and bars.\n\nThrough July 17, 64 people tested positive and about half of them had symptoms, said Dr. Janel Kittredge, Manchester Medical Center's chief medical officer and owner.\n\nThe clinic faxed the results of each positive antigen test nightly to the Vermont Department of Health. In order to be an official case, Vermont requires confirmation with a PCR test.\n\nThe state health department said it could confirm just four cases from the Manchester clinic. The state set up a pop-up clinic to test hundreds of others before concluding there were no signs of an outbreak.\n\nSan Diego-based Quidel said it conducted its own investigation and found no issues with the clinic or the company's tests. It shared results with the state health department, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the FDA.\n\nThe FDA informed Vermont it found no issues with Quidel's instruments or how they were used, the Vermont Department of Health said.\n\nIt's unclear what information the FDA reviewed, but a spokesman said no recall is warranted and the agency is \"continuing our evaluation.\"\n\nVermont Health Commissioner Mark LeVine said Friday it was inappropriate for the Quidel executive to question the accuracy of the state's PCR test. His agency said PCR \"remains a very reliable test\" and people should be confident in its results.\n\nDiscrepancies among different testing methods are common enough in the lab industry.\n\nThe difference with COVID-19 is the nation has never attempted to test such a large portion of the population. And never have large groups of Americans been ordered to quarantine based on test results.\n\n\"If you test enough people, you will get a false positive; you will get a false negative with any test,\" Breining said. \"And the question is now, what are going to be the consequences of it? How do you manage it?\"\n\nBreining said his son attends a school in Manhattan with about 3,000 students. One proposal for New York City schools would require all students in a classroom to quarantine if one tests positive. If a student in another classroom tests positive, the entire school would shut down for two weeks.\n\nRoutine, inexpensive testing of New York City students, teachers and staffers would allow schools to quickly identify new cases. It also means schools would sometimes close based on test results that might be inaccurate.\n\nThe key is to develop policies that require a confirmation test to gauge whether the initial test is accurate, Breining said.\n\nThe Maine health department did not identify the summer camp with 19 false positives, but other camps took notice.\n\nCamp Modin, which served about 360 kids from New York, New Jersey, Connecticut and other states, concluded camp without a single case. Organizers met with epidemiologists for months to carefully plan multiple rounds of testing, cleaning protocols and who would be allowed on the grounds.\n\nCampers were tested three times - a lab test before they arrived, a rapid test at the camp and another lab test days later. One camper tested positive after arriving, but medical staff concluded it was a false positive after the child was tested seven times. Nevertheless, the child was isolated in a medical unit until they confirmed there were no signs of COVID.\n\nThe camp operated as a bubble without allowing anyone in or out. Staff arrived two weeks before the start of camp and also underwent three rounds of tests.\n\n\"Everyone bought into it,\" said Howard Salzberg, the camp's executive director. \"Ironically, this is the healthiest summer we've ever had.\"\n\nInaccurate results could harm caregivers or nursing home assistants who take care of vulnerable patients.\n\n\"Clearly, the example of a nursing home, we would want to know very quickly if somebody is bringing the virus in there,\" Nuzzo said. \"But there are also consequences to inaccurately identifying somebody who has to stay home and is unable to work, possibly putting patients at risk because of the shortages in the workforce.\"\n\nSherry Perry, a certified nursing assistant, works in a nursing home and has a second job as a home health aide.\n\nThe Lebanon, Tennessee, resident agrees testing is vital to protect vulnerable residents and health care workers. But she said it's financially devastating when nursing assistants must take unpaid leave when they test positive, despite questions about the accuracy of some tests.\n\nPerry had to take a week off work after a coworker tested positive. She was not paid but had enough savings to tide her over. Other colleagues struggle.\n\n\"Most CNAs (nursing assistants) are living check to check,\" said Perry, who is co-chair of the National Association of Health Care Assistants.\n\nSome nurses use vacation time and sick days during quarantine, leaving less flexibility to take time off for other reasons. \"Our job is not only physical but emotional too,\" Perry said. \"We get burned out really easily.\"\n\nNursing homes in New Hampshire and Texas have reported false positives. In Connecticut, errors at the state lab meant 90 people, including nursing home residents, registered false positives from mid-June through mid-July.\n\nSuch inaccurate results can disrupt operations and waste resources. However, industry representatives say widespread testing is critically important to protect residents and workers.\n\nMark Parkinson, president and CEO of the American Health Care Association and National Center for Assisted Living, said the bigger challenge this summer has been getting timely results to patients and staff.\n\nIn July, more Americans sought tests than the nation's labs could process in a timely manner. There are signs, however, that the bottleneck is improving. Two major commercial labs, Quest Diagnostics and LabCorp, said average turnaround times have improved.\n\nBut nursing homes still need rapid antigen tests to provide quick results to residents and staff, Parkinson said. If test results are inaccurate, nursing homes should retest samples to correct errors.\n\n\"You can always retest a positive result to get a confirmation,\" Parkinson said. \"It's accurate to say the antigen tests are not as precise as the PCR tests. But the speed of getting results probably outweighs the disadvantage of their slightly reduced accuracy.\"\n\nSome experts want the FDA to loosen oversight of rapid tests that can be taken at home and deliver immediate results, albeit without the sensitivity or accuracy of lab tests.\n\nDr. Michael Mina, an infectious disease epidemiologist at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, has pushed more inexpensive, at-home tests. He said they will be accurate enough to detect when somebody is infectious.\n\nPCR testing can pick up signs of the virus even when somebody is no longer infectious, he said. That means some people are being unnecessarily quarantined after they have recovered.\n\n\"The travesty is that we're spending so much time focusing on capturing people over here by mistake that we're missing the people who are actually infected, and those are the people we really should be quarantining,\" Mina said.\n\nDr. Rachel Levine, the Pennsylvania secretary of health, agreed rapid tests at clinics and homes could be an important tool to stop COVID-19. \"We'll see if that is available by the end of this year,\" Levine said.\n\nPennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf announced a medical device company, OraSure Technologies, will expand in Pennsylvania and is working to develop a rapid antigen test. The company expects to seek FDA's emergency use authorization by September, with a goal of bringing the test to the market before the end of the year.\n\nOthers say the bigger challenge rests not with the technology, but with deciding how to manage and interpret results that are not always correct.\n\nThat requires coordination, Breining said, \"preferably at the national level, that up until now we've demonstrated we are incapable of doing effectively.\"\n\nContributing: Karen Weintraub",

    "COVID tests: Cheap, at-home tests will stop pandemic, Harvard doc says": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "Dr. Michael Mina thinks there's a simple way to beat back COVID-19: fast, cheap tests, taken at home every day or two.\n\nRight now, tests are designed for medical purposes. They identify whether someone with symptoms has COVID-19 or not. But they miss - according to Mina's estimate - 97% of people when they are most infectious.\n\nCOVID-19, we now know, is most contagious in the first few days - just before a person shows symptoms and in the few days after symptoms start, if they ever do. Waiting until someone has symptoms before scheduling them for a test, means they won't know they were contagious until they aren't.\n\nIn recent weeks, Mina, an infectious disease epidemiologist at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, has been lobbying heavily for fast, cheap, at-home tests, hoping to get the federal government to fund their development and remove barriers to their approval. He's spoken with senators, foreign leaders, and company executives, who share this idea, but is increasingly frustrated by the administration's inaction.\n\nOn Friday, he laid out his vision to reporters on a group Zoom call. What follows is an edited version of what he said.\n\nThe tests that are being deployed now are like deluxe espresso machines. These are tests that require instrumentation. There'll be a big, big startup cost to get it going and each individual test will be expensive. They will have a difficult time getting the scale to where it needs to be to make an impact on a population level. What I really want is the instant coffee version. I want a $1 thing versus a $20 thing.\n\nThe way to do that is to use cheap tests that are highly accurate to detect somebody at the moment they're transmitting. People can act on it, because they're getting immediate results. I want them to take them every single day or every other day.\n\nIf we can get a test that everyone wakes up - just like they put in their contact lenses -they take a test. And if it turns positive, they stay home. And they take a test the next day and they stay home until the test turns negative, or for a set number of days, maybe 7 days.\n\nThat alone, if everyone's doing it, or even just a majority of people are doing it, it will stop the vast majority of transmission and it will cause these outbreaks to disappear in a matter of weeks. We don't have to wait for a vaccine.\n\nWe could reduce maybe by 90-95% transmission in this country in the next few weeks if everyone could have one of these tests tomorrow. Of course, that's not at the moment possible, but it could be if the federal government were treating this with the same urgency that they're treating a vaccine, which may or may not even work.\n\n(The government should) put $1 billion into really pushing the technology for $1 paper strip tests that can be printed in the millions, which they can be, and get a package of 50 in every American's hands over the next month - or not even every American - it could just be Texas, Arizona and Florida right now, because those are the states that are seeding infections to other states.\n\nWe're allowing red tape and this archaic view - we have so defunded and under-appreciated public health in this country for so many years that we literally don't have a recognition of the fact that there could be a test whose main goal is public health and not clinical medicine. Everything is wrapped up in insurance reimbursements and FDA regulations as diagnostics. It takes a whole rethinking of what a test that somebody might use looks like and how it's defined.\n\nI'm usually not against regulation, but it's just gotten so extreme here, and it's truly been hindering every step of the way our ability to test our way out of this virus since February. The current landscape is bottlenecking these companies that could have a cheap test today into producing a more expensive espresso machine, because they can't actually legally use the instant coffee.\n\nUntil the regulatory landscape changes, these companies have no reason to try to bring (a fast, cheap, at-home test) to market. So, a lot of them are just kind of sitting on it. Or they're trying to spend more time and more money to better and better optimize tests, which might take months. My fear is that what will come out of it at the end of those months is a test that does meet FDA approval, but that's too expensive and too complicated to scale and use for everyone.\n\nA lot of people are wasting time trying to figure out how to get instant coffee to be as good as espresso. They're different things.\n\nI have no financial ties or any other connection to any of these companies. I'm truly just basing this on science.\n\nWe don't have a vaccine tomorrow. We don't have anything but shutting down the economy and keeping schools closed. This can work. This is a tool that tomorrow could start to go into production and within a few weeks' time could start to change the whole course of outbreaks in major cities in America and in so doing, make all of the United States safer.\n\nContact Karen Weintraub at kweintraub@usatoday.com",

    "COVID, California fires: How evacuation centers are handling crowds": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "REDDING, Calif. -- The thousands of people evacuating from the wildfires burning across California are seeing something new this summer, and as with nearly every other aspect of their lives, the coronavirus drives it.\n\nPushed by the COVID-19 pandemic and the need for social distancing, shelter managers can no longer rely on large assembly halls at schools, fairgrounds and community centers to house wildfire evacuees.\n\nRather than eating and sleeping in large, open rooms, many of those displaced are being sent to nearby hotels, said Nicole Maul, a spokeswoman for the American Red Cross, which operates numerous shelters up and down California in areas hit by wildfires.\n\nShe said the Red Cross has been giving priority to sending people to hotels over having them bunk overnight in large gathering rooms.\n\n\"They're noticing it's a little bit different than what they are used to seeing,\" Maul said. \"It's been a culture shift for our country and the world.\"\n\nWhat we know: 5 dead as over 370 wildfires burn in California right now\n\nCalifornia is on fire: What are fire whirls, fire tornadoes, fire clouds and running crown fires?\n\nWith the onset of the coronavirus, the Red Cross has been working since January to plan for sheltering people displaced during the summer wildfire season.\n\nThere are at least 23 major fires burning in California that have torched hundreds of thousands of acres and forced the evacuations of residents all over the state.\n\nMaia Carroll, a spokeswoman for Monterey County, said officials want to get people safely away from fires, but also make sure they stay safe at shelters.\n\n\"They need to bring face covering with them. They need to plan on social distancing and temperature checks are being done,\" she said.\n\nThe River Fire (61.7 square miles) and the Carmel Fire (7.4 square miles) are both burning in Monterey County.\n\n\"It's a little complex when we have a life threatening situation right now. The number one priority is life and safety. In terms of COVID we want people to evacuate first and get to a safe location and then at that safe location we can continue with COVID precautions,\" she said.\n\n\"Because of COVID, we can't just accept things being dropped off here (donations) so that's something we are concerned about,\" she said.\n\nSending fire-displaced residents to motels is not new for the Red Cross. The agency has been working with hotels across the state for many years on a smaller scale, Maul said.\n\nFamilies burned out of their homes are regularly given vouchers to stay at nearby hotels, Maul said.\n\nThe agency continues to use congregate centers for housing wildfire evacuees, but center managers try to keep the number of residents lower at each location to increase social distancing.\n\nThat means the Red Cross has had to open more congregate centers with fewer evacuees, Maul said.\n\nIn years past, meals were served buffet style, but with the COVID-19 pandemic, evacuees are served packaged meals. And those staying at motels also are delivered packaged meals, she said.\n\nDr. Jahan Fahimi, associate professor of emergency medicine at the University of California, San Francisco Medical Center said people are less likely to catch COVID if they stay at home or avoid large gatherings.\n\n\"Being in public indoors might not be in your best interest,\" he said.\n\nThe risk of exposure to COVID-19 is just one of the concerns for people fleeing wildfires this summer, according to Dr. Stephanie Christenson, an assistant professor of medicine at UCSF Medical Center.\n\nShe said wildfire smoke, heat and COVID have created a \"perfect storm\" of risk for certain groups of people with underlying health problems.\n\nThe microscopic particles in wildfire smoke can irritate the tissue deep in the lungs and cause inflammation and infections, Christenson said. But this summer, Californians are facing an additional threat from the coronavirus.\n\n\"Now we've just given them another insult that can make matters worse,\" Christenson said.\n\nThe effects of wildfire smoke may make people more susceptible to COVID-19 and worsen their symptoms, she said.\n\nPeople with underlying health problems such as heart disease, asthma, diabetes and high blood pressure are especially at risk for symptoms being further exacerbated by smoke and COVID, she said.\n\n\"These would be the groups that I would be particularly worried about,\" she said.\n\nChristenson said that in addition to social distancing, shelter managers should also sanitize congregate areas and make sure residents wear masks and wash their hands regularly.\n\nMaul said before someone is allowed into an evacuation shelter they are given a temperature checks and asked whether they have had any symptoms or have been exposed to anyone with COVID-19.\n\nHelen Cosentino, a Red Cross Chapters program disaster specialist for San Benito and Merced counties, said some people, out of concern about the coronavirus, are avoiding evacuation centers.\n\n\"The fear people have of coming to places like this, we are taking precautions. But I know some people are fearful, some people are choosing to sleep in their cars,\" said Cosentino.",

        "authors": [],
        "body": "The U.S. hit the latest bleak milestone this week in the historic pandemic: 5 million confirmed cases of COVID-19 and more than 162,000 deaths, just 17 days after reaching 4 million cases.\n\nExperts agree the number of cases is actually much greater - potentially 10 times higher than what's been reported, according to federal data. Still, the U.S. has remained the most infected country, with the highest reported case and death count.\n\nDr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said on Aug. 6 the overall response to the pandemic in the U.S. has allowed the daily case count to plateau at an \"unacceptable level,\" warning that the virus will continue to \"smolder\" without a unified effort to stop it the virus.\n\nWhere are we on a vaccine? Early success of COVID-19 vaccine candidates fuels optimism, but experts warn 'a lot has to go right'\n\nUSA TODAY has tracked the nation's successes, setbacks and major news since the first case was confirmed in January in Washington state. Below, we break down the milestones in case and death counts:\n\nThe U.S. surpassed 5 million confirmed cases of COVID-19 as the death toll nears 163,000.\n\nThe milestone comes after President Donald Trump said the U.S. has the virus \"under control,\" describing his administration's response to the pandemic as \"incredible\" in an interview with Axios aired on HBO on Aug. 3.\n\nTrump repeated his claim that the high number of cases in the U.S. is due to the high rate of testing - though the interviewer argued many other nations did not have to test as much because they had the virus better contained and that testing was not to blame for the rising number of hospitalizations and deaths.\n\nThe CDC reported long-term effects of the disease are likely in COVID-19 patients. And more than 150 health professionals called for another shutdown in an open letter to U.S. leaders.\n\n\"Tell the American people the truth about the virus, even when it's hard. Take bold action to save lives -- even when it means shutting down again,\" the letter, spearheaded by the nonprofit U.S. Public Interest Research Group, said.\n\nThe U.S. case count doubled in a little more than a month. The death toll approached 144,000.\n\nWhile more COVID-19 testing was being done than ever before, bottlenecks appeared as labs and states bid against each other for limited supplies. Experts said many tests become irrelevant after delayed results.\n\nCases reached 2 million about 6 weeks after confirmed infections surpassed 1 million.\n\nMore than a dozen states and Puerto Rico saw cases spike at a faster rate in summer months. Experts said the unexpected uptick in cases could be due to lifting restrictions, isolated outbreaks and the virus catching up to communities that had not been affected.\n\nOn May 13, data compiled by Johns Hopkins University showed the national curve flattening. Starting May 18, several states began to lift their restrictions, then Memorial Day saw more travel, family gatherings and relaxed social distancing.\n\nThe result: Deaths from the coronavirus surpassed 100,000.\n\nAccording to polls, half of Americans said they were unsure they would get a vaccine.\n\nOver the course of four months, the U.S. reached 1 million cases and more than 50,000 deaths. Experts cautioned the number of cases was probably much higher because not all people infected by the coronavirus were tested.\n\n\"The million (cases) is clearly way under what the actual number will be because of all the issues of testing and all the people with mild symptoms that haven't been tested,\" said Dr. Steven Corwin, president and CEO of NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital.\n\nJohn Hopkins University tracking found the U.S. had the 33rd-highest mortality rate out of the 134 countries.\n\nFor the first time, 1,000 people died in a single day, bringing the national death toll above 5,000, according to Johns Hopkins University.\n\nTwo days later, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reversed its guidance advising Americans to not wear face masks to save them for medical professionals. President Donald Trump said the new guidance to wear face masks was voluntary: \"I don't think I'm going to be doing it,\" he said. The mask guidance came as research revealed that asymptotic people spread the disease without knowing they had it.\n\nUnemployment rates hit record highs at the end of March and early April.\n\nA day after the U.S. became the world's most-infected nation, the country passed 100,000 cases and had more than 1,000 deaths.\n\nTrump signed the largest relief package in U.S. history, promising $1,200 checks to eligible Americans and additional amounts for families. The package included hundreds of billions of dollars of support for companies to keep a payroll during the pandemic.\n\nTrump announced a ban on travelers from Europe, and U.S. cases jumped from 100 to more than 1,000 in eight days.\n\nThe World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic. \"We cannot say this loudly enough, or clearly enough, or often enough: all countries can still change the course of this pandemic,\" Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director-general of the WHO, said in a statement.\n\nThe first case of COVID-19 in the U.S. was reported Jan. 21 soon after the CDC began implementing health screenings in airports. China had 548 confirmed cases, and South Korea had one. A few weeks later, two people died, on Feb. 6 and 17, and tests done in April determined they were positive for the coronavirus.",

    "COVID-19 costing integrity of baseball, football": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "Add integrity of the game to the costs of trying to salvage the Major League Baseball and football seasons.\n\nIts schedule already compressed because of the COVID-19 pandemic, outbreaks among the Miami Marlins and St. Louis Cardinals have forced MLB to give up all pretense that this season is equivalent to any other. A week in, it announced that seven-inning doubleheaders would be played to try and fit more games in. There's talk playoff spots might be determined by winning percentages over an unequal number of games.\n\nAnd when the Marlins and Cardinals do resume play, they'll need name tags because of all the taxi squad players needed to fill out the rosters.\n\nWhat's next? A best-of-seven game of rock, paper, scissors to determine the World Series champion?\n\nMeanwhile, the Big Ten, Pac-12 and SEC have conceded they can only play conference games this season. But given the threat of boycotts by Pac-12 players as well as the outbreak at Rutgers, what happens if a school can't field a full team? Or has to shut down midway through the season?\n\nIs playing simply for the sake of playing worth it? The majority of Americans don't think so.\n\nIn a Harris poll that is to be released Wednesday, 58% of respondents said MLB should stop the season because of the COVID outbreaks. That same percentage doubts MLB will be able to complete its abbreviated season.\n\nAnd in a stat that should give leaders in all sports pause, 48 percent of the Harris respondents said watching sports now is much or somewhat more boring than it used to be.\n\nThese are not existential questions. If we've learned anything about COVID-19 over the last six months, it's that it does not care about best-laid plans and protocols. The virus might have a more severe impact on certain parts of the population but, as the cases of Red Sox pitcher Eduardo Rodriguez and Indiana offensive lineman Brady Feeney show in stark fashion, the young and fit are not immune.\n\nRodriguez, who was supposed to be Boston's opening day starter, is out for the season because of an inflamed heart that followed his bout with COVID-19. Feeney wound up in the emergency room after contracting the virus during voluntary workouts last month.\n\n\"Now we are dealing with possible heart issues! He is still experiencing additional symptoms and his blood work is indicating additional problems,\" Feeney's mother, Debbie Rucker, wrote in an emotional Facebook post about her son.\n\n\"Bottom line, even if your son's schools do everything right to protect them, they CAN'T PROTECT THEM!!\"\n\nAnd therein lies the problem.\n\nFingers can be pointed and eyebrows raised at irresponsible behavior. (Some of the Marlins left the team hotel to get coffee? That's really the best you've got, Derek Jeter?) But the truth is that this is a highly contagious disease that spreads rapidly, particularly when travel is involved.\n\nUnless practices and games take place in a bubble, an impossibility for football, players and coaches are going to be infected. It's simply a question of when, how many and how quickly an outbreak can be contained.\n\n\"The SEC and Vanderbilt are attempting to implement safe playing conditions for the players, but there are only so many precautions one can take while playing the game of football in various cities on a large team in a college environment during a global pandemic,\" Vanderbilt kicker Oren Milstein wrote Monday on Twitter, explaining his decision to opt out of the season.\n\nWhich leads back to the question of whether this is all worth it.\n\nSure, having baseball back has been a blessed distraction, a chance to fool ourselves into thinking that life is normal, even if it's only for a couple of hours. But look closely, and the game is as altered as our reality.\n\nMLB has always prized the \"integrity of the game,\" to the point former commissioner Bud Selig insisted teams play meaningless makeup games in September so everyone would play 162 games. Now commissioner Rob Manfred, owners and, yes, even players, are willing to sell their souls - and their health - for the payoff of the playoffs.\n\nBut is it really Major League Baseball when half the team is made up of minor leaguers, as will be the case while the infected Marlins and Cardinals players complete their quarantines?\n\nWhile some MLB teams have already played 11 games, the Marlins have gotten in just three. What happens if they squeak into the playoffs - Miami had a slim lead in the NL East before resuming play Tuesday - ahead of a team that played more games?\n\nAnd what happens when there are more outbreaks, as there surely will be so long as the virus is running rampant in this country? Is it really going to take a player winding up on a ventilator before we admit that baseball and football are simply a luxury we cannot afford until there's a vaccine or proven treatment for COVID-19?\n\nAthletes often talk about the sacrifices they have made throughout their career. But their health, and the integrity of the games they play, shouldn't be among them.",

    "COVID-19 data slowed in US by lack of national health data network": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "After terrorists slammed a plane into the Pentagon on 9/11, ambulances rushed scores of the injured to community hospitals, but only three of the patients were taken to specialized trauma wards. The reason: The hospitals and ambulances had no real-time information-sharing system.\n\nNineteen years later, there is still no national data network that enables the health system to respond effectively to disasters and disease outbreaks. Many doctors and nurses must fill out paper forms on COVID-19 cases and available beds and fax them to public health agencies, causing critical delays in care and hampering the effort to track and block the spread of the coronavirus.\n\n\"We need to be thinking long and hard about making improvements in the data-reporting system so the response to the next epidemic is a little less painful,\" said Dr. Dan Hanfling, a vice president at In-Q-Tel, a nonprofit that helps the federal government solve technology problems in health care and other areas. \"And there will be another one.\"\n\nThere are signs the COVID-19 pandemic has created momentum to modernize the nation's creaky, fragmented public health data system, in which nearly 3,000 local, state and federal health departments set their own reporting rules and vary greatly in their ability to send and receive data electronically.\n\nAug. 1: What a post-vaccine world looks like for seniors: It's time to learn telemed. Oh, and how you travel will change.\n\nJune 23: With little oversight, patchwork of airline coronavirus policies leaves flyers wary\n\nSutter Health and UC Davis Health, along with nearly 30 other provider organizations around the country, recently launched a collaborative effort to speed and improve the sharing of clinical data on individual COVID-19 cases with public health departments.\n\nBut even that platform, which contains information about patients' diagnoses and response to treatments, doesn't yet include data on the availability of hospital beds, intensive care units or supplies needed for a seamless pandemic response.\n\nThe federal government spent nearly $40 billion over the past decade to equip hospitals and physicians' offices with electronic health record systems for improving treatment of individual patients. But no comparable effort has emerged to build an effective system for quickly moving information on infectious disease from providers to public health agencies.\n\nIn March, Congress approved $500 million over 10 years to modernize the public health data infrastructure. But the amount falls far short of what's needed to update data systems and train staff at local and state health departments, said Brian Dixon, director of public health informatics at the Regenstrief Institute in Indianapolis.\n\nThe congressional allocation is half the annual amount proposed under last year's bipartisan Saving Lives Through Better Data Act, which did not pass, and much less than the $4.5 billion Public Health Infrastructure Fund proposed last year by public health leaders.\n\n\"The data are moving slower than the disease,\" said Janet Hamilton, executive director of the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists. \"We need a way to get that information electronically and seamlessly to public health agencies so we can do investigations, quarantine people and identify hot spots and risk groups in real time, not two weeks later.\"\n\nThe impact of these data failures is felt around the country. The director of the California Department of Public Health, Dr. Sonia Angell, was forced out Aug. 9 after a malfunction in the state's data system left out up to 300,000 COVID-19 test results, undercutting the accuracy of its case count.\n\nOther advanced countries have done a better job of rapidly and accurately tracking COVID-19 cases and medical resources while doing contact tracing and quarantining those who test positive. In France, physicians' offices report patient symptoms to a central agency every day. That's an advantage of having a national health care system.\n\n\"If someone in France sneezes, they learn about it in Paris,\" said Dr. Chris Lehmann, clinical informatics director at UT Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas.\n\nCoronavirus cases reported to U.S. public health departments are often missing patients' addresses and phone numbers, which are needed to trace their contacts, Hamilton said. Lab test results often lack information on patients' races or ethnicities, which could help authorities understand demographic disparities in transmission and response to the virus.\n\nLast month, the Trump administration abruptly ordered hospitals to report all COVID-19 data to a private vendor hired by the Department of Health and Human Services rather than to the long-established reporting system run by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The administration said the switch would help the White House coronavirus task force better allocate scarce supplies.\n\nThe shift disrupted, at least temporarily, the flow of critical information needed to track COVID-19 outbreaks and allocate resources, public health officials said. They worried the move looked political in nature and could dampen public confidence in the accuracy of the data.\n\nAn HHS spokesperson said the transition had improved and sped up hospital reporting. Experts had various opinions on the matter but agreed that the new system doesn't fix problems with the old CDC system that contributed to this country's slow and ineffective response to COVID-19.\n\n\"While I think it's an exceptionally bad idea to take the CDC out of it, the bottom line is the way CDC presented the data wasn't all that useful,\" said Dr. George Rutherford, a professor of epidemiology at the University of California-San Francisco.\n\nThe new HHS system lacks data from nursing homes, which is needed to ensure safe care for COVID-19 patients after discharge from the hospital, said Dr. Lissy Hu, CEO of CarePort Health, which coordinates care between hospitals and post-acute facilities.\n\nSome observers hope the pandemic will persuade the health care industry to push faster toward its goal of smoother data exchange through computer systems that can easily talk to one another -- an objective that has met with only partial success after more than a decade of effort.\n\nThe case reporting system launched by Sutter Health and its partners sends clinical information from each coronavirus patient's electronic health record to public health agencies in all 50 states.\n\nThe Digital Bridge platform also allows the agencies for the first time to send helpful treatment information back to doctors and nurses. About 20 other health systems are preparing to join the 30 partners in the system, and major digital health record vendors like Epic and Allscripts have added the reporting capacity to their software.\n\nSutter hopes to get state and county officials to let the health system stop sending data manually, which would save its clinicians time they need for treating patients, said Dr. Steven Lane, Sutter's clinical informatics director for interoperability.\n\nThe platform could be key in implementing COVID-19 vaccination around the country, said Dr. Andrew Wiesenthal, a managing director at Deloitte Consulting who spearheaded the development of Digital Bridge.\n\n\"You'd want a registry of everyone immunized, you'd want to hear if that person developed COVID anyway, then you'd want to know about subsequent symptoms,\" he said. \"You can only do that well if you have an effective data system for surveillance and reporting.\"\n\nThe key is to get all the health care players -- providers, insurers, EHR vendors and public health agencies -- to collaborate and share data, rather than hoarding it for their own financial or organizational benefit, Wiesenthal said.\n\n\"One would hope we will use this crisis as an opportunity to fix a long-standing problem,\" said John Auerbach, CEO of Trust for America's Health. \"But I worry this will follow the historical pattern of throwing a lot of money at a problem during a crisis, then cutting back after. There's a tendency to think short term.\"",

    "COVID-19 hits California's migrant farm workers hard": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "WINTON, Calif. -- The 31-mile road that connects Modesto and Merced, cut between almond, apricot and plum orchards, leads to California's agricultural heartland.\n\nMany migrant agricultural workers such as Hugo Garcia call this small town, a few miles north of Merced, home. Garcia has worked at an almond processing plant in the region for more than 16 years, but he saw his life upended this year when he and his entire family contracted COVID-19.\n\nGarcia, sitting in the home he shared with his 85-year-old mother, said he worked shoulder-to-shoulder with more than two dozen workers in an area that was shut down after nearly everyone tested positive for COVID-19. He tested positive June 16 and quickly spread the virus to his mother and other family members.\n\nGarcia's symptoms were mild and he recovered, but his mother, Sinforosa, died after more than three weeks in the hospital. He had to make the agonizing decision to take her off life support when doctors said she wouldn't recover.\n\n\"She had a 1% chance of living; she wasn't going to make it,\" he said in Spanish. \"She was only suffering at that point.\"\n\nAgainst the advice of health officials, county leaders abandoned contact tracing, saying the spread of the virus was \"too wide\" for it to be effective. So, despite a confirmed diagnosis, no one from Merced County asked Garcia about who he came in contact with.\n\nGarcia's situation is far from unique. Farms and processing plants across the region have reported alarming COVID-19 outbreaks, leading to a disproportionate rate of cases among the Latino and migrant community.\n\nCategorized as a high-risk group for COVID-19, Latinos make up 39% of the state population, but they represent 57% of coronavirus cases in California and 46% of deaths. About 90% of the state's agricultural laborers are Latino.\n\nFarm workers, who endure extreme heat and pesticide exposure daily, continue to work grueling hours standing shoulder-to-shoulder in processing centers across the state, often shuffling to and from the fields in clusters, then going back home to close quarters.\n\nAs cases surged, California focused efforts to combat the spread among Latinos and migrant farm workers in the Central Valley by allocating an additional $52 million in federal funding to the region and deploying three teams of health and safety workers.\n\nIn addition to the state's $75 million in disaster relief for workers, Gov. Gavin Newsom announced a $50 million philanthropic effort to support the state's roughly 2 million undocumented people.\n\nBut those dollars are running out, and experts say there's enough to provide aid for only 150,000 people. Latino leaders in the Valley are calling for more state action.\n\nKings County Supervisor Richard Valle, who grew up in a farm worker community, helped draft a letter to state leaders asking for more financial assistance as well as protective equipment, mobile testing sites and translation services for workers. He said farm workers need the same protection and support as public safety and medical workers.\n\n\"The farm workers are catching COVID at high rates, and it's spreading out in the communities,\" Valle said. \"It's driving up the numbers in the communities, and it puts our food chain at risk.\"\n\nSouth of Merced County, in the secluded Kings County town of Avenal, Rosa Barajas, a line worker at an onion processing plant, worried about getting sick. But earning only $12 an hour, she couldn't afford to take days off.\n\nShe said she worked more than eight hours a day standing next to a dozen co-workers without masks or gloves and in cramped quarters. Coworkers began to get sick, and Barajas, a mother of two, started to feel unbearably tired.\n\nIn a few days, she suffered from congestion and bone-chilling aches. Then a coworker died, terrifying Barajas, who is diabetic and has hypertension.\n\n\"Everything started feeling worse and I couldn't even breathe,\" she said. \"I thought I was getting better, then it would start all over again. I prayed to God to take me because I felt like I couldn't go through with it anymore.\"\n\nCalifornia's $50 billion agricultural industry depends on workers like Garcia and Barajas, about 60% of whom are unauthorized to legally work in the U.S., according to a recent study.\n\nConsidered essential workers by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, their undocumented status disqualifies them from unemployment, access to health care services and safety net programs put in place to help residents during the pandemic. They also don't receive family sick leave if exposed to the virus.\n\nValle, the Kings County supervisor, knows how hard migrant laborers work to put food on the table for Americans and for their families. His grandparents used to take their five children, including his mother, to the fields where they picked grapes during the hundred-degree summers in Selma, Calif. They worked long hours while the kids played, then drove home, made dinner, put the children to bed and woke up at 4:30 a.m. the next day to do it all over again.\n\n\"I feel obligated because I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for my (grandparents) working in those fields,\" he said. \"So we owe it. I can't sit here knowing that farm workers are not getting protection while in the middle of a pandemic.\"",

    "COVID-19 kills Rhode Island father, son within hour of each other": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "PROVIDENCE, R.I. - The doctors told the family of Dan Remillard, age 43, that his time was at hand. He'd held on for six weeks, often on a ventilator, but the virus had taken a toll.\n\nAs Dan, a working man from Woonsocket, lay unconscious at Rhode Island Hospital, those who knew and loved him gathered by Zoom to say goodbye. In a testament to how many souls Dan had touched, almost 100 were on the video call.\n\nThere was one notable absence: Dan's father, Ron Remillard.\n\nRon too, was gravely ill from COVID-19 -- in his case, having served in Vietnam, at the Providence VA Medical Center.\n\nAs folks on the Zoom said final words to Dan, there came a heartbreaking turn. A VA doctor phoned Ron's wife to tell her difficult news.\n\nNot long after, Dan Remillard's battle ended too, father and son dying within an hour of each other, both victims of the coronavirus pandemic of 2020.\n\nIt was Dan, the son, who got the virus first.\n\nIt began with his wife, Liz Remillard, 41, a longtime certified nursing assistant, now with the Friendly Home in Woonsocket, a skilled-care facility with 126 beds.\n\nShe had been out with a foot injury as the pandemic began. Her first week back was in early May, working the third shift with residents who had COVID.\n\nOn Monday, May 4, she took a routine virus test for staffers and two days later, although she had no signs, learned she was positive.\n\nLiz quarantined herself in a room in their home, the first floor of a two-family. Liz soon developed moderate symptoms including fatigue, a runny nose and no smell or taste.\n\nOut of caution, Dan, a heavy-equipment operator with the Woonsocket Water Department, also locked down at home.\n\nBy that Friday, May 9, Dan began having symptoms, too - chills with a light fever. He got tested, and on Sunday May 10, learned he had COVID-19.\n\nHe quarantined in a room as well.\n\nThe Remillards' 8-year-old daughter, Avabella, was also positive, but with no symptoms. Their 17-year-old son, Gavin, tested negative, and everyone worked to protect him, masking up when they left their rooms.\n\nAt first, it seemed like it would just be a version of the flu.\n\nThen Dan's symptoms began to get worse.\n\nOn May 14, four days after testing positive, Dan Remillard's fever suddenly went to 104. Liz gave him Tylenol and put him in a cool bath. That seemed to work - it went down to 99.\n\nA day later, Dan's left hand went partly numb. The doctor, concerned about blood clots, asked that he go to the hospital.\n\nBut Dan, never prone toward complaint, said he'd be okay.\n\nThen his temperature spiked again and stayed high. Dan began to cough, too. As it got worse, Liz grew alarmed.\n\nIt seemed to be affecting his breathing. It was hard for Dan to get words out.\n\nAt 8 p.m., Liz insisted they go to the ER. It took Dan an hour to get ready. He'd put on a shoe, then lie down, exhausted. That's how weak he was.\n\nFinally, they drove to Rhode Island Hospital's emergency room, stopping at a tent set up outside.\n\nStaffers right away saw Dan needed to be admitted. Liz would have to say goodbye to him there.\n\nThe virus wasn't as bad for Liz. Soon, the body aches and fatigue faded. But her tests didn't come back negative for six weeks. That's how long, she learned, COVID can last.\n\nThen she learned another relative had the virus - her 79-year-old uncle Virgilio Jordao. He'd lived with a degenerative nerve disease that years before had put him in the nursing home where Liz worked. He was one of the residents she cared for.\n\nWith his pre-existing challenges, COVID proved devastating. Virgilio died in mid-May at the Friendly Home.\n\nIn normal times, Danny would have helped Liz get through that loss. It was a reminder of COVID's cruelty that she couldn't even visit her husband for solace.\n\nTwo days after Dan went into the hospital with COVID, the night nurse arranged a Zoom call with Liz and the kids. Dan looked good to her. He had on a clear oxygen mask and she could see him mouth the words \"I love you.\"\n\nThey had another call the next day. This time, Dan looked tired. It was hard for him to talk.\n\nStill, his playful spirit was intact. At one point, it came up that Liz's background was Portuguese, prompting a nurse to say, \"So you're a good cook.\"\n\nDan shook his head \"no\" to tease Liz, then gave a thumb's-up.\n\nAs they signed off, Liz was hopeful.\n\nBut on the third day, Dan could barely keep his eyes open. His breathing had gotten worse.\n\nOn the fourth, they had to put Dan Remillard on a ventilator.\n\nThen his kidneys failed and he was soon on continuous dialysis, too.\n\nThat began a month-long vigil as Dan held on while unconscious, the family praying for him from afar.\n\nOn June 20, the Remillard family got news about their patriarch, Ron.\n\nTwo years before, at age 71, after a journey of memory issues that progressed to dementia, they had made the hard decision to move Ron into a nursing home. He was now in the Morgan Health Center in Johnston, which gave the kind of round-the-clock care that had been difficult for the Remillards to do.\n\nBut they visited often, Dianne bringing Ron home every weekend, the family gathering around him.\n\nMorgan Health routinely tested residents after the pandemic began, and Ron was negative for months. But on that Saturday, June 20, Dianne was told he had come up positive.\n\nYet there was good news, too. Ron was asymptomatic.\n\nDianne Remillard was seeing how capricious COVID-19 could be. Her son Dan, strong and 43, was in grave condition while her husband, 72, and with many challenges, had no symptoms.\n\nThat would soon change.\n\nDan, despite the ventilator and dialysis, held on. By mid-June, he seemed to be turning a corner.\n\nAround June 18, the doctors said there was hope of weaning him off, perhaps moving him to a step-down floor to begin rehabbing back to full health.\n\nBut there was caution, too. COVID had taken a toll on his body and lungs, and such patients could suddenly decline.\n\nOn Sunday, June 21, Father's Day, they were transporting Dan to a CT scan. It was an arduous process, having to move all his machines with him.\n\nThat's when something happened. Dan suddenly crashed. His breathing blocked up and his heart stopped.\n\nA team began CPR and wouldn't give up. Finally, at 12 minutes, they got Dan's heart restarted.\n\nBut it left profound damage.\n\nA nurse called Liz to say things were so uncertain she should come to the hospital immediately. She did, bringing the kids.\n\nIt was the first time she'd been next to Dan in weeks. He'd lost a lot of weight and looked terribly ill.\n\nAfter a half hour, the kids stepped out and it was just Liz and Dan in the room. She held his hand, saying, \"I'm here with you.\"\n\nHe was full of tubes and IVs, the machines beeping and hissing.\n\nBy then, she had gotten to know the Rhode Island Hospital nurses well enough to see they had come to love Dan, too. They talked about his infectious smile, and devoted family. They had hoped to see his triumphant recovery. Now, they told Liz that if this was the end, Dan would never be forgotten.\n\nLiz, heartbroken, prayed for Dan to rally, but if this was his time, she trusted the Lord. Liz knew God has a plan for everything.\n\nJust as a Rhode Island Hospital nurse had called Liz about Dan on June 21, now a different nurse the very next day called Dianne Remillard from the VA about her own husband, Ron.\n\nHe was no longer asymptomatic. Ron had developed breathing problems. His oxygen was declining, so they had taken him to the Providence Veterans' Administration Medical Center.\n\nAs with Dan, things looked grave.\n\nBut the Remillards' grit was still in both father and son. They both held through the night. And the next days.\n\nDianne would later say it was as if Ron somehow sensed his son's situation. She's convinced her husband would not leave until Danny was ready to come with him.\n\nDays later, around June 26, Dan's doctor called Liz.\n\nIt was now clear, the doctor said, that Dan's heart had stopped for so long that his brain had little activity, and would not recover.\n\nHis lungs were in bad shape, too. In essence, Dan was being kept alive by machines. The doctor and Liz talked about how there comes a time when a life is unnaturally prolonged.\n\nOver the next days, Liz prayed about what to do. At times, she almost wished God was ready to take Dan so she would not have to make the decision.\n\nOn Sunday morning, June 28, Liz went to a service at her church, held in the parking lot. Ocean State Baptist is a close community and many told Liz that Dan was in their hearts.\n\nThe pastor at one point said it was time for each soul to pray. Liz prayed for guidance, and as she did, suddenly felt peace.\n\nGod, she realized, was telling her it was time to let Dan go.\n\nShe shared this with her kids and the Remillard family, and though heartbroken, they agreed.\n\nFor closure, they decided to set up a Zoom call so those who loved Dan could say goodbye.\n\nDan's sister Cindy had one request -- that Liz be present in the hospital room. It gave Cindy comfort that her brother wouldn't be alone.\n\nLiz arrived at Rhode Island Hospital's fifth-floor Medical Intensive Care Unit around 2 p.m. that same day, June 28. One other visitor was allowed. Cindy and Dianne felt it would be too hard, so Liz came with Danny's cousin Lisha Hall.\n\nThe two masked and gloved up, and went in.\n\n\"Do you feel it,\" said Lisha. \"There is so much peace in this room.\"\n\nShe didn't want to say the word \"goodbye,\" so she told him, \"We'll see you again, in heaven.\"\n\nLiz held her husband's hand and with her mask on, kissed him on the forehead.\n\nThen it was time for the Zoom call.\n\nEveryone was amazed at how many people popped up. It seemed over 100 - family, friends and church folk.\n\n\"My son was a social butterfly,\" Dianne would later say.\n\nAs she looked at the Zoom screen on her couch in her Woonsocket home, she thought about Danny's smile and blue eyes and his heightened way of living - he loved eagles so much, he got a tattoo of one on his back.\n\nOne at a time, those on the Zoom bid goodbye to Dan, saying they wished he didn't have to go.\n\n\"My God, grown men crying,\" Dianne would recall, \"saying how much Danny touched their life.\"\n\nPeople thanked Dan for being there for them, whether plowing out a driveway or having coffee after a Bible study.\n\nIt struck Dianne that only two days before, June 26, she had marked her 49th anniversary with Ron. Two days before that, Liz and Dan marked their 14th. It was as if the two men had held on to see their milestones through.\n\n\"My heart is breaking,\" Dianne said to her son. \"You're the best son a mother could wish for.\"\n\nSuddenly, Dianne's phone rang. She decided not to answer. Then, next to her, a call came in to her daughter Cindy.\n\nIt was Ron Remillard's doctor at the VA.\n\n\"I'm sorry to say,\" he told her, \"but your father just passed.\"\n\nCindy and Dianne shared the sad news on the Zoom.\n\nThat's when Cindy said to her brother, \"Go with Daddy - he's waiting for you.\"\n\nThere in Danny's room, Liz thought to herself that now Danny would be with both his dads - his earthly father and the heavenly one.\n\nLiz asked if anyone had anything else to say.\n\nNo one did, leaving the hospital room quiet except for the sound of the machines.\n\nThe call ended, though Dan's sister Cindy chose to stay on, to be with her brother to the end.\n\nLiz told the doctors she was ready to let him go.\n\nMinutes later, they took Dan Remillard off the respirator.\n\nDianne, Cindy and Liz - all the Remillards really - are quite sure dad and son are now together.",

        "authors": [],
        "body": "DETROIT -- A rite of passage. A ritual, of sorts. Something to look forward to for so many young people.\n\nProm. Graduation. Summer.\n\nBut the coronavirus stripped the class of 2020 and other young people of a regular experience of those events, some of which have been anticipated for years.\n\nIt was a massive blow, especially after being in their homes for months with family because of stay-at-home or safer-at-home orders by Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer that were lifted at the beginning of June.\n\nThe rules loosened, and the party planning began.\n\nUnofficial proms, grad parties, sleepovers, yard parties, gatherings at the lake and just hanging out with friends.\n\nThe problem is, health officials say, mask wearing and social distancing went out the window. Now, they are seeing the number of positive COVID-19 cases in younger people on the rise in Michigan -- as well as spots across the United States and the world.\n\n\"Evidence suggests that spikes of cases in some countries are being driven in part by younger people letting their guard down during the Northern Hemisphere summer,\" World Health Organization Director-General Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said July 30.\n\n\"We have said it before and we will say it again: Young people are not invincible. Young people can be infected; young people can die, and young people can transmit the virus to others,\" he said.\n\nMore: Younger people are a factor in surge of COVID-19 cases, analysis shows\n\n'Feels like the world is against you: Young people struggle with finding mental health support amid COVID pandemic\n\nKayleigh Blaney, an epidemiologist with Michigan's Oakland County Health Division agreed.\n\n\"You're not gonna stop kids 15 to 19 who are not in school, with nothing to do, from hanging out with each other,\" she said. \"People are itching to get back to normal. I understand completely. I would love to get back to our old normal in time, but we are pushing ourselves to being more restricted again.\"\n\nThe Detroit Free Press, part of the USA TODAY network, analyzed state coronavirus data. Findings show that after Whitmer's orders were starting to lift June 1, those in the 0- to 19-year-old age group began to see a slightly faster rise in cases.\n\nBefore June, children and teens mostly made up 1% to 3% of COVID-19 cases in Michigan. A month after the order lifted, July 1, that age group made up 3.9% of the cases. During the past two weeks, from July 21 to Aug. 7, the age group saw an increase in cases of almost 2 percentage points: 5.7% to 7.4%.\n\nThe number of cases for the 20- to 29-year-old demographic also surpassed those in their 40s on July 24. The 20-somethings are now almost at the same positive case level as the 50- to 59-year-olds at 16%. Cases among people older than 39 have been slowly making up a smaller percentage of the population, with 60- to 69-year-olds seeing the most improvement.\n\nTeens across Michigan counties who test positive are typically in the 15- to 19-year-old age group, and their conditions range from asymptomatic to mild symptoms. Case numbers increased rapidly from late June to early August.\n\nBlaney said photos on social media of some of the parties, such as one that had about 70 young people standing shoulder-to-shoulder in long gowns and suits, show: \"There's not even a mask under a chin even in sight.\"\n\nShe said officials now are awaiting cases from parties held on or after July 31, with people starting to get sick and testing now.\n\n\"Events like graduation parties, proms, and house parties are contributing to this increase, but any type of large event or gathering where people fail to take appropriate precautions to stop the spread of COVID is a contributing factor,\" said William Ridella, director/health officer for Michigan's Macomb County Health Department.\n\n\"We need everyone to make informed decisions on the type of events or gatherings they attend and socialize responsibly by wearing face coverings, practicing social distancing and washing their hands frequently. Currently, these are the only tools we have to break the chain of transmission,\" he said.\n\nLynn Sutfin, spokeswoman for the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services, said last week that graduation parties and unofficial proms are considered social gatherings, \"and social gatherings make up the second most frequent setting for outbreaks.\"\n\nShe said long-term care facilities are the most frequent setting for outbreaks.\n\n\"A big concern is that young people risk their own health and the health of those around them when engaging in social activities without taking precautions,\" Michigan's Livingston County Health Promotion Coordinator Natasha Radke said. \"Actions like this continue to fuel the spread of COVID-19, as does not cooperating with local health departments to complete contact tracing.\"\n\nA lack of cooperation in contact tracing continues to be a problem.\n\n\"Most people aren't willing to rat out their friends,\" Blaney said.\n\nBut, she said, young people need to know that their friends may not talk about their home situations, such as their grandmother with dementia or their 45-year-old mother who is undergoing radiation for breast cancer and is immunocompromised.\n\n\"Your friends don't tell you everything, good or bad, when it comes to everything in their life,\" she said. \"You don't really know what's going on. By withholding contacts, you're really putting people at risk.\"\n\nAlso, she said, the long-term effects of the virus on the body, including a young person's, aren't known yet, though research is underway.\n\nNo social distancing or masks: Back-to-school photo shows unmasked students crowding shoulder-to-shoulder in Georgia\n\nMore: New York schools OK'd for in-person classes. Here's where nation's big districts stand on reopening.\n\nThe recent spike in teens testing positive for the virus increases concern among school reopening plans nationwide.\n\nAcross the country, school districts face delayed in-person instruction. And in some states, like Georgia or Tennessee, schools are already reporting positive cases shortly after reopening.\n\n\"Conferring with medical personnel from around the county regarding the recent spike of COVID-19 cases, there is a strong likelihood that, if the trend continues, we could be facing a forced shutdown after we begin face to face instruction,\" one Michigan public school district stated in a release.\n\nContributing: Wyatte Grantham-Philips, USA TODAY.",

And of the nearly 42% of students who sought mental health care during the pandemic, 60% said it was either much more or somewhat more difficult to access care.\n\nMental health among young people has been worsening for years. A 2019 analysis of teens reported 13% of U.S. teens ages 12 to 17 (or 3.2 million) said in 2017 they had experienced at least one major depressive episode in the past year, up from 8% (or 2 million) in 2007.\n\nLooking at the climbing data on anxiety yields even starker numbers. The Higher Education Research Institute at UCLA asked incoming college freshmen if they \"felt overwhelmed\" by all they had to do. In 1985,18% replied yes. In 2000, that climbed to 28 percent. By 2016, to nearly 41%.\n\nRoughly 48,000 people in the U.S. died by suicide in 2018, with the rate increasing 35% since 1999, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Suicide is the 2nd leading cause of death among ages 10 to 19, after accidents.\n\nBut the intersection of crises - COVID-19, economic woes and racial injustices - could make it worse still.\n\nSCHOOL'S OUT: Parents fear for children's mental health amid coronavirus pandemic\n\nTeens need mental health support in quarantine, just as others do, said Jennifer Rothman, the National Alliance on Mental Illness senior manager of youth and young adult information, support and education.\n\nCall volume at NAMI's HelpLine is up 65% compared to last year, she said, averaging more than 200 calls a day - and most calls ask for support with anxiety.\n\nTeenage requests are similar, Rothman said, \"and especially with COVID-19, and the social isolation, the change in structure and day-to-day activities and routines, we're seeing an increase in some of these symptoms\" of anxiety and depression.\n\nClass schedules and extracurriculars provided stability, said Boit, who has Borderline Personality Disorder and Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. But when classes became pre-recorded and time zones made connecting more complicated, motivation to seek help dropped.\n\n\"A Zoom call can't replace a shoulder to cry on or the warmth of a hug,\" Boit said.\n\nShe's continuing with group therapy remotely, but because of interstate medical restrictions she's unsure if she can do teletherapy with her Massachusetts psychiatrist from New York state, where she's lived with her boyfriend since April.\n\n\"Do I get a temporary therapist? The question of if I even bother is on my mind every day,\" she said. \"It's so hard to even want recovery when it feels like the world is against you.\"\n\nAccording to a June report from the American Psychological Association, more than 80% of U.S. adults report the nation's future is a significant source of stress in their lives\n\nBut a vast majority of older adults say they find preventive measures, such as face masks, reassuring. Gen Z adults were least likely to say it was reassuring (67%). Gen Z was also most likely to find these measures stressful (58%), according to the report.\n\nRothman attributes Gen Z's mental health challenges to the idea that \"this is their first 'where were you when' moments in their lifetime and they've had to adapt their lives to meet the restrictions of this pandemic.\"\n\n\"Gen Z depend on their social connections, and with the restrictions around large group gatherings, sheltering in place, virtual classes vs. in-person and the uncertainty for the future, it's causing a lot of uneasiness, stress and anxiety,\" she said.\n\n\"We should not trivialize (teenagers') stressors or grief in the context of the larger issues playing out during this pandemic,\" said Beth Marshall, associate director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Adolescent Health, during a faculty roundtable in May. \"Their grief over what they are experiencing - or not getting to experience - is real.\"\n\nAnushe Engineer, a junior at Scripps College in California, said part of the reason she and her peers are struggling right now is that \"college students are gearing up for jobs and employment and getting out into the 'real world'\" but that that real world isn't ready for them yet, which causes a lot of anxiety.\n\n\"From the class of 2020 to the next several graduating classes, college students will be entering a terrible job market with low prospects and fewer chances of opportunity,\" she said. \"That's not set in stone but it would be stupid to be oblivious to the realities we're facing currently.\"\n\nJaime Diaz-Granados, APA deputy chief executive officer and acting chief scientific officer called those realities, \"a culmination of crises unlike anything we have seen in our lifetimes - in coronavirus, economic turmoil and racism.\"\n\nThe intersection of these three crises is especially relevant for Yolo Akili Robinson, longtime mental health activist and founder of Black Emotional and Mental Health (BEAM), an organization dedicated to the wellness of Black and marginalized communities.\n\nHe said there's been an uptick in use of BEAM's resources since the pandemic and protests against police brutality began, particularly the Virtual Heart Space, where youth and others come to share problems, and the Black Virtual Therapist Directory, which enables people to find Black therapists by state.\n\n\"We have a lot of college students, a lot of younger people who come to (the Virtual Heart Space), many of whom are isolated, and many feel that people in our community or their families may not understand where they're coming from,\" Robinson said.\n\nDoctors say this intersection reverberates deeper among Black people, who've seen rising youth suicide attempts and suffered disproportionately during the pandemic.\n\nBut a 2005 analysis estimates that Black people are seven times more likely to live in areas with limited access to mental health care.\n\nHowever, Robinson notes that traditional talk therapy is not always accessible. Even before a pandemic made it nearly impossible to access in-person talk therapy, cost was prohibitive for many, especially college students or teens who do not have a stable income and often rely on their parents.\n\nCompanies like BetterHelp, 7Cups, and Talkspace offer online counseling appointments or peer support networks for less than the cost of traditional talk therapists, depending on health insurance. BetterHelp costs $80/week, Talkspace starts at $49/week, and 7 cups is free but to talk to a licensed therapist costs $150/month.\n\nPsychologist Glen Moriarty, who founded 7Cups, says part of the reason peer support networks have skyrocketed in demand is \"connections that are nurturing have decreased\" for youth and others.\n\n\"What it feels like is we don't want to be alone, like we want to belong to something,\" he said. Students, especially, have felt this way, because the emotional \"gas tank\" that is filled up when interacting with others has diminished, he said.\n\nEngineer, who is also an international student from Pakistan, said that for a lot of people, college can be a safe space where students can think and perform better, instead of worrying about what is happening at home.\n\nShe attributes a lot of this to the bubble students tend to live in \"at college, especially when you're literally halfway across the world from your family.\"\n\nSUPPORT: How to find a therapist if you're suicidal\n\nPeer support networks and online therapy are just two ways that those who feel anxious or depressed can reach out for support. Psychology Today also has an online database of therapists (which can also be sorted by ethnicity) some of whom have sliding scales or offer insurance coverage to pay for traditional therapy.\n\nBut if you can't afford a talk therapist, BEAM and NAMI suggest other coping tips for crises in quarantine:\n\nRobinson recommends journaling as a way to \"process your feelings and move through them\" and Chan-Frazier recommends going on a social media break and focusing on the good.\n\nRothman says that college and high school aged youth in NAMI's programs have gotten creative with learning new things virtually, \"like languages, how to cook, dances and getting crafty\" or whatever \"makes you feel more grounded,\" whether that be music, hobbies or dancing.\n\nRothman also noted that while it is important that \"you're staying in touch with your friends and family, whether it's virtually or socially distancing from them,\" it is okay to ask for help from a support network if you don't feel comfortable going to your family.\n\nCrisis Text Line provides free, 24/7, confidential support via text message to people in any crisis when they dial 741741.\n\nYou can also locate peer support resources at warmline.org.\n\nFor those who are seeking to support friends, 7Cups offers a free listening course which Moriarty says can help people \"collectively to learn how to better to support one another and always.\"\n\nThe Trevor Project also offers a peer support network called TrevorSpace for young people ages 13-24, and the Trans Lifeline is a peer support service run by trans people, for trans and questioning callers.\n\nIf you are a survivor of sexual assault, you can call the National Sexual Assault Hotline at 800.656.HOPE (4673) or visit hotline.rainn.org/online and receive confidential support.\n\nIf you or someone you know may be struggling with suicidal thoughts, you can call the U.S. National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 800-273-TALK (8255) any time day or night, or chat online.",

        "authors": [],
        "body": "The COVID-19 pandemic is having a significant impact on Americans' mental health, according to a new survey out Thursday from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nIt found elevated levels of symptoms of anxiety and depressive disorders, substance use and suicidal ideation among U.S. adults, and identified populations at increased risk, including young people, racial and ethnic minorities, essential workers and caregivers of adults.\n\nMore than 40% of respondents who completed surveys during June reported an adverse mental or behavioral health condition, and 11% reported having seriously considered suicide in the 30 days prior.\n\n\"We need to recognize the profound effects of the pandemic, of racial injustice, of economic instability,\" said Nadine Kaslow, a professor of psychiatry at the Emory University School of Medicine. \"Those people whose symptoms of anxiety or depression, or substance use or suicidal ideations are really interfering with their functioning, where the symptoms are extreme, those people need help.\"\n\nMental health experts say the data offers a helpful snapshot, but in some cases raises more questions than it answers. The survey shows more people are reporting symptoms of anxiety and depression, but the prevalence of anxiety and depressive disorders is unclear. More people may be thinking about suicide, but no one knows if suicidal ideation is leading to more suicidal acts because there's no national data on how the pandemic is impacting the suicide rate.\n\nThe data's greatest value, experts say, is the spotlight it shines on vulnerable populations.\n\n\"It is showing that this breakdown in our society, the breakdown of the safety net, the breakdown of economic security is taking a massive toll,\" said Anna Mueller, a suicide researcher and professor of sociology at the Indiana University Bloomington. \"These breakdowns really show how crucial economic stability and economic security are to an individual's well being. Because the people who are more vulnerable in terms of their socioeconomic status, people who are being put in harm's way, those are the people who are suffering the most.\"\n\nMore than half of essential workers reported at least one adverse mental or behavioral health symptom, and 22% reported suicidal thoughts. Symptoms of a COVID-related trauma and stressor-related disorder and increased substance use were more prevalent among essential workers than nonessential workers.\n\nEssential workers go beyond nurses and doctors. They are factory workers, hospital custodians, grocery store clerks. Many don't have job security and risk their health and the health of their families to meet basic needs.\n\nEssential workers: Food workers are scared, but they show up anyway.\n\n\"You have a lot of essential workers that often have no choices, don't get paid well, often are people of color,\" Kaslow said. \"They have certainly not in any systematic way gotten what they need in terms of hazard pay, in terms of protection, certainly in terms of accolades.\"\n\nThe percentage of respondents who reported having seriously considered suicide was significantly higher among Hispanic respondents (18.6%) and Black respondents (15.1%) than among whites (7.9%)\n\nHispanic respondents reported higher prevalence of symptoms of anxiety disorder or depressive disorder and substance use than whites. Black respondents reported increased substance use more commonly than did whites.\n\n'We're losing our kids': Black youth suicide rate rising far faster than for whites\n\nTwo thirds of unpaid caregivers for adults reported at least one adverse mental or behavioral health symptom. Thirty three percent of unpaid caregivers reported increased substance use compared to 6% of those who are not. And 31% of unpaid caregivers reported suicidal ideation versus 3% who were not.\n\nThe elderly are among those at highest risk of dying or having serious complications from COVID-19. Caregivers may have trouble finding additional help, or feeling safe using help that is available.\n\n\"Imagine how hard it is to take care of somebody anyway, but you have all these added stressors with COVID and you're not seeing an end in sight. The sense of overwhelmingness is intense,\" said Bart Andrews, chief clinical officer at Behavioral Health Response.\n\nThe survey found 75% of respondents 18-24 reported at least one adverse mental or behavioral health symptom and serious suicidal ideation was most commonly reported by this group, at 25%.\n\n\"This is a time when you are either going to college or you're finishing college or you're going into the workforce, and it's all about building and growing and becoming an adult. Everything that's happening is thwarting that,\" Kaslow said. \"There's no sense of the future. And I think as you enter young adulthood, to feel like your future is foreclosed is really distressing.\"\n\nMueller speculates uncertainty may also be a factor.\n\n\"They're watching their world crumble, and probably struggling to imagine a future,\" she said. \"I mean, we all are. What is the world going to look like? What is college going to look like if they were off to college? What is employment going to look like if they were hoping to enter the labor force?\"\n\nAndrews says it's important not to minimize distress signals, but he cautions against pathologizing emotions. People are stressed, anxious and depressed because they are human, he says. For some people, the universality of the pandemic may end up being a protective factor.\n\n\"Of course you're stressed out and anxious and depressed. You're living in the middle of the first pandemic in the United States of America in a hundred years,\" he said. \"The distress signals are very real and people are distressed, but that distress may be mediated because it's normalized. It's connected to a very real event that's external to the person. Nobody's blaming themselves for COVID. This is what's happening to us. Everybody's stressed out and who wouldn't be?\"\n\nAndrews says the situation likely will increase risk for some and decrease risk for others. Without intervention, it will exacerbate existing disparities, which is why he says social safety nets are critical.\n\nThe CDC survey calls for interventions that include \"strengthening economic supports to reduce financial strain, addressing stress from experienced racial discrimination, promoting social connectedness, and supporting persons at risk for suicide.\"\n\nKaslow said better access to affordable mental health services will be crucial. As will compassion.\n\n\"No matter how tired and burnt out we each are, we need to check in with people, to see how they're doing, to let people know that we care,\" Kaslow said. \"People did a lot of that at the beginning. ... As we get into this phase that people sort of call the disillusionment phase, I personally think we're seeing a lot less of that. We have to be in this for the long haul. We have to take care of each other for the long haul.\"\n\nYou may also be interested in:\n\nIf you or someone you know may be struggling with suicidal thoughts you can call the U.S. National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 800-273-TALK (8255) any time of day or night or chat online.\n\nCrisis Text Line provides free, 24/7, confidential support when you dial 741741.",

        "body": "PHOENIX - Nearly 200 tents stand inches apart on the scorching gravel lots, many covered in blankets for an extra layer of relief from the desert sun. Outside, their occupants sit on hot ground or in folding chairs, nearby palm trees providing no shade. Despite 12-foot-square sections painted in the gravel, there is little social distancing for Phoenix's homeless population.\n\nCreated by local officials in late April as a temporary solution for some of the estimated 3,700 unsheltered homeless, the fenced-in lots on the edge of downtown promised round-the-clock security, social distancing and access to water and toilets. But residents complain that hygiene supplies have become scarce, and measures meant to contain the spread of COVID-19 are not enforced.\n\n\"We have been, like, ignored,\" said Elisheyah, 61. \"There's no safety, nothing to guarantee you can be safe out here.\"\n\nHomeless people are one of the most vulnerable populations in the coronavirus pandemic, yet they're largely invisible victims of the crisis. Very little is known about how they're faring, in part because the Department of Housing and Urban Development - the main federal agency overseeing programs for them - has not required its national network of providers to gather information on infections or deaths. That's despite the fact that unlike other high-risk, congregate-living groups, such as nursing home residents and prisoners, homeless people interact more with the general public.\n\nAt the start of the pandemic in March, researchers warned that at least 1,700 of the nation's estimated 568,000 homeless people could eventually die of COVID-19. The Trump administration's homelessness czar, Robert Marbut, told Congress in July there had been just 130 homeless deaths, noting that was \"significantly lower than had been originally projected.\"\n\nHowever, the Howard Center for Investigative Journalism tracked at least 153 deaths of homeless people in the same time period in just six areas with large homeless populations - San Francisco, Los Angeles, New York City, Washington, D.C., Seattle and Phoenix - and at least 206 deaths nationwide by early August.\n\n\"This country for a long time has written off the lives of people experiencing homelessness,\" said Margot Kushel, a nationally recognized expert on homelessness and medical professor at the University of California, San Francisco. \"And now it is literally the thing that is really going to make it very difficult to control this pandemic.\"\n\nKushel called the pandemic \"a crisis within a crisis,\" noting that most homeless people are usually in poorer health and, with widespread closures in response to the pandemic, had lost access to services providing food, water and shelter.\n\nOnly about a dozen states acknowledged their homeless populations when they issued stay-at-home orders. Arizona said \"individuals experiencing homelessness are exempt from this directive, but are strongly urged to obtain shelter as soon as possible.\" Delaware similarly noted homeless residents weren't \"subject to this shelter in place order.\" But orders from Idaho and Kentucky made no reference to their homeless, even as they took care to mention golf and guns, respectively.\n\nCongress has allocated more than $4 billion for homeless-specific programs as part of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act and made billions more available at the discretion of federal and state officials. But four months after passage of the CARES Act, most of that money had not made its way to local communities, the Howard Center found. Meanwhile, behind the scenes, officials in Washington are seeking to shift long-standing homelessness policy, and state and local politicians disagree whether funds should be used to help currently homeless people or those at risk of becoming homeless in the economic collapse that has accompanied the pandemic.\n\nThe Howard Center spent three months investigating COVID-19's impact on homeless people, analyzing data to predict which homeless populations around the country would be most vulnerable. It identified 43 counties that would likely struggle in the pandemic, several of which, such as Imperial in California and Maricopa in Arizona, went on to develop some of the highest infection rates in the country. Reporters also interviewed more than 80 professionals working in homelessness, epidemiology and public health, as well as homeless people in hot-spot areas, who described their daily struggles. And because homelessness is typically a problem left to local communities to address, reporters filed 140 public records requests to the vulnerable counties and their major cities to learn more about their responses to the crisis.\n\nSome communities were quick to act, forming cross-departmental working groups to address both the housing and health needs of their homeless, securing emergency housing, such as hotels, trailers and even convention centers, and taking care to prevent communal spread. In Colorado Springs, Colorado, for example, an emergency isolation shelter with 100 beds was constructed in just three weeks. By March 11, police in Oceanside, California, were handing out fact sheets to homeless people to inform them of the spread of the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19.\n\nOthers were slow or failed to respond. The city manager in Sanger, California, opposed housing homeless people possibly infected with COVID-19 in emergency trailers in his town. And in Daytona Beach, Florida, efforts to convert an old building into permanent housing for homeless residents failed despite having the funding and county support needed to do so.\n\nOverall, records showed, localities faced two major problems in addressing the pandemic's impact on their homeless populations: a lack of readiness to work across departments dealing with both housing and health, and insufficient data and testing to know who was getting sick and where.\n\nMany have criticized the federal government for not providing a coordinated response to the pandemic's impact on homeless people, as well as more resources for testing and tracing. Some have also advocated for racially equitable COVID-19 responses. By early August, people of color, who represent about 24% of the general population, made up about 61% of all COVID-19 infections and 50% of all deaths, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\n\"All states have been at a disadvantage in their response to C-19 because the federal government has failed to adopt a unified nationwide strategy. In fact, the national strategy seems to be 'let states handle it,'\" Barbara DiPietro, senior policy director for the National Health Care for the Homeless Council, said in an email. \"This is the least efficient, most wasteful way to approach a crisis.\"\n\nOne week before the CARES Act was passed on March 27, researchers from the University of Pennsylvania, UCLA and Boston University released a report forecasting COVID-19 infections, hospitalizations and fatalities among homeless people. They estimated more than 20,000 homeless people could require hospitalization and gave a range for potential fatalities, with the midpoint about 3,400.\n\nMore: From a Biogen conference to a homeless shelter: Researchers track coronavirus infections from 'super-spreader' events\n\nMore: Wrestling with demons: How a troubled child turned into a champion\n\nMore: Another 1 million expected to file unemployment claims as coronavirus spikes and ebbs\n\n\"We believe that the true likely fatality outcome would be on the higher end of this range given the challenge of actually getting homeless clients to the hospital, especially when they are unsheltered, as well as the unusually high mortality risks that prevail among the homeless population,\" the researchers wrote. They estimated $11.5 billion was needed to supply additional beds and housing required for social distancing.\n\nDan Treglia, one of the Penn researchers, said he stands by the study's predictions. He, like other experts interviewed by the Howard Center, noted there was no nationwide systematic testing, including for homeless people. Without such testing, the virus' infection rate remains unknown, making COVID-19 deaths harder to identify and count.\n\nThe virus \"is hitting different parts of the country at different times and with different rates of severity,\" Treglia said, adding it's hard to know \"exactly what this number is going to look like at the end of the day.\"\n\nHUD's Homeless Management Information System allows for the department, through a network of regional and local planning bodies, to track COVID-19 infections and deaths among homeless people. But HUD announced in late March it would not require COVID-19 data collection through HMIS, although it did provide guidance on what information communities could collect if they wanted.\n\nExperts say this highlights one of the structural problems facing how the country deals with homelessness.\n\n\"HUD is for housing, so they're not really thinking about health care and the people on the ground; even service providers that are serving their patients in their housing programs are not primarily thinking about health,\" said Bobby Watts, chief executive of the National Health Care for the Homeless Council. But, he added, \"Housing is health care.\"\n\nNew York City, which has the nation's largest sheltered homeless population because of a right-to-shelter law, is the only metropolitan area yet to attempt a statistical assessment of COVID's impact on homeless people. The Coalition for the Homeless, the city's court-appointed monitor of homeless shelters and families, reported that the age-adjusted COVID-19 mortality rate for sheltered homeless was 67% higher than the mortality rate for the city's general population, as of early August. The city reported 104 deaths among its almost 80,000 homeless residents for the same time frame.\n\nBoston tested a group of homeless people after a large-scale outbreak at a shelter in late March. Of 408 residents tested, researchers found a 36% positivity rate, a measure of viral spread. Of those, about 88% were asymptomatic. The results, published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, confirmed that COVID-19 carriers could be asymptomatic.\n\nLos Angeles, which along with New York accounts for nearly one-quarter of the nation's homeless population, began to measure COVID's impact on its most vulnerable in April. California has the nation's largest unsheltered homeless population.\n\nThe Los Angeles County Department of Public Health said as of Aug. 7, it had tested about 30% of its nearly 60,000 homeless residents and found a 2.8% positivity rate among sheltered homeless and a 2.4% positivity rate among those living unsheltered. Researchers have noted that infection rates seem to be lower for people living outdoors compared to those in shelters, though they're not sure why.\n\nWilliam Nicholas, director of the county's Center for Health Impact Evaluation, said decades-long funding cuts of public health departments meant many didn't have the ability to track homeless COVID-19 deaths or infections.\n\nThe report to Congress by the U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness cited relatively low numbers of homeless infections and deaths, which it credited to \"early collaboration with federal agencies, front-line providers and local authorities.\" It also said \"individuals experiencing homelessness have been tested on a wider basis and at significantly higher rates than the general public.\" The report noted the numbers were provisional and may \"increase slightly.\"\n\nEmily Mosites, a senior CDC adviser on homelessness, told the Howard Center the report included some CDC data, \"but we don't have a very precise count of total cases, and we expect that the estimates that we do have are an underestimate.\" One reason for that, she said, is homelessness is not always reflected in medical records.\n\nIn an interview with the Howard Center, Marbut, executive director of the Interagency Council on Homelessness, said his organization, not HUD, was best suited to collect COVID-19 data on homeless people. He said the council was doing that through contacts with homeless shelters around the country.\n\nJeff Olivet, who has researched homelessness for 25 years, said \"it would be dangerous to assume that just because there have not been major outbreaks yet that there won't be.\"\n\nAfter shelter outbreaks in Boston, Seattle, San Francisco and Atlanta, the CDC recommended that shelters consider testing all residents and staff members, but local government records show that did not always happen.\n\nIn Santa Barbara County, California, no homeless people brought into the county's emergency shelter site were being tested as of April 15, records showed. A homeless assistance program manager requested widespread testing but was told asymptomatic people would not be tested.\n\nIn Merced, California, the public health department sent nurses in mid-May to encampments of homeless people to test for COVID-19 and provide guidance, records showed, but it was not able to provide treatment to those who tested positive.\n\nOfficials in Arizona's largest county, Maricopa, were discussing in late March how to implement testing for their homeless residents, records show, even though one local nonprofit was already testing the homeless. One month later, testing remained a problem for the county. As of the first week in August, officials reported that 490 of the estimated 7,400 homeless in the county had tested positive for COVID, and nine had died.\n\n\"We're flying in the dark,\" Watts said. \"We don't really know if we're giving the best advice at a given period of time. And the only way to really try to get the best advice is to have the best data.\"\n\nAndy Phelps, the homelessness prevention and response coordinator for Colorado Springs, received countless emails in the first two weeks of March as the COVID-19 threat hit home.\n\nOne shelter operator reminded him that \"people in homelessness with little to limited access to hand-washing and who are already apt to suffer from other illness may be among higher risk populations for the Corona virus.\" She then asked whether emergency shelter operations were still applicable if an outbreak occurred. Others told Phelps of increased cleaning needs and sought guidance from the Office of Emergency Management on alternate locations to house people.\n\nPhelps even got questions about asking questions - \"could the OEM make that request to the County, or could you? Or should one of us reach out directly?\"\n\nFinally, Phelps emailed El Paso County's public health director proposing a meeting to discuss the response to the crisis.\n\n\"I have received a growing amount of calls and emails from shelter providers in town that are concerned about the potential impact of the COVID-19 virus spreading into the shelters,\" Phelps wrote. \"I feel unprepared to offer them guidance further than sending them a CDC webpage.\"\n\nThe Howard Center filed public records requests in the 43 counties its analysis identified as being most vulnerable to a coronavirus outbreak, including to the HUD planning bodies that oversee homelessness efforts around the country, known as Continuums of Care. Responses to about half the 140 records requests filed provide an inside look at how some communities struggled to respond in the first three months of the crisis.\n\nAfter Phelps' suggestion, El Paso County began cross-departmental meetings with representatives of its public health and homeless response teams, as well as relevant nonprofits. Within three weeks, the city had created a 100-bed isolation center.\n\nSeveral other communities from Florida to Hawaii created similar task forces to address homeless needs in the pandemic, bringing together departments that didn't regularly work together, such as housing, health and emergency services.\n\n\"One thing that has kept me up at night has been how do we protect those in encampments and living unsheltered,\" Chelsea Haring-Cozzi, executive director of the Indianapolis Coalition for Homelessness Intervention & Prevention, said in a March 13 email to city officials. \"How do you quarantine someone who doesn't have a home?\"\n\nMaricopa County had two main goals: reduce the risk among the most vulnerable homeless and adequately respond to people with symptoms or those who needed isolation. Although the cross-departmental coordination was successful, the county was criticized for housing unsheltered homeless people in three open-air encampments in downtown Phoenix, known as the Lots.\n\nIn late July, when temperatures reached 118 degrees Fahrenheit, about 200 people were living in nearly 170 spaces, according to Amy Schwabenlender, executive director of Human Services Campus, a nonprofit that was providing services to the Lots. She said total numbers were fluid because people regularly came and went.\n\nOceanside, California, and Pasco County, Florida, were among several cities and counties that partnered with nonprofits to ensure their unsheltered populations had water, hand-washing stations, toilets and electricity to charge cellphones - all services that became nearly inaccessible after COVID's mass closures.\n\nCalifornia implemented Project Roomkey, aimed at moving high-risk homeless people out of crowded shelters and outdoor encampments to secure isolated settings, such as hotel and motel rooms. As of June 30, 14,200 people had been housed by the program, funded by state and federal emergency funds.\n\nOther cities, such as Las Vegas, San Diego and Santa Barbara, California, turned convention centers and high school gyms into emergency homeless shelters big enough to allow social distancing.\n\nSan Diego opened its convention center as an emergency shelter, testing site and meal distribution hub on April 1 and, by early August, had sheltered 2,780 homeless people. Internal records show the city spent about $2.8 million a month on the makeshift shelter, and it expects to spend $3 million a month through the end of the year. Funding was also allocated to ensure that, when the center reverts to normal operations, homeless residents will \"be able to obtain shelter and housing.\"\n\nConnecticut has been widely praised by homeless experts for moving quickly. In early March, the state's housing department reduced shelter capacity by nearly 60% and placed homeless people 60 or older in hotels, some of which it used as testing sites. Of 300 tests, only two homeless people tested positive, according to Steve DiLella, a Connecticut housing official who spoke in July at the virtual Nationwide Town Hall on Ending Homelessness.\n\nBut not all efforts to safely house or test the homeless were welcomed, records showed.\n\nIn Daytona Beach, Florida, heads of two homeless nonprofits sought permission to convert an empty building into a shelter that could be turned into permanent single-room housing after the pandemic. Jeff White, executive director of Volusia/Flagler County Coalition for the Homeless Inc., and another nonprofit leader argued that using COVID-19 funds to develop \"permanent supportive housing\" was better than paying for hotel rooms, which would be \"basically burning money.\" The project had funding, a quick timeline and county support, records show, but the deputy city manager was not encouraging.\n\nWhite told the Howard Center he never received a final answer from city officials and moved on to another plan.\n\n\"The response was kind of a non-response saying that the permits could be applied for but not really commenting on whether they would support the project,\" he said.\n\nIn Sanger, California, city manager Tim Chapa opposed placing three emergency isolation trailers in his town to house homeless people showing symptoms of COVID-19. The Fresno County public health department ordered Chapa to take the trailers, records show, but before they arrived, Chapa appealed to the City Council. He said the city's shelter \"may not have the capacity to provide adequate medical support service to identified COVID + homeless,\" he recounted in an April 17 email to a county official. Chapa said the trailers would be better in Fresno, where they ended up later that day.\n\nLeaders in El Centro, the main city in California's Imperial County, repeatedly but unsuccessfully sought the county's help with a COVID-19 testing program.\n\n\"As to the homeless population, they (county officials) are not going to enact anything unless there are any positive results within the population. They are not doing any pre-emptive activities,\" Adriana Nava, El Centro's community services director, wrote to her colleagues March 19.\n\nBy June 22, there were 17 confirmed coronavirus cases among the estimated 1,400 homeless people in Imperial County, including one case in a 10-person encampment behind a grocery store in Calexico. Internal emails show that county officials did not realize the infected person had been living in the camp until they were notified by a homeless service provider, who said others there were worried about becoming ill. The county then tested the encampment residents and said all were negative, records show. In a June 22 email, Linsey Dale, a spokeswoman for Imperial County, said it was the only encampment the county had tested.\n\nEl Centro Fire Chief Kenneth Herbert told the Howard Center he had questions about the county's infection numbers for homeless people.\n\n\"You look at that and say there are only 17 positive, then my next question would be what your testing outreach has been, how many persons have you tested or attempted to test?\" he asked. \"How can it possibly be 17?\"\n\nAs of the first week of August, the county reported 36 homeless people had tested positive for COVID-19.\n\nThe varied local government responses to caring for homeless people during the pandemic highlight the need for a coordinated federal approach, experts told the Howard Center.\n\n\"We have been left county by county, city by city, to cobble together a public health response to something that is on par with the Spanish flu in terms of its infectiousness and potential lethality,\" said Marc Dones, executive director of the National Innovation Service, a public policy organization focused on racial equity. \"To simply step out of the role, to step out of the responsibility in this moment feels like a fundamental abdication of the purpose of government.\"\n\nFive months into the pandemic, statistics show people of color are disproportionately infected with and dying from COVID-19.\n\nAt the same time, Blacks, Latinos and Native Americans are disproportionately affected by another public health crisis: homelessness. These same groups comprise nearly 65% of the country's homeless population, according to HUD's 2019 Annual Homeless Assessment Report.\n\nExperts interviewed by the Howard Center said structural racism was the root cause of both plagues affecting people of color.\n\n\"We simply wouldn't have homelessness if we didn't have the kinds of structural racism that we have,\" Dones said, pointing to hurdles that people of color face in accessing both affordable housing and health care. \"Racism is one of, if not the core driver, of why homelessness exists in this country.\"\n\nExperts say the main type of homelessness experienced by Latino and Native communities involves living doubled or tripled up in inadequate housing, which influences both the undercounting and underserving of those communities, as well as the spread of COVID-19.\n\nIn a 2018 study, researchers in El Paso, Texas, found that homeless Latinos were being underreported in HUD statistics, which they attributed to the fact that the agency did not account for people who were marginally housed, such as those doubling-up with others or couch-surfing.\n\nIn its definition of homelessness, HUD considers marginally housed people 24 and younger to be homeless, though such people are not recorded in HUD's biennial Point-in-Time counts. People older than 24 in the same situation are not considered homeless by HUD. The agency acknowledged, when updating its definitions in 2011, that it was excluding some vulnerable populations.\n\nOlivet, who authored an influential report on racism and homelessness in 2018, said Latino homelessness often is \"hidden\" because outreach services are not \"culturally and linguistically competent.\"\n\nExperts attribute high rates of COVID-19 infections and homelessness among minority populations to their likelihood of working low-wage jobs. Data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics showed such workers were more likely to be people of color: fewer than 20% of Black people and about 16% of Latinos were able to work from home during the pandemic, compared with about 30% of white people.\n\nPeople of color are not less healthy than their white counterparts, Olivet said; rather, they're put in less healthy working conditions with inadequate health care.\n\n\"So it's not just that they're sick because they're sick, it's also that they're sick because they don't have access to health care,\" he said.\n\nCOVID's disproportionate impact on people of color has coincided with a larger conversation on race as Black Lives Matter and anti-police brutality rallies spread across the U.S. Recently, some federal, state and local government agencies have started considering how to incorporate racial equity into how federal homeless and COVID-19 dollars are spent.\n\nOne of the first places to take such action is Tacoma, Washington, which is aiming to issue 45% of its coronavirus rental-assistance funds to households identifying as Black or mixed race. In Pierce County, where Tacoma is located, Blacks comprise about 26% of the homeless population but about 6% of the general population.\n\nVa Lecia Kellum, president of St. Joseph Center, a Los Angeles organization providing housing opportunities and health services, said she would like to see similar approaches elsewhere.\n\n\"If we are all in this together, then it's absolutely the case that we need to invest in our most vulnerable citizens,\" Kellum said.\n\nAmid finding ways to protect, isolate and test one of the nation's most vulnerable populations, experts say another homelessness crisis is looming.\n\n\"We're starting to brace ourselves for just a huge infusion of people losing their homes,\" said Megan Hustings, the managing director of the National Coalition for the Homeless. \"We already didn't have the resources to help everybody who was losing their homes before this crisis, and it's just going to be worse.\"\n\nIn 2019, there were only 389,549 shelter beds for an estimated 568,000 homeless people, according to HUD. To combat the expected rise in homelessness, some experts are calling for additional rental assistance and unemployment benefits in addition to continued bans on evictions.\n\nTreglia, the Penn researcher who was among the first to warn of an impending homeless crisis amid COVID, said shelter capacity won't keep pace with the expected increases in homelessness, and that could have wide-ranging effects.\n\n\"The worse this gets, the more homeless people that are infected, the more precautionary measures need to be taken,\" he said. \"The more we put at-risk populations or any population at risk of infection, the greater the risk is for everyone.\"",

    "COVID-19 travel: Where can Americans vacation internationally?": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "Scott Keyes is used to fielding questions about the best cheap flights around the world, but the queries he's getting from globetrotters as the coronavirus pandemic continues are more basic.\n\nAt the top of the list: Where can Americans travel internationally today?\n\n\"People are very curious to know the answer to that,'' the founder of travel deals website Scott's Cheap Fights said. \"The answer to that is: not very many places. And the number seems to be going in the wrong direction.''\n\nThe good news: several spots in the Caribbean and Mexico are welcoming guests again and drawing U.S. tourists as airlines resume flights and add new ones. United Airlines on Friday said it is adding additional flights to St. Thomas and San Juan, Puerto Rico. Of the few Americans traveling internationally, travel app Hopper says bookings to Puerto Rico, Mexico and the Dominican Republic topped the list in the past two months.\n\nBut the welcome mat was quickly rolled back up in one popular destination, and other destinations have tightened their entry requirements.\n\nThe Bahamas touted its reopening on July 1 but changed its mind a few weeks later due to an uptick in coronavirus cases in the United States, banning commercial flights from the U.S. as of July 22.\n\nMore: 6 things to keep in mind before you book an international trip during the pandemic\n\nThe popular islands off the coast of Florida adjusted their stance again a week later, to allow U.S. travelers as long as they present a negative COVID-19 test and quarantine for 14 days, the latter which still effectively rules out vacations. Southwest Airlines has suspended its service to Nassau through October, American Airlines through August.\n\nEuropean countries have reopened their borders, but most are off-limits to U.S. vacationers due to the surge in coronavirus cases. A couple that are welcoming U.S. visitors: Croatia and Turkey. Canada is off limits as the border remains closed and only essential travel is permitted, even by air.\n\nKeep in mind that even though international travel is reopening, the U.S. State Department and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention still advise against nonessential international travel, and countries have rapidly changing COVID-19 regulations. Attractions and other tourist businesses may or may not be open, so if you're itching for a getaway, make sure to thoroughly research the trip before booking and carefully check cancellation and change policies of airlines, hotels and vacation rentals.\n\nHere's a list of popular spots that are welcoming U.S. tourists but notably not requiring a 14-day quarantine on arrival because few travelers want to book a pricey international trip if they can't leave their hotel room or vacation rental. That rules out London, Ireland, The Bahamas and others.\n\nThe land border between the U.S. and Mexico is closed to nonessential travel through at least late August, but tourists are free to fly to several destinations that have reopened. They include:\n\nCOVID-19 test: No\n\nOther entry requirements: Masks are required at the airport, and travelers must fill out a traveler risk factor questionnaire upon arrival and departure.\n\nOther entry requirements: Masks are required at airports, and travelers must fill out a traveler risk factor questionnaire upon arrival and departure.\n\nOther entry requirements: Masks are required at airports, and passenger temperatures are checked via thermal screening.\n\nOther entry requirements: Temperature screening at Puerto Vallarta airport and face masks are required at the airport.\n\nOther entry requirements: Masks are required at airports, and travelers must fill out a traveler risk factor questionnaire upon arrival and departure.\n\nOther entry requirements: Temperature screening at Puerto Vallarta airport.\n\nDetails: Riviera Nayarit Convention and Visitors Bureau\n\nCOVID-19 test: Yes, though the timing of the test depends on which U.S. state you're arriving from. Travelers arriving from a long list of states with rising COVID-19 infections must get a PCR test 72 hours before their flight. An initial option for airport testing is no longer available for those travelers.For travelers from all other states, airport testing is an option, for $75, or they can do a test 72 hours before their departing flight. For those taking tests in advance, results must be uploaded at least 12 hours prior to flight departure when filling out Aruba's online embarkation/disembarkation forms.\n\nOther entry requirements: Visitors must fill out an embarkation/disembarkation card online and purchase mandatory Aruba Visitors Insurance, a measure the country says is designed to help cover medical expenses of up to $75,000 for visitors who test positive during their stay.

While in Bermuda, visitors are required to be tested every four, eight and 14 days, and the appointments will be scheduled automatically. Face masks are required in public.\n\nDetails: Government of Bermuda\n\nCOVID-19 test: Travelers ages 5 and older must show proof of a negative PCR test taken no more than five days before arrival. Those who don't provide proof will undergo rapid diagnostic tests at the airport for free. Travelers who test positive or show symptoms will be isolated at authorized' locations.\n\nOther entry requirements: Health evaluations conducted upon arrival, and face masks are required at the airport.\n\nDetails: Dominican Republic tourism website\n\nCOVID-19 test: Residents from designated high-risk states must upload a negative PCR test from a College of American Pathologists accredited lab. The test, required for travelers ages 12 and older, must be taken within 10 days of arrival. Vacationers from other areas aren't required to take a test but are subject to health screening on arrival, and those showing symptoms will be tested and must quarantine in their hotel room until test results are available.\n\nOther entry requirements: Visitors must fill out a travel authorization in advance. Visitors can only leave their hotels and resorts to visit select \"COVID-19 compliant'' tourist attractions and travel there on approved transportation providers.

Those who've taken a test within 72 hours but are still waiting on results will be forced to quarantine for 14 days or until they're able to present negative results to the Puerto Rico Health Department. Those who arrive on the island without a test will be tested locally and must quarantine until they can present a negative result. Travelers not willing to undergo a test must quarantine for 14 days.\n\nIf travelers are displaying COVID-19 symptoms upon arrival, the Puerto Rican National Guard will give them a rapid COVID-19 test (finger prick blood test) must quarantine even if the results are negative until they are able to present a negative PCR test, as well.\n\nOther entry requirements: Visitors must complete an online travel declaration form and will be presented with an airport exit confirmation number upon receipt of negative COVID-19 test results. Face masks are mandatory in all public areas.\n\nDetails: Discover Puerto Rico\n\nCOVID-19 test: Visitors must receive a negative test no more than seven days before arrival.\n\nOther entry requirements: Travelers must fill out a pre-arrival registration form that includes a reservation at a certified hotel. Visitors may only stay in one approved hotel per visit. At the airport, there is a health screening, including temperature checks. Symptomatic passengers will be immediately isolated and tested. If positive for COVID-19, they will be transferred to a hospital for treatment and care at their expense. All other passengers must take a certified taxi to their certified hotel or government quarantine facility and must stay there for the duration of their stay except to participate in water excursions arranged by the hotel.\n\nDetails: St. Lucia tourism website\n\nCOVID-19 test: Travelers are required to submit negative results from a PCR test taking within 72 hours prior to departure. Children ages 10 and younger are exempt.\n\nOther entry requirements: Travelers must complete an online health declaration form.

Face masks are required at the airport.\n\nDetails: U.S. Virgin Islands tourism website\n\nCOVID-19 test: Croatia is requiring travelers to present a negative COVID-19 test taken within 48 hours. If the test is older than 48 hours upon arrival, travelers will be required to self-isolate until getting tested again locally and providing negative results. Those entering the country without a COVID-19 test will have to quarantine for 14 days, but that can be shortened to seven with a test in the country.\n\nOther entry requirements: Tourists must provide a receipt upon arrival showing they've paid for accommodation in the country. Documentation will be required at the airport or travelers can save time and upload paperwork in advance.

    "COVID-19 worse for New York than Spanish flu of 1918, new study shows": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "The 1918 Spanish flu pandemic, which claimed an estimated 50 million lives worldwide, stands as the most frequent point of comparison to the current coronavirus scourge.\n\nIn some ways, according to a new study, the COVID-19 pandemic has been worse.\n\nThe study, published Thursday in the medical journal JAMA Network Open, compares the two months since the first recorded death of COVID-19 in New York City - the epicenter of the U.S. epidemic for weeks - with the deadliest two months of the 1918 calamity.\n\nAlthough the number of New Yorkers per 100,000 who died monthly was higher at the time - 287, significantly more than the average of 202 from March 11 to May 11 of this year - the deviation from the norm in 2020 is considerably higher.\n\nAbout 100 New Yorkers per 100,000 died of all causes every month in the four years before the Spanish flu, a figure that nearly tripled in October and November of 1918, the peak of the pandemic in the city.\n\nThis time around - with more advanced medical care and public health systems bringing fatalities down to 50 a month per 100,000 during the same March-to-May dates the previous three years - the number of deaths quadrupled.\n\nDoes new school year mean measles or flu outbreaks? Doctors worry as kids miss scheduled vaccinations\n\nThat puts in stark terms the impact of a disease some still downplay in part because approximately 40% of those infected might not develop symptoms.\n\n\"They're comparable events in terms of magnitude,'' said Dr. Jeremy Faust, an emergency physician at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston and the lead author of the study.\n\n\"I think maybe we imagine pandemics and plagues and other calamities to be this sort of historical events where the streets are lined with dead bodies and there's pestilence and filth, but what our numbers show is that what happened in New York was pretty similar to what happened in the greatest modern pandemic.''\n\nAnother expert not involved in the study reached a similar conclusion, noting that the new report puts in perspective the enormous toll extracted by a virus that has infected nearly 5.2 million Americans and killed more than 165,000 - in just seven months. An estimated 675,000 Americans died in the Spanish flu pandemic.\n\n\"The gross numbers per population were higher for flu, but when you account for the changes in death rates due to healthier cities in 2020, COVID has resulted in far more excess deaths than the flu pandemic,'' said Dr. Eric Cioe-Pe\u00f1a, director of global health for Northwell Health in Long Island, New York. \"A reminder of just how bad this pandemic is and how swiftly this virus can kill.''\n\nBeware: Scammers tell people they're fired or may have COVID-19\n\nFaust acknowledges his report represents a case study that's not necessarily applicable to other cities or the rest of the nation. That remains to be seen as the coronavirus continues to spread and disrupt life across the country.\n\nHe pointed out nobody knows whether we've seen the worst or just a preamble of the damage that can be inflicted by the virus. Many public health experts fear that the arrival of the flu season in the fall and winter combined with the continued prevalence of the coronavirus could lead to catastrophic results.\n\nFaust also warned against equating the COVID-19 epidemic with a bad flu season, as those who seek to minimize the danger the new virus presents have often done.\n\nOpinion: We are worried that hospital COVID-19 data no longer goes to the apolitical CDC: Doctors\n\nIn a JAMA article published May 14, Faust and Dr. Carlos del Rio - also his co-author on the new study - noted that conditions at hospitals treating coronavirus patients have often been much more dire than during a flu season. They also argued that the way the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates flu-related deaths overcounts them.\n\nBy Faust's estimation, the epidemic the U.S. is going through now, with 25% of the world's COVID-19 cases and 22% of its deaths, is 20 times worse than a typical flu season.\n\n\"What we're experiencing is truly historic and unusual, and it shouldn't be shrugged off,'' Faust said. \"We're sort of used to a very low level of deaths, and for us to suddenly experience a quadrupling, it gives us a sense of the magnitude of the public health crisis we're dealing with.''",

        "body": "My sister doesn't yet have the virus, but COVID-19 is already killing her.\n\nBefore the pandemic, Erica struggled. The isolation of New York City's spring lockdown pushed her off a proverbial cliff from which I'm not sure she can return.\n\nFrom birth my sister has struggled. Born with a dislocated hip, at 3 years old she spent months in a full body cast and wheelchair following surgery. Unable to walk, run, and play like other children, she gained weight as a toddler and has faced lifelong mobility challenges. Erica's hard start continued with intellectual disabilities and a diagnosis of schizophrenia in her 20s. She's struggled with weight, twice losing close to 100 lbs in the last decade but regaining it and more. Her fiercest advocate -- our mother -- died when Erica was 13.\n\nI've worried about losing our 77-year-old father to COVID-19, given his history of cancer, lung problems, and high blood pressure. With reports of younger people battling severe cases, many of them with preexisting conditions and obesity, I've now had to worry about my 37-year-old sister's heightened risk of COVID-19 complications and death.\n\nWhen I last saw her in February, Erica wasn't doing great but not awful. I cancelled my March trip, fearing I'd kill my father, who she lives with, if I brought the virus home. I helped from afar, paying rent and utilities so he didn't have to travel to cash checks. I called daily with public health advice to safeguard against the virus. I sent medicine and a guitar, art supplies, and books to feed Erica's soul in quarantine.\n\nMy sister had climbed out of extreme isolation last summer. It took persistent urging to get her to leave the house and return to mental health treatment. Just as she'd reestablished her routines, she had to isolate again for her safety and our father's.\n\nCOVID-19:Online learning can work. Here's how my class found the energy and inspiration.\n\nShe had phone therapy sessions but no longer had in-person appointments to compel her to walk to the bus and run errands. She couldn't use the internet anymore with public library closures or attend a psychosocial clubhouse where she participated in social activities. Her mobility plummeted and depression soared.\n\nI found a disaster when I returned this summer. Erica stayed in bed most days. Empty soda bottles and candy wrappers piled beneath, and a mountain of dirty clothes that no longer fit grew in the corner. I discovered her ankle monstrously swollen. She'd had a phone appointment, but no one examined her. She insisted it didn't hurt until finally admitting that it did. Erica's used to being in poor health, never wanting to cause trouble. \"I'm good,\" she answers whenever I ask how she is.\n\nShe's far from \"good.\" At 37, she's having more trouble than many of the 70, 80, and 90-year-olds I've met in my research on older adults. She can no longer reach her foot or squeeze her swollen ankle into her shoes or socks, only a plastic slipper.\n\nGetting her to the clinic was no small feat. The doctor warned of what he called \"expiration of life\" in the next 10 years at Erica's BMI of 84. \"4-7-5 pounds.\" I had to ask him to repeat this number several times. When I last accompanied her in 2018, Erica weighed 350 pounds. Forget 10 years. I worry about her surviving 2020.\n\nWith her poor balance, I dread the fall that lands her in a nursing home or the COVID that robs her breath. We're waiting for Medicaid to approve a homecare aide and medical transportation to appointments because she cannot walk to the bus and can barely get into a taxi with my assistance. It feels too little, too late.\n\nMy sister isn't alone. We've barely scratched the surface of the pandemic's collateral damage as reports surface about increases in drug overdoses, anxiety, depression, and the health declines of people fearful of routine check-ups, even disregarding serious symptoms of stroke and heart attack. With perpetual surges on the horizon and the threat of necessary future shutdowns, our failure to control the virus condemns vulnerable people like my sister to isolation, delayed medical care, and premature deaths of despair.\n\nRisks of recovery: With COVID-19, don't only focus on deaths. Too many Americans are alive and in misery.\n\nBefore leaving I cleaned and stocked the house with healthy food and 100 rolls of toilet paper. We organized Erica's room, but there's much more to do when I return to help prepare her space for the long winter. I clipped my sister's overgrown toenails and washed her feet. Scaly yellowish scabbing gave them a reptilian appearance. She laughed as I inadvertently tickled her feet. I laughed too, to keep from crying.\n\nI told her it wasn't too bad. And it wasn't. But it saddened me to return to the immobility of Erica's time in the body cast, when I'd scratch the itch she couldn't reach.\n\nI couldn't hug her before I left, having strictly masked and physically distanced from my family. I patted her arm. I didn't have time to say this before dashing to the airport:\n\nThe world doesn't love you, Erica. The pandemic has exposed how we devalue the lives of those we deem \"throwaway people,\" the poor, sick, disabled, old, immigrant, and minority. If our leadership cared we wouldn't allow more than 176,000 deaths and counting. But we've met many caring people, such as the patient immigrant cabdrivers that risked their own health by physically coming close to us to assist as you struggled into the taxi. We all need a little help sometimes, said the kind man who brought us home.\n\nI try to remember these helpers when pulled down by the unbearable weight of this situation. They remind me that it's often those with the least who help the most.\n\nErica, my love may be tough, but weary and not enough. I'm sorry for that. You're gentle, kind, and deserve much more than this world has given you. But I love you and will do everything I can to ensure you live in dignity, however long that is.",

    "COVID-19: Back-to-school plans fuel fear of spread in children, adults": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "A student gets his temperature checked by a teacher before entering a summer STEM camp at Wylie High School in Texas. Schools across the USA continue to plan on how to reopen schools this fall.\n\nAs many school districts across the USA prepare to reopen campuses, some fear classrooms will become the next incubators for large coronavirus outbreaks.\n\nAdvocates for resuming school in person, including President Donald Trump, have repeatedly claimed that children pose less of a risk of spreading COVID-19 and that the benefits of returning them to the classroom outweigh the risks of keeping them home.\n\nSuch statements have been used by conservatives, as well as many parents, to argue for a prompt reopening of classrooms.\n\n\"We know that children get the virus at a far lower rate than any other part of the population,\" U.S. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos said during a CNN interview in July. \"There's nothing in the data that suggests that kids being back in school is dangerous to them.\"\n\nThe evidence suggests otherwise.\n\nAbout 245,000 youth from birth to 17 have tested positive, according to the latest data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nHundreds have transmitted the virus at summer camps and youth programs that have welcomed kids, often with the kinds of hygiene, masking and physical distancing rules proposed by many schools.\n\nMore than 300 cases have been linked to state child care facilities in California, 62 in Pennsylvania and 54 in North Carolina, according to data published by those states.\n\nIn Georgia, at least 260 people became infected in June at an overnight youth camp where the median age of campers was 12 and staff members 17, according to a CDC report. The first person - a teenage staffer - became sick two days after the first weeklong camp session. Officials started sending campers home the next day and closed the camp by the end of the week.\n\nTest results were available for 344 camp attendees, the CDC reported. Among them, 76% tested positive.\n\nAlthough children account for 22% of the population, their share of coronavirus cases is just a fraction of that ratio - 7%.\n\nEven fewer kids get seriously ill. About 6 out of 100,000 school-age kids are hospitalized with COVID-19 compared with the overall rate of 130 people per 100,000, according to the latest data from the CDC. Most children who are infectious never experience the symptoms commonly seen in adults, such as fever, cough or shortness of breath.\n\nSome scientists worry that because kids are less likely to show symptoms, they are less likely to be tested and that the real rate of infection among youth could be much higher. Also, it's unknown how effectively children might spread the virus to both kids and adults.\n\nElizabeth Pathak, a population health scientist and president of the Coronavirus and Kids Education and Tracking Project, said the limited data available to researchers and parents is likely a drastic undercount.\n\n\"We know that the majority of kids who are infected have no symptoms whatsoever,\" she said. That means most children who are contagious never will be tested and might spread the virus to a vulnerable peer or adult.\n\n\"Unless you have a program where you are routinely and comprehensively testing people with no symptoms, you're going to miss the majority of cases of COVID-19 in kids,\" Pathak said.\n\nMost states do not report how many schools, child care facilities or youth programs have been linked to outbreaks.\n\nSeveral people who returned to school in the past week tested positive, including at least nine in Tennessee, six in Indiana, five in Mississippi and two in Kentucky, according to those school districts and health officials.\n\nJason Salemi, an epidemiologist and professor at the University of South Florida College of Public Health, said poor data collection and transparency mean he often can't even answer simple questions about how coronavirus spread among kids.\n\n\"We knew the discussion to open schools was going to come,\" he said, \"and we need comprehensive and consistent data across states to make those decisions.\"\n\nA study published last month by JAMA estimated that closing schools in March reduced the rate of new COVID-19 cases by 66%.\n\nThat meant about 1.4 million fewer people becoming ill and about 40,600 fewer people dying over the 26- and 16-day periods studied. The mathematical model weighted its results based on community demographics and other shutdown orders.\n\n\"Policymakers were hopeful that closing schools would curb the coronavirus epidemic, but that wasn't known,\" said lead study author Dr. Katherine Auger, an associate professor of pediatrics at the University of Cincinnati College of Medicine. \"We show that it actually did make a difference in cases and in deaths. That was a very important thing society did.\"\n\nAuger said the research, which has limitations as a modeling study, should not be misconstrued as proof that schools should never return to in-person instruction. Schools reopening would probably follow precautions that were not in place in the spring.\n\n\"It's not just about education. It's about other services schools offer,\" Auger said. \"We support families through our school system in this country. That is critically important infrastructure.\"\n\nThe cost to childhood development and to working families who rely on schools as affordable child care is worth the risk of reopening classrooms in places with low levels of community spread, some experts said.\n\n\"This is going to be a local decision that needs to be made. And it might have to be made over and over again as changes occur in infection rates,\" said Enriqueta Bond, who leads an advisory committee on reopening schools at the National Academies of Science and Engineering.\n\nStates have disagreed on whether to track outbreaks among kids as diligently as for other hot spots, such as nursing homes. Few state health departments share what they know about such cases with the public.\n\n\"Local health departments may identify outbreaks in these types of facilities during their investigations, but we are not tracking them at the state level or posting them to our website,\" Michigan Department of Health and Human Services public information officer Lynn Sutfin said in an email to USA TODAY. \"If there was an outbreak and public notification needed to occur, that would happen at the local level.\"\n\nIn Arkansas, health officials said they are discussing how best to share outbreak information this fall.\n\n\"We track outbreaks in all settings, but school has not started,\" public information officer Danyelle McNeill wrote. \"We are working to determine how we will present this information once schools are back in session.\"\n\nThe Arkansas Department of Human Services has tracked outbreaks in day care centers but has not shared that information with the public because \"no one has previously asked us for that data,\" spokesperson Amy Webb said.\n\nOfficials said it is against their policy to publicly identify the particular settings of any outbreak.\n\nIn contrast, Colorado reports the location of all outbreaks, including those at schools and child-centric facilities. Although the data does not separate cases into age groups, state officials report the number of \"attendees\" versus \"staff\" who contracted the virus.\n\n\"Our primary goal is to be as transparent as possible with our data while ensuring we're reporting accurate information to the public,\" the state Health Department wrote in an emailed response to questions.\n\nWithout better information about cases in kids, Pathak, the epidemiologist tracking cases nationwide, said it will be difficult to prevent large outbreaks that, inevitably, will result in severe complications or deaths for some children.\n\nFor every 2,381 kids who are infected, one will become sick enough to need intensive care, based on a study by Pathak and others that was published in the Journal of Public Health Management and Practice.\n\n\"Even though it's a low rate, if you talk about millions of kids getting infected, you're still going to have thousands of kids needing to go into the ICU,\" she said.\n\nThose risks are even higher for adults, especially those with underlying medical conditions such as diabetes, asthma or high blood pressure.\n\nThese are the risks that haunt Petal Cates, 16, of Charlotte, North Carolina, a high school student on the autism spectrum.\n\nCates said she has mixed feelings about her mom signing her up for remote digital school this fall.\n\nOn one hand, Cates misses her friends and wishes she could take driver's ed. She said face-to-face experience is the best way for her to learn about managing her anxiety and responding to certain social cues.\n\nOn the other hand, Cates worries about her mom, Rose, a widow who uses a wheelchair and is at higher risk of complications from COVID-19. She doesn't want to bring the virus home from school and get her sick.\n\n\"Until we have a vaccine, I won't go. I don't want to put my mom in danger,\" she said. \"There's a lot of germs around school, and janitors hardly clean the bathroom.\"\n\nRose Toth-Cates worries about her daughter's quality of education in online classes and the social development provided by in-person schooling.\n\nShe said she would encourage Petal to return to the classroom on three conditions: if the rate of community transmission was much lower than it is today, if the school reduced class sizes and if masks were mandated.\n\n\"I would risk it,\" she said. \"I feel like this is stealing her high school experience.\"",

    "COVID-19: Michigan college among 1st in U.S. to test campus living": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "SAULT STE. MARIE, Mich. -- Just before 10 a.m. Wednesday, Sophia Schiepek pulled her car, loaded down with some of the stuff needed to survive a year in a dorm room, into a parking lot driveway on the campus of Lake Superior State University.\n\nA little more than an hour later, all that stuff had made it up into her room, even if it was just stacked here and there instead of tucked away in the back seat or trunk.\n\nThat's nothing new. Students have been coming to Lake State -- Michigan's smallest public university -- since the 1940s. While the styles of cars dropping off the students have evolved over the years, much of the process remains unchanged.\n\nUntil this year.\n\nAs universities across the U.S. welcome students back to campus during a pandemic, they are shaking up how they handle move-in and the hoops students have to jump through to get on campus. Out: A pile of bodies all trying to squeeze through the same dorm door while balancing suitcases and posters. In: Carefully orchestrated periods of time when just one student has access to the entranceway. And don't forget to stick a swab up your nose for a COVID-19 test before you do any unloading.\n\nLake State started moving in first-year students in late July. This week, returning students are moving onto the campus in Sault Ste. Marie in Michigan's Upper Peninsula, overlooking the St. Mary's River and the Soo Locks.\n\nClasses start Monday. The move-in and start were moved up as part of the university's reaction to the COVID pandemic. The early start puts Lake Superior State students among the earliest non-athlete students to arrive on a college campus in the nation and the first public university in Michigan to begin the fall semester.\n\nLake Superior State made the choice in mid-June to return this fall to face-to-face instruction, while moving up dates.\n\nOther than a one-day break, school will be in session from Monday into November, keeping students on campus. The university is touting it as a get-here-stay-here philosophy, said Provost Lynn Gillette.\n\n\"We had very strong interest from our students for face-to-face instruction,\" he said, standing in the parking lot as move-in started. \"We are prepping all the classrooms so we get social distancing. We're requiring everyone to wear masks -- we're going to be pretty heavy on that.\"\n\nAbout 10% of the university's classes are normally offered online. This semester is up a little bit to 13%. In order to keep classes face-to-face, the school is converting every possible space into classrooms and spreading out chairs. The chairs not being used are being stacked in the back of classrooms to give visual clues about the differences this year.\n\nThe low number of coronavirus cases in the rural area surrounding the college is helping the efforts to get back to face-to-face instruction. Lake State is located about an hour north of the Mackinac Bridge and several hours away from various hot spots in Michigan. As of Thursday evening, 37 cases had been reported in Chippewa County, where the university is located, according to the county website. School officials said they factored the number of cases into their decision.\n\nAlso factoring into the decision to bring back students was that a majority are first-generation college enrollees and a large proportion are low-income. Students would likely lack access to high-speed internet, making online classes even more challenging.\n\nAs Schiepek, a 19-year-old sophomore studying environmental sciences, pulled into the parking lot, she was greeted by a college staffer, who checked her name off against a list of students scheduled to check-in.\n\nOn Wednesday, waves of students were set to arrive at 9 a.m., 11 a.m. and 1 p.m. The university moved in 311 students last week and hundreds more were scheduled to move in this week. About 2,000 students are enrolled at the school.\n\nAfter getting cleared, Schiepek drove down the length of a long parking lot and looped around a sign with a student sitting next to it, joining one of three lanes.\n\nAt the end of the lot were three large tents. Half of each tent was taken up by long tables with computers, forms and COVID-19 tests stacked on them. The other half of each tent was for vehicles to drive into.\n\nParty killers: Colleges hope new rules will slow COVID-19 spread, students aren't convinced\n\nSchiepek pulled in, putting a mask over her face as she rolled down her window. A masked staffer approached the car and began asking a series of questions about Schiepek's health, wanting to know whether she was experiencing any COVID-related symptoms or had been around anyone with the illness.\n\nAs the staffer walked back over to the tables to get a COVID test, another masked staffer walked about with the normal move-in information -- a map of campus, a temporary parking permit for Schiepek and an extra one for her mom who was helping her move. There were also the keys to Schiepek's room and some unusual move-in paraphernalia -- a selection of Lake State branded masks. Schiepek got to pick out two.\n\nThen she was ready for the test, which is voluntary for students. She inserted a long swab into her nostril and then took it out. As she did, her eyes watered and she rubbed her nose. The staffer assured her that was normal and said some students have been sneezing after taking the tests, which provide quick results. As of Wednesday morning, none of the tests had come back positive, school officials said.\n\nThe tests done, Schiepek drove across the street to parking lot O, where she waited a couple of minutes for the student in front of her to finish unloading. Then she drove up to the door and was joined by her mom, who was driving a small SUV full of needed supplies.\n\nUp and down the stairs they went, carrying in clothes, plants, a mini-refrigerator, a trombone and everything else needed to live at school.\n\nSchiepek is living in a suite of rooms with seven other people. There's a big common area, with couches and chair, a table and other furniture. There's a large shared bathroom off that room toward the front of the suite. In the back are four rooms, each designed to have two people in it. Beds in those rooms can be bunked or separated.\n\n'The virus beat us': Colleges are increasingly going online for fall 2020 semester as COVID-19 cases rise\n\n\"It's going to be interesting,\" Schiepek said of the coming year. \"I'm interested to see what everything looks like -- is it just going to look like a Plexiglas prison?\"\n\nSchiepek said she didn't want to do an online semester, especially after having to go online last spring while on campus.\n\n\"My roommate left like right away when we went online, so I was just alone in my room,\" she said. \"I had taken some online classes in high school, so I knew it didn't work for me.\"\n\nShe's not too worried about being around other students.\n\n\"We're old enough to be conscious of what needs to be done,\" she said. \"I'm excited to see my friends. I haven't seen them in person in months.\"\n\nWhile Lake State had deep cleaned residence halls, that didn't stop people from doing their own wiping down when they arrived.\n\nJunior Rebecca Weipert and her parents did just that when they got to campus Wednesday.\n\n\"It's stressful to send them into something you don't know if it's truly safe or not. We know it's not 100 % safe,\" William Weipert said. \"We're excited for her to get to her halfway point, but we're equally as nervous about her having to do it this way.\"\n\nThis year Weipert brought extra masks and supplies for her own room. She has one of her five classes online due to the class size.\n\n\"A lot of students are saying they think that it's going to go back online because people aren't going to follow the rules,\" she said. \"I really hope it doesn't happen. It's hard to learn online especially with certain classes. That's why we're here, to learn and get the full potential of every class to get that kind of education.\"",

More than 182,000 Americans have been killed by the disease.\n\nThe hasty reopening of businesses across much of the nation after the spring shutdown was largely blamed for a summer surge in infections, but social functions of various sizes among relatives, friends and co-workers may have been a contributing factor as well.\n\nPublic health experts sound the alarm as the Labor Day weekend approaches.\n\n\"People don't think of it in the same way as the (President) Trump rally in Tulsa, a bunch of people on the beach or in the bars, but these small events add up to a lot. It's just invisible,\" said Dr. Peter Chin-Hong, a professor of medicine at the University of California-San Francisco who specializes in infectious diseases.\n\nThere's no generally accepted definition of what's a small gathering - it may range from five to 30 people - and the majority of these activities take place behind closed doors. That makes it difficult to garner hard data about them.\n\nDouble trouble: Coronavirus Watch: Evacuating from Hurricane Laura amid COVID-19\n\nIn late July, Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan said contact tracing revealed 44% of those testing positive for the virus in the state reported attending a family activity and 23% a house party, but the size of the events was not specified.\n\nPlenty of anecdotal evidence supports the notion that getting together with people outside the immediate household, even in fairly limited numbers, can lead to a rash of infections. Chin-Hong said several of the COVID-19 patients he treated believe they caught the virus at barbecues.\n\nWeddings have been more troublesome, including a 100-guest event in San Francisco in early July that resulted in at least 10 people contracting the virus, among them the bride and groom.\n\nSmaller events, such as family, office and graduation parties, have yielded COVID-19 cases as well.\n\nIn Alabama, eight of 11 relatives who went to a lake house together in July tested positive for the coronavirus.\n\nIn the Washington, D.C., area, the host of a backyard dinner in June for about 25 came down with COVID-19, as did some of her guests.\n\nAnd in Houston, seven members of a family that went out for a Fathers' Day meal developed COVID-19.\n\nEducation issues: Chaos reigns in some schools with in-person learning. Many kids learn at home\n\n\"Small gatherings are a concern because there's so many of them. They may account for a much greater proportion of the cases than we think right now,'' said Dr. George Rutherford, a colleague of Chin-Hong's at UCSF and the principal investigator for California's contact tracing program.\n\nRutherford emphasized the need for those planning to attend or host functions on Labor Day weekend to practice social distancing and wear masks as much as possible, but he's even more wary of what may be in store after Thanksgiving.\n\nExtended families traditionally convene on that holiday, often after traveling from far away, and sit around for long stretches, be it eating or watching NFL games on TV. The dinners are almost always held indoors, where limited ventilation makes it easier to contract the virus.\n\n\"Everybody's going to be there with their belts undone and the top button off their pants, snoring and laying without masks on watching football in some tiny little den,\" Rutherford said. \"It's not a pretty picture. There could be a lot of transmission. And Christmas is going to be exactly the same. It's unfortunate, but this is not the year for family gatherings.\"\n\nGiven human nature, it's nearly impossible to prevent them.\n\nMatt Lambert, an emergency room physician based in Washington, D.C., said he would advise against any gatherings bigger than 25 people, small enough for the hosts to inquire about symptoms before the event.\n\nThose seeking to congregate for special occasions could take extreme measures, like a couple Lambert heard of who held their wedding at a zoo, where the staff enforced distancing regulations.\n\n\"We're not made that way,\" Lambert said. \"You get extended loved ones together, especially at a wedding, and there's going to be some hugging going on.\"\n\nLambert said he has treated patients who contracted the virus at a dinner with only eight participants, although he noted the party was held indoors and guests sat close to each other.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization posted guidelines for gatherings, and Chin-Hong said relatively safe barbecues can be held if the hosts and guests take precautions.\n\nHe pointed out that, besides mask usage, the main determinants of risk when people assemble are the size of the group, the type and duration of the activity, where it's held (indoors or outdoors), whether alcohol is served, whether there is shouting or singing and how well participants know each other.\n\nChin-Hong suggested inviting no more than two or three groups, each from a single household, and having them stay in their own \"pods,\" at least 6 feet apart from the other participants. The event should be outdoors, hand sanitizer should be readily available, and either a host wearing a mask should serve the food, or the members of each pod could serve themselves while maintaining distance from the rest. Anybody using the bathroom should wear a mask.\n\n\"It's fine to have a barbecue if you do it in a modest way and think about these risk aspects of keeping the pods apart from each other,\" Chin-Hong said. \"I'm not against barbecues at all, but you can make it safer by not having a big event. Don't try to have a class reunion barbecue right now.\"",

    "COVID-19: Students push back against colleges' coronavirus tracking": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "DETROIT -- Special police patrols in student-heavy neighborhoods. Smartphone apps monitoring location inside a bubble. Daily check-in forms.\n\nAs hundreds of thousands of students arrive back on campuses across the country, college and university administrators are greeting them with a variety of methods to monitor behavior and discourage large gatherings, all in an effort to keep the students healthy and on campus.\n\nNotre Dame and the University of North Carolina have recently shut down face-to-face instruction after large gatherings led to COVID clusters. Syracuse University's leaders last week said large gatherings had left the school on the verge of shutting down and going online-only.\n\nEven as administrators are coming up with plans, students are pushing back, saying they are invasions of privacy.\n\nThey've seen some success. At Oakland University, a plan to mandate all students wear BioButtons was changed to strongly recommend wearing the health tracker after student complaints.\n\n\"Many students are already hesitant, at best, to be tracked as they stay on campus (and as they leave for the weekend to visit home, go to class, grocery shop, etc.),\" a petition from Oakland students that garnered more than 2,400 signatures this summer said. \"Masks and socially distancing are understandable ... but this seems like a large overreach in terms of student and staff privacy.\"\n\nThe BioButton is worn by the user and connected to an app on a smartphone. It constantly measures heart rate and temperature, among other things.\n\n\"We are strongly encouraging a BioButton to be worn because it enhances our broader strategy to monitor the safety of OU's campus,\" Oakland's website said. \"We believe it is among the many ways we are keeping you and others safe. However, even if you don't want to wear the BioButton, there is value in carrying it with you when you are on campus because it can assist with contact tracing.\"\n\nColleges and coronavirus: Colleges need COVID-19 tests to reopen, scientists say. Some don't have much of a plan.\n\nThe BioButton is designed to work as a screening tool for Oakland, said David Stone, Oakland's chief research officer and a professor of health sciences and philosophy.\n\nIt will monitor the wearer's breathing rate, heart rate and temperature when the person is at rest. Using artificial intelligence, it will see when there's a pattern of changes that could indicate an infection. People on campus will also have to answer a series of screening questions each day.\n\nOnce a day, the system will send Oakland a screen noting the person is green -- OK to be on campus -- or red, meaning follow-up from the school's health services is needed. It will send similar updates every 6 hours to the individual user through an app on their phone.\n\nCoronavirus and schools: New cases are emerging. How much you know depends on where you live.\n\n\"All the university will see is the cleared/not cleared status,\" Stone said. The school will not see the actual data from an user.\n\nThe button won't track location but will know when it is around another user wearing a button. That's useful in contact tracing. The school hopes the button will help them not have big outbreaks that some other schools are seeing.\n\nSome universities are going with less intrusive monitoring apps.\n\nAt the University of Tennessee, students on campus will be required to \"self-screen\" for COVID-19 symptoms each day before leaving their dorms using an app that asks questions about their temperature, any symptoms and if they have been exposed to anyone who is known to have COVID-19. Faculty and staff are also required to do this when they are on campus.\n\nAt Ohio State University, students and employees will be required to report their body temperature and health status through a mobile app before coming on campus each day.\n\nWhen students at Michigan's Albion College first heard about being required to download an app before coming onto campus, they thought it was just an easy way to schedule COVID-19 tests and then get the results.\n\nIt wasn't long before they learned they had to also turn on a location tracker, which monitors when they leave a several-mile bubble.\n\n\"I felt betrayed by Albion,\" said junior Alexis De La Cruz, an economic major in quarantine at Albion, waiting for her COVID test to come back. \"It's like Albion doesn't trust us to practice social distancing.\"\n\nAbout 97% of the school's students live on campus.\n\nThe app is part of the small liberal arts college's multiprong approach to the semester, which includes lots of education for students, said Mathew Johnson, the school's new president. The app allows the school to push out educational material to students, but also includes a geotracking feature, built to help with contact tracing.\n\nIt also notifies the school when a student leaves a predefined boundary, which is about a 4.5-mile circle around the campus, about 95 miles west of Detroit.\n\nThe boundary includes the entire city, meaning students can leave campus. It also includes a nature area and other nearby spots.\n\nCOVID-19, visas, Trump: International students turning away from US colleges for lots of reasons\n\nIf a student wants to leave the bubble boundary, they can apply for a waiver.\n\nDe La Cruz says she has seen friends be denied to work outside of the bubble. She also says it will be tough to see her family during the school year.\n\nIf a student leaves without permission, their student ID is deactivated, which means they can't get back into college buildings. In order to get it reactivated, the student would have to speak with a staff member. That conversation would be educational and also to make sure the student practiced safe social distancing and mask wearing, Johnson said. If there were repeated violations, the student could go through the normal student justice system, which includes due process. It could lead to a suspension or more.\n\nSeveral schools in Michigan are using some sort of app to monitor students' health. For example, at Eastern Michigan University, student workers were set up at the entrance of buildings during summer school and will be again during fall classes. Anyone coming in will have to show on their smartphone how they completed the form; paper forms will also be available.\n\nParent Michael Coleman, 53, of Ypsilanti has a son at Eastern and a daughter at Albion. He wonders what will happen with all the data being collected.\n\n\"Is there some database somewhere that someone can hack and get all the data?\" he asked. \"I understand they want to keep everyone safe, but it seems like they are starting to go overboard.\"\n\nIn Ann Arbor, the University of Michigan isn't relying just on technology. The school is also sending police officers -- both from the university and the city -- into student-heavy neighborhoods.\n\nThe Ann Arbor Police Department said it is teaming up with U-M students, staff, faculty and volunteers to patrol campus and neighborhoods around the university to \"serve as a visible presence and reminder to students and other community members of the need to follow public health guidance,\" the department said in a tweet.\n\nIt comes as the Washtenaw County Health Department tightens restrictions on the number of people who are allowed to gather outdoors in the cities of Ann Arbor and Ypsilanti, home to U-M and Eastern, respectively.\n\n\"COVID-19, large gatherings and harmful alcoholic behavior are all concerns this year,\" the police department tweeted.\n\n\"It's not really an extension of the police or something,\" U-M President Mark Schlissel told the student newspaper, The Michigan Daily, in a recent interview. \"So, you'll undoubtedly forget on some occasions to pull your mask over your face as you walk from some part that's off campus onto campus, or as you rush out of your apartment or a student rushes out of their dorm room. So, these are people that are just going to remind you, and we're hoping that a lot of enforcement really comes from changing norms.\n\n\"Students who fail to come into compliance when they're partying in town after multiple admonitions and many different tiered levels of reminders ultimately will be brought into the student code pathway or receive a citation that will be very expensive to them,\" Schlissel said. \"But that's the last resort.\"",

        "body": "Temperature checks are becoming the new normal as schools, businesses and offices attempt to reopen safely while in the midst of a pandemic.\n\nBut as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimated last month that nearly 40% of COVID-19 patients are asymptomatic and experts suspect only half of symptomatic patients exhibit a fever, is this cumbersome practice really keeping anyone safe from the coronavirus?\n\nMost schools and office buildings are using non-contact thermals scanners or thermometers. While the device allows someone to measure temperature at a safe distance, experts say there are obvious limitations.\n\nOne is the scanner can only read surface body temperature, which can be inaccurate when determining if someone has a fever.\n\n\"If somebody was out in the heat for a long time, their surface body temperature might read that they have a fever when they don't have one,\" said Dr. Natasha Bhuyan, a family physician in Phoenix, Arizona.\n\nDr. Anthony Fauci, director of National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said in a Facebook Live broadcast with the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center last week the White House and the National Institutes have abandoned temperature checks as they're \"notoriously inaccurate.\"\n\n\"We have found at the NIH, that it's much, much better to just question people when they come in and save time,\" he said.\n\nWhile office buildings and government agencies are certainly a concern, public health experts also worry about schools as they begin to reopen for in-person learning in some parts of the country.\n\nA study published Thursday in the Journal of Pediatrics found children who tested positive for COVID-19 had significantly higher levels of virus in their airways than hospitalized adults in intensive care units.\n\n'Silent spreaders' of COVID-19: Kids who seem healthy may be more contagious than sick adults, study says\n\nWhen should I get my flu shot this year?: Everything to know about flu season during the coronavirus pandemic\n\nResearchers at Massachusetts General Hospital and Massachusetts General Hospital for Children also discovered only half of the children who tested positive had a fever.\n\n\"How likely are you to pick up every case of COVID? The answer is only 50% of the time,\" said Dr. Roberta DeBiasi, chief of Pediatric Infectious Diseases at Children's Hospital in Washington D.C.\n\nDoctors say temperature checks should be treated as one of the many tools in the COVID toolbox. While they can detect fever, they should also be paired with additional screening methods and prevention tactics such as monitoring for other symptoms, mask wearing, social distancing and frequent hand washing.\n\n\"Certainly kids with fever shouldn't be going to school, but just because the kid isn't presenting a fever doesn't mean they don't have the coronavirus,\" said Dr. Len Horovitz, a pulmonary specialists at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City.\n\nFollow Adrianna Rodriguez on Twitter: @AdriannaUSAT.",

    "COVID: Dallas mom transmits coronavirus to unborn baby in the womb": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "Wendy Figueroa turned over on her bed to look at the empty crib and began to cry. She cried every night for 20 days straight after giving birth to her daughter, Alexa.\n\nHer newborn remained at Parkland Hospital in Dallas, fighting off a SARS-CoV-2 infection her mother transmitted to her while she was in the womb - one of the first such cases to be recorded in the United States.\n\nWendy was admitted to the hospital with a fever, headache and gastrointestinal symptoms April 30, and tested positive for COVID-19. Two days later, baby Alexa was born.\n\n\"They showed her to me from a distance and then took her away,\" she said. \"It's hard to carry a baby for nine months and when they're born, you can't even cradle them ... It's hard for a mother.\"\n\nTwenty-four hours after Alexa was born, she also tested positive for COVID-19. Doctors confirmed her diagnosis the next day with a second test.\n\nTheir case was published July 10 in The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal. Dr. Amanda Evans, a pediatric infectious diseases expert at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, who oversaw the case study, said the virus was detected in the mother's placenta, leading experts to believe Alexa was infected before she was born.\n\n\"Even if the baby had been exposed to mom's secretions or bodily fluids on the way out of the birth canal, that likely would not have affected the placental tissue,\" she said.\n\nAlexa began presenting symptoms - a fever and some trouble breathing - within 24 hours after she was born, which further contributes to the argument that she may have been infected in the womb and not during birth, as studies suggest the earliest babies may present COVID-19 symptoms is about 48 hours after infection, Evans said.\n\nDr. Mambarambath Jaleel, a neonatal doctor at UT Southwestern and medical director of the neonatal intensive care unit at Parkland Hospital, also ruled out transmission via respiratory droplets because Alexa was immediately separated from her mother at birth.\n\nAlthough Alexa was born premature at about 35 weeks and briefly required oxygen, she recovered from the virus without any complications, Jaleel said.\n\nHowever, Wendy didn't take her baby home until 20 days after she was born. She spent six days in the hospital video calling staff every three and a half hours to watch Alexa feed on her bottle.\n\n\"Seeing her through a camera, it's not the same,\" she said. \"I would cry watching my little girl through the camera because I would say, 'I can't have my little girl.'\"\n\nWhen Wendy was discharged from the hospital, she spent another 14 days at home in quarantine before she was able to bring Alexa home. While she didn't receive a negative COVID-19 test, doctors believed Alexa was no longer shedding the virus.\n\n\"She didn't need any additional supportive care in the intensive care unit,\" Jaleel said. \"She was healthy, stable, ready to go home to meet her mother.\"\n\nWendy's husband, her two daughters and her son were eager to see Alexa, as no one was allowed to visit her at the hospital. Wendy couldn't put into words the happiness she felt when she finally got the call to pick up her baby girl.\n\nCDC study: Pregnant women with COVID-19 are 5 times more likely to be hospitalized\n\nIt was one of the hardest experiences of her life. She never expected her pregnancy to take such a turn, especially because she left the house only for doctor visits, always wore a mask and none of her family members tested positive for the virus.\n\n\"That's why I want to tell everyone who's pregnant to take care of themselves, try to take care as much as you can, because it's so difficult,\" she said.\n\nJaleel said it's rare for newborns to become infected with the virus. According to the doctor, only six babies have tested positive for COVID-19 at Parkland Hospital out of the 128 mothers who contracted the infection at some point during their pregnancy. He added that the babies recovered without any complications.\n\nHowever, he said pregnant women are considered immunocompromised and have a higher risk of contracting COVID-19. A study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, published in June, found that pregnant women were five times more likely to be hospitalized from COVID-19.\n\n\"It's a very infectious virus and gets transmitted very rapidly,\" he said. \"Try to avoid contact with people as much as possible, especially in the last few weeks of pregnancy.\"\n\nFollow Adrianna Rodriguez on Twitter: @AdriannaUSAT.",

        "authors": [],
        "body": "You don't need an MD or PhD to get involved in the global quest to find a safe and effective vaccine for COVID-19.\n\nScientific companies and institutions are searching for tens of thousands of people to participate in their vaccine trials. The faster researchers prove their vaccine is safe, the faster it can be widely distributed potentially avoiding thousands of illnesses and deaths, and enabling people to get back to socializing, working in offices and enjoying movie theaters, bars and gyms.\n\nVaccination is the only way to stop a pandemic like this - with a virus that is extremely contagious and infectious before symptoms show up, if they ever do.\n\nThree candidate vaccines have started Phase 3 trials in the U.S. If all seven candidate vaccines now funded by the federal government make it to Phase 3, they will need a combined total of at least 210,000 volunteers.\n\nHere's information about the various vaccine and treatment trials, and how to volunteer.\n\nAs of Aug. 28, the Moderna COVE study has enrolled more than 17,000 people and has testing sites all over the country. Researchers are looking for healthy participants who are over 18 years old, at high-risk of COVID-19 infection and have never had prior exposure to any vaccine or treatments for COVID-19.\n\nParticipants will have two injection visits, which will happen on the first day and one month later, as well as follow-up visits and phone calls over the next two years. Each participant has a 50% chance of receiving the study vaccine and 50% of receiving the placebo but won't know which one they received until the trial ends in two years.\n\nParticipants will also be asked to complete electronic diary entries reporting any COVID019 symptoms during the study.\n\nHere's where you can sign up and volunteer.\n\nResearchers are looking for healthy adults 18 to 85 years old who are not pregnant and have not been previously diagnosed with COVID-19 to participate in this study.\n\nParticipants will receive two injections about three weeks apart and will be asked to record and report any changes in health over time. To do this, they'll be given an electronic diary or download a secure app on their phone.\n\nThey will also be asked to attend four additional study visits over two years after the last injection. Participants will be reimbursed for expenses and time related to completing the e-diary such as parking, meals and travel.\n\nHere's where you can sign up and volunteer.\n\nResearchers are looking for 30,000 participants to take part in the study. Participants must be at least 18 years old or older, in good or stable health, have an increased risk of getting COVID-19 and not had a previously confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19.\n\nThis study has three parts: screening, study treatment and follow-up. After visiting the center to learn more during the screening process, participants will be randomly assigned to receive two injections of either the investigational vaccine or the placebo four weeks apart. There's twice as much chance of receiving the candidate vaccine than the placebo.\n\nThe follow-up will take place over the course of two years where participants will visit the study center up to six times for assessments. They should also expect regular phone calls, emails and text messages asking about symptoms of COVID-19.\n\nHere's where you can sign up and volunteer.\n\nCompanies and institutions across the nation are not only looking at a COVID-19 vaccine, but they're also studying treatment and prevention methods as well.\n\nVelocity Clinical Research has joined the quest in recruiting potential volunteers who want to take part in current or future COVID-19 prevention clinical trials. The only requirement is that the participant must be 18 years or older.\n\nResearch coordinators will then reach out to answer any questions and to see if that person is suitable for any active or upcoming studies.\n\nHere's where you can sign up and volunteer.\n\nWhy volunteer for a vaccine clinical trial?: Duty, love and a willingness to experiment, participants say\n\nReport: Coronavirus vaccine shouldn't be first-come, first-served\n\nUC Health, located in Cincinnati, Ohio, is currently enrolling participants for multiple clinical trials designed to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines. Interested parties must complete a brief study and a research coordinator will reach out to see if they're eligible for enrollment.\n\nOn top of vaccine trials, UC Health is also in the process of enrolling participants for a wide array of treatment trials. This includes convalescent plasma trials as both a treatment and prevention method, nebulizer treatments, antivirals, immunosuppressants and even a high blood pressure medication.

    "COVID: Vaping linked to increased risk of coronavirus infection": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "A new study has found that vaping is linked to an elevated risk of COVID-19 among teenagers and young adults, providing more evidence of the harmful effects of electronic cigarettes.\n\nAccording to the study, led by researchers at Stanford University of Medicine and published Tuesday in the peer-reviewed Journal of Adolescent Health, teens and young adults who vape are five times more likely to become infected with the coronavirus compared with those who did not use e-cigarettes. Those who both vaped and traditionally smoked were nearly seven times more likely to become infected.\n\n\"Young people may believe their age protects them from contracting the virus or that they will not experience symptoms of COVID-19, but the data show this isn't true among those who vape,\" said the study's lead author, Shivani Mathur Gaiha.\n\nStanford researchers looked at surveys completed by more than 4,300 participants between the ages of 13 to 24 who lived throughout the country, including the District of Columbia and three U.S. territories.\n\nResults adjusted for a host of confounding factors including age, sex, race, ethnicity, LGBTQ status, education, body mass index, compliance with shelter-in-place orders and state positivity rates for COVID-19.\n\nThe survey asked participants whether they had ever used vaping devices or combustible cigarettes, as well as whether they had vaped or smoked in the past 30 days. They were then asked whether they had experienced COVID-19 symptoms, were tested or had received a positive diagnosis after being tested.\n\nYoung people who had used both cigarettes and e-cigarettes in the previous month were almost five times as likely to experience COVID-19 symptoms such as coughing, fever, tiredness and difficulty breathing, which the study concedes may explain why they were also more likely to receive testing.\n\nDr. Sunil Sharma, chief of pulmonary, critical care, and sleep medicine at West Virginia University Medicine, said that while more testing in this population could contribute to an increase in positive diagnoses, the study's results are consistent with previously published literature on vaping and decreased immunity.\n\n\"At least hypothetically, it goes along with what we have learned about e-cigarettes,\" he said. \"These do harm the lungs and, in some way, (harming) the lungs translates to reduced immunity to infection and that could certainly mean more propensity for COVID-19.\"\n\nDr. Bonnie Halpern-Felsher, the study's senior author and a professor of pediatrics at Stanford University School of Medicine, speculates that it's not just a compromised immune system that makes this population susceptible to the disease. She said teens and young adults tend to share their e-cigarettes, which can spread the virus.\n\n\"Most of the participants were sheltering in place, but they may be in the backyard with a few friends sharing their vaping device,\" she said.\n\nVaping also violates one of the cardinal rules of the pandemic: Don't touch your face. Vapers could be transferring the virus from their hands to their face every time they bring the device to their mouth. And inhaling offers a direct pathway for the virus to enter the respiratory tract.\n\nE-cigarettes also produce an aerosol, which may contain virus microdroplets that get carried further than 6 feet.\n\nDr. Sharon McGrath-Morrow, pediatric pulmonologist at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, said doctors are on high alert as the vaping epidemic and coronavirus pandemic converges into a diagnosis nightmare.\n\nSmoking, vaping in casinos: Why are Arizona casinos still open despite experts saying they're high-risk during COVID-19 spike?\n\nFact check: Are smokers at less risk for contracting the coronavirus?\n\nSome of her patients have arrived to her office with respiratory symptoms thinking they have the coronavirus when they really had EVALI, the newly identified lung disease linked to vaping. EVALI was first recognized in August 2019 by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and stands for e-cigarette or vaping product use-associated lung injury.\n\n\"It makes it difficult to know right away what you're dealing with,\" she said. \"Are you dealing with COVID-19 or are you dealing with EVALI?\"\n\nAs of Feb. 18, vaping-related lung injuries have been associated with more than 2,800 hospitalizations and 68 deaths in the U.S., according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\n\"(The vaping epidemic) is not something we really have a handle on and now we have another new disease which we have lesser idea and both of them have connections to respiratory injury,\" Sharma said.\n\nIn addition to warning about the dangers of vaping, study researchers hope their findings will prompt the Food and Drug Administration to further tighten regulations governing how vaping products are sold to young people.\n\n\"We need to tell everyone: If you are a vaper, you are putting yourself at risk for COVID-19 and other lung disease,\" Halpern-Felsher said.\n\nFollow Adrianna Rodriguez on Twitter: @AdriannaUSAT.",

    "California, Colorado, Washington grapple with wildfires and a pandemic": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "District Chief Paul Duarte's team, the first to reach the Pine Gulch fire as it began spreading across western Colorado about three weeks ago, put months of planning to the test as they prepared to battle their first major wildfire under pandemic conditions.\n\nFirst, they were screened for COVID-19 symptoms as the blaze, which became the second-largest in state history, ripped through the rough terrain near Grand Junction.\n\nInstead of assembling in a \"circus tent,\" crews checked in online and received briefings over the radio. Each unit camped together in the field, rather than hundreds of responders establishing a shared base camp. Meals were delivered to each \"spike camp,\" replacing large communal gatherings.\n\n\"The biggest change in the process has really been about the things that attract big groups of people -- getting food, supplies, camps and briefings,\" said Duarte, an operations section chief with the Colorado Department of Public Safety.\n\nSo far, leaders battling blazes across the West say they're holding their own, despite the pandemic. Some adjustments to COVID-19 are proving more effective than previous tactics. But as more fires erupt in California and elsewhere, responders are bracing for a long battle that will force them to revamp time-tested strategies on the fly.\n\n\"We're building the bridge as we cross it,\" said George Geissler, Washington state forester and deputy supervisor for wildfire.\n\nWashington Gov. Jay Inslee, a Democrat, last week declared a state of emergency in response to ongoing wildfires and hot, dry conditions that are likely to lead to more. The declaration allows the state to use aviation resources from the National Guard to help fight fires.\n\nCalifornia wildfires: Striking photos from wildfires show homes, boats engulfed in flames\n\nNo state has been hit harder than California, where nearly 800,000 acres burned last week, forcing the evacuation of tens of thousands of residents and fouling the air quality in much of the state.\n\nWhen it comes to on-the-ground firefighting tactics, officials in several states say not much has changed. It's in the staging areas, where firefighters used to assemble by the hundreds for meals, briefings and camping, that everything looks different.\n\n\"I think we're just as effective as we were before because our tactics haven't changed,\" said Lucas Spelman, battalion chief of southern operations for California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CalFire). \"But there may be a point where we don't have the amount of people we'd like to put on those fires.\"\n\nCalFire has about 12,000 employees, and only 33 have tested positive for COVID-19 since the pandemic began.\n\nThe state is missing workers from inmate crews, because of early releases and COVID-19 outbreaks in prisons. Currently, 106 of California's 192 inmate crews are staffed. The state usually has more than 2,000 inmates available to fight fires, but that number has dropped by more than 500 this year.\n\nCalifornia has about 7,000 firefighters deployed. Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, announced in July that the state would hire more than 800 temporary firefighters, and most of those workers now have joined the ranks.\n\nLike many states, California's strategy this year involves an aggressive early response, trying to squelch fires quickly in the hopes that will prevent some from becoming large blazes. The fewer massive fires, the fewer large camps will be required, lessening COVID-19 risk.\n\n\"Initial attack is happening much sooner,\" said Brad Alexander, spokesperson for the California Governor's Office of Emergency Services, which oversees and coordinates with local response agencies. \"Hopefully we can cut off these fire events a lot earlier.\"\n\nAlexander said the state was fortunate that COVID-19 hit earlier in the year, giving officials time to prepare for fire season under new conditions. Another silver lining is that the pandemic has created strong lines of communication between state agencies and county leaders who respond to emergencies. But as more fires spring up, California knows it will continue to be tested.\n\n\"With these lightning storms, there's tons of fires burning right now and it's starting to impact our ability to deal with them,\" CalFire's Spelman said. \"It's going to be a long fire season.\"\n\nNew ways of working prompted by the pandemic have some upsides.\n\nIn Colorado, firefighters have found that assembling small camps in the field, as opposed to regrouping en masse further from the fire line each evening, has saved hours of travel and briefing time each day. Food and supplies are delivered to each spike camp daily.\n\n\"We gain a lot by keeping people spiked close to where they're working,\" Duarte said. \"There's some opportunities we're going to find due to this and become more efficient in the long run. It's been pretty astonishing how well it's worked up to this point.\"\n\nThe state also has used more aviation resources to hit fires early, hoping to prevent massive blazes that require a large assembly of firefighters.\n\n\"We're hitting fires that are small and trying to keep them small,\" said Phil Daniels, deputy chief of Colorado's Wildland Fire Management Section. \"Our number of large fires is lower than it could have been.\"\n\nOregon and Washington likewise have deployed more helicopters and planes to fight fires this year. Geissler, the state forester, said the strategy has been successful, but noted attacking fires from the air creates additional risk. Aviation units also are very expensive, but some state officials believe they could be more cost-effective in the long run if they prevent large fires from spreading across the landscape.\n\n\"There's an argument that suppressing big fires could save money,\" Geissler said. \"If we had a lot more aircraft, we could keep the fires small all the time. We're learning a lot this year about what the risk-reward challenge is.\"\n\nSome firefighters in Washington have been housed in nearby hotels instead of camps, which crews have welcomed and which could become a long-term strategy. Even before COVID-19, it was common for other illnesses to spread widely in fire camps, a phenomenon known as \"camp crud.\" The spread-out approach to this year's camps could be a model for avoiding that issue in the future, Geissler said.\n\nAt Oregon's Mosier Creek fire, the state's first large-scale deployment this year, fire camps were kept off-limits to visitors as crews staged earlier this month. Crews camped in modules of about 10 people, and everything from meals to showers was reconfigured to limit exposure. The state has so far avoided any outbreaks among its teams.\n\nHave we made progress? Activists see progress after George Floyd's death but say more must be done\n\nSo far, leaders in the West say they've avoided their worst nightmare: a COVID-19 outbreak that takes hundreds of firefighters out of commission. Colorado has not had any of its firefighters test positive, and Washington has had only a handful of cases, including one in which 14 firefighters had to quarantine after a potential exposure.\n\n\"It's not the hundreds and hundreds of cases that we were concerned about early on,\" Geissler said. \"To date, everything has been kept manageable.\"\n\nHe added that state and county health officials have worked to turn around firefighters' COVID-19 test results quickly, but if there are delays later in the season, it could create problems for the state.\n\nColorado has conducted mass testing for firefighters when they leave camp, seeking to ensure they don't bring the virus back to their home communities.\n\nWhile COVID-19 has not yet decimated states' wildfire response, officials know they're not close to being done with wildfire season or the pandemic.\n\nJim Gersbach, public information officer for the Oregon Department of Forestry, said the state is not counting on receiving as much help from out-of-state crews or Canadian partners this year because of the pandemic.\n\n\"The real test is this month, because we now have a lot of fires burning simultaneously, and there's a lot of demand on resources across the country,\" he said.\n\nAs long as states can keep their crews from getting infected, they say they can be just as effective as ever.\n\n\"The firefighting portion of it hasn't changed that much,\" CalFire's Spelman said.\n\nPublished in partnership with Stateline, an initiative of The Pew Charitable Trusts.\n\nRNC: Three things President Donald Trump and the GOP need to do at their convention",

        "body": "\"We are seeing more people in their 30s and 40s who are developing colorectal cancers - often because they're having symptoms that aren't thought to be cancers,\" said Dr. Nilofer Azad, an associate professor of oncology at Johns Hopkins Medicine.\n\nAbout 30% of colorectal cancer diagnosed today is in people under the age of 55, she said. Symptoms of colorectal cancer include a change in bowel movements, rectal bleeding, blood in stool, abdominal pain and more.\n\nBoseman, who made a global impact bringing \"Black Panther\" to life in the Marvel Cinematic Universe along with playing Black icons on the silver screen, was diagnosed with stage III colon cancer in 2016 and battled with it as it progressed to stage IV, his family said in a statement Friday.\n\nColorectal cancer - which includes colon and rectal cancer - is expected to cause more than 50,000 deaths in 2020 - including 3,640 deaths in people younger than 50 years.\n\nThe lifetime risk of developing colorectal cancer is about 1 in 23 for men and 1 in 25 for women, the American Cancer Society says. This year, more than 100,000 people will be diagnosed with colon cancer and more than 40,000 with rectal cancer, including 18,000 colorectal cancer cases in people younger than 50, the group estimates.\n\nFor younger people, those numbers are rising. Deaths from colorectal cancer among people younger than age 55 have increased 1% per year from 2008 and 2017, according to the American Cancer Society.\n\nIn 2017, about 130 people in their 20s died from colorectal cancer, 720 in their 30s and 2,700 in their 40s, with older age groups accounting for higher and higher death tolls, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nDuring the late 1970s and early 1980s, colon cancer diagnoses were declining in age groups younger than age 50 years and increasing in those age 50 years and older, according to a 2017 study in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute.\n\nBut that trend flipped in the mid-1980s, when rates declined in adults age 55 years and older, while increasing by 2.4% per year in adults age 20-29 years and by 1% per year in adults age 30-39 years, the study found.\n\nRectal cancer rates saw an even more extreme version of this trend.\n\n\"If you were born in 1990 or afterward, you were two times more likely to get colon cancer or four times more likely to get rectal cancer than those born before 1990,\" said Michael Sapienza, CEO of the Colorectal Cancer Alliance. \"It is, unfortunately, becoming a bigger and bigger epidemic.\"\n\nSapienza, whose mother died of colon cancer at age 56, said oncologists are seeing more late-stage diagnoses of colorectal cancers, which are often mistaken for other illnesses.\n\n\"What's happening is, young people are going into the doctor having symptoms, and it's usually taking them to see three or four doctors until they're getting a diagnosis,\" he said. \"Especially now, in the telemedicine world, people are going to be afraid to recommend a colonoscopy. If you're having rectal bleeding, night sweats, cramping - especially dark blood - you really to emphasize that with your physician.\"\n\nBaltimore Orioles outfielder Trey Mancini was diagnosed in March, days before his 28th birthday. He was at spring training when a pair of blood tests revealed low iron levels. What he initially thought may have been a stomach ulcer or celiac disease turned out to be stage III colon cancer. Manci had a malignant tumor removed a week later and began chemotherapy in April.\n\n\"If you're young like me, you don't think you're getting colon cancer,\" Manci told USA TODAY. His father was diagnosed with stage II cancer at 58. \"I was shocked.\"\n\nOncologists don't yet know what's causing the rising number of cases among young people, but there are several theories.\n\n\"We really can't hone in on one cause,\" Azad said. \"There could be diet changes, obesity, increasing prevalence of diabetes. All of these things are also associated with colorectal cancer.\"\n\nHigh consumption of processed meat and alcohol, low levels of physical activity and fiber consumption, and cigarette smoking are also known risk factors, researchers said.\n\n\"It is not surprising that the timing of the obesity epidemic parallels the rise in colorectal cancer because many behaviors thought to drive weight gain, such as unhealthy dietary patterns and sedentary lifestyles, independently increase colorectal cancer risk,\" researchers said in the 2017 study.\n\nOverall, colorectal cancer disproportionately affects Black Americans. The cancer incidence is about 20% higher in Black men and women compared to their Caucasian counterparts, and Black patients are about 40% more likely to die of colorectal cancer, said Rebecca Siegel, a cancer epidemiologist and scientific director of surveillance research at the American Cancer Society.\n\n\"The mortality difference is what's striking,\" Siegel said. \"It's also the elephant in the room of systemic racism that has been going on for decades and affects everyone in the Black community, regardless of their wealth status.\"\n\nAmong young people, the difference in the rate of cases between Black and white Americans narrows, Siegel said. White Americans under 50 account for a large portion of the increase in cases in the younger age group, she said.\n\nTo combat the rising prevalence of colorectal cancer among young people, researchers suggest educating clinicians and the public about symptoms and screenings, and expanding health care access to young people, who are less likely to have access to a primary care physician and more likely to declare bankruptcy from their cancer treatments, Siegel said.\n\nResearchers also suggest developing new strategies to curb the obesity epidemic and shift Americans toward healthier eating and more active lifestyles.\n\nIt's also important to end the stigma around colorectal cancer, experts say.\n\n\"A very common symptom is bleeding in the stool, and that's embarrassing. Young people are not accustomed to talking about these symptoms with their friends,\" Siegel said.\n\nReducing the stigma and increasing awareness both of the symptoms and the increasing risk in young people directly translates to saving lives, she said.\n\n\"It might be tough for some people to talk about their colon and bowel movements, but it's the third most common cancer and we need to talk about it more,\" Manci said.\n\nIn 2018, the American Cancer Society updated its guidelines to recommend that people at average risk for colorectal cancer start regular screening at age 45, or at 40 for people with a personal or family history of colorectal cancer, a history of inflammatory bowel disease and more.\n\n\"Everybody's always told that you don't need colonoscopies until you're 50 years old, and that's clearly not the case,\" Manci said. \"In hindsight, I wish I would have gotten screened at 25 or so.\"\n\nMore groups are planning to revisit their guidelines in the next year or two, Azad said.\n\n\"I wouldn't be surprised if we started to see screenings moving earlier across other guideline committees as well,\" Azad said. \"This is a very treatable cancer, and it's a fully preventable cancer if people get their screening.\"",

    "Church restrictions amid COVID-19: Faith leaders find ways to operate": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "On a recent Sunday, Rod Loy, senior pastor at the First Assembly of God in North Little Rock, Arkansas, delivered the message of the Gospel through his computer screen.\n\n\"It's easy to live out your faith when everything is going good,\" he preached to his congregation. \"But the real test is difficult. How does your faith hold up when the doctor gives you a bad report, the kids get bad grades, and you can't pay your bills? How does your faith hold up when you lose your job in the middle of a pandemic? The true test of faith is a difficulty, hardship and persecution.\"\n\nAs he spoke, members of the church typed \"amen\" in the comment section. The church has been using Facebook to livestream its services for the past couple of months.\n\nAcross the U.S., faith leaders are debating how they can continue to pray in fellowship with others while keeping staff and members safe in the age of coronavirus. Some churches have moved completely online, others have embraced drive-in service, and some are adamant about holding in-person gatherings.\n\nProponents of church services argue that places of worship are a crucial source of strength, community and solace for many Americans, who should be allowed to safely congregate. Critics said soaring cases of COVID-19 in communities across the U.S. have made it impossible for large groups to interact and follow public health guidelines. In July, the Supreme Court ruled for the second time during the pandemic that churches can be restricted from worshiping to protect public health.\n\nChurches that insist on worshiping shoulder to shoulder with members have already been linked to outbreaks. At the Warrior Creek Missionary Baptist Church in Alabama, more than 40 people were infected by the coronavirus after attending a week-long revival event. In San Francisco, at least 10 people tested positive for coronavirus after attending a wedding with roughly 100 people at Saints Peter and Paul's Church. In Copperas Cove, Texas, five members of Victory Baptist Church tested positive for coronavirus and 20 members had symptoms.\n\nThe Trump administration has called on local governments to allow places of worship to safely reopen.\n\n\"We really do believe that, as we open up America again, we need to open up America's churches and houses of worship because faith is the wellspring from which the American people have always drawn strength in challenging times,\" Vice President Mike Pence told a local reporter last week after visiting a church in Florida.\n\nOpinion: Churches are essential. If protesters can assemble, so should people of faith.\n\nThe push to reopen churches has intensified as the pandemic has stretched on.\n\nDuring the early days of the COVID-19 crisis, many churches either stopped meeting or moved their services online. As some COVID-19 restrictions lifted, some faith leaders began having in-person services or filed lawsuits against state officials in California, Mississippi, Kansas and New Mexico, arguing their First Amendment rights had been violated by the limitations on church gatherings.\n\nIn Nevada, the leadership at Calvary Chapel Dayton Valley filed a lawsuit in May against Gov. Steve Sisolak's attendance limit of 50 people at religious gatherings. The lawsuit pointed out that Sisolak's rule allowed casinos, restaurants, bars, theme parks, and gyms to operate at 50% capacity.\n\nRyan Tucker, senior counsel and director of Center for Christian Ministries with Alliance Defending Freedom, a conservative legal organization that advocates for religious freedom, said Calvary Chapel Dayton Valley members were experiencing loneliness, depression, and marital problems with churches not meeting in-person.\n\n\"There is not a First Amendment right to gamble at the casino,\" said Tucker in an interview. \"You got First Amendment protection and issues in play against this church and any other across the United States.\"\n\nIn its 5-4 decision, the U.S. Supreme Court denied Calvary's request without explanation. Conservative members of the church said the decision violated the First Amendment.\n\n\"A public health emergency does not give governors and other public officials carte blanche to disregard the Constitution for as long as the medical problem persists,\" Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. wrote in a dissent joined by Justices Clarence Thomas and Brett M. Kavanaugh.\n\nIn Washington, Gov. Jay Inslee announced this week relaxed restrictions for in-person worship.\n\nAmid the legal maneuvering, many churches have continued to hold digital gatherings.\n\nIn Philadelphia, officials at St. Peter's Church chose to remain remote despite the state lifting its stay-at-home orders on June 4. The Rev. Sarah Hedgis said she won't risk other people's health by having in-person services.\n\n\"I feel like the guiding principle for us is to love your neighbor as yourselves,\" said Hedgis.\n\nNeal Curtiss, an associate pastor at Living Hope Church in Vancouver, Washington, is doing online and drive-in services. He is waiting to see what happens in the next few months with schools reopening to determine whether it will be safe to resume service in the building.\n\n\"There's a reality that people may not come back inside the building,\" said Curtiss.\n\nThe Rev. Reginald Woullard of Shady Grove Baptist Church in Hattiesburg, Mississippi, said it would be nice for churches to gather in person, but church members can still worship as a community online.\n\n\"Churches should be built on the word,\" said Woullard.\n\nJoseph W. Walker III, the bishop of Mt. Zion Baptist Church in Nashville, said his congregation is considering not having in-person services or having fewer in-person services even once the pandemic ends. The church has seen a 30% increase in engagement since services went online.\n\nThose who insist on worshiping together said they are looking out for their members' needs.\n\n\"People are dealing with the mental health struggles of quarantine and the church can be a lifeline for them,\" said Angie Hall, executive pastor at the Church for All Nations in Tacoma, Washington, which has both online and in-person services.\n\nThe Rev. Jeremiah Williamson, at Grace and St. Stephen's Episcopal Church in Colorado Springs, Colorado, said his decision to do in-person services included a handful of members struggling with technology, as well as many feeling lonely and isolated.\n\n\"People recognize that there's something critical in gathering together in church communities and have a new appreciation for the time together that we have,\" said Williams.\n\nAnthony Weber, an elder at the Church of the Living God in Traverse City, Michigan, said some church members have left the church to attend other churches because they're not happy about how the church is dealing with the pandemic.\n\n\"Most churches are trying to balance the tension of trying to let people get back together while trying also to honor what the governor is asking of them,\" said Weber.\n\nChurch of the Living God is holding in-person services with members social distancing in the pews, but worship is done outside because the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has said singing may contribute to the spread of the virus. When people sing, there is a large production of aerosols that can spread the virus. In one study, it was discovered that 53 out of 61 people contracted the virus after attending a choir rehearsal.\n\nWeber said he is thinking about how to change the structure of the service once the weather changes. Once it gets too cold, he is not sure if church members will want to sing outside.\n\nBenjamin Karner, a senior pastor at First Baptist Church Laredo in Laredo, Texas, said services were held only online at the beginning of the coronavirus restrictions, then moved to a drive-in service. The church is now holding in-person services at 25% of the building's capacity, as well as online services. Karner said the changes have been hard on the congregation but the church has to make sure that it continues to share in its love of Christ.\n\n\"I'm urging people to take a step back and realize that sometimes life does change,\" said Karner. \"God works through that change--If you can change and adapt, you'll find new opportunities that God is putting before us. If we can take advantage of those opportunities, we'll see the love of God shine through.\"",

    "College football leaders realizing season too risky with COVID-19": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "The conversations and considerations that have led college football to the confusing place it finds itself in on Aug. 9 are endlessly complex, but the question that will determine whether other leagues follow the Mid-American Conference in canceling their fall season is relatively straightforward.\n\nWould you stake your career on college football being safe under these circumstances?\n\nNo matter how else administrators have tried to rationalize the push forward toward a fall season for months and months, the chill of trepidation that has settled over college sports in recent days bears a distinct resemblance to the consciousness of guilt.\n\nThere is nothing wrong with pursuing a season until it becomes realistically impossible to do so, especially given the severe consequences for all of college sports if football is not played this year.\n\nMORE TO COME: Conferences could follow MAC's lead of canceling fall football season\n\nTHE PREVIEW: Outlooks for the Top 25 college football teams in the preseason Amway Coaches Poll\n\nBut in conversations with more than a dozen college sports officials over the weekend, the witching hour has brought to campuses and college presidents a more clear-eyed reality about what they don't know related to COVID-19 and the potential liabilities surrounding a virus whose long-term impact on the body is unclear. There is also, at the most basic level, little confidence that the trajectory of infections in the United States is going to end up at an acceptable rate within the next month or two that would allow a contact sport to even take place safely without players being put in a bubble.\n\nThe problem is, nobody wants to be the one to say what the majority of college athletics now instinctively knows: Rushing to play football right now just isn't a very good idea.\n\n\"The overriding piece of this is it's just not clearing up like we all hoped,\" said one athletics director, who spoke on the condition of anonymity due to the fluidity of the situation. \"This is just too difficult for us to really believe that it's right for us to go forward at the moment. It feels like we're heading for a pause.\"\n\nPeople can argue whether the MAC's decision to shut down fall sports was completely about the health and safety, as the league claimed Saturday, or because the finances no longer made sense without the ability to make money off non-conference games against Power Five opponents. Both things can be true.\n\nBut at least the MAC was willing to make a decision and own it, regardless of the blowback. Eventually, other schools and conferences will have to make a tough call, and they know that if they decide to play this fall, they have to be right. That's by far the scariest part because, with COVID-19, it tends to be the most uninformed who speak with the most certainty.\n\nFor instance, potential cardiac issues related to COVID-19 have been discussed for months as a major unknown. As far back as May, sports cardiologist Jonathan H. Kim of Emory University co-authored an opinion piece that suggested athletes who become infected should not exercise for two weeks after their symptoms resolve and should undergo extensive cardiac testing to look for underlying heart inflammation.\n\nBut as the scheduled games get closer, the issue is suddenly getting a second look. According to one person with knowledge of the matter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the situation, a group of Pac 12 presidents has become significantly concerned about the data they've been given as players have undergone necessary cardiac tests.\n\nA Sports Illustrated piece on Sunday anonymously quoted a team doctor who was aware of 10 COVID-related heart issues on college football teams, and a recent paper published in JAMA Cardiology found that 78 of 100 patients they studied had cardiac abnormalities more than two months after being diagnosed with COVID-19.\n\nThis brings up two very important questions, particularly at schools that have had large numbers of players test positive for the coronavirus. First, has everyone's testing on the cardiac part been adequate enough? Second, what is the risk of a player who recovered from COVID-19 dying on the practice field or in the middle of a game due to a related heart issue?\n\n\"The studies have a lot of people thinking,\" said one athletics director. \"Not everybody does baseline heart testing the same way and that's a concern trying to understand more about the research. Does it heighten or expose someone with a preexisting condition or did this happen because of COVID? We're dealing with something there aren't known answers for yet, and we don't have the benefit of time to see how it all works out. That's what has everyone additionally concerned.\"\n\nIn retrospect, as you talk to administrators, many now wistfully admit that college football was doomed as soon as COVID-19 and the notion of public health became politicized. And they know that, too, will rear its ugly head if the season is canceled -- not just from some fans and donors who will baselessly accuse schools of kowtowing to liberal academics but perhaps even from President Trump, who has specifically talked about college football coming back as an aspirational normality.\n\nSo what now?\n\nAs much as the power conferences have wanted to act in concert, there is still no agreement about the path ahead. The Big Ten and Pac 12 are likely joined at the hip, and both leagues have factions that are ready to pack it in, though it's unclear whether they'll reach a consensus on that in the next few days. But once a couple leagues make that call, it's hard to imagine the momentum not sweeping up the rest.\n\nThen the discussion turns to a season being played in the spring, a topic that has ardent fans and significant detractors. Some schools believe the operational cost of running a normal athletic department through the fall with the hope of playing in the spring makes no sense, particularly since nobody knows whether the conditions around COVID-19 will improve by then. Others think there's little to lose and envision a shortened season ending by May 1 and then starting the 2021 season in October to give players more time to recover.\n\n\"Come March, who knows what the country could have (regarding vaccine, testing, therapeutics and infection numbers),\" said one administrator who favors the spring plan. \"Certainly better than right now.\"\n\nSlowly but surely, college sports is coming to grips with both the ramifications of these decisions and the necessity in making them. In the end, the people in charge are beginning to realize the biggest factor in whether college football can be played was out of their hands all along.\n\n\"The virus is not athletics' problem,\" said one athletics director. \"It is society's. But athletics couldn't safely adapt.\"\n\nAnd until that happens, the ultimate test for college sports remains simple. Unless the people in charge would stake their careers on it being safe enough to play, the other factors don't really matter.",

        "authors": [],
        "body": "The greatest COVID-19 threat to college football players this fall might not be on the field, but rather on the rest of campus, a newly published study shows.\n\nIn an article posted on the Journal of the American Medical Association's JAMA Network Open site last Friday, researchers from Yale, Harvard and Massachusetts General Hospital wrote that the safe reopening of college campuses may require testing of all students every two days and \"uncompromising vigilance and continuous attention to good prevention practices.\"\n\nA. David Paltiel, a professor at the Yale School of Public Health, said in an interview with USA TODAY Sports that he and his research partners recognize \"we're setting a very high bar, and we realize that our recommendations may be beyond the financial reach and logistical capacity of many universities.\"\n\nThis is where the potential impact on athletes comes into play. They'll be tested with greater frequency than will other students. The Big Ten Conference, for example, announced Wednesday that all of its football players -- and all of the team staffers in close contact with them -- must be tested at least twice a week during the season.\n\nAsked whether the effectiveness of that protocol could be undercut on a campus that is not testing all of its students as frequently, Paltiel said:\n\n\"Yes. I'm going to quote my friend Carlos Del Rio at Emory University, who has talked about how you can't create a no-peeing zone of a swimming pool. There's going to be cross-contamination. And it's very difficult to imagine that you could apply one standard to the football team and not expect that that standard is not going to be cross-contaminated. You know, those two populations are going to interact. You can't keep them apart.\"\n\nOPINION: COVID-19 will affect college football season. But how will it inform rankings of Amway Coaches Poll voters?\n\nWhile the possibility of college-age people dying after becoming infected is \"exceedingly low,\" Paltiel said, significant issues remain.\n\n\"The serious adverse consequences associated with an outbreak on campus will be borne disproportionately by the non-student members of the college community -- the staff, the dining-hall workers, the custodians, the faculty and the more vulnerable members of the surrounding community,\" he said.\n\nThe researchers modeled various rapid-testing and transmission scenarios for a hypothetical 5,000-student campus that had 4,990 infection-free and 10 with undetected, asymptomatic infection at the start of an 80-day semester intended to represent many schools' plans to conclude any in-person instruction at the Thanksgiving break.\n\nThey considered a symptom-based testing approach, testing every 1, 2, 3 or 7 days, using tests with different abilities to avoid false negatives, different abilities to avoid false positives and different costs. They found that using a test with a relatively poor ability to avoid false negatives, but doing the testing with relatively greater frequency, had the most cost-effective outcome -- one that resulted in 243 infections over the course of the semester.\n\nThe researchers determined that schools' and students' strict adherence to best practices, including -- among other things -- hand-washing, mandated indoor masking, lower-than-normal campus and classroom density, limited bathroom sharing and the elimination of buffet dining could make containment possible with weekly testing. However, \"any relaxation of these measures ... could easily increase\" transmission rates dramatically -- to more than 1,800 total infections for the semester, even with weekly testing.\n\nMost important -- given that few schools will be testing all of their students with any frequency over the course of the semester -- the infection numbers could climb much higher, especially if schools test based only students having COVID-19 symptoms.\n\n\"You can't play catch-up with this virus,\" Paltiel said. \"Any school that tests and responds only when symptoms have been observed, it's like a fire department that responds only to calls when the house has already burned to the ground.\"",

        "body": "FORT COLLINS, Colo. - Colorado State football players and athletic department staff say coaches have told players not to report COVID-19 symptoms, threatened players with reduced playing time if they quarantine and claim CSU is altering contact tracing reports to keep players practicing.\n\nAnd they say those actions by the athletic administration are putting their health at risk in return for monetary gain the school would receive if fall sports are played.\n\nFootball players said they would like to play this season but don't believe there should be a season given the spike in positive cases on the team in the past two weeks and the threat of more once Colorado State's full student body comes to campus later this month. The school shut down football workouts on July 29 after eight in the football program tested positive.\n\n\"I believe there is a coverup going on at CSU,'' said a current football player who spoke to the Coloradoan on the condition of anonymity for fear of retribution. \"But they could only cover it up so long and now that we have so many cases across athletics, they can't cover it up anymore. It's not about the health and safety of the players but about just trying to make money off the players.''\n\nPAC-12: The unlikely player helping lead movement of football players demanding change\n\nSEC: Alabama football may be on hook for more than $3.5M for canceled non-conference games\n\nSaid an athletic department staff member, who also spoke to the Coloradoan on the condition of anonymity for fear of retribution: \"There are some red flags in the athletic department, but the common denominator with this administration is to protect the coaches before the student-athletes and that makes them feel more like cattle than student-athletes.''\n\nThe player and staff member were two of 10 players and staff who contacted the Coloradoan in the past week regarding CSU's handling of athletics and COVID-19. They all spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of retribution.\n\nCSU athletic director Joe Parker said he is disappointed in the criticism but believes CSU has a solid COVID-19 plan in a time of uncertainty and fluidity.\n\n\"This (student-athlete) population is the most tested population there is here, but obviously some feel that is not a good enough job to make them feel comfortable regarding their health,'' he said. \"If that's the feeling, we will need to amp it up.''\n\nIn response to the player saying he has been told by coaches not to report symptoms, Parker said that is unacceptable and runs counter to everything the university is doing to avoid spreading the virus.\n\nParker said previously that there were no positive COVID-19 tests for athletes as of July 20. That number spiked to 16, including 11 football players, as of Sunday.\n\nLike universities across the country, CSU has in place guidelines from Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, local and state health department and the NCAA in an effort to have fall sports seasons. That includes testing, temperature checks, social distancing, mask requirements, quarantining and a host of other barriers to contain the spread of the virus.\n\nPlayers said a number of athletes from different sports attended a party around the Fourth of July holiday and that may have been a root cause of the recent surge in positive tests.\n\nParker agreed the incident appears to have spurred the increase. He said as difficult as it is for student-athletes to adhere to COVID-19 safety measures outside of practices, not abiding by those guidelines puts themselves and other players and staff at risk.\n\nPlayers and staff confirmed to the Coloradoan that there were 27 players, about a quarter of the team, missing because of COVID-19 at the last practice July 29 before the university voluntarily paused practices.\n\nMonday, CSU tested 150 athletes. Results are expected on Wednesday or Thursday.\n\n\"Because we didn't have student-athletes with us over our football pause, I don't know what will we see when they return to campus,'' Parker said. \"I hope the Fourth of July was a wake-up call.''\n\nKatie O'Donnell, spokesperson for the Larimer County health department, confirmed CSU voluntarily shut down practices but said the department was keeping a close eye on the program before that due to the rising number of positive cases.\n\nPlayers and athletic staff said they believed the pause should have happened a week earlier but that coach Steve Addazio was adamant to get practices in. Addazio was not made available for comment.\n\nPlayers said trainers stress adhering to safety guidelines during training but compliance is difficult. They said they are supposed to wear face coverings during conditioning and practice drills, but the masks make it hard to breathe so many players take them down.\n\nPlayers and staff said Addazio, 61, and defensive coordinator Chuck Heater, 67, rarely wear their masks. They said that is dangerous to themselves because of their age and also sets a bad example for the team.\n\nPlayers and athletic staff also voiced concern over the reporting protocol, claiming quarantine procedures vary wildly and that coaches are coercing health administrators not to quarantine athletes so they can continue to practice.\n\nParker disputed the claim.\n\n\"There is no influence from our coaching staff on those kinds of decisions and those decisions are made outside of the athletic department and that is the way I want it,'' he said.",

    "Colorado State football faces racial insensitivity, abuse allegations": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "FORT COLLINS, Colo. - More than 20 current and former Colorado State football players and athletic department staff say they have witnessed recurring instances of racial insensitivity and abusive behavior within the department.\n\nIn dozens of independently gathered and corroborated interviews with Coloradoan reporters, players and staff within the program claim a pattern of concerning behavior has spanned the tenure of former head coach Mike Bobo and current coach Steve Addazio. They say athletic director Joe Parker and other athletic administrators have turned a blind eye to the issues.\n\nThose who spoke to the Coloradoan include a CSU Athletic Hall of Fame member and former coach, a current mental health counselor at the university and numerous players and staff with firsthand knowledge of the football program's culture, which some have called \"toxic.\"\n\nSome spoke to the Coloradoan, which is part of the USA TODAY Network, on the condition of anonymity out of fear of retaliation from others within the program.\n\nOn Friday, the university halted all football operations and expanded the scope of its investigation into the athletic department's handling of COVID-19 protocols to include examination of these concerns.\n\n\"Today, we learned of some extremely troubling allegations of racism and verbal abuse from CSU's athletic administration generally and in the football program specifically,\" Parker said in a written statement.\n\n\"I have consulted with President (Joyce) McConnell about these new allegations, which obviously deeply concern her as well. Effective immediately, and for the best interests of our student-athletes, I am pausing all football-related activities indefinitely.\"\n\nIn an interview Saturday, McConnell said she \"put no limits on what the investigators are looking for. I have confidence if these incidents happened that we will know about them after the investigation is complete.''\n\nThe Coloradoan first reported allegations Tuesday that football coaches told players not to report COVID-19 symptoms and threatened players with reduced playing time if they quarantined. McConnell quickly hired an outside law firm to investigate those claims.\n\nPrior to CSU suspending football operations Friday, the Coloradoan sought interviews with the school's leadership regarding the newspaper's months-long investigation of the allegations of racial insensitivity and abuse. Also Friday, ESPN reported corroborating allegations in its story about CSU's suspension of football activities.\n\nParker told the Coloradoan Saturday that \"he had never heard of the specific allegations'' presented to him in the interview, but that they will be forwarded to investigators.\n\n\"These are very concerning and obviously we are going to ask the outside investigative team to understand each and every one of these,\" he said. \"And we will take appropriate action when we finish our investigation.\"\n\nThe Coloradoan's investigation revealed allegations of racial insensitivity, harassment and verbal abuse that have dogged Parker's five-year tenure leading CSU's athletic department, spanning his handling of former men's basketball coach Larry Eustachy's documented abuse through the recent investigation of Addazio's football program.\n\n\"In these types of closed systems where abuse is taking place, it's hidden in plain sight; everybody knows the truth but they are afraid to address it because of the fear of losing their jobs or scholarships or being blackballed,'' said Jimmy Stewart, a CSU mental health counselor who admitted he feared for his job after speaking out. \"Because the people you are reporting the truth to are the very people whose job it is to polish the brand. They are trying to manage the abuse, not stop it.''\n\nAnthoney Hill is a CSU Athletic Hall of Fame member, a Black former quarterback under legendary coach Sonny Lubick and an assistant coach for the Rams from 2008-11. He then served as the football program's director of player development and community/alumni relations from 2015 until he was terminated earlier this year.\n\nDespite his longtime affiliation with CSU, Hill said Parker didn't see him as a \"good fit'' because he voiced concerns about the racial insensitivity and abuse. Hill said he never met with Addazio before his termination.\n\nParker provided emails to the Coloradoan showing Hill was offered opportunities with the department outside of football, but said Hill didn't respond.\n\nIn an email sent to Parker in February, Hill expressed his concern about the athletic department. It read in part:\n\n\"What I have seen from you is a person of privilege who either intentionally or unintentionally isn't aware of insensitivities of young black men being berated under the guise of coaching. You are allowing that toxic culture to be cultivated and to persist by not addressing the issues. The bottom line, the athletes don't trust you, Joe.\"\n\nThose interviewed by the Coloradoan said the erosion of that credibility started at the beginning of Parker's tenure when he continued to employ Eustachy for four years after the coach was the subject of a scathing internal report regarding player abuse in 2014.\n\nThey said that loss of trust continued when Parker failed to address player and staff complaints involving Bobo, who they accused of making racially insensitive comments and verbally harassing assistant coaches, players and staff during his five years. Parker negotiated a $1.825 million buyout of Bobo, who went 28-35, after the 2019 season.\n\nAnd they said a toxic culture was perpetuated when Parker hired Addazio in December, less than a month after Addazio was fired at Boston College.\n\nOthers within the program have strongly denied any implication of impropriety within CSU football. Multiple members of the football team and coaching staff came out in support of Addazio on Saturday in a statement shared on Twitter. It read in part, \"the last number of days has created an unfair and unstable environment within our football team.\"\n\nThe statement denies allegations of racism and verbal abuse by current staff.\n\n\"The seniors and our football team unequivocally support our Coach and his staff. They have acted professionally, respectfully and are committed to fostering an inclusive and supportive football program,\" the statement read.\n\nHowever, several members of the team contacted by the Coloradoan on Saturday said they did not support the statement.\n\nA member of CSU's football staff said Addazio has downplayed the COVID-19 health threat and Black Lives Matter movement, which have dominated public discussion in recent months, calling both a \"distraction from football'' to be managed.\n\nAdazzio declined the Coloradoan's interview request Saturday, but agreed to review emailed questions about the allegations. He later declined to answer the questions. He released a statement Tuesday after allegations from players that coaches were not following COVID-19 protocols.\n\n\"The health and welfare of our student-athletes on the Colorado State football team is our top priority, and I fully support President McConnell's investigation into concerns about whether these protocols were properly followed by everyone involved with our program,\" Addazio said in a statement released by the university.\n\n\"We want every student-athlete to have confidence that we are taking every possible measure to ensure their safety, and we will continue working with the training staff, the athletic department and the University to evaluate and implement any additional steps necessary to live up to our high standards.\"\n\nStewart, who was hired at CSU six years ago by former AD Jack Graham to help student-athletes address their mental well-being, said he decided to go public with his concerns after an encounter with Addazio in June.\n\nDuring that encounter, Stewart said he witnessed humiliation, denigration and intimidation of a Black player over academic issues. Stewart said the incident felt eerily similar to Minneapolis police officers' treatment of George Floyd before a white officer knelt on the back of Floyd's neck until he died.\n\n\"After watching George Floyd being humiliated before he died, it triggered in me the times I saw or heard about certain coaches humiliate student-athletes and the fact that not going public made me complicit and compromised my integrity,'' said the 65-year-old Stewart, who is white. \"I also became conscious that racism is about being a bully. In that encounter with the Black student-athlete, Coach Addazio had this attitude that he's bigger and more powerful than the student-athlete. The student was enslaved.''\n\nStewart said after Addazio's berating of the student-athlete that, in a subsequent call from Addazio to Stewart, the situation worsened. During the conversation, Stewart said he felt Addazio's demeanor was \"domineering, threatening and intimidating (in) manner, as if he owned me.''\n\nA football staff member said Addazio later \"bragged'' to coaches at a meeting about berating the player, who the staffer described as a sensitive kid who was sobbing after the encounter. The staff member said Addazio used expletives when describing the incident to others.\n\nWhen asked about the incident Saturday, Parker said, \"If that proves to be true, that is not acceptable. Not what I want represented in our program.''\n\nStewart said despite such incidents being known within the department, Parker claims plausible deniability, walling himself off from witnessing instances of racial insensitivity, harassment and humiliation.\n\n\"When these administrators allow or ignore student-athletes being harmed, it makes them just as culpable as if they had actually participated,'' Stewart said. \"What became real for me was the fact that much of what gets hidden and accepted as coaching really is systemic bullying and it's happening here at CSU, and Joe Parker isn't going to stop it because he has a vested interest in painting a pretty picture.''\n\nParker denied that, saying he has a cultural expectation of \"never passing a problem.''\n\nStewart said it became more clear to him after experiencing the abusive nature of how Eustachy, Bobo and Addazio run their programs that the athletic department's culture is hurting student-athletes and staff, who are too afraid to speak up for fear of retaliation.\n\nHill echoed those concerns in a February email to Parker, which was copied to McConnell, Hughes and Albert Bimper, senior associate athletic director for diversity and inclusion.\n\n\"Bringing in a new head football coach who tells the graduate assistants within days of knowing them that he 'doesn't give a (expletive) about their feelings' is contradictory to being 'committed to the holistic development of student-athletes ... and of crafting a culture where students thrive.' As a dedicated former student-athlete and confidant/mentor to the current players, I know that's not the type of representative that we want in CSU athletics. It doesn't fit our mission statement: To educate, engage, and excel.''\n\nMany of those interviewed said they wouldn't call Bobo or Addazio racist, but said they are racially insensitive, insulting and ignorant.\n\nBrandon Summer, a backup punter from 2015-2018 who was recruited by Bobo's staff, said he explained his concerns about the football program's culture under Bobo during a 90-minute in-person exit interview with Parker.\n\n\"Under Bobo and (former defensive coordinator) John Jancek, it was like an angry white man society and they come into college football to take it out on the players,'' said Summer, who is white. \"They were racially insensitive but players were concerned about their scholarships and playing time, so many didn't say anything and that's not right.''\n\nExamples of racial insensitivity and verbal harassment within CSU athletics were corroborated by multiple people who witnessed the events in meetings, locker rooms, practices and on the sidelines.\n\nBobo and Jancek called Black football players \"boy,\" a derogatory term aimed at Black people. One assistant coach under Bobo said Jancek quit using the term after being told it was insensitive.\n\nBobo, who is the offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach at South Carolina, did not respond to the Coloradoan's interview requests through South Carolina's athletic department.\n\n* * *\n\nNathan Lucas, a long snapper and holder, played three seasons for Bobo. Lucas, who is white, said Bobo would look at Black players and say, \"I know a lot of you don't have daddies, so I'm going to be your daddy.''\n\nAnd while meeting before a game, the lights went out, prompting Bobo to make a demeaning remark to a dark-skinned player.\n\n\"There is dead silence and Coach Bobo says '(Name of player omitted) smile so everyone can you see you,' \" Lucas said. \"(Name of player omitted) is one of the most kindhearted men you will ever meet. I don't care who you are, you shouldn't be called out like that.\"\n\n* * *\n\nThose interviewed said Parker began to lose credibility with staff, coaches and student-athletes during his handling of Eustachy's departure.\n\n\"When you talk about an individual tied to injustice to student-athletes, Larry is a pure reflection of that,'' said Nick Longo, a former CSU athletic trainer who worked under Parker. \"Yet at a head coaches meeting, Joe tells the coaches, 'When you see Larry, pat him on the shoulder because he's having a rough week.' How do you think that made the rest of the coaches who were making much less money feel?\"\n\nJack Graham, who preceded Parker as AD and hired Eustachy, wanted to fire Eustachy after a 2013-14 investigation uncovered the coach \"created a culture of fear and intimidation and emotionally abused his players.\"\n\nGraham told the Coloradoan in 2017 that he advised then-President Tony Frank that Eustachy should be terminated, but Frank didn't believe the university had the basis to fire the coach. Frank instead told Graham that Eustachy was to be placed on a personal improvement plan that included \"zero tolerance for the negative behaviors.\"\n\nAs part of Eustachy's improvement plan, starting in February 2014, he was no longer allowed to be alone with his team and was required to have Graham or a staff member present at meetings, practices and games.\n\nIn February 2018, Parker placed Eustachy on administrative leave. Eustachy and CSU agreed to part ways a month later. CSU paid Eustachy $750,000 as a buyout with a non-disclosure clause that precludes Eustachy or CSU from commenting on his departure.\n\nBlack athletes and staff also point out there have been only one Black head coach in CSU's 150-year history and few people of color in top administrative positions within the athletic department.\n\nThey pointed to CSU overlooking Tony Alford -- a Black Ohio State assistant who is considered one of the nation's top recruiters, a former CSU star running back and a Colorado native -- after he openly expressed interest in the head coaching job as evidence of lingering institutional racism.\n\nStephanie Johnson, a CSU athletic trainer who is Black, said the athletic department missed an opportunity to provide action on its mission of growth through diversity and to elevate the consciousness to serve the needs of a diverse population by not hiring Alford.\n\n\"Like the athletics department's mission statement, he was just a name put out there for optics,\" she said. \"When something like this happens, it's a good representation of how CSU athletics sees the importance of Black representation in their athletics department.\"\n\nStewart said there is a heavy long-term cost to the CSU athletic department's current culture.\n\n\"If a person fears retribution for telling the truth, especially as it concerns the welfare of our student-athletes, what does that say about the system?\" Stewart asked. \"Universities are supposed to be about integrity, honesty, freedom of thought and leadership.\n\n\"But athletics is about power over people, not power with people. What the collegiate athletic departments have largely become is an industry that sees protection of the brand as more important than protection of its people.\"",

    "Conditions at Lapeer nursing home led to COVID-19 deaths, illnesses": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "DETROIT - Dennis Williams is haunted by the memory of his mother, Wanda Parker, through the window at a Michigan nursing home.\n\nHe said she was begging for help.\n\nIt was the last time he saw his 68-year-old mother alive. She died of COVID-19 on April 7, two days after she was transported to a hospital from the Villages of Lapeer Nursing & Rehabilitation.\n\nWilliams said he remembers seeing employees of the facility not wearing masks, gloves or other personal protective equipment (PPE) during his through-the-window visits with his mother before she died. And he's aware of the significantly lower COVID-19 statistics reported at the other nursing homes in the area.\n\n\"They (the facilities) actually took the precautions,\" the Lapeer, Michigan, man said. \"And that's what pisses me off, is that when we'd go see mom through the window and it wasn't the workers' fault - I had talked to several of them - they just were just being told they could not wear the stuff.\"\n\n\"The stuff\" was masks and PPE - some of which two former employees and their lawyers said were donated by the community, but kept away from the staff.\n\nWilliams, his step-father and his brother are suing the nursing home. So are three former employees, all certified nursing assistants, who contracted the virus and who allege the nursing home refused to test residents or staff, to let employees stay home unless they had a fever and to allow employees to wear masks or PPE during the initial weeks after the pandemic hit Michigan in mid-March.\n\nOne former employee said a mask was ripped off her face by the director of nursing, who told her she was scaring patients.\n\nNineteen residents at the Villages of Lapeer Nursing & Rehabilitation, an 87-bed facility, have died of COVID-19, according to data from the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services. That is more than half of the 34 COVID-19 deaths in Lapeer County to date.\n\nOn April 8, the day after Parker died, the Michigan Department of Licensing and Regulatory Affairs began a survey of the nursing home and declared \"immediate jeopardy\" in a 37-page report. The state report supports the allegations of management barring staff from wearing PPE.\n\nThe Villages of Lapeer provided this statement to the Detroit Free Press of the USA TODAY Network last week:\n\n\"Due to the fact that the matters being inquired about are ongoing, we are not in a position to provide comment. We can say that The Villages of Lapeer has been and will continue to cooperate with the involved parties,\" it stated.\n\n\"Please be assured that The Villages of Lapeer is committed to continuing to provide high quality care and support to our residents and their families, as well as support for all of our staff during these challenging times.\"\n\nAttorneys representing the nursing home did not respond to calls and emails.\n\nWilliams' lawsuit also names Jill Vankerschaver, identified as the former director of nursing who resigned April 7. A woman who answered the phone for a telephone listing for Vankerschaver said: \"I'm not interested. You have a nice day,\" before hanging up on a Free Press reporter.\n\nThree lawsuits were filed in Lapeer County Circuit Court in June against Davis & Davis Management Group, the LLC that owns the Villages of Lapeer Nursing & Rehabilitation. Medicare.gov listed the owners and directors of the Villages of Lapeer Nursing & Rehabilitation as Michael Davis and Thomas Davis, two doctors who are also brothers.\n\nThe Free Press could not immediately reach the Davises on Friday.\n\nIn an April 9 article on Flint, Michigan, TV station ABC12, Thomas Davis was quoted as saying: \"We're taking good care of the patients and everything is being followed by the letter. And, I don't want people to be worried about their loved ones that are in there.\"\n\nIn a follow-up article the next day, after Parker's family raised concerns about her death, the station quoted Davis as saying there was a shortage of PPE across the country.\n\n\"We were not being negligent, we were doing everything we could, believe me,\" he told the television station.\n\nNo responses had been filed to the lawsuits, and no court dates had been set as of last Wednesday, according to Lapeer County Circuit Court.\n\nWilliams' lawsuit and one filed by Taylor Minifield and Tasha Harden, both of Flint, each seek more than $1 million in damages. The third lawsuit, filed by Shanika Johnson of Flint, seeks more than $25,000.\n\nTheir attorneys say the nursing home's actions amounted to gross negligence and egregious circumstances.\n\n\"When you rip the face mask off of a person ... that's active, that's intentional, that's reckless,\" said Jim Rasor, one of the attorneys, told the Free Press. \"This is not just a screw-up. This is not a mistake. This is actively, recklessly putting people in a horrible or deadly disease.\"\n\nCo-counsel Andrew Laurila agreed, saying: \"Here we had a willful refusal to allow people to wear PPE.\"\n\nYet, they said, a March 27 post on the facility's Facebook page shows homemade masks and N95 masks and states: \"Our community has been so gracious to us, and we are SO grateful!\"\n\nMinifield said she saw masks come in and go into the director of nursing's office.\n\n\"She kept 'em in there. She never brought 'em out. I asked her in the hallway, like, can we bring in donated masks, and she said, 'Oh yeah, I have a lot of them in my office. I've got them for emergency purposes only,'\" Harden recalled. \"I'm still confused what was considered an emergency, (because) that was an emergency.\"\n\nPreviously: Death toll rises as coronavirus sweeps through Michigan nursing homes\n\nThe lawsuit filed by Minifield and Harden states that starting in the middle of March they saw employees and staff beginning to show signs of the virus. It alleges that during the week of March 16, the director of nursing told all staff they were not allowed to wear PPE, specifically but not limited to masks, because it would \"scare the residents.\"\n\nMinifield cared not only for residents such as Parker, but also at home for her mother, who was being treated for cancer. She said wore her own mask to work at the end of March for her safety and the safety of the residents. The director of nursing, she said, removed it from her face.\n\n\"She said you have to take that off because basically you're scaring the residents. The residents were asking why were we wearing masks,\" Minifield said. \"She told me, 'You have to take it off.' She ripped it off my face and threw it right into, we have a trash can on our nurse's cart, and threw it right in there, and walked off and didn't care. And she told me, 'If you have something to say, you can leave my building.'\"\n\nCoronavirus Watch newsletter: Sign up for daily updates in your inbox\n\nMinifield said she told the director of nursing on March 25 that numerous residents under her care were showing severe symptoms of COVID-19.\n\nThe director of nursing told her \"no one here has the virus,\" the lawsuit alleges. When Minifield asked her supervisors what the plan was, she was told there was no intention of testing the residents \"because they could not possibly have it,\" according to the lawsuit.\n\nMinifield arrived at work March 28 feeling sick, but was told she had to work unless she had a fever. She called in sick the next day and on April 3 found out that she had the virus and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, or SARS.\n\nHarden worked the week of March 23 with residents she suspected had the virus and \"persistent high fevers.\" During shifts March 29 and March 30, she interacted with about seven residents who had serious virus symptoms, including one who was vomiting for four days, the lawsuit states.\n\nShe reported the conditions and her concerns, but was told there were no plans to test any of the residents \"and they would remain in their present states.\" Some of those patients died, according to the lawsuit.\n\nHarden started to feel sick March 30 and stayed off work April 1. She went to the emergency room April 6. Two days later, she received positive test results for COVID-19. Her daughter also tested positive and was hospitalized, the complaint states.\n\nMore: Nursing home residents account for 34% of Michigan's COVID-19-related deaths\n\nIn her lawsuit, Johnson said she reported various respiratory ailments she experienced to her supervisors March 24, saying she felt she might have the virus. She \"was expressly told by management that unless she had a fever - Plaintiff did not - she had to work.\"\n\nShe, too, reported concerns for residents who showed visible symptoms of the virus.\n\nOn March 31, Johnson's symptoms and condition had worsened, which she reported to management, but was denied going home sick. She worked for 90 minutes and had a nurse take her vitals, which prompted her to go home, according to the lawsuit.\n\nIt states that while driving home, Johnson's respiratory ailments became so severe, she pulled over and called 911. She was taken to the hospital by ambulance and the next day received positive test results for the virus.\n\nOn April 2, the director of nursing called Johnson and requested proof she tested positive, which Johnson sent her. Johnson then called the Lapeer County Health Department, which told her that the nursing home reported that Johnson's last day of work was March 26, according to her lawsuit.\n\nYou're facing a lot of choices amid the pandemic: Cut yourself slack: It's called decision fatigue\n\nIn early April, the Michigan Department of Licensing and Regulatory Affairs surveyed the Villages of Lapeer Nursing & Rehabilitation through observation, interviews and record reviews.\n\nThe state issued its report, which declared \"immediate jeopardy.\"\n\n\"Based on observation, interview and record review, the facility failed to follow accepted Infection Control standards of practice to ensure the appropriate Personal Protective Equipment/PPE (the use of facial masks) was made available for staff usage when caring for residents during the onset of the facility''s COVID-19 outbreak of a census of 58 residents, resulting in increased COVID-19 cross contamination, 25 facility residents with reported COVID-19 tests ... numerous staff members with reported positive COVID-19 test results, 6 resident deaths ... and the potential for further cross contamination of other residents residing in the facility with possible hospitalization and death,\" according to the report.\n\nThe report, which doesn't reference employees or patients by name, states the \"immediate jeopardy\" began on March 24 when the former director of nursing came into the facility therapy room and told an occupational therapist to remove her own personal protective face mask and told her \"she was not going to wear the mask in 'her building.' This was during a worldwide pandemic of the COVID-19 virus.\"\n\nThe report stated that according to the state health department, Lapeer County had the first case reported of COVID-19 on March 24.\n\nTwo nursing assistants had been sent home from working at the facility on March 25 by the previous director of nursing for wearing their own protective face masks while caring for facility residents, according to the survey report.\n\nThe county health department reported on April 9 the facility had 22 residents with a positive COVID-19 test result. By April 13, there were 25 residents who tested positive for the virus, the report states.\n\nIt indicates that in an April 9 phone interview, the previous director of nursing said they had enough masks and PPE and \"I was saving them.\" She said the administrator said she's keeping the masks on a table in the corner of her locked office.\n\nShe also said she told the administrator there were several staff members who were wearing masks because they didn't want to get the virus.\n\n\"I told them we were checking temps and didn't want to alarm the residents and we wanted to save these masks,\" the director of nursing told a state investigator, according to the report. She also said she went to one of the therapists and a couple of staff and told them they didn't need to wear them and shouldn't wear them in the building \"and the residents were getting upset.\"\n\nShe said the therapist called a physician, then the administrator said to let the staff wear masks. A review of a typed note dated March 25 indicated the administrator told the previous director of nursing that the staff needs to be allowed to wear masks, per doctors.\n\n'Small events add up to a lot': Limited gatherings quietly emerge as source of coronavirus infections\n\nAccording to the report, the administrator said during an April 8 phone interview that the facility had enough masks and PPE in the building on March 24 for staff to use. The administrator said the facility had N-95 face masks, gowns, gloves, face shields and hand sanitizer in the facility and that masks were available to staff.\n\nThe report states the \"immediate jeopardy\" was abated on April 7 based on observation via virtual tour of the facility staff wearing the proper PPE, including protective facial masks, while interacting and caring for residents and on confirmation during interviews on April 14 that the facility had implemented seven measures to remove the \"immediate jeopardy.\"\n\nThe report ended: \"Although the Immediate Jeopardy was removed on 4/7/20, the facility remained out of compliance at scope and severity for potential for more than minimum harm pending the facility\"s ability to sustain compliance as verified by the State Agency.\"\n\nAs the state of Michigan passed 100,000 confirmed coronavirus cases, it has recorded 6,446 deaths from the virus as of Friday. More than a third of those deaths, or 2,103 as of Wednesday, have been nursing home residents.\n\nShortly after the first cases in Michigan were announced March 10, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer issued an executive order restricting visitors to nursing homes.\n\nThe state health department eased visitor restrictions June 30, but only for residents who are in serious or critical condition or hospice care or who need someone to help them with activities of daily living.\n\nWhitmer has been scrutinized for her decisions about nursing homes, such as allowing COVID-19 patients to be treated in the same facility as those who have not contracted the virus. On Wednesday, the U.S. Department of Justice announced it wants Michigan and three other states governed by Democrats to provide data related to nursing homes and coronavirus deaths.\n\nFeds to Whitmer: Turn over COVID-19, nursing home data. She blasts back response.\n\nIn addition to the 19 resident deaths, the Villages of Lapeer Nursing & Rehabilitation has had 47 confirmed resident COVID-19 cases and 16 confirmed staff cases for the virus, according to the state's long-term care data. There have been no COVID-19 deaths among staff.\n\nWilliams said he still has nightmares about his mother's death.\n\n\"All I hear is my mom saying, 'Please help me,' the last time I seen her through the window. Over and over again,\" he said.\n\nWanda Parker arrived at the nursing home in November and was scheduled to stay only about 12 days for rehabilitation. Shortly after she arrived, she had a seizure, lost the use of her legs and was bedridden. She also had diabetes and heart disease, according to the lawsuit filed by her family.\n\nWhen she was younger, Williams said, his mom worked in some factories and stores. She loved her children and grandchildren.\n\n\"I never had nobody love me that much,\" Williams said.\n\nParker also loved to shop and give items to others, Williams said: \"You couldn't go to her house without leaving with a bag of stuff.\"'\n\nCoronavirus updates: 25 million global cases as US approaches 6 million; WHO warns of front line 'burnout'\n\nWilliams said he visited his mother daily at the nursing home. Before the virus, he would bring her food and drinks. After the pandemic hit Michigan, he had to visit her through the window.\n\n\"It was horrible to see what happened,\" he said. \"I feel guilty for even letting it happen, but I don't know what I could have did.\"\n\nWilliams' lawsuit states the former director of nursing \"severely understated the conditions at Villages during (an) initial conversation with the Lapeer County Health Department.\" It states the first day the nursing home tested any resident was April 3 and by April 21, there were 13 deaths.\n\nThe nursing home's management, it states, \"disregarded weeks-long internal reports of resident danger and continued to refuse to test residents and effectively continued to allow these dangerous conditions to persist in the face of a serious problem and imminent harm to numerous high-risk residents\" such as Parker.\n\nWilliams said at the hospital a nurse held the phone to his mother's ear so everyone could say goodbye since they couldn't go inside because of the virus.\n\nHe said the nursing home hasn't reached out since his mother's death. But it sent a bill for the month of April. It was for $1,300, said Laurila, one of Williams' attorneys.\n\nWilliams said his mother was a tough woman and just because she had health problems \"doesn't mean she was disposable.\"\n\n\"She always recovered from that stuff. She was not gonna die tomorrow,\" he said. \"I don't know how long she had, but she had a lot longer than she was given.\"\n\nFollow reporter Christina Hall on Twitter: @challreporter\n\nCompeting parties, clashing realities: Campaign's final sprint opens as conventions end",

    "Coronavirus in Florida: DeSantis vows never to lock down state again": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "MIAMI (AP) -- Some coronavirus restrictions started easing up Monday in parts of South Florida.\n\nIn Miami-Dade County, restaurants were allowed to welcome back diners to indoor seating for the first time in almost two months, provided masks were worn and the establishments operated at 50% capacity.\n\nIn Palm Beach County, officials issued an order allowing tattoo and body piercing parlors, as well as tanning salons, to reopen starting Monday.\n\nIn Miami-Dade County, most indoor dining has been banned in the county since early July to stop the spread of the coronavirus.\n\n\"This does not mean this is over by a long shot,\" Mayor Carlos Gimenez said in an online news conference. \"While we're heading in the right direction, we're not out of the woods.\"\n\nThe loosening up of restrictions in South Florida comes after Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said he was considering allowing South Florida to move into Phase 2 , which would allow more businesses to resume operations.\n\nDeSantis reiterated that idea Monday at a news conference in The Villages retirement community, saying he's looking at reopening bars and nightclubs and wants the three South Florida counties - Palm Beach, Broward and Miami-Dade - to join the rest of the state in reopening businesses.\n\n\"Everything's open except the nightclubs and the pubs, and that's something we're going to address,\" DeSantis said. \"We're going to work on our three southern Florida counties, getting them where we are. And that's really the last piece of the puzzle.\"\n\nDeSantis vowed never to have another lockdown in Florida. \"I hear people say they'll shut down the country, and, honestly, I cringe,\" he said.\n\nBefore his visit to The Villages, DeSantis held a panel discussion in Tallahassee with President Donald Trump's new pandemic adviser, Dr. Scott Atlas, who noted that infections and deaths are declining in the hardest hit states.\n\n\"The American public should feel cautiously optimistic here about what's going on,\" Atlas said. \"There is no need for fear at this point.\"\n\nAtlas downplayed the risk of infections in young people, saying activities like college football needed to be reopened because communities depended on them economically.\n\n\"This shouldn't really be a point of controversy. College football should be open. It can be done safely,\" Atlas said. \"College sports is a big part of America and it's a big part of the economic engine.\"\n\nAtlas also questioned the need to test people for coronavirus who do not have symptoms.\n\n\"When you start a program of testing simply to detect positive cases among asymptomatic low-risk groups, the outcome from that is to close the schools,\" Atlas said. \"And the goal of testing is not to close things. The goal of testing is to protect the vulnerable while we open the schools and open the economy.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Florida's largest school district resumed classes Monday, though they were online rather than in person. Miami-Dade County Public Schools' classes will remain online for at least a few weeks until the number of coronavirus cases in the county trends downward enough to resume in-person instruction.\n\nBut the online learning got off to a rocky start. The school district posted on Twitter that its website was having connectivity problems. \"The problem has been identified and staff is working diligently to resolve it,\" the district said Monday morning.\n\nFlorida reported around 1,900 new coronavirus cases Monday, raising the state's total to 623,471 cases. Florida also reported 68 new deaths Monday, raising the state's total to 11,331 deaths.\n\nA fourth Florida lawmaker reported having COVID-19. State Rep. Chris Latvala of Clearwater said on Facebook that he was being treated at the Largo Medical Center but expected his stay to be short. The Republican lawmaker said he had been self-isolating since last Wednesday.\n\n\"My symptoms vary,\" he said. \"This pandemic is not over but we will get through it. Keep wearing masks, social distancing, and washing your hands frequently.\"\n\nAlso Monday, DeSantis extended for the fifth time an executive order that placed a freeze on evictions and mortgage foreclosures. The freeze had been set to end Tuesday but will now last until October 1. The original order was signed April 2.",

    "Coronavirus pandemic leads to explosion in depression, anxiety in women": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "Kam-Mira Joy Edwards hasn't been able to sleep in weeks. She hasn't menstruated since March, maybe February. Her headaches seem unending.\n\nEdwards, a 32-year-old graduate student in clinical mental health counseling, knows she's struggling. Since COVID-19 emerged in the United States, she's felt both symptoms of both depression and anxiety, she said.\n\n\"I come out of it, and it's like I'll drop back in it. But every time I drop back in it, it gets worse,\" she said. \"Especially with everything that's going on.\"\n\nEdwards is going through a divorce, and her sister died in April. Either event would incur a heavy psychological toll on its own, but the pandemic has made it almost unbearable: The single mother of two, who also helps care for her father, is also trying to figure out how to approach education for her kids. Money is tight, and she can't find full-time work.\n\nAnd through it all, the isolation inherent to social distancing means she can't lean on her usual in-person support networks. She's tried booking appointments with a psychiatrist, but she can't find any openings.\n\n\"This is not something I've ever experienced before,\" she said. \"I'm surprised my hair hasn't fallen out.\"\n\nThe devastating spread of COVID-19 has put a spotlight not only on physical vulnerabilities, but also on the nation's mental health. Both depression and anxiety were already far more prevalent in women and, as early data pours in, it's becoming increasingly clear that the pandemic has exacerbated that disparity. Experts say that much of the growth stems from the pandemic's cultural and economic fallout: child care burdens, lost income and efforts to navigate children's education -- all of which are disproportionately affecting women. Researchers are also finding that transgender and non-binary people -- who are also already at greater risk for depression and anxiety -- may be facing greater psychological stress as well.\n\nAltogether, the surge threatens to create a new stress-test for the nation's already fragmented mental health care system, with ramifications that could play out for years.\n\n\"The pandemic, it widens existing disparities,\" said Dr. Cindy Liu, an assistant professor at Harvard Medical School. \"It's going to have long-term consequences.\"\n\nBehavioral health scientists haven't determined why women are more susceptible to depression and anxiety. But a key factor is that women typically work in lower-paying jobs and are more often put in caregiving roles. A robust body of research shows that lower wages are linked to mental disorders.\n\n\"When you don't have enough money, when you're taking care of someone, that is a risk factor,\" said Dr. Karen Martinez Gonzalez, an associate professor of psychiatry at the University of Puerto Rico. \"From what we know about women and jobs and how they are being paid, they will probably be more affected by this pandemic.\"\n\nSince the end of April, higher rates of women than men have reported symptoms of anxiety or depression, per data collected by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. As of July 14, 44 percent of women reported symptoms of at least one of the conditions, compared to 36 percent of men. About 30 percent of women indicated symptoms of only depression, compared to 26 percent of men; for only anxiety, the gap was 39.4 percent versus 31.5 percent.\n\nSince May, polling from the Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonprofit health care research group, has consistently shown women are more likely than men to say the pandemic has negatively affected their psychological well-being. The latest data, from July, found that 57 percent of women were likely to say COVID-19 had negatively affected their mental health, compared to 50 percent of men. Women were also more likely than men to report that their deteriorating psychological health translated to adverse physical effects.\n\nRace further compounds the issue. Since the end of April, Black and Latina women have been generally more likely than White women to report symptoms of depression or anxiety, though the gap has varied over the course of the pandemic, according to data the CDC shared with The 19th. At the end of June, 47.9 percent of Latina women and 45.8 percent of Black women reported symptoms of at least one condition, compared to 38.7 percent of White women. (In general, the difference between Black and Latina women has not been statistically significant.)\n\nNone of those datasets or surveys look specifically at nonbinary or transgender people. But observational research published this June in the Journal of General Internal Medicine found that they also experienced increases in depression and anxiety that accompanied the onset of COVID-19, a change the researchers suggest could be influenced by factors like the weakening economy, fear of the virus and social isolation. In March and April, Trans Lifeline -- a peer support mental health hotline for transgender people -- experienced a 78 percent increase in crisis calls, said Bri Barnett, a spokesperson for the organization.\n\nJob insecurity is a risk factor for anxiety and depression. In general, the economic downturn has generally hit women harder than men, and Latina women have been affected more than any other group, seeing a 21 percent loss in jobs, per data analyzed by the Pew Charitable Trusts. Black women experience a 17 percent drop. Black women and Latinas also have far greater likelihood of working a job that's been deemed essential, meaning they're at heightened risk of going out in the world, contracting the virus and potentially passing it onto others -- yet another psychological burden.\n\n\"You're talking about two groups where the pay gap is quite dramatically different,\" said Margarita Alegria, a professor at Harvard Medical School's psychiatry department and chair of Massachusetts General Hospital's Disparities Research Unit. \"You're talking about poverty, you're talking about unemployment rates being higher, and you're talking about less support.\"\n\nData collected by the Human Rights Campaign found that 19 percent of transgender people had become unemployed because of the pandemic. Among non-White transgender people, that jumped to 26 percent.\n\n\"This isn't surprising to us,\" said Annesa Flentje, an associate professor at the University of California-San Francisco, who authored the General Internal Medicine Report. \"You have a group that already had less, and was more disadvantaged, and then something like this happens.\"\n\nEarly data collected by academic researchers also suggests that moms are at greatest risk because they most often shoulder the burden of homeschooling, according to a paper out of the University of Utah. It's a psychological burden that women's health researchers worry could re-emerge this fall, as schools' reopening plans remain unclear at best. A June paper out of the University of Southern California found that, in two-adult, mixed-gender households, women in general were more likely to report psychological distress following the pandemic. But the burden was most pronounced for women with children.\n\n\"There's a problem, and this is a problem that's affecting moms more than other groups,\" said Gema Zamarro, the paper's lead author and a professor at the University of Arkansas. Zamarro was moved to do the research, she said, by her own distress while juggling parenting and work in the pandemic.\n\nGenerally, research looks at mixed-gender, two-parent households. But that leaves out many other households.\n\nAbout 39 percent of women who identify as LGBTQ are raising children, according to data provided by the Williams Institute, though it's unclear how many of those households have one or more parents. In households with multiple, same-sex parents, it's also unclear what the divsion of child care looks like, said Kerith Conron, research director at the Williams Institute, which is run out of the University of California-Los Angeles.\n\nBut what researchers stress is that, though the data doesn't capture it, the same child care stressors do afflict single moms. About 23 percent of children live in households headed by a single mother, compared to 4 percent in a single-father household, according to data from the U.S. Census Bureau.\n\nStephanie Guzman Ferran, who lives near San Diego, said navigating homeschooling has been perhaps the biggest single source of anxiety -- and she has plenty to choose from. Guzman Ferran, 38, raises her teenagers on her own. She earns $13 an hour working at the local supermarket. She can't visit her mom, stepdad or grandmother because her job puts her at risk. Already, she has a history of post-traumatic stress disorder and anxiety. And she's nervous about the prospect of putting her teenage kids in school.\n\n\"I really want my son to be on a campus, but that's putting my kids at risk, too. They have chronic asthma. Anything can get them sick,\" she said. But, she added, \"the stress of trying to educate your kids is one of the hardest things.\"\n\nFor Black women in particular, it's not just the viral pandemic. The national upheaval over anti-Black racism has taken a psychological toll. Researchers are only beginning to understand the extent of racism's mental health impact, Brown said, but it adds a powerful layer on top of the stressors imposed by COVID-19 and its economic fallout.\n\nThe data is already bearing that out: The CDC's mental health figures showed a significant increase in Black women's rates of depression and anxiety starting on May 26 -- the day after George Floyd's death. The same spike didn't appear for White, Asian or Latina women.\n\n\"We find ourselves in a critical place, especially with COVID, especially with the heightened conversation about racism in Black communities,\" said Andrea Brown, executive director of the Baltimore-based Black Mental Health Alliance. \"Having to juggle all these glass balls is a struggle.\"\n\nAs the psychological stressors accumulate, medical experts worry that the nation's mental health infrastructure is ill-equipped to address the growing need. The same barriers that are disproportionately affecting mental health -- child care, extra household work, financial insecurity and, quite simply, too few hours in a day -- also make it harder to put aside resources for mental health treatment, or therapy. Even for those who have health insurance, psychiatrists are often not covered.\n\nAnd though Black and Latina women are particularly vulnerable to symptoms of anxiety and depression, they are less likely than White women to access treatment, federal data shows. The mental health workforce is disproportionately White, even though researchers have long argued that a more representative workforce could help address mistrust of the health system that is more prevalent amongst non-White Americans. Many of the same factors that limit non-White women also curtail mental health care access for gender minorities.\n\n\"If you're not able to get to work or make our appointments and see your doctor and get support -- even if it's limited support available now -- if you can't get that, it's going to be harder,\" Liu said. \"It's going to have a compounding effect for individuals who don't have access. They're going to sadly fall through the cracks.\"\n\nThe implications are multifold. Depression can be a risk factor for heart disease and diabetes, and anxiety is associated with conditions including thyroid disease, migraines and respiratory problems.\n\nAnd these too are conditions whose burdens are unevenly distributed. Black Americans are more likely than White ones to die of heart disease, and diabetes is in general more common among Latinx and Black people than it is among White people. And untreated, the pandemic's heavier psychiatric burden could exacerbate those gaps.\n\n\"It's going to compound the issue we've seen before,\" Liu added. \"It's tragic, it's devastating because of the compounding, this cascading.\"\n\nFor Ola Foy, 36, those factors are already constellating. Foy, an army contractor in Brooklyn, already has a history of depression and anxiety, and her mental health has deteriorated as a result of the pandemic. On some days, she can barely get herself out of bed. She works from home with her three children; since she and her husband have separated, she is the primary caretaker and home-schooler in her family.\n\nThe burden is overwhelming, she said, especially when it comes to school. She doesn't want to put her kids at risk, but if she can't send her kids back, either she or her husband might have to cut back on work to make things work or move back in together.\n\n\"You have a lot of people now falling into depression and anxiety, because it is a lot,\" she said. \"And then, on top of this pandemic? Forget about it.\"\n\nFoy says she's seeing the psychological burden affect other aspects of her health. After getting her initial psychiatric diagnosis, she said, she gained weight and developed prediabetes, conditions she believes are all related. Now, she said, she experiences frequent, draining headaches accompanied by blurred vision. It's so bad that she's scheduled an MRI with a neurologist.\n\nShe's tried to find a psychiatrist, but early on in the pandemic, no one she called was taking new visitors. Even now, despite her good health insurance, she can't find someone in-network.\n\n\"I don't want to get to the point where I have to be hospitalized,\" she said. \"I don't feel like there's enough professionals out there.\"\n\nMental health care is also only one part of the equation. Disparities researchers pointed to the cultural and economic factors that are disproportionately driving the mental health gender gap, that could be addressed via public policy: child care, or more generous paid leave policies from work, or stronger unemployment benefits, to name a few.\n\nAmped up social benefits policies, researchers argued, might be easier, quicker fixes than plugging holes in coverage and building up a more robust and representative mental health care infrastructure.\n\n\"If you have to work around the clock, you can hardly sleep because you have a job, and you have to homeschool your children, and you're more responsible, and are cleaning your house and are doing basically everything, and you're stressed out -- there's not an easy mental health treatment that is an answer for that,\" said Dr. Veerle Bergink, who heads the women's mental health program at Mt. Sinai Hospital, in New York. \"If there is no financial support, and you have to work so many hours at a time where at the same time you have to look after your family, whether it's parents or children -- people are not made to do this.\"",

    "Coronavirus vaccine: Employers may force workers to get vaccinated": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "Employers grappling with COVID-19's impact on the workplace may soon be forced to make another tough decision after months of agonizing over layoffs, furloughs and the right strategies to keep their businesses afloat during the pandemic.\n\nThe next challenge? Should they require workers to take vaccines?\n\nSome companies concerned about liability issues, health and safety may need to decide whether to force their employees to get vaccinated if they want to continue working or return to the office, experts say.\n\nAnd some experts are already calling on employers to make it mandatory, which, they say, would generally be legal. But others caution against mandates, saying that they could backfire by making Americans more resistant to a vaccine they're already concerned about and more likely to embrace anti-vaxxer sentiment.\n\nThree Case Western University professors argued in a recent op-ed for USA TODAY that Americans should be compelled to get vaccinated, saying one option is that \"private businesses could refuse to employ or serve unvaccinated individuals.\"\n\nSuch a requirement could place employers in conflict with their workers, given that more than 1 in 3 Americans say they wouldn't get a COVID-19 vaccine today even if it were free and approved by the Food and Drug Administration, according to a Gallup poll conducted July 20 through Aug. 2. The most common reason why some Americans are nervous about the vaccine is the speed with which it's being developed, followed by fears that the risks will outweigh the benefits, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll conducted May 13-19.\n\nBut while requiring workers to get vaccinated could raise ethical issues - should people be forced to get immunized if they have religious, philosophical or personal objections? - some experts say those can be overcome for the sake of protecting everyone.\n\n\"It's very much in keeping with an employer's responsibility for maintaining the health and wellbeing of its workers to require it,\" said Denise Rousseau, professor of organizational behavior and public policy at Carnegie Mellon University's Heinz College.\n\nVaccine race: Could a coronavirus vaccine rehab the pharmaceutical industry's reputation?\n\n2020 flu shot season: Walgreens, CVS pharmacists to check for coronavirus symptoms, wear face shields\n\nAnthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, has predicted that a vaccine will be available by late 2020 or early 2021. There are dozens of potential vaccines in the works, including ones from drug companies like Pfizer, Moderna, Johnson & Johnson, AstraZeneca, Merck and GlaxoSmithKline.\n\nDorit Reiss, a law professor at the University of California, Hastings College of the Law, and an expert on vaccine requirements, said she expects certain employers to require the vaccine - potentially including organizations with at-risk workers, such as meat-processing plants and hospitals.\n\n\"Legally every employer can require it - you don't have to be a high-risk employer to require it,\" she said. \"On one hand, employers will be concerned about pushback from employees. On the other hand, they'll also be concerned about COVID outbreaks that can be prevented.\"\n\nBut some vaccine proponents say that requiring workers to get immunized, even if well-intentioned, would be counterproductive.\n\n\"Unfortunately when you go straight to a requirement for something, even though you think it's wonderful, that just does not go over well with a lot of people,\" said Kelly Moore, associate director for immunization education for the pro-vaccine Immunization Action Coalition.\n\nShe said companies shouldn't rush to require vaccination quickly after any COVID-19 vaccine is released. Due to the inevitable lack of long-term health data on the vaccine, she said it's important for employers to follow the guidance of public health professionals as they monitor the impacts and performance of the inoculation.\n\n\"The first thing we do with a new vaccine is educate people about it, answer their questions, monitor how it's accepted and how it works,\" she said. \"Companies who are trying to do a good thing for their employees will look around and say, 'What does public health recommend?' And at this stage a requirement for these vaccines would not be recommended.\"\n\nTo be sure, vaccination requirements aren't unusual in certain settings. For example, all 50 states require schoolchildren to obtain a certificate of immunization for several vaccines, according to the Immunization Action Coalition, a pro-vaccine advocacy group. Required vaccines included those that prevent tetanus, diphtheria and pertussis (Tdap); polio; chickenpox; and measles, mumps and rubella (MMR). Every state provides exemptions for medical reasons, while some allow exemptions for religious or philosophical reasons.\n\nAnd most hospitals require workers to get a flu shot every year to help protect themselves and patients. But vaccines for MMR, polio, chickenpox, the flu and other diseases have a long track record of safety that the COVID-19 vaccine won't have when it is first released.\n\n\"It's certainly not unheard of\" for employers to require vaccines, said Bunny Ellerin, director of the Healthcare and Pharmaceutical Management Program at Columbia Business School. \"The issue is there are a number of people who are not going to want to take a vaccine. So I think more likely what people are going to do is strongly suggest it.\"\n\nJohnny C. Taylor Jr., CEO of the Society for Human Resource Management, an HR professional society, said in a recent Q&A for USA TODAY that \"generally speaking,\" employers are allowed to impose vaccine mandates.\n\n\"For decades, health care and education employers have required employees to take the flu shot and show proof of other major vaccinations - such as those for tetanus, polio or measles - since they are in close contact with vulnerable populations such as children, the elderly and immunocompromised people,\" Taylor wrote. \"I predict, because of the damage COVID-19 has done to lives and livelihoods, we will see many more employers in other sectors make this a requirement.\"\n\nSome exemptions typically apply, including religious reasons. But it's not necessarily enough for people to express concerns about the health and safety implications of getting vaccinated.\n\nSeveral government agencies did not comment on potential employer mandates when contacted by USA TODAY for this article. The Department of Labor referred questions to the CDC, which referred questions to the Department of Health and Human Services, home to the FDA, which referred questions to the CDC.\n\nInstead of requiring vaccination as a condition of employment, employers may take one of several other approaches, experts say. They could:\n\n* Require it to work from the office.\n\nLegally, employers would be required to make reasonable accommodations for workers who refuse to get vaccinated, Reiss said. Such an accommodation could include allowing them to work from home, which millions of Americans are already doing.\n\n* Advocate voluntary inoculation and run vaccination clinics at the workplace.\n\n\"Bring folks in to make it easy,\" Ellerin said. \"Make sure there's no penalty for taking time off to get it done. Just make it really accessible.\"\n\n* Pay for it.\n\nWhile it's possible that the federal government will end up picking up the tab, it's also possible that workers will need to foot part of the bill. Employers should pressure their health care insurance providers to pick up the cost, Ellerin said.\n\nHealth experts say that it's vital for a critical mass of Americans to get vaccinated for immunizations to begin defeating COVID-19. While a vaccine is unlikely to be 100% effective against contracting COVID-19, it is likely to help prevent many Americans from getting the disease while reducing the severity of the symptoms for many others.\n\n\"If we want to decrease deaths, if we want to decrease hospitalizations, if we want to decrease ventilator use, we have to have maximization of the vaccination to be effective,\" said Wilbur Chen, chief of the adult clinical studies section at the University of Maryland School of Medicine's Center for Vaccine Development & Global Health. \"At least in those communities that have higher uptake, I'll expect we'll have less disease, less cases\" and fewer patients who need medical treatment.\n\nWhile the anti-vaxxer movement has gained currency among some Americans in recent months due to their concerns over how fast the process is moving, Chen said he's confident in the FDA's expedited procedures for authorizing COVID-19 vaccines.\n\n\"It's pretty clear that they're not skipping over anything,\" he said. \"They want to have efficacy, they want to have safety, they want to have the vaccine examined in diverse parts of the population by gender, by race, by ethnicity. They want to have all ages evaluated.\"\n\nThat said, experts acknowledge that they won't have long-term health data for the vaccine until well after it's been approved for the marketplace.\n\nWhile most employers will likely spurn mandates, it will be \"common sense\" for some to require vaccination, such as meat-processing facilities that have experienced outbreaks due to the close proximity of workers in the factory, Ellerin said.\n\n\"There will be certain environments I believe where you'll have no choice. If you're working next to somebody in a factory, I think it's pretty obvious that you need to do that,\" she said, adding that hospitals are another obvious place.\n\nSome employers should brace for a fight if they decide to impose mandates on their workers.\n\n\"On workplace infectious disease exposures, labor has a history of taking the position that employers must offer the vaccine to employees at no cost, but not be mandatory, in order to be safe from workplace exposures associated with their job,\" said Rebecca Reindel, safety and health director of the AFL-CIO, a conglomeration of unions, in an email.\n\nShe added: \"We are supportive of individuals/workers getting vaccinated if the vaccines are demonstrated to be safe and effective. This issue also could be subject to collective bargaining rules and workers' representatives would address the tradeoffs and procedures involved in such a decision.\"\n\nOfficials should focus most of their efforts on educating the public about the need to get vaccinated, rather than imposing mandates, said Immunization Action Coalition advocate Moore, a former director of the Tennessee Immunization Program and a former member of the FDA panel that makes recommendations on vaccine policy.\n\n\"I have seen requirements backfire,\" she said. \"I learned a lot from our experience with the HPV cancer vaccine. It's really one where well-intentioned efforts at requirements caused a lot of damage to the public's trust -- completely accidentally, without intention but with repercussions we're still dealing with more than a decade after this vaccine came out.\"\n\nThat vaccine - which is \"unbelievably effective\" and \"long-lasting,\" Moore said - prevents cancers related to HPV.\n\n\"But when it was first introduced, a lot of well-intentioned people thought it would be great to require this vaccine immediately because they didn't want another young girl to face cervical cancer,\" she said. \"That, unfortunately, became a political football. People began questioning immediately, 'Why are you requiring me to take something I don't understand?'\"\n\nIn her home state of Tennessee, legislators responded to talk of a mandate by introducing a bill that would have prohibited health authorities from requiring a vaccine without a vote of the legislature. Moore said that requirements can be helpful, but usually only when there's a small percentage of holdouts.\n\n\"In my experience, requirements must be used judiciously and only in concert with broad public acceptance,\" she said.\n\nShe said she \"can't imagine\" employers requiring vaccination until long-term data is available on a COVID-19 vaccine and the FDA provides full licensure, not just emergency authorization, which is likely the first step to launch distribution.\n\nStill, employers legally don't have to wait for full licensure to require vaccination, said Reiss, the UC Hastings expert on vaccine law. They must make exceptions for people for medical reasons. And they must make accommodations for people with religious objections, but not if doing so would \"create a direct threat\" to other employees or customers, Reiss said. She noted that COVID-19 could be an example of a crisis in which religious exemptions may not be tolerated.\n\n\"What courts are looking for is a good faith effort to work something out\" when objections arise, she said. \"You have to show an effort to find a solution.\"\n\nBut if the effort would impose \"undue costs,\" the employer can maintain the requirement, she said.\n\n\"Ethically you can say that high-risk employment places may have an obligation and certainly have a very good justification for imposing such a mandate,\" she said.\n\nFollow USA TODAY reporter Nathan Bomey on Twitter @NathanBomey.",

        "authors": [],
        "body": "COLUMBUS, Ohio - Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine's second COVID-19 test came back negative Thursday evening.\n\nDeWine tested positive for the novel coronavirus on Thursday morning using a rapid test. That test was part of the protocol to greet President Donald Trump on the tarmac at Burke Lakefront Airport in Cleveland.\n\nDeWine then returned to Columbus and took a second COVID-19 test from Ohio State University's Wexner Medical Center. That polymerase chain reaction or PCR test came back negative late Thursday night.\n\nFirst lady Fran DeWine and staff members also tested negative.\n\nThe first test was an antigen test. The second test was a PCR test, which looks at specific genetic material for the virus. It's known to be more sensitive and accurate.\n\nMore: Which members of Congress have tested positive for COVID-19?\n\nPCR tests for the governor, first lady and staff were run twice and came back negative both times. They were run on two different diagnostic platforms.\n\n\"We feel confident in the results from Wexner Medical Center,\" DeWine said in a released statement. \"This is the same PCR test that has been used over 1.6 million times in Ohio by hospitals and labs all over the state.\"\n\nAntigen or rapid tests aren't prevalent in Ohio yet. DeWine announced on Tuesday that Ohio would soon acquire 500,000 rapid tests as part of a collaboration with five other states.\n\n\"We will be working with the manufacturer to have a better understanding of how the discrepancy between these two tests could have occurred,\" DeWine said in the statement.\n\nMike and Fran DeWine plan to take another PCR test Saturday, out of an abundance of caution and at the direction of doctors. Those results will be released.\n\nDeWine had planned to quarantine for 14 days at his Cedarville home. He already keeps a small circle of in-person contacts: his wife, Lt. Gov. Jon Husted, security personnel and a few staff members.\n\n\"I spend most days right here anyway,\" DeWine said via videoconference from the front porch of his home. \"I'm on the phone a lot. I'm on conference calls a lot.\"\n\nDeWine isn't the first governor to test positive for COVID-19. Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt announced he had the disease several weeks ago. Last month, DeWine's state prisons' director, Annette Chambers-Smith, announced she received a positive COVID-19 test result after feeling slight symptoms.\n\nDeWine took some of the earliest aggressive action to combat the spread of COVID-19 in his state, one of the first five governors to close bars, restaurants, and wineries in March.\n\nDuring the first few months of the pandemic, Ohio was reported as an early success story. The state gradually lifted its stay-at-home order throughout May and June and saw a plateau in newly reported cases, as well as a decline in hospitalizations.\n\nIn recent weeks, however, cases began to surge, with the state reporting more than 1,000 new cases per day for most of July.\n\n\"We're going the wrong way,\" Dewine said of the uptick in cases to NBC's Meet the Press last month.\n\n\"We are at a crucial stage. We are at the point where we could become Florida,\" he said, issuing a statewide mask mandate in late July.",

Elliott was isolated from teammates and friends as he rested and tried to avoid transmitting the virus to others. He passed the time by gaming online via streaming service Twitch. He was more vocal on social media, too, an offseason trend he showed in May, when Elliott joined NFL stars in a Black Lives Matter video to Roger Goodell.\n\n\"It definitely was good to get back out and moving once I got out of quarantine,\" Elliott said.\n\nAfter he recovered and was cleared to exercise again, Elliott joined offensive teammates working out at quarterback Dak Prescott's newly commissioned backyard football field. Elliott ran routes with teammates including receivers Amari Cooper, Michael Gallup and rookie CeeDee Lamb. Tight end Blake Jarwin joined. All realized the depth of the weapons their unit brings. Prescott praised his teammates for showing no ego about ball distribution.\n\nElliott said Monday he expects his load to be similar to that of previous years. In 2019, his 355 combined touches (301 rushes, 54 receptions) accounted for 42.4% of the Cowboys' total. During Elliott's other two full seasons with Dallas (he was suspended six games in 2017), Elliott accounted for 47.9% (381 touches) and 42.9 (354) percent of Cowboys touches.\n\n\"Obviously, Zeke has been such a weapon and a force as far as his opportunities here in the past,\" head coach Mike McCarthy, who's tinkered the offense with coordinator Kellen Moore, said Monday. \"That will continue.\"\n\nMcCarthy said he's not worried that just four of Elliott's 301 carries last season netted 20 yards. McCarthy looks instead to the 4.5 yards per carry Elliott averaged in 2019. McCarthy says Elliott's film underlines his competency as a threat on outside-, inside- and tight-zone runs.\n\n\"No flaws there, as far as him as a runner,\" McCarthy said. \"You can see on the screens and some of the big plays he did have: He finishes runs. He finishes plays.\n\n\"His ability to be a multiple-run force runner is something I think we'll will definitely utilize.\"\n\nElliott expects to better acclimated for the opener this year than when he trained in Cabo San Lucas, Mexico, during the entirety of the Cowboys' 2019 training camp while holding out for a contract extension. The Cowboys signed Elliott to a six-year, $90 million deal five days before last season's opener.\n\nThis year, he's working with teammates on the timing of his runs, sitting in the front row of meetings room, per McCarthy, and hammering repetition on an element of his game he hopes to threaten with even further this season.\n\nMonday during practice, Elliott was active in team drills as a pass-catcher. Prescott continually found him on short-yardage and deep gains down the turf of the Ford Center. The \"no-flaw\" runner says the passing game was his primary emphasis during summer workouts.\n\n\"This offseason I really didn't do anything from the backfield,\" Elliott said. \"I did a lot of stuff from out at receiver, in the slot. Just trying to evolve my game there, just so I can be more of a viable source in the pass game.\"\n\nBut don't ask him for a target number of targets, or yards, or how he'll define success in the evolution of his pass game. Elliott juked when asked Monday about his individual goals for 2020.\n\n\"My individual goals are just win a Super Bowl,\" he said. \"We have a great team. This is our time. That's all of our goals.\n\n\"Just win a Super Bowl and everything else is going to fall in place after that.\"",

    "Daycare and COVID-19: How to pick nanny, child care amid coronavirus": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "Schools are reopening virtually or with part-time \"hybrid\" models, parents are returning to work and general \"coronavirus fatigue\" has set in months since the start of the pandemic.\n\nFor many families, day care is the only option to support themselves and their children, but that opens up many other questions: How safe is child care in COVID-19 times? What protocols should day care centers have in place? Does it matter if kids are separated into pods?\n\nTo help with parents' decisions on when and where to send their children back to day care, USA TODAY spoke with three pediatric health experts to get some practical tips and questions to ask themselves and their child care providers.\n\nBack to school and COVID-19: Everything to know as students head back to class\n\n\"I wish there was a simple answer,\" said Dr. Andrew Hashikawa, a University of Michigan pediatric emergency medicine physician. \"Families are quite different.\"\n\nSome families may have an adult living with them with an underlying condition that puts them at a higher risk, Dr. Charlene Wong, a Duke University pediatrician, said. In those cases, they'll need to consider if sending a child to a day center is the right choice.\n\nBut for many families, Wong notes, sending a child to day care is a necessity, given the high costs of private care and parents' work. Additionally, with competitive programs and limited capacities, the number of day care centers a family can consider may also be limited, Wong said.\n\nIn cases where there is only one option, Wong said families should be as communicative as possible about their specific needs with the staff. Hashikawa said, for example, if a child has asthma, do they have the necessary medication available to them while at the center or does the center know the child's asthma action plan?\n\nWong notes that centers also may be facing financial constraints amid the pandemic. \"If there are families that can help out ... just ask the school if there are ways that they can help,\" she said. \"Offer support for the staff who are all working so hard.\"\n\nIf a family has the financial resources, some have turned sharing a private tutor or babysitter with other families nearby - often dubbed a \"pandemic pod.\" Hashikawa said asking a family member who is not at higher risk for complications to help may be an option, too.\n\nIn any scenario, Hashikawa said having a back up plan in place is important in case a center closes or a babysitter gets sick.\n\nKnow your local COVID-19 numbers.\n\nData should be driving families' and local officials' decisions about whether to send a child to a day care center and also in what capacity the centers are open, experts said.\n\n\"The number one thing to consider is what the rates of COVID-19 are in your community,\" Wong said.\n\nIf there is an active surge in cases in your town or county, it may be time to limit the number of people your children are exposed to, Wong said.\n\nSending a child to a day care center in parts of a state like Massachusetts poses a lower risk right now than states like Texas or Florida, Hashikawa noted. And it's unknown where and when future spikes could occur, making it all the more important to have the most recent and most local data available to parents, Wong said.\n\nUS coronavirus map: Tracking the outbreak in your state\n\nWhile pulling a child from a daycare is not an easy decision and won't be feasible for every family, Wong said it's still important to know the local numbers and stay informed.\n\nWong said within day care settings, separating children into different pods with their own teachers that don't interact with the other students or teachers is one of the most important things a facility can do.\n\nAsking for young preschool students to physically distance can be extremely challenging, but limiting the number of people they come in contact with once at school limits exposure risk, she said.\n\n\"If there is a case of COVID-19 in a teacher or student then the number of people exposed is the smallest possible,\" she said.\n\n'Time for innovation': How tutoring could be a key to lifting kids out of 'COVID slide'\n\n\"If you are able to have truly separate pods, if you have teachers and students that can stay with those pods, it does make a difference,\" Hashikawa added. \"If you're putting 15 to 20 people in a room, that's a lot different than having 8 or 9 in a room.\"\n\nWhile the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says there's no optimal minimum or maximum number of students that should be in one pod, the smaller the cohort, the better. Small cohorts also may not be truly separated from each other as students in one group may have a sibling in another, the CDC notes.\n\nAdditionally, a day care center that allots time to be outside can also help reduce risk, Dr. Camille Sabella, a pediatric infectious diseases specialist at the Cleveland Clinic, said. While there is a fear that children won't stay apart during recess, \"being outside really is one of the best things we can do to prevent the spread of this virus from person to person,\" he said.\n\nThe CDC agrees. On its website, the agency says activities held outside in general are safer than inside, where there may be less ventilation.\n\nHashikawa said he's seen centers that are \"recreating their play time\" and trying to include being outdoors into the curriculum when feasible.\n\nSome of the cleanliness practices day cares are including in their COVID-19 protocols are things most parents would hope they were doing anyways, Sabella noted.\n\nCertain viruses and bacteria that were around before the new coronavirus can spread even more easily on surfaces like toys, he said.\n\nWhile there may not be documentation about the cleaning of every toy in a center, day care staff may keep track of how often the center as a whole is cleaned, he said.\n\nMore on child care safety measures: Day cares welcome mask-wearing toddlers as parents struggle to 'make best decision' in COVID-19 world\n\n\"The devil is in the details,\" Hashikawa said. A COVID-19 safety plan should be thorough and transparent. \"If that's not there, I worry quite a bit about the child care center,\" he said.\n\nFor example, does the child care center screen for symptoms or a fever on site or is it up to the parents to self-report that information from an at home screening, Sabella asked. The actual ratio of students to teachers or day care attendees matters, too, he said. Though even before COVID-19, that number may be dictated by state law.\n\nIf the center is able to, consulting with a pediatric public health expert is one of the best ways to ensure that staff has every area covered, and it also gives them someone to check back in with if needed, Hashikawa said.\n\nA hybrid model of schooling -- going in person part time and staying home the other time -- could work well to reduce children's risk of spreading the virus, Sabella said.\n\nWhat could make the hybrid model more of a challenge is if children spend their days when not physically in school at daycares instead, he said.\n\nThe hybrid model works well for children who can be unsupervised for some periods of time, such as middle and high schoolers. But for younger children, the time not physically in school may \"get diverted to child care centers,\" Hashikawa said. Sending children to two separate locations and with different groups could increase potential exposure to the virus, he added.\n\nChildren under 2 years old should not be wearing face coverings. It's dangerous, Wong said. But children above 2 years old should be given more credit for their ability to mask.\n\nSabella said while it may not be true in every case, it's possible for children to wear masks for the length of a day care day, it just needs to be done correctly.\n\n\"Kids can certainly be rule followers with good teaching techniques and talking about it the right way and getting kids involved,\" Sabella said. \"I think kids are much more willing to be compliant with (wearing a mask) ... people will be surprised.\"\n\nHashikawa said it's also helpful when centers openly talk about wearing masks with the children and actively include it into the curriculum. \"Make it fun. Make something that is kind of cool to do,\" he said.\n\nCOVID-19 disparities: Hispanic, Black children at higher risk of coronavirus-related hospitalization, CDC says\n\nFor parents who can afford it, splitting the cost of a babysitter with other families nearby has become a popular way to get child care and reduce the risk of spreading the virus.\n\nBut what's important is asking about the people you're letting into the \"pandemic pod.\"\n\n'Pandemic pods': As school starts online, parents need to study up on 'pandemic pods' - and what they mean for equity\n\n\"What we are trying to do is to reduce the number of people who are sort of in your circle who you have regular and frequent close contact with,\" Wong said. \"So it's important to ask: What is that babysitter's circle looking like during the COVID-19 pandemic?\"\n\nBefore the pandemic, questions like, \"How many people do you live with?\" or \"How often do you go out to bars and restaurants?\" may seem intrusive. But those are the kinds of things parents should be asking now, Wong said.\n\nLike with a child care center, parents need a back-up and communication plan with their babysitter, especially in case someone inside the \"pandemic pod\" gets sick, Hashikawa said.\n\nIt's important to discuss with children the importance of wearing masks and washing their hands, Wong said, and having those discussions in a way that emphasizes \"play\" and \"fun\" can be most effective.\n\nWhether it's singing \"Happy Birthday\" twice when washing hands or making masks with their favorite TV characters, Wong said more positive communication around the pandemic will have a better effect than fear-based learning.\n\nWong also said showing your children your own safety practices can reinforce good behaviors for when you're not around. If a child sees you wearing a mask, it'll make more sense to them when they see their teacher in a mask, she said.\n\nSabella added that at this point in the pandemic, children are probably very attuned to these safety practices, too.\n\n\"If this was in March or April and we were trying to do this, I think it would be somewhat different, but now that it's several months later and a lot the kids have been isolating, I think they get it,\" he said.\n\n\"Even the youngest ones, they're wearing their masks, they're washing their hands. They're even asking me if i'm washing my hands,\" Sabella said.",

    "Daycare centers during COVID: What preschool looks like in a pandemic": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "AUSTIN, Texas - The afternoon heat had hit 95 degrees when the back door swung open to the playground at the Sweet Briar Child Development Center, nestled in the middle of an apartment complex in south Austin. Five toddlers meandered out of the building and onto the playground, followed by two teachers, their noses and mouths covered by masks. One teacher pushed a cart holding small pitchers, watering cans and a bucket of water toward a garden teeming with flowers.\n\n\"Let's water the sunflowers!\" the teacher said, handing children the pitchers and watering cans.\n\nThe children spread out, sprinkling water on their roots and gazing up at stalks that towered over them. After a few minutes, the teachers began herding the children away from the garden, and one wheeled the water cart back into the building.\n\nIn the past, the water may have stayed outside to fill a water table or sensory bin, where little hands could splash and children could cool off in the Texas heat. But at a time when Texas is still seeing high numbers of Coronavirus cases, including at child care centers, emergency rules meant to prevent the transmission of the virus mean water tables and sensory bins are strongly discouraged.\n\nNationwide, many child care centers and preschools that managed to survive the coronavirus-induced shutdown are now trying to open their doors once more. Those that did not shut down permanently are facing immense obstacles, including staff shortages and a lack of funds, as well as arduous requirements for cleaning and sanitizing. In some states, agencies that oversee child care have given centers dozens of pages of new, more stringent regulations that, among other things, require centers to keep all children's belongings at school, to stop serving family-style meals and to clean more frequently than ever.\n\nSome new requirements for centers mean toddler and preschool classrooms have lost or are discouraging some of the basic elements of early childhood, like experiencing the world through physical touch and learning to share toys with friends. In many cases, parents can no longer enter center buildings and must hand their children off at the front door or even commit to sending their child to a center without ever having set foot inside it.\n\nAt a center in Utah, older children are wearing masks and learning to \"walk like mummies\" to keep distant from other children. In Arizona, children make \"airplane arms\" when standing in line to leave more space between each child. Across the country, children are changing into indoor shoes when they enter classrooms, relinquishing their bags and lunchboxes for daily disinfecting, and are no longer mingling in groups on playgrounds.\n\nEven hugs are being discouraged: In recently released recommendations by the Child Development Associate Credential Advisory Committee, made up of five early learning educators, it was suggested that early childhood instructors \"teach children to air hug, hug a teddy bear or hug themselves.\"\n\nExperts say many of these practices and recommendations cropped up, out of an abundance of caution, at the height of the pandemic in centers that served children of essential workers, but are not appropriate or practical in the long run.\n\n\"You can't tell a 3-year-old to not hug their friends or be with a friend,\" said Susan Hedges, the director of quality assessment and assurance at the National Association for the Education of Young Children (NAEYC). \"It's bad for them. It's bad for their social emotional health, and it's just not feasible.\"\n\nBut many of the recommendations are here to stay as long as coronavirus is a threat. In Texas, the emergency rules for child care centers require centers to screen parents and children outside for coronavirus-related symptoms at drop-off and to train workers in COVID-19 infection control procedures. HVAC systems must be adjusted to allow fresh air to enter the building. Any \"secretions\" on a child's clothes must result in immediately changing the clothes, and caregivers must wash their hands and the child's hands afterward. Groups of children are supposed to stay with the same caregiver each day and remain separate from other groups.\n\nSome experts and center directors say these requirements, while necessary to control the virus within centers, only add to the stress of running a child care center. Many child care programs operated on razor-thin profit margins before the pandemic, and losing income in the form of tuition payments for several months has been devastating.\n\n\"Frankly, the hardest thing for programs, I think, will be able to stay in business while making the changes they have to make to ensure safety,\" Hedges said. Centers will need to purchase extra sanitation equipment and supplies and possibly hire more staff members to maintain smaller groups of students, while at the same time taking on fewer children, which will lead to a drop in income.\n\nNew coronavirus cases at schools: How much you know depends on where you live\n\n\"That can be crippling to the point of making programs not viable,\" Hedges said.\n\nSome states have directed federal CARES Act money to provide grants for centers that need to purchase personal protective equipment like masks, but experts largely agree more funding is desperately needed to help centers that are reopening get off the ground. Some centers have resorted to GoFundMe campaigns to raise money after seeing their enrollment drop by more than half. Others have been helped temporarily by local foundations and grants.\n\nPat Smith, the owner of Sweet Briar, which has two locations in south Austin, is grateful for the financial support she has received from the state, including money for the children they serve who rely on state subsidies for care, even if those children haven't been in attendance. The state also has paid centers 25% more than the normal subsidy reimbursement rate, which typically falls below the actual cost of caring for children. That money came via federal funds provided to states through the CARES Act specifically for child care-related costs. The center was also paid by the state for serving children of essential workers.\n\nBut Sweet Briar has not avoided other changes that child care programs are experiencing. Enrollment has dropped from 85 to about 50 kids, a number that fluctuates daily. Both Sweet Briar locations have stayed open to serve the children of essential workers throughout the pandemic, which has resulted in a constant learning curve as new information about the coronavirus and requirements for child care centers has changed.\n\n\"It's a roller coaster ride,\" Smith said.\n\nMany of the cleaning and sanitizing practices contained in the new regulations for child care centers were already in use pre-coronavirus at Smith's center. Hedges said the same should be true of any high-quality center.\n\nThat means both teachers and students are washing hands constantly and staff members are frequently sanitizing toys and surfaces. Touch points on the playground, like rubber grippers on swings, are cleaned between classes. In the past, infant classrooms were the only rooms with buckets to collect toys that kids put in their mouths. Now every classroom has a \"soiled toy bucket\" in which toys are promptly deposited after being whisked away from children who sneeze or touch an item with their mouth.\n\nStaff wear masks at all times; employee and child temperatures are taken daily. Any symptom of illness or rash, even something that may have not been much cause for concern in the past, now results in a child being immediately isolated and then sent home.\n\nDuring circle time, children must spread out, away from each other. While groups of both 3- and 4-year-olds would play together outside in the past, now just one age group uses the playground at a time. At one of the center's locations, a portable hand-washing station was installed near the playground.\n\nTo make the additional work manageable, Sweet Briar shortened its operating hours by 30 minutes in the morning and evening; now it opens at 7:15 a.m. and closes at 5:30 p.m., something Smith says has made an immense difference.\n\n\"If we were operating as we were prior to COVID, we'd have to hire two more people,\" she said. \"The shorter hours, the lower numbers (of children) are making it more feasible.\"\n\n'Like saying I don't love her': Parents torn as some schools face greater reopening risks\n\nThe precautionary measures Sweet Briar has put in place are meant to lessen the transmission of the virus between children and also between caregivers. Smith said staff members frequently hold each other accountable for maintaining safe practices outside of work, lightheartedly reminding each other not to go out on the weekends and to keep a safe distance from their mothers and grandmothers to spare them exposure to germs. They're also keeping distance from each other when at the centers.\n\n\"Teachers are not socializing,\" Smith said. \"You can't mingle in the kitchen. You can't chat at nap time.\"\n\nDespite the potential risks, many experts and parents say it's important for child care centers and preschools to be able to safely open. Many parents rely on the nation's child care providers, who serve some 12 million children under the age of 5 each day, in order to work. But group care and learning offer benefits for children as well as parents: less social isolation, more eyes on a child to see signs of neglect or abuse and the chance to interact with other children and build the early learning skills that can set them up for success in elementary school.\n\n\"For the very youngest children, the smallest children, that is their main developmental job: to learn basic social emotional skills,\" Hedges said. \"They need to have the opportunity to be with peers. They need to develop these skills in a supportive environment.\"\n\nTeachers at Sweet Briar said there are some benefits to the new status quo, like smaller class sizes that allow them to focus more on individual students.\n\nThere have been challenges. The center's washing machine recently stopped running, something that would have been a minor inconvenience in the past but is critical now that teachers must wash children's nap mats and blankets each week to comply with new regulations.\n\nAnd one thing continues to worry Smith: that her shorter hours won't remain viable for many parents if they lose flexible schedules and return to set work hours. She hopes that both parents and employers will stay patient as the nation struggles with the pandemic.\n\n\"We are managing. It just is something that we're mucking through every day,\" Smith said. \"I think everybody understands we're just doing the best we can.\"",

        "body": "While battling COVID-19, Detroit Tigers pitching prospect Tarik Skubal had a fever that spiked to 103.7 degrees.\n\n\"It did get scary,\" Skubal said in a Zoom call with reporters Saturday morning. \"That's the hottest I've ever felt in my entire life.\"\n\nSkubal tested positive in June for the coronavirus about a week before MLB announced it was going to restart.\n\n\"I had pretty much all the symptoms,\" Skubal said.\n\nHe quarantined in his house in Arizona for two weeks. \"I didn't know anyone who had it,\" Skubal said. \"I didn't know any of my friends or my family or their family or friends that have had the virus.\"\n\nAnd the truth is, the virus didn't seem real to him until he got it.\n\n\"I was like, yeah, this thing is real,\" he said. \"You need to take caution and social distance and wear a mask.\"\n\nSkubal had a shot to make it to the big leagues this year. He is the 50th-ranked prospect in baseball, according to MLB Pipeline. And he has soared through the Tigers' system.\n\nSkubal, a left-hander, pitched in two games in spring training, recording six strikeouts in 4 \u2154 innings with three walks.\n\n\"In spring training, I kind of flipped the grip on my curveball a little bit, just to get a little bit more break and spin that I wanted to create and get the pitch that I want to create,\" he said.\n\nAfter spring training shut down because of the virus, Skubal went home to Arizona and continued to work on his pitches. He he said he \"took a big step forward\" in his development.\n\n\"I was just able to work on some pitches and, and kind of design some stuff that I really like,\" he said.\n\nHe thought he was being safe, using precautions against the virus.\n\n\"I tried to be careful with this whole thing when I was home,\" he said. \"I didn't really go out and I just didn't try to stay away from everybody.\"\n\nStill, he got it.\n\n\"I'm lucky that I got it when I'm 23 years old and I don't have underlying health deficiencies,\" he said.\n\nBut it wasn't an easy fight. \"Physically it took a lot out of me,\" he said.\n\nAbout 14 or 15 days after testing positive, he started to get back into his routine and move around. \"Then I started feeling a bit better, you know, just being able to move around,\" he said.\n\nHe said he has no lingering effects. \"I came out fine,\" he said.\n\nSkubal was cleared to come off the injured list July 21 and rejoined the team for workouts. He is on the Tigers' taxi squad, working out in Toledo.\n\nThe Tigers have brought him back slowly. He was scheduled to pitch in his first game in Toledo on Saturday, but only for two innings.\n\n\"Now it's just about building back up,\" he said.\n\nIn some ways, it seems ironic. He is in Toledo, like many expected all along. But nothing about this situation is what anybody expected.\n\n\"I'd love to be playing in a regular minor league season but the world isn't normal right now,\" he said. \"There's a lot of bigger problems with this thing, the virus going on, and everything else. So, you know, I'll take what I get, and I'm playing baseball right now. And that's pretty much it. Being safe trying to keep everyone else safe as well.\"\n\nEven though he had the virus, he is still trying to be cautious.\n\n\"I try not to do much,\" he said. \"I go to the apartment, and maybe go to the grocery store to get some food and bring it back here but always wearing a mask.\"",

        "authors": [],
        "body": "In a social media post containing explosive allegations, Eastern Kentucky University kicker Landon White said he had left the football team as coaches have failed to prioritize the health of athletes amid the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nWhite announced he would be leaving the team Tuesday evening in a lengthy Instagram post because \"the coach and some staff, do not care about player safety.\"\n\nThe team has continued to practice on days where some players had shown coronavirus symptoms, White wrote, though no team tests had occurred in nearly a month. Players have also been in close contact with one another at dining halls and other meeting rooms, White alleged.\n\n\"This is a tough day for me, but somebody has gotta tell the truth on what us athletes are going through during this pandemic,\" wrote White.\n\nWhite and a spokesman for the Eastern Kentucky football program did not immediately respond to requests for comment Wednesday morning. White was still listed as a member of the EKU football program's online roster early Wednesday but appeared to be removed about 8:30 a.m.\n\nThe head coach of the Colonels is Walt Wells. He was hired by Eastern Kentucky in December after spending the previous two seasons as a quality control assistant at Kentucky. He'd also spent time in the past as an assistant coach at Eastern Kentucky, South Florida, Western Kentucky (he spent 10 years with the Hilltoppers) and Cumberland University in Tennessee.\n\nWhite's post claimed the last Eastern Kentucky team test took place on July 6 and that symptomatic players have still been at practice and in team facilities around teammates. A number of players and staff members have tested positive, he said, but team activities have not been suspended and meetings with more than 100 team members have continued to take place.\n\nEastern Kentucky football players have continued to eat at the university's Case Dining Hall, he said, which has put other students as well as cafeteria staff at risk.\n\nSee also: Colorado State launches investigation into football team allegations over COVID-19 protocols\n\nWhite wrote that Wells cares more about the payout Eastern Kentucky will receive by playing West Virginia University in a game at WVU on Sept. 12. The Colonels will receive $450,000 to playing that game, and Eastern Kentucky athletic director Matt Roan recently described that money as \"significant.\"\n\n\"That $450,000 supports not only our football program, it really supports our entire athletics enterprise,\" Roan told The Richmond Register in July. \"The effects of losing a game like that would be felt across the board.\"\n\nWhite, who said he took the health of his extended family into account when making his decision, said Wells is aware of the situation at EKU.\n\n\"The Head Coach knows and the Head Coach does nothing,\" he wrote. \"The Head Coach does not care about his players safety as well as his staff and their families.\"",

    "Feds spending more than $9 billion on COVID-19 vaccine candidates": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "The federal government has allocated more than $9 billion to develop and manufacture candidate vaccines. More than $2.5 billion more has been earmarked for vials to store the vaccines, syringes to deliver them, and on efforts to ramp up manufacturing and capacity.\n\nAnd they're not done yet.\n\nSo far, the largest sums have gone to pharmaceutical giants Pfizer, AstraZeneca, and a collaboration between Sanofi and GSK, as well as biotech firms Moderna and Novavax - all of which have candidate vaccines being tested in people.\n\nTo save time in the development process, the companies have been running trials simultaneously that they usually run in sequence.\n\nModerna, for instance, hasn't yet published its Phase 2 trial results, but is already in larger-scale Phase 3 trials, beginning tests last week of its candidate vaccine in 15,000 volunteers. Phase 3 trials started this summer are expected to return results this fall, with the timing depending on how quickly they can find volunteers.\n\nNone of the candidate vaccines use the whole virus, so they cannot cause COVID-19. Instead, they train the immune system to respond to the virus' spike protein - which gives the coronavirus its distinctive shape. Once the immune system is trained to recognize the spike protein, it should be able to rapidly clear the virus should the person be exposed again.\n\nThe vaccine candidates now receiving government funding are all based on new technologies, most of which have not been the basis of previously approved vaccines. They have been chosen because they were faster to develop than more conventional vaccines, which is important in fighting a virus currently killing about 1,000 Americans a day.\n\nIf any of these approaches prove safe and effective, it could transform vaccine development worldwide, allowing faster attack strategies against dangerous viruses that may emerge in the future, as well as those that mutate rapidly, like the flu.\n\nAlmost all the candidate vaccines in human trials will require two doses to become fully effective, which means many hundreds of millions of doses will be needed to vaccinate the majority of America's 328 million residents.\n\nIt is not known exactly what percentage of a population must be vaccinated to provide enough \"herd immunity\" to stop or prevent an outbreak, but researchers believe at least 50-70% of the population will need protection.\n\nTo win government approval, all the candidate vaccines have to go through three phases of testing in people, starting small to prove basic safety, and ending in 30,000-person trials, where half the volunteers get a placebo and half get an active vaccine. This stage proves the vaccine will be safe for the vast majority of people who get it, though rare reactions can still occur.\n\nIn each of the Phase 3 trials, only about 150-160 people will have to fall ill with COVID-19 for statisticians to be able to calculate the effectiveness of the vaccine.\n\nThe FDA has said it will approve any vaccine that is shown to be safe and to prevent infection or severe symptoms in at least half of those who are vaccinated. Several companies have said they are hoping to show their vaccine is effective at least 60% of the time.\n\nHere's how more than $9 billion taxpayer dollars have been allocated so far for vaccine development:\n\nSanofi Pasteur and GSK received nearly $31 million in April as a base award, and were allocated an additional $2.1 billion on July 31 to complete development and to manufacture 100 million doses by the end of the year. More than half of the money will go to complete development of the candidate vaccine, including a Phase 1/2 trial to start in September, and a large-scale Phase 3 trial to be started before the end of the year. The government holds an option on 500 million more doses to be made next year.\n\nThe companies' candidate vaccine is an edited version of the spike protein delivered via a harmless virus that normally infects insect cells. This approach was pioneered designed by a company Sanofi bought in 2017. The vaccine also includes a booster, called AS03, designed by GSK.\n\nThe government will pay Pfizer, in collaboration with German company BioNTech, $1.95 billion if it receives FDA approval for its candidate vaccine and produces 100 million doses by the end of the year. The government also has reserved the right to order 500 million more next year.\n\nPfizer/BioNtech developed their candidate vaccine without government assistance and recently started a Phase 2/3 trial, which they also will self-fund. The two have already invested billions of dollars in their work, according to a Pfizer spokesman.\n\nTheir candidate vaccine, BNT162, uses mRNA technology, which turns the body's cells into tiny factories producing the spike protein. The messenger RNA is packaged inside tiny balls of fat that should boost the duration of the immune response. This kind of vaccine was quick to design and should allow for rapid scale-up of manufacturing.\n\nThe down side to mRNA vaccines is that they must be kept very cold at all times -around -70 degrees Fahrenheit - so they are challenging to distribute to rural areas, and may be more expensive than other vaccines. Pfizer is currently working to address this shortcoming.\n\nNovavax has signed an agreement worth $1.6 billion to complete development, test and produce 300 million doses of its candidate vaccine as early as the end of this year. The company recently completed a Phase 1 trial and expects to begin a Phase 3 trial this fall.\n\nIts candidate vaccine, NVX-CoV2373, includes a spike protein delivered by tiny particles, and an adjuvant that boosts its effectiveness.\n\nSome of this funding is intended to help demonstrate that large-scale vaccine manufacturing is feasible.\n\nJanssen Research & Development, a subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson, is developing a COVID-19 vaccine delivered by a harmless virus called Adenovirus 26. Janssen has spent years working with this virus, and has begun Phase 1 testing in people, with Phase 3 slated to begin late this year.\n\nThis human virus is uncommon in nature, so most people have not developed immunity to it.\n\nThe company received $456 million in March for research and the Phase 1 trial and another $1 billion in early August to produce 100 million doses.\n\nAstraZeneca, which collaborates with Oxford University, has been awarded up to $1.2 billion to produce 300 million doses of its candidate vaccine as soon as the end of 2020.\n\nThe AZD1222 candidate vaccine uses a virus that normally infects chimpanzees to deliver the spike protein into human cells, which then learn to recognize it.\n\nTheir vaccine is expected to enter a Phase 3 trial within the next month.\n\nAZD1222 delivers its spike protein with the help of the chimpanzee virus. The advantage to this is the human immune system has not yet seen the virus, so hasn't made soldiers to fight it. With some vaccines delivered by human viruses, like one being developed in China, a large percentage of the population has already developed immunity to the virus, which is likely to limit the vaccine's effectiveness and the ability to deliver multiple doses.\n\nModerna has received just under $1 billion to develop its candidate vaccine, and recently launched a Phase 3 trial. The company, whose mRNA-1273 candidate vaccine was partially developed by government researchers, has received three large federal grants: A base award of more than $430 million in April, another $53 million in May, and nearly $472 million in late July.\n\nThe company has not signed a deal to deliver a certain number of doses to the government, though it has said it is collaborating with drug manufacturer Lonza to produce as many as 600 million to 1 billion doses next year.\n\nModerna's, like Pfizer's is an mRNA vaccine, so it must be kept very cold and requires two shots.\n\nMerck and its collaborator IAVI USA received $38 million in federal funding in April to advance development of their candidate vaccine.\n\nTheir vaccine uses a virus called a vesicular stomatitis virus, engineered to be harmless, to express spike proteins. The same virus was used as part of Merck's successful Ebola vaccine, ERVEBO, licensed in December 2019. IAVI has been working for years to develop rVSV vaccines for HIV as well as other emerging infectious diseases such as Lassa fever, Marburg, and Ebola Sudan disease.\n\nDr. Roger Perlmutter, president of Merck Research Laboratories, said in last week's earnings report Merck's vaccine will provide protection with only a single dose, and it will be delivered orally, like the polio vaccine, rather than via a shot.\n\nContact Karen Weintraub at kweintraub@usatoday.com",

        "body": "Fitbit unveiled a smartwatch enabled to tell you if you may be feeling stressed out or potentially running a fever as the coronavirus pandemic continues to grip the nation.\n\nThe company announced a trio of health wearables on Tuesday, each with the brand's typical curved edges. At the center of the lineup is the Fitbit Sense, an innovative smartwatch built with sensors that help you better understand what might be happening to your body.\n\nThe high tech wristlet comes with a sweat-reading sensor that detects \"small electrical changes\" to tell you how your body responds to stress. So if your palms get sweaty when you're feeling anxious the Sense can pick that up, the company claims.\n\n\"Our mission to make everyone in the world healthier has never been more important than it is today. COVID-19 has shown us all how critical it is to take care of both our physical and mental health and wellbeing,\" said James Park, co-founder and CEO, Fitbit, in a statement.\n\nBan TikTok? Social networking app sues Trump administration over executive order\n\nThe $395 smartwatch also is equipped with advanced heart rate and breathing rate tracking technology as well as a skin temperature sensor measures body heat. Fitbit claims that during early testing, changes in the metrics occurred simultaneously with the onset of COVID-19 symptoms, \"and in some cases even before.\"\n\n\"Wearables may be able to play an important role in the early detection of infectious diseases by acting as an early warning system for our bodies, which is critical to slowing the spread of COVID-19 and to better understanding disease progression,\" said Eric Friedman, co-founder and CTO of Fitbit, in a statement.\n\nThe company worked with researches at Stanford, Scripps Research and King's College London to determine if wearables can be used to detect potential signs of the coronavirus, Fitbit said.\n\nThe battery life on the Sense lasts longer than 6 days, and you're supposed to keep it on at night so the device can better monitor for trends.\n\nAlong with the Sense, Fitbit is rolling out new additions to its Versa and Inspire smartwatch families.\n\nThe Fitbit Versa 3 comes with baked-in GPS tracking, enhanced pulse-reading technology and a built-in speaker to take phone calls from your wrist. Fitbit added access to the Google Assistant and Amazon Alexa so you can speak to the wearable the same way you would your smartphone.\n\nFitbit Versa 3 is launching with a $229.95 price tag and is available in black aluminum, pink with soft gold aluminum and navy with soft gold aluminum.\n\nThe tech company also revealed a refreshed version of its most popular entry-level step tracker. The Fitbit Inspire 2 adds more tracking features and the longest battery life of any Fitbit device at 10 days.\n\nThe Inspire 2 has GPS tracking so you can get real-time pace and distance metrics for as you go for a run without having to carry your phone. It also has over 20 exercise modes and is available for $99.95 in black, white and \"desert rose.\"\n\nFitbit Sense, Fitbit Versa 3 and Fitbit Inspire 2 are available for pre-order on Fitbit.com.",

She hasn't been able to talk to them, or anyone, for more than two weeks.\n\nThat's how long she's been on an extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) machine at Shands Hospital in Gainesville, which she was placed on after her lungs completely failed while fighting COVID-19, according to her older brother, Barry Boutwell.\n\nHearne, who works in the finance office of the Okaloosa Tax Collector's office, began feeling ill in early July.\n\nShe was flown to UF Health Shands Hospital in mid-July after doctors at Fort Walton Beach Medical Center called Boutwell to tell him they didn't have the ECMO machine she really needed. Instead, with her family's approval, they hooked her up to a heart bypass machine that kept her alive long enough to get more specialized care.\n\nWhen she was hospitalized, her ex-husband moved into her home to take care of their children.\n\nHer 73-year-old father, Carl Fontaine, has some health challenges and is so broken by his daughter's illness that he can't talk about it without crying.\n\n\"You have no idea,\" he said Sunday. \"It's probably one of the hardest things in my life. I'm 73 years old and this ain't right at all.\"\n\nDuring the time she has been hospitalized, Hearne has used up her paid time off, emergency paid time off and Care Act money.\n\nThe rent, utilities, car insurance and car payment still need to be paid and her niece put up a GoFundMe page on July 24 to help raise money. As of Sunday afternoon, more than $7,000 had been donated.\n\n\"While we will never give up hope that she will pull through, we must be realistic in acknowledging that the recovery will not be a short one,\" the post reads, in part. \"The hardest part for us is that we can't be there to hold her hand, but I know she feels our love and prayers.\"\n\nBoutwell said that right before his sister's lungs failed, she had a couple of days when she seemed to be better. She texted her family members and even sent selfies.\n\n\"We thought she was on the upturn,\" he said.\n\nHe said he and his sister are close and that they had lost their mother to cancer two days before Hearne's 18th birthday.\n\n\"She works very hard, spends a lot of time with her children, that's about all you can do when you've got young ones,\" Boutwell said.\n\nThe children have been quarantined and tested and are not showing any symptoms, Boutwell said. But they miss their mama.\n\nWhen she was at FWBMC, Boutwell and his dad spoke to her nurse every four hours.\n\n\"Every single time they were pleasant. They were very helpful,\" he said. \"They were trying to do the best they could. I could hear it in their voices. I believe they saved my sister's life.\"\n\nThe staff at Shands have also been very helpful and nice, he said. Boutwell talks to them daily.\n\n\"What they're telling us is they're trying to wait for her to get strong enough so they can get her off the ECMO and insert a tracheotomy. She could possibly be on oxygen for the rest of her life.\"",

        "authors": [],
        "body": "It took less than five minutes into the 15th season of HBO's NFL reality series \"Hard Knocks\" for the vicious reality of 2020 to sink in.\n\nLos Angeles Chargers head coach Anthony Lynn fired up Zoom on his laptop computer and delivered shocking news to his players.\n\n\"I can't promise you that you're not going to get infected. ... I got infected,\" the 51-year-old Lynn said.\n\nEntering his fourth season at the helm of the Chargers, Lynn used his positive coronavirus test as a motivational tool for his players.\n\n\"Be patient, man. Be patient. Fellas, this year is not like any year we've had in the National Football League,\" Lynn said. \"There's going to be chaos. It's going to be change and it's going to come every single day. The goals, the objectives, will not change.\n\n\"I've talked to some people who said they're sick of this virus. What the hell is that supposed to mean? Let me tell you something, you aren't promised next year. You aren't promised tomorrow. What I want to do is I want to limit your exposures.\n\n\"But when that whistle blows, let's go kick somebody's ass and play some football. One team will do this better than the other 31. Trust me. It might as well be us. So, be ready for chaos. Embrace it. Because if we're going to play, the team that handles this thing the best is going to have the best chance of winning that trophy.\"\n\nLater in the episode, Lynn offers more details about the symptoms he was experiencing in a meeting with Chargers team psychologist Dr. Herb Martin. Lynn says he was coughing a bit and his body was aching. He said that he was watching golf and one of the players pulled out of the tournament due to body aches.\n\nLynn, of course, was referencing PGA Tour player Denny McCarthy, who withdrew from the Travelers Championship on June 26. McCarthy also tested positive for the COVID-19.\n\nBEST 'HARD KNOCKS' MOMENTS: From J.J. Watt workouts to rants from Rex Ryan and Bob Wylie\n\nHere are other notable moments from the first episode of \"'Hard Knocks\" with the Chargers and Rams:\n\nCoaches from both the Chargers and Rams brought up the situation surrounding the Marlins, who had 15 players and two staff members test positive for COVID-19.\n\n\"You see some of these other professional sports teams going right now. Look no further than the Marlins. I hate to see that. I love sports,\" Rams head coach Sean McVay said while addressing his team. \"But things happen when you don't make good decisions outside the ecosystem or the arena that we have put forth right here.\"\n\nPlayers are getting tested daily. Coaches and players are wearing face coverings. Meetings are socially distanced. Lockers were moved apart. The NFL appears to be taking this pandemic seriously.\n\nThe Rams' Jalen Ramsey is one of the league's premier cornerbacks. And the Rams invested heavily to acquire him, trading three draft picks -- including two first-round selections -- to the Jacksonville Jaguars to acquire Ramsey, who earned his third Pro Bowl selection in 2019.\n\nRamsey still is playing on his rookie contract, and will become an unrestricted free agent without an extension.\n\n\"My agent and the front office will handle all that,\" Ramsey says while speaking with reporters.\n\nHe repeats that line multiple times.\n\nClearly tired of talking about his contract situation, he walks out of a Zoom call with reporters, but later returns.\n\n\"I'm not worried about (the contract),\" Ramsey says. \"I'm worried about football. I'm worried about other things in my life.\"\n\nMoments later on the show, and down the road at the Chargers' facility, defensive end Joey Bosa basks in his new record-setting contract extension that made him the league's highest-paid defensive player.",

        "authors": [],
        "body": "Hawaii's government will be requiring all travelers to fill out its online \"Safe Travels\" application in an effort to keep its residents and visitors healthy during the coronavirus pandemic beginning Tuesday.\n\nTravelers currently can fill out two different forms: one for inter-island travel and one for trans-pacific travel. This new plan digitizes the process, which is currently in paper form, and uses the same form for each traveler type.\n\nIt collects health and contact information to assist in public health monitoring.\n\nIt's part of a new screening process that includes temperature checks and secondary screening for travelers with symptoms or 100.4\u2109 or higher temperatures.\n\n\"I am pleased to launch this digital app which will allow our travelers to provide their required health and travel information before they arrive at the airport,\" Gov. David Ige said in a news release. \"It will also help us keep in contact with those who are required to be in quarantine. This is an important step in preparing to reopen our economy.\"\n\nHere's how it works: Travelers enter their information and trip details 24 hours ahead of their flights. Then they receive a QR code via email after entering their information, which is scanned at the airport once they arrive at their destination.\n\nHawaii Gov. David Ige announced earlier this month that the state won't reopen to tourism until at least October, which means its 14-day mandatory quarantine for both out-of-state and inter-island travelers (in Kauai, Hawaii, Maui and Kalawao counties) remains intact.\n\nForget about a Hawaii vacation until at least October: COVID-19 spike delays tourism reopening\n\nHowever, the state is working on a \"resort bubble concept\" for inter-island travelers. The state calls the program an \"enhanced movement quarantine\" that each county can develop to give residents and visitors the ability to travel between islands without a 14-day quarantine.\n\nOfficials had been reviewing an idea that would allow tourists to roam freely on resorts while their movements are tracked via a wearable monitor to ensure they stay inside the boundaries of the facilities.\n\nThe \"resort bubble\" concept would keep the tourists within a \"geofence\" that tracks their movements, West Hawaii Today reported.\n\nHow Hawaii might eliminate quarantine: State may use 'geofence' technology to track tourists during coronavirus pandemic\n\nThe tourism delay, the second since the program was announced in June, will affect passengers who bet on the previous Sept. 1 reopening plan and bought airline tickets to Hawaii; airline flight schedules; and, of course, Hawaii's pummeled tourism industry. The quarantine began in March, and the latest extension means much of the year will be wiped out as few visitors want to be confined to their hotel or vacation rental.\n\nThe state also reinstituted a ban on social gatherings over five people - inside and outside - and other restrictions on Oahu, home to Honolulu and the site of the vast majority of the state's coronavirus cases.\n\nContributing: Dawn Gilbertson, USA TODAY; The Associated Press\n\nA way to travel in Hawaii?

        "authors": [],
        "body": "HONOLULU (AP) -- Hawaii health officials reported a record 231 new coronavirus cases on Saturday as state and municipal officials closed beaches and parks on Oahu and restricted other activities.\n\nThe statewide total of cases since the start of the pandemic in March has risen to 3,346 and newly confirmed infection cases surpassed 200 for two days in a row. Most of the cases have been in Honolulu and its suburbs.\n\nThe death Friday of an Oahu man who was older than 60 was the state's 31st fatality linked to COVID-19, the state Department of Health said.\n\nHawaii Department of Health Director Bruce Anderson said officials expect the death toll to rise.\n\n\"Hospitals throughout Oahu are transferring patients and opening up new specialized COVID units to handle the surge in patients that is expected over the next couple of weeks,\" Anderson said Saturday.\n\nClosing Oahu's beaches, parks and other high risk activities will help prevent the spread of the virus, but the measures are not enough and residents need to take responsibility in efforts to curb the virus, Anderson said.\n\nHawaii Gov. David Ige, a Democrat, plans to reinstate a requirement that people traveling between the islands quarantine themselves for 14 days, starting on Tuesday.\n\nTravelers arriving on Oahu from the state's other islands will not need to quarantine, but people arriving in the other counties from different islands will.\n\nHonolulu Mayor Kirk Caldwell said he would close public parks, pools and campgrounds. State parks on Oahu will also close.\n\nState-by-state quarantine guide: Which states require travelers to self-quarantine or present negative COVID-19 test?\n\nLt. Gov. Josh Green said the number of cases should begin falling as closures and quarantine take effect.\n\n\"We'll likely see cases in the triple digits for another week, then the numbers should begin to drop,\" he said. \"If we do very well socially distancing, the numbers on Oahu could be back to the 20-30 a day or better by 9/1.\"\n\nHawaii delayed its plan to allow out-of-state visitors to return to the vacation hot spot by a month because of an increase in coronavirus cases in the state and on the U.S. mainland.\n\nIn late June, the governor's office announced that travelers could visit Hawaii beginning Aug. 1, no quarantine required, by presenting a negative COVID-19 test taken within 72 hours of boarding a flight.\n\nThe number of infections is thought to be far higher because many people have not been tested, and studies suggest people can be infected with the virus without feeling sick.\n\nFor most people, the coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks. For some -- especially older adults and people with existing health problems -- it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia, and death.\n\nScratch that August trip to Hawaii: State just extended its quarantine until Sept. 1",

    "How lessons from 9/11 can help colleges cope with COVID-19": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "As the president of a liberal arts university with nearly 1,500 students about to return to campus, sleep has been in short supply. Along with every other college leader, we have worked nonstop with our colleagues to devise systems and new approaches that will allow our students, faculty and staff to be safely reunited -- even as cases of COVID-19 continue to rise.\n\nWhile I am proud of the work we have done to prepare for the fall semester, and am confident in our approach, I will admit to being apprehensive. This is all new territory -- for us and for our students.\n\nThis virus is unpredictable. But I take great comfort knowing the lessons learned in the wake of the 9/11 terror attacks can help us all smartly manage this latest crisis. The risk-based, intelligence-driven program we have developed at Anderson University has been informed by successes at my previous job, when I served as administrator at the Transportation Security Administration.\n\nAt TSA, I was privileged to lead a team that created TSA PreCheck, the expedited security-screening program that provides travelers with smarter security and a better travel experience. It has been an overwhelming success used by millions of travelers today.\n\nWhen I resigned from TSA at the end of 2014, Senate Commerce Committee Chairman Jay Rockefeller of West Virginia said, \"Shifting TSA from a one-size-fits-all approach to risk-based security has empowered the agency to provide the most effective security in the most efficient ways.\"\n\nThat's what we are attempting to do at Anderson University in responding to COVID-19. We can never eliminate all risks, but we can manage them, and in a way that allows students to still be students.\n\nWorking with our partners at Daon, identity management and biometric experts who safeguard bank accounts and other important assets, students, faculty and staff are being introduced to our new mobile health screening app that allows users to quickly assess their health status.\n\nCalled AU Together, the app will allow for daily COVID-19 health screenings for all our campus community. It has the added benefit of allowing for more effective contact tracing because students will use the app to scan into buildings.\n\nMembers of our campus community will engage in a daily self-screening that includes a temperature and symptom list. If a screening yields a fever or symptoms of COVID-19, they will be connected to campus health professionals to receive testing and resources that might be needed for their care. The individual's contacts will then be notified for follow-up.\n\nBy introducing these public health safety protocols across campus, each person is surrounded by resources and support -- and on devices they always have with them and are comfortable using.\n\nAs Dr. Sarah Neal, professor of nursing and head of our COVID-19 task force, explains, this type of risk-based approach will offer students the ability to return to campus with a measure of safety that would not otherwise be possible. It allows us to detect cases on campus and respond with a full set of resources for faculty, staff and students.\n\nWhen you consider how to approach COVID-19 versus terrorism, there is one obvious difference. In the world of terrorism we're focused on an enemy, whereas with the coronavirus we're focused on a classmate or teacher. Everybody is a potential threat to us -- even those we hold dear.\n\nSo we must find solutions that work for everybody. We must ask ourselves, do the systems we are creating present an undue burden to our customers, in our case students, faculty and staff? And does it evoke a sense of safety and security?\n\nIn all cases, a risk-based security approach, as was used to develop TSA PreCheck, is preferable to \"one-size-fits-all\" solutions.\n\nIn developing AU Together, flexibility and adaptability were key factors, allowing a tailored system designed to mitigate risk with minimal disruption. That is what we all seek to achieve.\n\nMy passion, whether in government or now in academia, is to inspire and empower people to do their absolute best in transforming, adding value and making a difference in the lives of others. This global health crisis requires all of us in positions of leadership -- especially on college campuses -- to inspire our colleagues to be creative problem solvers on behalf of our students who are counting on us to find ways to bring some normalcy back to their lives.\n\nAnderson University was founded in 1917 -- the time of our last global pandemic. While I cannot imagine what it must have been like to build a college campus during a health emergency, I certainly know what it's like to keep one operating. The lessons of the past will guide as forward. We're all in this together.",

    "How to stay safe at work during the COVID-19 pandemic": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "-- Recommendations are independently chosen by Reviewed's editors. Purchases you make through our links may earn us a commission.\n\nAfter the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic forced many people into months of remote work and endless Zoom meetings, some workplaces are finally starting to allow employees to return to the office. But just like gyms, hotels, and schools that have reopened, offices now look much different, as employers and employees alike adjust to a new normal that includes face masks, social distancing, plexiglass partitions, and more.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has published comprehensive guidelines for businesses to follow in order to protect employees. \"Businesses and employers can prevent and slow the spread of COVID-19 within the workplace. Operation decisions should be based on both the level of disease transmission in the community and your readiness to protect the safety and health of your employees and customers,\" the CDC explains, advising companies to follow a phased approach to reopening similar to the White House Guidelines for Opening Up America Again.\n\nAs some offices start to reopen their doors, many people are understandably concerned about how safe it is to return to work during the pandemic. Below is everything you need to know about going back to the office, according to experts, so both you and your colleagues can stay safe and healthy.\n\nGone are the days of crowded break rooms and shared desks. Businesses that are choosing to reopen amid the pandemic have put strict protocols in place to keep employees and customers safe, like requiring social distancing and face masks, staggering schedules to limit the number of employees in the office at one time, and even putting up partitions in between desks. Many are also requiring employees to undergo temperature checks upon arriving at work and are offering employees more flexibility to continue to work remotely when possible. Additionally, per the CDC's recommendations, offices have implemented more thorough cleaning and sanitation procedures and some are even providing personal protective equipment (PPE) to all of their employees.\n\nBoth the CDC and medical experts agree that the safety of returning to a workplace depends on a number of factors, including the rate of transmission in the area where the business is located, the health and sanitation protocols put in place by the employer, and whether or not employees actually adhere to those new rules. \"With the proper controls in place (like masking and social distancing), in most places, it is reasonably safe,\" Amanda M. Valyko, MPH, CIC, FAPIC, Director of Infection Prevention & Epidemiology at the University of Michigan Medical School, says. The CDC recommends that businesses and employees continuously monitor local and federal guidance and regulations regarding COVID-19 to make sure they are doing the most they can to protect everyone in the workplace.\n\nAnother factor to take into account is the type of work being conducted at the office. \"Higher risk work settings would be those where the work is inside, there is regular face to face contact with the public, workers are required to be in close proximity to one another, or there is poor ventilation,\" Michael D. Sweat, PhD, Director of the Division of Global and Community Health at the Medical University of South Carolina explains.\n\nWhen it comes to protecting yourself at work, experts say that the three most important things are wearing a mask, social distancing, and practicing good hand hygiene. \"The only places you should be unmasked indoors are in your own personal office or partitioned cubicles at least 6 feet from others,\" urges Christopher Ohl, MD, Professor of Medicine and infectious disease expert at Wake Forest Baptist Health in Winston-Salem. He adds that while you should wear a mask at all times indoors (like in conference or break rooms), this can be tricky during lunchtime. \"One area where I have seen workplace exposures occur is when eating lunch. Obviously, masks are not worn, making this event in many instances the highest risk for virus exposure in the workplace,\" he explains. \"To decrease this risk, if you eat with others, do so in a large room and distanced from others, or outside.\"\n\nEven when masked, practice social distancing by staying six feet away from coworkers or customers and spacing out desks accordingly. The CDC also recommends washing your hands (or using hand sanitizer) frequently and sanitizing both your desk, chair, and high-touch areas (like doorknobs or elevator buttons) with disinfecting wipes. Additionally, avoid sharing workstations, keyboards, etc. with coworkers to reduce any potential spread of bacteria.\n\nExperts also remind people to always put your own safety (and the safety of those around you) first. \"Addressing when coworkers or customers put you at risk is challenging,\" Dr. Sweat says, \"But it is still important that you stand up for your safety and politely request others to follow company guidelines.\" Along those same lines, stay home if you have any symptoms or aren't feeling well to avoid putting your colleagues at risk.\n\nWhile these measures -- especially wearing a face mask -- may not be the most comfortable or convenient, remember that they're put in place to keep both you and your coworkers safe. \"Masking is mainly to keep those around you from 'catching' COVID-19 from you if you are infected asymptomatically or shedding virus before you get symptoms,\" Dr. Ohl says, stressing, \"It's not all just about protecting yourself. You also want to be a good citizen and protect your colleagues and coworkers.\"\n\nThe product experts at Reviewed have all your shopping needs covered.

    "Hurtigruten cruise: 45 cruise ship passengers, crew have COVID-19": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "At least 45 people who were aboard Hurtigruten's MS Roald Amundsen cruise ship have tested positive for COVID-19.\n\nThirty-six crew members have tested positive for COVID-19, according to \u00d8ystein Knoph, spokesperson for Hurtigruten. Nine passengers have also tested positive for COVID-19 since it became clear that there was an outbreak on board, according to the Norwegian Institute of Public Health. The nine passengers are from six counties around Norway. Thirty-three of the 36 crew members who tested positive are Filipino and the remaining three are Norwegian, German and French citizens.\n\nPassengers from two separate voyages on the ship had already disembarked on July 24 and on Friday to begin their voyages home before the cruise line contacted passengers about the initial COVID-19 cases.\n\nCEO of Hurtigruten Daniel Skjeldam said the cruise line failed and made mistakes in a statement on Monday. They thought the line was well-prepared amid the coronavirus pandemic, though a preliminary review of what happened on the MS Roald Amundsen shows deviations from their established procedures.\n\nMost of the global cruise industry remains on pause as coronavirus continues to sweep the world, but some cruise lines have begun to resume operations in international waters. And while ships are sailing with new precautions, problems because of the novel coronavirus, which causes COVID-19, are already on the rise.\n\nThe cruise company announced Monday it would suspend all expedition cruises though its coastal Norway operations have not been impacted.\n\nSkjeldam said in a statement the decision was the only responsible choice until the company can be sure it can execute its cruises while meeting all standards from the government and the even stricter requirements Hurtigruten has set for itself.\n\nSkjeldam added: \"To our guests, employees and everyone who loves Hurtigruten, I want to apologize for this.\" The company will engage in a full external review of what happened, as well as take a look at procedures at Hurtigruten.\n\nIt's not clear how the MS Roald Amundsen outbreak began, and passengers were from all over the world.\n\nAll 158 crew members on the ship were tested for COVID-19, according to the cruise line. Four crew members are hospitalized at the University Hospital of North Norway, with three recovering and expected to be discharged soon.\n\nBecause the cruise line often acts like a local ferry, traveling from port to port along Norway's west coast, some passengers disembarked along the route and may have spread the virus to local communities. A total of 69 municipalities in Norway could have been affected, Norwegian news agency NTB reported on Monday.\n\nTwo new cases were reported ashore, according to the city of Trondheim, saying both had been passengers on the ship. Trondheim sits about halfway to Troms\u00f8, north of the Arctic Circle, where the empty ship is docked.\n\nPreviously: As cruising resumes in some parts of world, multiple cruise ships affected by new COVID-19 cases\n\nThe Hurtigruten cruise line was one of the first companies to resume sailing during the pandemic, starting cruises to Norway out of northern Germany in June with a single ship, then adding cruises in July to the Arctic archipelago of Svalbard that is part of the Scandinavian country.\n\nThe leading industry organization, Cruise Lines International Association, will eventually release a mandatory policy on how to handle COVID-19 prevention and outbreaks on board ships. But right now, its cruise line members are deploying company-specific protocols based on advice of governments, health authorities and experts.\n\n\"Resumption is extremely limited so far, and sailings that are taking place must follow the requirements and approval conditions of national authorities,\" Bari Golin-Blaugrund, senior director of strategic communications, told USA TODAY.\n\nAfter a 22-year-old American woman tested positive for the coronavirus aboard a cruise ship in Tahiti, all other passengers and crew on board the MS Paul Gauguin have tested negative and some have begun to disembark to enter a seven-day quarantine, the cruise line announced Tuesday.\n\nThe infected passenger, who was asymptomatic, was confined in a special cabin before disembarking with her mother to a hotel to remain in isolation offshore, according to a statement from the Paul Gauguin cruise line shared with USA TODAY by spokesperson Lauren Wintemberg.\n\nFollowing the discovery of the infection, the 340 passengers and crew members aboard the MS Paul Gauguin, the cruise line's flagship boat, underwent tests and were confined to their cabins pending results.\n\nThe ship returned Sunday morning to the departure port in Papeete, the capital of French Polynesia on the island of Tahiti, it said, where they began seven days of quarantine and before undergoing new tests.\n\nAll foreign passengers were required to take two tests before boarding The Gauguin, according to the cruise line. The first was done within three days of an international flight and a second was administered four days after arrival in French Polynesia.\n\nCrew members can quarantine on board for one week. All passengers and crew who have been on the ship will be required to be retested within one week, according to crew members, noted in a statement from the cruise line shared with USA TODAY by spokesperson Lauren Wintemberg.\n\nFrench Polynesia reopened last month to visitors but requires them to take a test before entry and again four days after arriving.\n\nHurtigruten's expedition cruise MS Fridtjof Nansen announced Monday that four crew members had been isolated on the ship after reporting mild cold symptoms. These crew members all tested negative for COVID-19.\n\nThe entire crew has been given coronavirus tests, the first of which are to be delivered ashore Tuesday for analysis in Alesund, Norway, press officer \u00d8ystein Knoph said a news release from the cruise line. Guests are all offered and encouraged to get tested and have been asked to remain in their cabins for the time being, Knoph added.\n\nThe two-week round trip cruise from Hamburg travels along the Norwegian coast and is currently nearing Alesund. It has 171 passengers and 162 crew on board.\n\nThe MS Spitsbergen, another expedition cruise ship in Hurtigruten's fleet, does not have any suspected cases of the coronavirus but plans to test every person on board, Knoph said in the release.\n\nThe ship is expected to dock Thursday in Troms\u00f8, Norway, where all passengers and crew will remain on board until they test negative. Knoph stressed taking all necessary precautions despite a lack of reason to believe there were any cases of the virus present on the ship.\n\nThe ship was set to receive testing equipment on Monday but fog blocked the plane with the equipment from landing.\n\nSixty-four guests and 20 crew members are on board the ship. Of the passengers, most are Norwegian and the rest hail from other European countries. Forty-six crew members are Filipino citizens, 20 are Norwegian and four are from Europe.\n\nContributing: The Associated Press\n\nIn case you missed: As cruising resumes in some parts of world, multiple cruise ships affected by new COVID-19 cases\n\nAnd this, too: AIDA Cruises cancels 2 of 3 August sailings after anticipated restart amid COVID-19 pandemic",

    "Hydroxychloroquine: Florida lawmaker with COVID says drug is not magic": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "After two weeks battling COVID-19, State Rep. Randy Fine (R-Palm Bay) posted on Facebook that he needed his lungs X-rayed as his symptoms now included a recurring fever and a hacking chest cough. He remarked that the hydroxychloroquine therapy he had been on proved ineffective.\n\n\"I've had a cold who knows how many times. I have never had to deal with anything like this. And for those who want to believe that (hydroxychloroquine) is some kind of magic solution, I've been taking that too (I don't oppose it, but I am tired of people pretending it is magic),\" he wrote in the post.\n\nBy the time the X-ray images came back showing lung damage serious enough that doctors ordered Fine to stay for observation, a debate over hydroxychloroquine raged on Fine's Facebook page.\n\n\"Hydroxychloroquine as stated by many Doctors here and abroad is very effective. Had you been given that at the outset you might think it was magic indeed...\" wrote one user.\n\n\"Was given it the day my test came back,\" Fine replied. \"Sorry to burst the magic bubble.\"\n\nFurther on, netizens commented that surely Fine must have not been taking the drug \"as prescribed\" or following \"protocol\" (there is none established by any medical authority).\n\n\"I'm over it,\" Fine texted FLORIDA TODAY from his Holmes Regional Medical Center hospital bed on Monday. \"People should be able to use it if they want. But people should stop pretending it is some kind of magic potion as well. If they need proof, look at me.\"\n\nSince the early days of the pandemic, excitement over the possibility that cheap, widely available drugs might be repurposed to combat the novel coronavirus has spurred a flurry of research and clinical trials. But one non-peer reviewed, clinical study from France, which has been widely derided for its shoddy methodology, including randomly eliminating test subjects without explanation, and small sample size, touted the effectiveness of the decades old anti-malarial drug hydroxychloroquine when used alongside azithromycin the antibiotic commonly sold as Z-Pak.\n\nFervor around a possible miracle cure exploded, fueled by anecdotal reports that patients recovered suddenly after taking the drug. Before science could validate the results of the study, the drug was seized on by President Donald Trump who along with allies such as Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis secured vast quantities of the untested \"cure\" at taxpayer's expense.\n\nMore: The coronavirus therapy President Trump is gambling on is backed by weak scientific data\n\nBut successive clinical trials following standard scientific methods failed to replicate the results touted by the flawed studies that championed the therapy. The scientific consensus is that there is no measurable impact from taking the drug, alone, or alongside other medications.\n\nU.S. health authorities began recommending against the use of the therapy outside of the controlled setting of a clinical trial because of the risk of adverse side-effects.\n\nMore: New guidelines 'recommend against' use of much-touted COVID-19 therapy outside of clinical trials\n\nOn Jul. 22 the highly-respected journal Nature published a first of it's kind study that looked at live human lung cells and found definitively that chloroquine had no anti-viral properties when it came to the virus that causes COVID-19.\n\nThe argument appeared to be settled.\n\nThen, last week, President Trump again touted hydroxychloroquine after a group of physicians calling themselves \"America's Frontline Doctors\" staged a press conference in front of the Supreme Court building in Washington D.C.\n\nA video of one of the doctors, Stella Immanuel, claiming that a combination of hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin and the nutritional supplement zinc were a cure quickly went viral. Even as social media platforms feverishly tried to take down the video for containing false and misleading claims it was re-posted by President Trump, major right-wing personalities and Donald Trump Jr.\n\nDr. Immanuel's credentials have since come under scrutiny, along with her prior claims that certain real-life ailments are caused by sexual intercourse with demons.\n\nThis prompted assistant secretary for Health and Human Services, Adm. Brett Giroir, who was appointed to the White House's coronavirus task force to coordinate testing efforts, to say on 'Meet the Press' Sunday that it was time to \"move on\" and that the government does not recommend the therapy.\n\nMore: Hydroxychloroquine not effective; time to 'move on:' White House coronavirus testing chief Giroir\n\n\"The most well-designed studies so far, that are not anecdotal, but are actual studies, have indicated that there does not appear to be any beneficial effect on the use of hydroxychloroquine,\" said Jay Wolfson a public health policy expert and senior associate dean at the University of South Florida's medical school.\n\nDespite this, believers in the treatment have persisted.\n\n\"He didn't use the HCQ correctly,\" a comment said on Randy Fine's page. \"You must take zinc with the hydroxychloraquine. (sic) The zinc is the magic bullet and the hydroxychloraquine (sic) carries it so it can prevent viral replication. Just curious, did you take the zinc too?\"\n\n\"Yup. Sorry to burst the magic bubble,\" Fine shot back.\n\nIn fact Fine said he took the drugs on the recommendation and prescription of his doctor, and contrary to assertions that the public is being denied access to the drug, Fine said he had no problem filling his prescription at CVS.\n\nCertain states have curtailed easy access to hydroxychloroquine to prevent hoarding that was endangering access for patients with Lupus who also need the drug. But anybody with a prescription from a doctor willing to prescribe it for COVID-19, in theory, has access.\n\nFine has now stopped responding to commenters asking about whether he was taking the therapy.\n\n\"I just got tired of every time I made an update people stating that if I just took (hydroxychloroquine) I'd be magically healed which was particularly frustrating because I was taking it,\" he told FLORIDA TODAY in a text.\n\n\"Much of COVID has become politics as opposed to science,\" said USF's Wolfson. \"And it's an old issue of science being viewed in some social circles as being antithetical to belief systems.\"\n\nWhether it was polio or smallpox, Wolfson said resistance to science and public health expertise, despite concerted public information campaigns, has always been an issue.\n\n\"It took a long enough time where enough people died or were affected by it, that both individuals and communities and political systems and communities, took action. We've only been at this for seven months in this country.\"\n\nOnly then, Wolfson said, will the walls individual's belief systems have erected come down.\n\nFor Fine the situation is reminiscent of the polarization over masks. \"It's like people can no longer accept disagreement with their view.\"\n\nIt should be noted that Wolfson has been retained as an expert witness for Hillsborough County, which is fighting against a lawsuit to repeal their mask mandate brought by Republican State Rep. Anthony Sabatini (R -- Howey in the Hills).\n\nFine, for his part, thinks it's a matter of people needing to feel comforted during a difficult time.\n\n\"I think perhaps some people are clinging to this to psychologically manage their anxiety over the disease.\" he continued, adding \"because if some pill can magically make it go away who has to worry?\"\n\nAlessandro Marazzi Sassoon is a watchdog reporter at FLORIDA TODAY.",

    "Inconclusive COVID studies on kids mean schools must be strict on safety": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "The theory that children are unlikely to contract or spread COVID-19 -- a notion that is guiding school reopening plans -- may feel reassuring. It shouldn't. It's based on flawed science.\n\nEven if school districts and policymakers are trying to make evidence-based decisions about classroom instruction, they may not understand the limitations of epidemiological studies. Until the research is more conclusive, schools need to operate under the assumption that everyone of all ages can become infected and spread the virus and take universal safety precautions.\n\nIt's hard to blame schools when messages from respected institutions are ambiguous. In its original guidance, the American Academy of Pediatrics urged schools to open for in-person learning, stating: \"Although many questions remain, the preponderance of evidence indicates that ... children may be less likely to become infected and to spread infection.\" AAP is now saying additional research is needed to understand infectivity and transmissibility of COVID-19 in children, even as it \"strongly advocates\" for students to be physically present in schools.\n\nSimilarly, the Massachusetts Department of Elementary and Secondary Education's fall re-opening guidance sent mixed signals. Its infection control recommendations include universal precautions in schools. At the same time, it cites studies reporting that very few COVID-19 clusters around the world originated in schools; adults are more likely to have the initial case in a household than a child; most recorded child-adult transmissions are from adult to child; infection rates are lower for children than for adults; and if exposed, children are less likely than adults to develop COVID-19.\n\nUnfortunately, the above studies weren't designed to clearly determine children's COVID-19 risks. In part, that's because the research was conducted in spring and early summer, when schools were shut as part of widespread mitigation efforts. Kept home with few social activities, children were less likely to be exposed to the virus and bring it home than parents who might have to work or shop for food and other essentials.\n\nChildren also are less likely than adults to exhibit symptoms, and thus are tested for COVID-19 less frequently. Although the data may make it appear that children are less likely to get infected, the truth may be that they are less likely to be diagnosed.\n\nFaster and more efficient: Why pooled testing for COVID-19 could help America's schools to open safely\n\nNewer evidence, albeit also imperfect, is already revising our understanding of COVID-19 in children. Recent studies have found that children with COVID-19 have a higher viral load than adults, and transmission rates are higher among school-age children than adults. A new report from the American Academy of Pediatrics found a 40% increase in child cases (or almost 100,000 new infections) reported just during the last two weeks of July, when children were starting to return to normal activities in many parts of the country.\n\nThere is also evidence that the novel coronavirus was readily transmissible between children in schools and summer camps -- including outbreaks in Georgia and Indiana -- that did not adhere to public health recommendations on physical distancing, mask wearing, proper ventilation and quarantining.\n\nNo one disputes that attending school in-person is critical for childhood development. So can U.S. classrooms reopen safely?\n\nOther countries have managed it. Studies from Australia and Ireland demonstrate that a known COVID-19 case in a school can result in low or no transmission to other students and teachers if appropriate infection control strategies are in place. These promising findings suggest that stringent practices -- universal masking, physical distancing, hygiene, proper ventilation, and frequent testing and contact tracing -- can work, especially if there is low COVID-19 prevalence in the community.\n\nThat still does not mean children are not vectors for spread.\n\nAction plan: Racial inequities will grow if schools don't open safely this fall\n\nRight now, the evidence on children's rates of infection and transmission is inconclusive. Statements by political, education and public health leaders that suggest otherwise may foster lax adherence to the precautions taken in schools and complacency among families outside of school.\n\nLess than six months into this pandemic, we must remember that COVID-19 is still a new disease. Education leaders need to think critically about the current scientific evidence and understand the limitations of epidemiological studies. Until more is known, aggressive strategies to limit viral spread in schools are the best way to keep students and teachers safe.",

    "Indiana football player Brady Feeney's mom posts about COVID-19 ordeal": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "BLOOMINGTON, Ind. -- Deborah Rucker didn't know when she wrote a Facebook post Sunday about her son's ordeal with COVID-19 that it would capture so much attention on social media.\n\nRucker's son, IU freshman offensive lineman Brady Feeney, tested positive for the virus during screening conducted by the program last month. He was isolated from his teammates and experienced breathing problems serious enough to warrant a visit to the emergency room. Indiana even paid for Rucker to come to Bloomington to be near Feeney -- she could not physically be with him, per isolation protocols -- while he recovered.\n\n\"After 14 days of hell battling the horrible virus, his school did additional testing on all those that were positive,\" Rucker wrote. \"My son even received extra tests because he was one of the worst cases. Now we are dealing with possible heart issues! He is still experiencing additional symptoms and his blood work is indicating additional problems.\n\n\"Bottom line, even if your son's schools do everything right to protect them, they CAN'T PROTECT THEM!!\"\n\nRucker didn't mean to alarm anyone over her son's condition. What she wanted was for those unconcerned or casual about the dangers posed by COVID-19 to understand how quickly and closely it can hit home.\n\n\"The whole point of my Facebook post is because in Missouri, where we live, the state is not taking this as seriously as they should,\" Rucker said Monday. \"With everything Brady is going through and has been struggling through, it has been infuriating to me that people are not taking this seriously and not wearing masks.\"\n\nA true freshman who signed with Indiana out of Christian Brothers College in St. Louis, Feeney moved to Bloomington after summer workouts were green-lighted as part of the athletic department's restart plan.\n\nRucker said Feeney was tested immediately, per Indiana's restart protocol, and given a complete physical. The program gave each player their own single room, and kept players in specific pods during workouts to limit person-to-person exposure as much as possible.\n\nEvery step of the way, Indiana communicated in detail with players' families. A family friend, Rucker said, serves as a physician for the St. Louis Cardinals, and everything he suggested they ask, Indiana covered.\n\n\"Everything they're doing, is exactly what should be done,\" Rucker said the family friend told her.\n\nNevertheless, Feeney was one of a handful of players to test positive in July. That, in turn, prompted a team-wide round of tests, which eventually led to a two-week suspension of football activities.\n\nIndiana only announced the resumption of its offseason at the end of last week.\n\nAfter testing positive, Rucker said Feeney was isolated with two other positive teammates. About a week in, Feeney began having breathing problems, at which point he visited the emergency room and received medication to help alleviate his symptoms.\n\nIndiana paid for Rucker to travel to Bloomington, where she could be with her son from a safe distance while he recovered.\n\n\"The last thing I want is for anyone to think the Indiana University football program has done anything wrong,\" she said. \"They have been phenomenal through all of this.\"\n\nOnce he was allowed to return to the team, Feeney was given a second physical. That's where the heart complication mentioned in Rucker's Facebook post first came up.\n\nRucker said that, because he dealt with more severe symptoms than his teammates, Indiana gave Feeney a thorough screening -- including an echocardiogram, an EKG and bloodwork -- before he could return to activity.\n\nThat bloodwork raised concerns. Feeney will see a cardiologist this week for further evaluation.\n\nIn the meantime, he's back with his teammates, just not cleared for workouts yet. And his mother remained firm in her message, that collective safety should be a priority, for everyone.\n\n\"It's a serious situation, and it may not affect everyone the same,\" Rucker said. \"It's so simple to wear a mask. It's the right thing to do. It's the humane thing to do. Why not wear a mask, to protect yourself and to protect everyone around you?\"",

    "Inmate sentenced before mandatory minimum reform gets COVID: Now what?": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "By the time prison officials told William Forrester he had COVID-19, he'd already lost his sense of taste and smell. The persistent headaches, body tremors and diarrhea had already begun.\n\nOn his worst days, his stomach cramps were so bad he couldn't stand, his back pain so severe he couldn't sit up to eat. He said he had to ask a fellow inmate to scoop coffee for him because his hands trembled so badly.\n\nOne day, he found himself lying on the shower floor as he struggled to catch his breath. His head felt like it was filled with air. This is particularly troubling for Forrester, a 63-year-old who lost one lung nearly two decades ago to cancer.\n\nForrester has spent more than a decade in a Florida state prison for faking opioid prescriptions for himself during a years-long addiction to painkillers following a lung operation.\n\nHis 15-year sentence was a product of mandatory minimum laws crafted years ago to fight the state's drug epidemic. Nationwide, mandatory minimums require judges to hand down predetermined and often lengthy sentences for certain crimes, many of which are non-violent drug offenses. But advocates and legal experts say the harsh sentences treated those addicted to drugs, like Forrester, as if they were violent drug kingpins.\n\nLess than a year away from freedom, imprisoned under laws that have since been invalidated, Forrester fears he'll die before he is free.\n\n\"I hope I'm not doing a death sentence,\" he said.\n\nIn the federal system, more than 7,500 prisoners have been moved out of prison after Attorney General William Barr ordered officials to transfer elderly and vulnerable inmates to home confinement. Among those who have been allowed to serve the rest of their sentences under house arrest amid coronavirus fears were high-profile criminals such as President Donald Trump's former campaign manager Paul Manafort.\n\nBut critics say the federal Bureau of Prisons has been slow to implement Barr's directives and still has left other nonviolent but less connected prisoners behind bars.\n\nIn the case of Forrester, a state prisoner, he applied for a furlough or a temporary release, but his request was denied.\n\nElderly in coronavirus-ridden prisons: Coronavirus was Paul Manafort's ticket home. Many other old, ill, nonviolent inmates are still in prison\n\nThere are many like Forrester in Florida's criminal justice system.\n\nA 2019 report from the state Department of Corrections showed that nearly 14,000 prisoners - 14% of the prison population - are serving time for drug offenses. The report does not distinguish violent prisoners from the nonviolent ones, or inmates serving time for opioid-related crimes from those who trafficked cocaine or heroin.\n\nBut a government report found that prosecution of opioid-related offenses led to a dramatic uptick in prison population from 2006 to 2011. In fiscal year 2010-2011 alone, 1,200 prisoners were serving time for opioid-related crimes; 81% had no previous drug offenses and 65% needed substance abuse treatments, according to the report by Florida's Office of Program Policy Analysis and Government Accountability.\n\nIn the federal system, mandatory minimum sentences have dropped significantly since the 1990s, although they continue to result in long punishments for thousands of federal inmates. According to the U.S. Sentencing Commission, nearly 20,000 federal cases in 2019 involved mandatory minimum punishments. A large majority of which - more than 70% - involved drug trafficking offenses.\n\nForrester tested positive for COVID-19 on July 13. He's doing better now and assumes he's negative, though he hasn't been retested.\n\nStill, in the close quarters of a prison, he fears getting the virus again is inevitable. The possibility of reinfection, experts have said, is real. Forrester has heard of other prisoners who died of COVID-19 and asks himself: How many times can I catch the virus and survive?\n\nSo far, 340 prisoners at Bay Correctional and Rehabilitation Facility in Panama City, Florida, where Forrester is incarcerated, have tested positive.\n\nOf the more than 95,000 prisoners in Florida, 15,500 or about 16% have COVID-19 - an infection rate far exceeding the federal prison system's.\n\nThe Florida Department of Corrections said it has suspended visitation, limited transfers between facilities, and staggered meal times to allow for social distancing at dining areas to stem the spread of the virus. Symptomatic prisoners are placed in medical isolation, and officials conduct contact tracing for every positive case, the department said.\n\nGEO Group, a private corporation that operates Bay Correctional and Rehabilitation Facility and a few other prisons in Florida, said it has started mass COVID-19 testing, distributed face masks to inmates and asked staffers to self-quarantine if they had contact with other employees with coronavirus.\n\nIsolated and scared: The plight of juveniles locked up during the coronavirus pandemic\n\nForrester was convicted in 2009 for trafficking 14 grams or more of oxycodone and obtaining drugs by fraud. Although there was no evidence that Forrester sold drugs, the weight of the pills triggered a drug trafficking charge - punishable by a mandatory minimum sentence of 15 years.\n\nUnder Florida law, had Forrester sold 200 grams of cocaine or methamphetamine, he would've been sentenced to just seven years. Such was the result of laws passed to crack down on drug traffickers that have since ensnared those addicted to drugs.\n\nOPIOIDS & COVID: Clinton Foundation works to put naloxone in recovery homes\n\n\"The quintessential drug trafficker that the legislature had in mind is a 'thug,' running around and shooting people in the neighborhood,\" said Janet Ferris, a retired Florida judge. \"The reality in most communities is it's not.\"\n\nAcknowledging that sentencing laws had gone too far, the Florida legislature in 2014 raised the threshold weights that would trigger mandatory sentences. Advocates heralded the change as a \"common sense\" law that would cut the number of nonviolent offenders sent to prison for lengthy sentences.\n\nBut the law isn't retroactive and bills to make it retroactive have so far failed. Had Forrester been convicted after the law was passed, he would've been sentenced to seven years. He would've been out by now.\n\n'It gets more frightening': As coronavirus surges in prisons, families of elderly inmates wait in fear\n\nHarsh sentencing laws are not unique to Florida, although the state has increasingly become an outlier for having stringent mandatory minimum sentences, said Nancy Daniels, of the Florida Public Defender Association.\n\nJudges, faced with defendants like Forrester, have no choice but to impose lengthy sentences they didn't believe were fair. The judge who sentenced Forrester to 15 years acknowledged as much.\n\n\"We get the addicted, and we get the organized crime, all threated the same under the wording of the Legislature,\" Judge Roger McDonald said during Forrester's sentencing hearing in December 2009, according to court transcripts. \"But since the Legislature is the Legislature and the Court is the Court, we have to enforce the laws, and we're stuck with them, and we can't carve out exceptions that don't exist.\"\n\nFerris said she often felt helpless when she had to face defendants in her courtroom, many of whom were young, first-time offenders.\n\n\"I did not have the opportunity in many instances to do what I thought was in the interest of justice. And that is a really, really troubling feeling,\" she said. \"When people come into the courtroom and say, 'Judge, I'm asking for justice' and you know what they're saying is correct ... To say to someone, 'I'm sorry I can't do justice in this case because the legislature has enacted a mandatory sentencing law, I have to follow that.'\"\n\nIn 2002, as he was visiting his grandmother in Bradenton, Fla., Forrester received sobering news. There were cancerous tumors in his left lung and he would likely die, he remembered his doctor telling him on the phone.\n\nMultiple surgeries to remove his lung seemed to have stretched his life, but he spent the next few years in and out of the hospital. Several visits were because of pneumonia. That's on top of a litany of other health problems: chronic headaches, chest and lower back pain, sleep apnea, strokes and panic attacks. He had more surgeries to fix chronic spine issues.\n\nAll the while, he said, he was prescribed huge doses of pain killers.\n\nHe'd spent much of his working years in telecommunications, first as a repairman in Florida, then as a pipeline controller in Oklahoma, then back to Florida as a dispatcher. When his addiction got worse, he said he relied on disability benefits to help make ends meet.\n\nAs his health problems worsened, so did his addiction. He was often at doctors' offices and pain clinics, receiving prescriptions for dozens, if not hundreds of milligrams of various opioid medications, including MS Contin, methadone pills, oxycodone, morphine, hydromorphine, muscle relaxants and Marinol for his loss of appetite.\n\n\"I was given hydrocodones by the hundreds,\" he said, referring to refillable prescriptions for 100 pills. \"I soon realized that out of all the other life-threatening problems I had gone through, I was now in the middle of the most deadly, a big dependence on and addiction to opioids.\"\n\nA pain management doctor testified at Forrester's sentencing hearing that some of the doses Forrester had been prescribed were too much. The morphine dose Forrester had been getting from another doctor \"was a little bit high,\" Dr. Gwinn Murray testified, according to court transcripts.\n\nThe last time Murray saw Forrester, Forrester asked for an increase in his oxycodone prescription because his pain had not gone away. Murray, who believed patients should rely less on medication and more on other means to deal with their pain, denied the request, according to transcripts.\n\nAfter his medications were cut back, Forrester said he began faking prescriptions. The less drugs he got, the more he felt he needed them, and the more he resorted to illegal means to get them. The more drugs he got, the worse his life became.\n\nTwice, Forrester woke up on life support after an accidental overdose. Other times, he said he woke up on his couch as medics were administering a shot of Narcan to reverse the effect of the drugs he'd taken.\n\n\"My whole personality changed,\" he said. \"I no longer knew myself, and all that mattered was feeding this addiction that had control over me.\"\n\nLaw enforcement officials, including prosecutors and sheriffs, have opposed changes to mandatory minimum sentences, concerned that easing punishments could lead to rising crime rates and the spread of drugs in communities.\n\nPinellas County Sheriff Bob Gualtieri said mandatory minimums provide consistency in punishments and avoid instances in which sentences for the same crimes vary from judge to judge or county to county.\n\n\"Mandatory minimums are designed to provide the appropriate consequences for people that are selling drugs and trafficking drugs,\" said Gualtieri, immediate past president of the Florida Sheriff's Association.\n\nStill, Gualtieri said drug laws \"were never intended and should not have encompassed people who were addicts and users.\"\n\n'Complete chaos': How the coronavirus pandemic is upending the criminal justice system\n\nIn Broward County, prosecutors have started easing sentences for several defendants convicted of opioid trafficking. Citing the changes the legislature made in 2014, prosecutors have recommended reduced prison sentences for two dozen defendants. Nineteen people have been released, and four are scheduled to be set free in the next four years, said Broward Chief Assistant State Attorney Jeff Marcus. Another defendant died before his release papers were processed.\n\n\"We believe it was an issue of fundamental fairness to initiate a review of these cases and reduce the sentences when appropriate,\" Marcus said in a statement.\n\nOne problem in Florida is the lack of a cohesive vision for what the criminal justice system should look like, said state Sen. Jeff Brandes, a Republican from St. Petersburg.\n\n\"The real question is whether you're going to use data and research to make decisions, or whether you're going to trust that the legislature of the past always got it right,\" said Brandes, who's been leading the effort to change sentencing laws and has been calling for giving judges more discretion. \"Fundamentally, should we treat addiction as a health issue or a criminal justice issue?\"\n\nLong prison sentences for such offenders does more harm than good, a belief that Brandes said Republicans and Democrats should share.\n\n\"Criminal justice reform is a bipartisan issue,\" he said. \"Democrats come to it from a social justice side. Republicans come to it from a public safety and fiscal conservatism side.\"\n\nForrester remembers clearly the day he was convicted by a jury. He thought he was about to cry as officers escorted him out of the courtroom, but the tears didn't come. When he was finally alone, sitting on a floor in a holding cell, they did.\n\n\"I felt like my heart had totally been crushed,\" he said. \"I prayed to Jesus to please help me what to know, what to do next.\"\n\nYears later, McDonald, the judge who sentenced Forrester, asked the state's Executive Clemency Board to release him early.\n\n\"At the time of the sentencing and even today I believe that the sentence was excessive given the crime, his criminal history and the involvement of addiction in his life,\" McDonald wrote in a 2018 letter to the board.\n\nHad it not been for mandatory sentencing laws, McDonald said he would've imposed a far more lenient sentence: three years in prison, two years on probation and drug treatment.\n\nThe Florida Commission on Offender Review declined to comment on Forrester's clemency application, saying the information is confidential. The commission publishes a database of people who have been granted clemency; Forrester's name is not in the database.\n\nIt seemed to Forrester, \"no one is listening.\"\n\n\"If they are listening,\" he said, \"then they just don't care.\"\n\nForrester says he spends his days reading the Bible, playing games he bought for his tablet provided by the prison, and exchanging emails with a longtime friend with whom he will live after he's released. In the mornings, he meditates and prays. Over the years, he's gathered about a dozen certificates, including several from dog training programs that allowed prisoners to become trained handlers and another after completing a substance abuse program.\n\nHis symptoms have abated, but the fear of dying before seeing the outside of a prison wall, hasn't.\n\nHe looks forward to going back home to Orlando, to his pets that are still alive and to a friend who has \"stuck with me all these years.\"\n\n\"I dream about the day I walk up to my front door,\" he said, \"and go inside where I can feel safe again.\"\n\nFollow USA TODAY's Justice and legal affairs reporter Kristine Phillips on Twitter @bykristinep.\n\n'It would cripple us completely': Coronavirus takes toll on rural police agencies",

        "authors": [],
        "body": "Dr. Scott Asnis' dental office in Bellmore, New York, looks a lot different than it did in February.\n\nToday, after checking in inside - where you and the receptionist are separated by a plastic barrier - you are asked to wait in your car until your dentist is ready to see you.\n\nOnce called back, you must don a face mask, while dental technicians take your temperature and have you wash your hands thoroughly. Then they ask that you gargle with a peroxide solution to kill any bacteria inside your mouth.\n\nOnce in the chair, technicians at the dental chain he founded, Dental365, will not use the typical tools to clean your teeth. Any aerosols to clean your teeth are not used amid the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nWith these protocols implemented, Asnis says \"the dental office is the safest environment to go.\"\n\nBut only one in five adults have visited a dentist office amid pandemic, even though two in five adults said they've had dental issues since March.\n\nThat's according to a new survey released Monday by Guardian Life, which also says one in four U.S. adults won't be comfortable going to the dentist by the end of the year.\n\nThese statistics, however, don't reflect the experience at Asnis' practice. He said visits to Dental 365 \"are up 27% from last July,\" with the practice having seen 50,000 patients since March.\n\nBut he understands fears about going to the dentist now.\n\nDentist's clever hack for making face masks fit better goes viral on TikTok\n\nSo does Dr. Nadeem Karimbux, dean of Tufts University School of Dental Medicine. He also has seen an increase in visits to the university's emergency clinic, but he attributes the uptick to the closure of private dentist offices during shelter-in-place orders.\n\n\"During the shutdown across the U.S., the one thing that dentists and dental schools were allowed to do was to treat patients that needed urgent or emergency care,\" he said. Most of the dental school shut down, but not the emergency clinic, he said, which treated about a dozen patients a day during the three months that much of the country was on lockdown.\n\nOne patient was Bob Whitten, of Newtonville, Massachusetts. He said he was \"very apprehensive\" because he is at a higher risk for death from COVID-19 - he is 79, has cardiovascular issues, and previously had cancer - but had to seek emergency treatment in March for a fractured tooth.\n\nHis anxiety, however, abated when he saw that at Tufts \"every precaution that could have been reasonably taken was taken.\"\n\n\"Provided you as a patient took reasonable precautions by masking, and did the best to ensure that you maintained reasonable spacing between yourself and other patients, I think you would be safe to obtain emergency treatment,\" he said.\n\nAs dental offices reopen, it is important that people return, Karimbux said, \"because a lot of people did have active disease beforehand ... and many of them have gone untreated for a period of three to three and a half months.\"\n\nEven more reason to schedule that dentist appointment: A study released Aug. 10 found that hospitalized COVID-19 patients with extreme gum disease were 22 times more likely to suffer from acute respiratory problems and to be placed on a ventilator.\n\n\"People shouldn't ignore symptoms that they're having in the oral cavity. Oral health is important for general health,\" Karimbux said. \"It's important for people to recognize that you shouldn't allow things to progress if you're feeling symptoms.\"\n\nFor those who are still anxious, Asnis said that when making an appointment, people should \"certainly ask questions and make sure that there are policies and protocols in place so that the patient will always feel safe,\" including protective gear, social distancing and air filters.\n\nKarimbux said dentists who are open have prepared to ensure the safety of their patients, and are eager to see them return.\n\n\"People should feel very comfortable coming back into the dentist's office,\" he said. \"We've spent a lot of money and created a lot of protocols to ensure the safety of patients.\"",

    "Jackie Robinson Day: MLB needs to amplify legend's entire legacy": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "As Major League Baseball awakens to a forever altered landscape in the wake of two days of player strikes to shine a light on racial injustice, there is no better time to re-think its celebration of a civil rights icon.\n\nSince 1997, when Commissioner Bud Selig celebrated the 50th anniversary of Jackie Robinson's Brooklyn Dodgers debut, ending decades of exclusion for people of color in Major League Baseball, the league has wrapped itself in No. 42 the way a political figure might wrap him or herself in the flag. In this ever-unpredictable 2020, that celebration falls today, Aug. 28, rather than the usual April 15, due to the coronavirus-inspired industry shutdown.\n\nIn positioning itself as a social institution, the league could place itself on the right side of history, integrating before the NBA, for one, and Robinson's role in the overall civil rights movement gave the sport a permanent thread within the nation's fabric.\n\nThe Black player population has been in free fall since the late 1970s, settling in at around 8% for the past decade. Managers, front offices, and executive roles at the league's central office are nearly bereft of people of color. The game's revenues have boomed but its cultural currency has waned significantly, a disease that has dozens of symptoms but perhaps none greater than the difficulty in accessing a sport that seems to grow more expensive to play and watch.\n\nMLB's efforts to grow the game and increase access come in good faith, but tangible gains remain elusive. Meanwhile, its embrace of Robinson only grows tighter, starting with the retirement of his No. 42 to having all players wear it on the standard April 15 anniversary to the various cut-and-paste social media platitudes celebrating the man.\n\nAll of it is well-intended, from the deeds to the dinero - such as the $420,000 the Miami Marlins pledged Friday to the Jackie Robinson Foundation to fund an annual scholarship, and the $3.5 million commitment MLB made in renewing its commitment to that organization. Yet now seems like an ideal time to move beyond the workshopped symbolism and toward a fuller, more organic embrace of Robinson's legacy.\n\nThis was a startling week for Major League Baseball.\n\nHundreds of its players - by tradition painfully staid and conservative in comportment and worldview - sat out to protest social injustice. As Black players expressed why they felt a desire to sit out, a handful of white allies - from Rhys Hoskins to Mike Yastrzemski to Brent Suter and many others - emerged.\n\nTo be sure, these actions had far from unanimous support. Ten teams - some partially driven by circumstance - have not yet participated in this strike.\n\nBut the action was radical by baseball standards and suggested at least a partial evolution that in some ways mirrored Robinson's.\n\nHis qualities most often celebrated are dignity and endurance, tolerance and courage. Yet at his core, Robinson was a radical, a complex individual who carried the confusion and pain of the actor in the arena of struggle.\n\nAny activist today knows their message must be pitch-perfect and consistent, lest they be branded a hypocrite or asked by those in positions of power and privilege, \"What exactly is it that you want?\"\n\nRobinson's views did not move in a linear fashion. His history is dotted with critiques of Black activist Paul Robeson for sympathizing with Russia or Martin Luther King Jr. for opposing the war in Vietnam, and even briefly pledging support for Richard Nixon's 1960 presidential bid.\n\nBut he eventually saw through the fog of his own war to disavow those viewpoints and take actions that we don't often hear about on the day he's celebrated.\n\nThe Jackie Robinson that baseball needs to know about lent his support to Olympic medalists John Carlos and Tommie Smith, who were exiled for protesting racism and the inclusion of South Africa in the 1968 games. The fuller view of Robinson includes a man who resigned from the NAACP board because he found it \"unresponsive to the needs and aims of the black masses,\" and who disavowed MLB in 1969 for failing to hire a Black manager, a barrier that would not be broken until Frank Robinson in 1975.\n\nThe Robinson we've magnified for feel-good truisms such as that a life \"is not important except in the impact it has on other lives\" has nearly erased the man who wrote that \"in 1972, in 1947, at my birth in 1919, I know that I never had it made.\"\n\nThat sentiment is expressed in a video MLB released Friday, narrated by Mookie Betts and directed by Emmy-winning Randy Wilkins. Interspersing clips of Robinson with modern players and recent protests, it would almost certainly meet Jackie's approval.\n\nNow, to educate the game's young.\n\nSince George Floyd's killing in May, we've heard a lot from ballplayers and managers about \"having difficult conversations\" in the clubhouse about racial injustice. Those were renewed this week after Kenosha, Wis. police shot Jacob Blake seven times in the back, leading to walkouts that began with Milwaukee's Bucks and Brewers and eventually spread to 20 major league teams.\n\nAnd as Black players share their experiences with racial profiling and unfair policing, a theme has emerged from their white teammates: They had no idea.\n\nThat seems startling at first. Then, you consider that the average young, white ballplayer grew up in a time mistakenly labeled \"post-racial,\" as if having a Black president for up to a third of their lives papered over all inequities.\n\nAnd then you consider the bubble of so many white ballplayers: From cul-de-sac or gated community to private instructor, travel ball team and then a college program or the minor leagues, with perhaps a handful of Black teammates along the way.\n\nMeanwhile, those teammates are often the only Black players on their respective teams, isolated and disempowered to speak their truths. In many cases, until this week.\n\nThat should never be the case again.\n\nSo while MLB celebrates Robinson, it needs to amplify every ounce of his story, and educate its youngest and most impressionable players from the time they enter the game, including the through line that exists to today's enduring structural injustices.\n\nAs players in every league noted this week, sitting out a handful of games won't erase police brutality, or systemic racism. And so those \"difficult conversations\" will still occur.\n\nThey can be a little easier in the future if the game presents a fuller picture of Robinson.",

        "body": "The Jaguars starting quarterback Gardner Minshew can return to the team's facility and resume throwing passes to his receivers in training camp.\n\nHe was activated off the reserve/COVID-19 list Tuesday morning after going on the list Sunday with five other players.\n\nMinshew is expected to rejoin his teammates for strength and conditioning work. Minshew and Detroit Lions' Matthew Stafford was the only starting quarterbacks in the league to be put on the COVID-19 list.\n\nJaguars also announced safety Andrew Wingard was removed from the COVID-19 list and cornerback D.J. Hayden [knee] was activated off the active/physically unable to perform list.\n\nMinshew is scheduled to hold a virtual news conference at noon on Tuesday.\n\nThe reserve/COVID-19 list was created for players who test positive or have been quarantined after having close contact with an infected person or persons. Under the NFL's policy, teams are not permitted to disclose whether a player is in quarantine or tested positive for COVID-19.\n\nAccording to safety protocols acquired from the Jaguars, if a player is exposed to an infected person, he needs a second negative test within 24 hours of the initial negative test. Also, the player will be tested for the next eight days and will be regularly tested thereafter.\n\nA player who tests positive but who doesn't show any COVID-19 symptoms must have two negative tests within a five-day period after the initial positive test.\n\nMinshew was tested for COVID-19 last week on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Friday, and all three tests came back negative, which allowed him to enter the facility and undergo his physical examination.",

But he has not been tested yet.\"\n\nBedingfield said Biden, 77, has followed the \"strictest protocols\" to prevent exposure to the virus and was therefore confident he had not been infected.

    "Kirk Cousins wrong in explaining COVID-19 comment, 'If I die, I die'": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "The Minnesota Vikings quarterback moved up his scheduled Zoom call with reporters by a day to try and explain just what he meant when he said he wasn't much concerned by COVID-19 because \"If I die, I die. I kind of have peace about that.\" But as it turns out, Cousins meant what he said. He just wishes he'd said it differently.\n\n\"Admittedly, I did not use the best wording. I certainly could have articulated it better,\" he said. \"(But) the heart behind it is no different then as it is today.\"\n\nAs an NFL quarterback, Cousins' words have an impact. In his home, in the Vikings' facilities and in a country that prizes the NFL above any other sport. The last thing that's needed, with 185,000 dead and misinformation already being spread at the highest levels, is for Cousins to give any license to the idea that the virus shouldn't be viewed with the utmost seriousness.\n\nOne of the most distressing things about America right now is that we no longer have a shared set of facts. When a pandemic has killed almost half as many Americans as in all of World War II, cratered our economy and forced us to stay away from friends and loved ones for their own protection, it should not be up for debate that the virus is bad and that caution should be exercised.\n\nWhen epidemiologists and virologists say the best thing we can do until there is a vaccine or proven treatment is wear masks and social distance, it shouldn't become a cultural football. When data shows that young, healthy people are not immune and even those without symptoms could be left with long-term damage to their hearts and brains, it shouldn't even be a question that health and safety need to be the priority.\n\nWhen asked if he could understand why his comments, first aired on Kyle Brandt's \"10 Questions\" podcast, were seen by many as damaging, Cousins said he was expressing his personal feelings. He also said he's adhering to the NFL's safety protocols for social distancing, frequent hand washing and wearing face coverings - so much so that when he left his locker to go to a meeting recently and didn't have his mask, he immediately realized something was missing.\n\n\"That's what it's all about, right? I want to be very respectful and considerate of everyone else,\" Cousins said.\n\nBut how can he be, when he's so steadfast in sowing the seeds of doubt?\n\nCousins is open about his deep Christian faith, and his feelings are informed by his belief that everything happens according to God's plans. But so many of Jesus' miracles involved healing people. To blithely disregard the advice of today's healers, to think Cousins knows better, runs counter to that.\n\nThis isn't a matter of personal belief, but rather one of public health. There are plenty of other people whose faith is just as strong, whose belief in God's plan is just as certain, who have put their trust in science.\n\nIf Cousins' feelings about COVID-19 impacted no one but himself, that would be fine. But they don't. There are 52 other players, as well as Vikings coaches, who are depending on him. He has small children who are modeling their behavior after him. Presenting his feelings about COVID-19 as an alternative view was not only selfish, it was reckless.\n\nCousins says his beliefs are his own. It would have been better to keep them that way.",

        "authors": [],
        "body": "LSU's defense of its college football national championship is off to a rocky start, with just one month before the Tigers open their season. Positive COVID-19 tests or a risk of exposure to infected individuals has sidelined nearly the entire offensive line position group in quarantine, according to a report in the Baton Rouge Advocate.\n\nCiting multiple people, the story by the Advocate said all but four members of the offensive line have either tested positive for the novel coronavirus or are isolating due to high-risk exposure. Players who test positive must isolate for 10 days and must be symptom free for at least 24 hours before returning to practice, according to SEC COVID-19 protocols. Individuals with high-risk exposure must quarantine for 14 days.\n\nOn one hand, this situation illustrates why the SEC delayed the start of its conference-only schedule until Sept. 26, when LSU is scheduled to play against Mississippi State. Should no other cases crop up, all players could be back in action by opening day should there be no lingering health issues.\n\nHowever, the situation also represents the nightmare scenario of a team experiencing an outbreak in a position group once the season is underway. That could require rescheduling or cancellation of games in an effort to complete the season by the proposed Dec. 19 date.",

    "Louisville chaplain's journal chronicles COVID-19's private wounds": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "LOUISVILLE, Ky. - Through the hospital room window, she could see her husband laid face down, a ventilator plunged down his throat. Muted beeping filled the ward's sterile air.\n\nJust weeks earlier, the man seemed to have beat COVID-19. Now life was slipping away.\n\nChaplain Adam Ruiz stood beside the man's wife, who watched helplessly through the glass for fear of being infected herself.\n\nHe heard her beg doctors. \"He's the only thing I have.\"\n\nWhen the breathing machine was finally removed, all she could do was ask questions of the nurses. Why is his mouth staying open? Can he hear anything? Why is his body suddenly jerking? Why is he gasping for breath? Is he in pain?\n\nIn the end, her husband died just beyond the arms that had promised to always be around him.\n\n\"It's not real,\" she repeated, \"because I can't be in there.\"\n\nIt was April 2020, barely a month after the first coronavirus case arrived in Kentucky, and the 58-year-old hospital chaplain found himself thrust into some of the global pandemic's most private and painful moments.\n\nLike colleagues across the country, Ruiz's already tough job providing spiritual care amid loss had grown exponentially more difficult. Illness and death multiplied. Fear and uncertainty gripped front-line doctors and nurses. Visitor restrictions meant suffocating isolation for patients and families. Grief was interrupted, funerals denied. A mountain of need sprang up overnight.\n\nRuiz's unassuming shuffle in hospital hallways, his calm eyes behind wire-frame glasses and easy demeanor, belied his own strains that few but his wife could see. Both to cope emotionally and knowing \"we were entering something extraordinary,\" he began keeping a journal the day before the first case arrived.\n\nRuiz pecked out dozens of pages, one finger at a time, over six months of what were often 12-hour days. He chronicled hospital strains, prayers, doubts, coronavirus counts; quiet conversations, stress and heroics of health care workers; knife-sharp miseries and sacred moments that otherwise went unseen.\n\nHe comforted a woman forced to sit alone with her stillborn child. He used FaceTime to show the last rites of a coronavirus victim to his family. He watched people struggle with mask shortages, argue divisive politics and battle crippling anxiety.\n\nStaff was upset, he wrote about the April death, recording the anguish of a nurse. If it was that hard for families socially distanced from dying loved ones, the nurse told Ruiz, what must it be like for the patient? It's horrible.\n\nRuiz's experience offers a rare and intimate window into the personal toll of a pandemic still gripping the nation. \"Incredible and terrible things are happening,\" he said.\n\nOn a cool March morning, Ruiz rose as usual before 6 a.m. in his split-level brick home in suburban east Louisville, donning his navy blue scrubs and downing a plate of eggs.\n\nCareful not to awake his wife of 25 years, Denise, he fed his dogs, Buddy and Molly, and grabbed his ever-pinging cell phone. He steered his car toward Norton Women & Children's Hospital as he has for the past seven years.\n\nOn that first Thursday in March -- nearly seven weeks after the first U.S. case in Washington state -- Ruiz recorded the beginning of Kentucky's fight with COVID-19 on a blank word document in his spare hospital office. Governor announces state of emergency. First KY Covid patient.\n\nHospitals outside of New York were just beginning the scramble for masks, ventilators and COVID-19 tests. Ruiz's hospital began what would be a flurry of changes: stricter sanitizing measures, isolation rooms, visitor limitations and elective surgery cancellations.\n\nWhere there had been little time to plan or gather equipment, there was even less to prepare emotionally, he later reflected in his journal.\n\nNurses and doctors feared getting infected or taking it home to their children, he wrote. Frustrations flared over shortages of N95 masks and shifting usage guidelines. Some complained doctors were being prioritized for scarce tests ahead of nurses.\n\nHe spoke with one nurse upset about tending to COVID-19 patients because few others were volunteering. He comforted another, writing, I ask if I can quietly pray with her. She says yes. We pray at the nurses' station. She cries softly and says she feels better.\n\nHe was getting more prayer requests, too. One came from a nurse, scared after caring for ICU patients being tested for the coronavirus. She told Ruiz she'd emptied her bank account to stock up on food and worried about her 72-year-old mother. Please pray for my mom who works and is scared. She is 72 and is worried every single day.\n\nTo help, he, along with other hospital staff, created a staff room with calming music. He brought chocolate or brisket BBQ to a team caring for COVID patients. He listened and gave out spiritual reassurance. He created a group text of stressed chaplains. He emailed a worried colleague: Covid is big. We're bigger...Stay together with me. We will be okay.\n\nBut he also worried he and other Norton chaplains would soon be overwhelmed, writing on March 19 that Today was hard. I called ____ afterwards and told her we needed more help because I felt the work we had to do was going to be more than what we (chaplains) could handle.\n\nBy late March, the hospital's overworked intensive care unit was half full of COVID-19 patients, many depressed and alone. Some funeral homes were limiting or denying family visitation or services. Staff was thin as nurses left to quarantine.\n\nRuiz knew some New York City hospitals were overwhelmed by patients struggling to breathe, forced to use refrigerated trucks to handle all the dead bodies. He knew the pandemic was pulling him to a place he didn't want to go, he said.\n\nAbout 7 a.m on March 27, Ruiz got a frantic call asking to help with a 12-year-old girl and her adult brother on their way to see their mother.\n\nShe had COVID-19. When Ruiz arrived, she was on a ventilator. Near death, he wrote later.\n\n\"There were a lot of unknowns,\" Ruiz said, including how safe it was for him, staff or the mother's children, who weren't finished with their 14-day quarantine. \"What's our policy? Let them in? Not let them in?\" he recalled asking.\n\nThe woman was intubated in an ICU room, tubes and machines keeping her alive. He scrambled to reach the woman's father, who couldn't be brought to Louisville in time.\n\nThat night, he wrote, the patient died.\n\nTo help the young girl cope, she was given two teddy bears. One was for her. In the other, she penned a message to her mother. It would be put in her coffin and buried with her, he wrote.\n\nRuiz felt a heaviness. There were only seven deaths in Kentucky at that point. But that figure would grow five-fold by the following week, and leap to 213 within a month.\n\nBut it was when he was called from the ICU to Room 9 in the hospital's labor and delivery area after that Ruiz felt how far the pandemic's impact was reaching beyond COVID-19 patients themselves.\n\nInside he found a mother laying in a bed. Nearby, the stillborn baby she'd delivered earlier was in a medical crib just feet away.\n\nShe was alone, she told him. Her husband was stuck in quarantine in another state. Her mother was high-risk and couldn't come. The pandemic's isolation had made an already traumatic experience far more difficult.\n\nShe doesn't know what to tell her other children. She asks me to help her decide what to do with the baby. \"You decide for me,\" she says. \"I can't think.\"\n\nThen she says, \"Can you pray? Like a funeral type prayer?\"\n\nAlone and scared with nothing and no one familiar to lean into and lean on, she asks me and the nurse to be her proxy family; to help her bless her baby to heaven. And so we pray.... We pray, and I leave, and I know I haven't really done much to comfort this mother. I write this not out of guilt or feeling of failure. I write it because it is the reality.\n\nRuiz's phone rang about 9 a.m., the voice on the other end was frantic. \"Hurry, he's dying.\"\n\nIt was April 21, and Kentucky's COVID-19 cases had shot up to 3,192, with 171 deaths.\n\nThe call was about Juan Carlos Pat Morales, a 48-year-old mechanic who lives in Buechel. He'd been in Norton Audubon hospital with the coronavirus for two weeks, among the minority groups being hit disproportionately hard by the virus.\n\nRuiz, who speaks Spanish, had been caring for Morales, including delivering groceries to his partner, Alvina Baires, and her teen daughter, both ill and quarantined.\n\n\"It's COVID,\" Morales had told Baires in the last phone call the couple shared before he was put on a ventilator. Both knew his diabetes put him in grave danger.\n\nBaires was scared. She wanted to rush to the hospital. But because of her coronavirus symptoms, it wasn't allowed. So Ruiz made a promise.\n\nRelated: Louisville health authorities want to expand COVID-19 testing for Hispanic residents\n\n\"I can be your eyes and ears. Look in on your husband, call and tell you what I'm seeing. And that way, in a sense, you can be there,\" he told her.\n\nIn the car that day Ruiz played Gregorian chants, reverberant voices that harken to a Catholic monastery. He said they help him get in touch with God ahead of difficult times.\n\nRuiz parked and hustled into the hospital's ICU, huddling with doctors and nurses in the quiet hallways, its glass-windowed rooms half full of people on ventilators. A priest was on hand.\n\nRuiz and nurses briefly debated whether using Zoom would cause privacy violations. We've got to make a decision, he told them. This guy is dying.\n\nRuiz called Baires and her daughter with a FaceTime video. He told her that the priest was giving last rites. He was able to show him putting on his collar, anointing Morales and touching his forehead. The priest was holding the man's hands in his, he told her.\n\nOver the next 20 minutes, they talked about his hometown in Mexico. Sunrises and flowers. Her faith. How difficult it was not being there with the man with whom she'd moved to Louisville when his Shelbyville factory closed. How he'd gone from healthy to death's door in two weeks.\n\nThe day ticked on, and Ruiz was narrating a heart or oxygen rate as nurses called them out. 59. 49. 19. 8. Avila started crying. Her daughter began crying too.\n\nFinally, the doctor raised a hand toward Ruiz as if he was saying goodbye, to signal a time of death.\n\nHe's gone to Jesus, Ruiz said.\n\nBy May, more than 100 nurses, doctors and staffers in Norton hospitals had contracted the virus caring for patients. Cases had topped 6,129 statewide, with 294 deaths.\n\nYet staff tensions had begun to ease as the month wore on, he wrote. People felt safer and more certain of protocols. His hospital's ICU hadn't run out of beds or ventilators.\n\nEven so, Ruiz's journal entries that spilled into the following weeks were filled with countless moments of the pandemic's quiet pain.\n\nOn May 15, he wrote about seeing a doctor tell a mother of three children -- one in elementary, middle and high school -- her 30-something husband was going to die of the coronavirus.\n\nDoctor: \"The three of you have to now help your mother. And you (the oldest at 15), you have to now be the man of the house.\"\n\nThis kid goes over and touches his 7-year-old sister's head in a loving, protective manner.\n\nHis journal, alternating in tone between the brevity and stoicism of a sea captain's log about a gale to passages of emotional storytelling, is filled with instances of front-line health workers scrambling bravely amid the dangers and chaos of life-and-death emergencies.\n\nOne a day in mid-May, he wrote, bells and whistles were going off everywhere in the ICU, a cacophony of alarms from ventilators, oximeters, IV infusions and heart monitors, marveling at nurses rushing to respond with poise and compassion, doors opening and closing, phones ringing.\n\nAround that same time, he watched another woman sing to her 88-year-old mother. And then, three gentle breaths later, she departed this world. She was home now. The daughter stood up from her chair and draped herself over her mother.\n\n\"I love you, Mom. I love you. I love you so much.\" (She) quietly cried next to the bed, and I stood as well in awe and wonder at what I had seen.\n\nHer daughter, alone because of restrictions, thanked him. \"I couldn't have done this alone.\"\n\nOften limited from walking in and out of rooms himself, he thought about the brain tumor he'd battled at age 19, consuming a decade of his life with hospitals, illness and depression, but propelled him into chaplaincy.\n\n\"So we pray outside. I think about how I was when I had my brain tumor. Totally vulnerable. I would imagine them feeling the same. And I'd pray, send them love, and trust in some way it would reach them,\" he said.\n\nWhen he told patients he was going to stay with them, to see them though, he could see the relief on their faces.\n\nHe recounted in a journal entry a conversation with one patient two days before he died. His family had been limited in visiting him. One night, Ruiz knocked on the patient's door and was invited in to talk.\n\nThe light outside was fading in the darkening room. Ruiz stood at the foot of his bed. The man was freshly shaved but seemed to take effort for him to talk.\n\n\"I'm not sure about what but I pray. Mostly forgiveness, really. That's the main thing. Maybe the only thing I need now ... We all do things we regret. Things that we shouldn't have done. Things we could've done better. I just need to feel forgiven for all my mistakes: for all the times I was not a good husband or could've been a better father or a better person. I did things. But maybe what I did best was my grandkids. Maybe I did that right. They're everything, really.\"\n\nRuiz told him he seemed like a man of faith. That was what mattered. And he told him he'd done well. The man seemed to find acceptance.\n\n\"I'm glad you came. Don't leave. Stay a little longer if you can.\"\n\n\"I will.\"\n\nIt was early June when Ruiz walked into a small church in Louisville.\n\nAcross the state, the numbers of new daily cases had declined. Restrictions on gatherings were beginning to ease, businesses reopening and funerals were resuming.\n\nIn a casket lay a man who died of COVID-19 after his meatpacking employer reopened.\n\nWalking past rows of pews to the altar, family and friends moved to embrace Ruiz for helping. It made him nervous. Days later, he attended another funeral in Mount Washington that included many mourners without masks.\n\nIt was then he said he realized that people had begun to lose their discipline, potentially allowing the virus to storm back. Meantime, headlines about the heroics of front-line health care workers had given way to politics, mistrust and suspicion. The mask issue seemed to be a control issue. I'm afraid, I'm out of control. Here is something I can directly address, attack, seek redress, he wrote.\n\nRuiz was right. Kentucky's cumulative cases nearly doubled from 15,842 to 30,151 in July alone, putting schools, sports, concerts, other reopenings into question, cases began to rise again at Ruiz's hospital, too.\n\nOn July 25, Ruiz lost another relative who had attended a wedding and later became ill. Aunt Jose died today, he wrote, saying that Covid contributed to her weakened state.\n\nHis spirits sunk. He understood the public was fatigued. Some of them could forget. But as July turned to August, he could not. Nearly 400 healthcare workers across Norton's hospitals, clinics and offices had contracted the coronavirus by Aug. 18. In the halls of the hospital, Ruiz continued to tend to its wounded.\n\nThere was the mother, isolated with her premature baby in the NICU because of COVID-19, relying on Ruiz to see her through her baby's heart surgery.\n\nThe 19-year-old on life support with a ventilator taped to his mouth, whose girlfriend spoke to Ruiz at the ICU door. They prayed together. \"Thank you for the miracle of his life,\" he said.\n\nRuiz said goodbye, straightened his glasses and ambled down the hallway.\n\nAnother room, another troubled family.\n\nHis shift wasn't over, and neither was the pandemic.",

        "body": "MSC Cruises cracked down on passengers who broke newly implemented COVID-19 health and safety protocol as the cruise line's ships resume sailing after the pandemic shut the global industry down in March.\n\nOn Tuesday, the cruise line denied a family from getting back on board the MSC Grandiosa after an excursion during which MSC Cruises says they broke from the \"social bubble\" put in place to avoid the spread of coronavirus. The Grandiosa departed from Genoa, Italy, Sunday on what was billed as the first Mediterranean cruise after Italy's pandemic lockdown.\n\n\"We had to deny re-embarkation to a family who broke from their shore excursion yesterday while visiting Naples, Italy,\" Paige Rosenthal, spokesperson for MSC Cruises, told USA TODAY Wednesday.\n\nAmong the other port calls for the Grandiosa are Palermo, Italy, and Valletta, Malta. Malta is one of four Mediterranean countries from which Italy requires incoming travelers to have COVID-19 tests.\n\nMSC stopped the family from getting on the ship to ensure the health and safety of passengers and crew on board, she explained, noting that because the group departed from the organized shore excursion, they would pose a risk to others upon getting back on the Grandiosa.\n\n\"This family broke from the 'social bubble' created for them and all other guests, and therefore could not be permitted to re-board the ship,\" Rosenthal said.\n\nOrganized shore excursions allow MSC to \"uphold the same high standards\" she said are being maintained on board.\n\nAnyone testing positive or who has a fever or other COVID-19 symptoms will be denied boarding, the company said. Passengers must wear face masks in elevators and other areas where social distancing is not possible. The ship's crew spent time in quarantine before the start of the cruise.\n\nEarlier this month, the Italian government gave its approval for cruise ships to once again depart from Italy's ports. But cruise ships are being limited to 70% capacity.\n\nFor now, MSC is limiting its guests to those who are residents of Europe's 26-nation Schengen visa-free travel zone.\n\nMSC said every guest and crew member on board will be given a wristband that \"facilitates contactless transactions around the ship as well as providing contact and proximity tracing.\"\n\nMSC declined to say how many passengers were sailing on this cruise.\n\nCruising remains on hold in U.S. waters until Nov. 1, at the earliest.\n\nAs cruising resumes: In some parts of world, multiple cruise ships affected by new COVID-19 cases",

        "authors": [],
        "body": "Mark Mothersbaugh, co-founder of the band Devo, is opening up about his harrowing battle with COVID-19.\n\nIn an interview with the Los Angeles Times published Monday, Mothersbaugh, 70, recalled fighting for his life in the ICU after contracting the coronavirus, which left him on a ventilator and led him to experience delusions.\n\nMothersbaugh said he believes he caught the virus while working at his commercial music company, Mutato Musikain, in May. When he began experiencing symptoms, the musician brushed them off, thinking he was just overworked. After he took his temperature, however, he was surprised to see he had a fever of 103.\n\n\"A nurse came over the next morning and said, 'You should be in ICU.' \" Mothersbaugh recalled. \"I said, 'That's ridiculous.' She replied that she'd been a nurse for three decades: 'You need an ambulance right now.' \"\n\nThe nurse saved his life, said Mothersbaugh's wife, Anita Greenspan, adding that her husband's health quickly took a turn for the worse.\n\n\"It went from, 'I don't feel good' on Tuesday to an ambulance to Cedars(-Sinai hospital) on Saturday,\" she said. \"It was terrifying.\"\n\nWhile hospitalized, Mothersbaugh said he experienced some \"very dark\" delusions. In one of them, the musician said he believed he was in the hospital because someone had hit him on the head with a brick in downtown Los Angeles.\n\n\"I felt blood from being hit,\" Mothersbaugh said. \"I was handcuffed to a parking deck downtown. I had this whole elaborate story of how these kids sold me to an ambulance company that then got some sort of a payment for delivering COVID patients to their ICUs. I totally believed it.\"\n\nBryan Cranston reached out to Tom Hanks after the actors got COVID-19 'around the same time'\n\nIn another delusion, Mothersbaugh said he wrote a brand new Devo album and organized a live show that the band performed through augmented reality in Hollywood.\n\nThe musician experienced delusions for more than two weeks, both on and off the ventilator. Through it all, Mothersbaugh said the support from his family was crucial, recalling one particular FaceTime call that came at \"a time where I just felt exhausted.\"\n\n\"Like, 'I could just float down this river right now, and it would be really peaceful. It wouldn't be a freak-out. It wouldn't be something I'd be scared of. I could really just do that.' I really thought about it,\" he said. \"And then it just happened that (Greenspan) called me, and she and the kids were on my phone, saying, 'You're getting out of there soon. Get off of that machine.' I don't know if everybody is lucky enough to have somebody do that for them.\"\n\nAntonio Banderas reveals on his 60th birthday that he tested positive for coronavirus\n\nMothersbaugh added he wants people to look out for their loved ones who are in the hospital battling COVID-19.\n\n\"If you have anyone that you know who's in ICU with COVID, contact them and keep them in touch with the outside world, because it's easy to lose track of where you are and why you are,\" he said. \"I had no idea I was on a ventilator for 10 days. Time meant nothing.\"\n\nNow, the musician said he's starting to get his health back on track.\n\n\"Before COVID, I was like, 'Yeah, I'm starting to feel about 50 now, and I'm 70,' \" he said. \"When I was in the hospital, I was feeling like I was about 90. And now I'm back to 70, and I'm trying to get back to 50. That's my goal.\"\n\nAfter announcing COVID-19 diagnosis, Alyssa Milano says the virus is making her lose hair",

College students who attend any classes or activities on campus, even once, must be vaccinated by Dec. 31.\n\nElementary and secondary students in districts and schools using a remote education model are not exempt.\n\nDepending on the child's age and flu vaccination history, a second dose of flu vaccine in the same season may be recommended, according to the department. In these cases, the second dose is not required for school entry.\n\nFor older students, the flu vaccine requirement applies to all full-time undergraduate and graduate students under 30 years of age and all full and part-time health science students. The requirement includes individuals from outside the U.S. attending or visiting classes or educational programs in Massachusetts as part of an academic visitation or exchange program.\n\nThe updated table of immunization requirements for the upcoming school year can be found at mass.gov.\n\nPandemic response: How miscommunication and selfishness hampered America's COVID-19 response\n\nOpinion: Even in face of a deadly pandemic, Big Ten parents set to do unthinkable -- protest for return of fall football",

        "authors": [],
        "body": "MEMPHIS -- Leslie Nelson, a 56-year-old Raleigh resident, was evicted from her home of several years Thursday. Nelson, who struggled to breathe while talking to The Commercial Appeal, said she is recovering from COVID-19.\n\nShe was sick, barely able to stand, she said, as her belongings were being removed from her home and piled on the property's front yard.\n\nMemphis police officers were on scene at Nelson's residence Thursday afternoon and told a Commercial Appeal photographer they were only there to keep the peace. The process server, there to oversee the eviction, left just before 3 p.m.\n\nEviction hearings resumed in Shelby County in mid-June after a months-long hiatus prompted by the novel coronavirus pandemic.\n\nTen volunteers had gathered on Nelson's Raleigh residence to try and move her belongings out of the sun, and to tend to Nelson while also keeping their distance.\n\nThe volunteers were summoned by Nelson's distress calls on Facebook, which were then amplified when Hunter Demster, a community organizer and activist, went to her house and livestreamed her eviction.\n\nAnd before the volunteers, movers or Memphis police cruisers showed up to her residence in the 3300 block of Joslyn Street, Nelson said she had pleaded with a probate attorney for a chance to settle her deceased mother-in-law's medical bills.\n\nThe house was left to Nelson and her partner. She said she has the papers to prove it, and sought ways to repay the medical debt attached to the house. A GoFundMe was started by a friend to help with expenses.\n\n\"I offered to pay,\" Nelson said. \"But he didn't even give me a warning. He just sent movers over here, and they showed up with police officers.\"\n\nNelson tested positive for COVID-19 on June 11. Though she had been been staying at home since the start of the pandemic, she did visit with a friend one day. That friend called her a few days later, saying they thought they had symptoms of heatstroke when they saw Nelson. It wasn't heatstroke, but COVID-19 at the root of their symptoms.\n\nJust three days after Nelson learned of her friend's positive status, she became sicker than she could ever remember feeling.\n\n\"I couldn't breathe, couldn't stand up, I was hallucinating at one point,\" Nelson said.\n\nShe called for an ambulance, and spent the next several days at Methodist North on oxygen.\n\nShe was released a few weeks ago, and had even started to feel like she was turning a corner. But when the process server showed up to her Raleigh residence, she said grew ill from the stress.\n\nHer epilepsy also presented itself in Thursday morning's chaos. Nelson suffered from a seizure severe enough to cause her to bite her tongue.\n\nCapt. Anthony Buckner with the Shelby County Sheriff's Office said no deputies responded to Nelson's address. SCSO, Buckner said, only handles about 20% of evictions in the county.\n\nThe rest are sometimes overseen by the Memphis Police Department, and Nelson said it was MPD officers who threatened arrest as she was being removed from her house.\n\nIt's not immediately clear if Nelson's eviction is among the 9,000 eviction filings Cindy Ettingoff, CEO and general counsel for the Memphis Area Legal Services, warned The Commercial Appeal about back in June.\n\nFor now, the group of volunteers are moving Nelson's belongings into a small rented storage space that someone donated. It's a start, but it's not quite enough to hold all her possessions from her house. She does not know where she will stay tonight.\n\nNelson's eviction, occurring after she said she was hospitalized with COVID-19, represents an aspect of public health the Shelby County Health Department has signaled concern over -- being unhoused and sick with COVID-19.\n\n\"This is going to happen again,\" Nelson said. \"And next time, I want to be the one that shows up to help.\"\n\nThe Commercial Appeal has reached out to Nelson's probate attorney for a response.",

        "authors": [],
        "body": "Former First Lady Michelle Obama said on her podcast Tuesday she's suffering from a \"low-grade depression,\" which she attributes to coronavirus quarantine, the mental health toll of racism and the \"hypocrisy\" of the Trump administration.\n\n\"These are not, they are not fulfilling times, spiritually,\" she told journalist Michele Norris during The Michelle Obama Podcast. \"I know that I am dealing with some form of low-grade depression. Not just because of the quarantine, but because of the racial strife, and just seeing this administration, watching the hypocrisy of it, day in and day out, is dispiriting.\"\n\nOne in three Americans are reporting symptoms of depression or anxiety, more than three times the rate from a survey conducted in the first half of 2019, a Census Bureau survey found.\n\nUSA TODAY spoke with Vaile Wright, senior director of Health Care Innovation at the American Psychological Association, about what low-grade depression is, who is susceptible and how it can be managed.\n\nTips for coping: Every Saturday and Tuesday we'll be in your inbox, offering you a virtual hug and a little bit of solace in these difficult times. Sign up for Staying Apart, Together.\n\n\"Low-grade depression is not an official diagnosis. It is probably closest to what we refer to as subclinical depression, which refers to a person who is experiencing depressive symptoms but does not meet the criteria for a depressive disorder,\" she said.\n\n\"The symptoms are similar to depression - sadness, loss of interest in activities, difficulty concentrating, sleep and appetite disturbances, irritability - and research has shown that subclinical depression has serious consequences for quality of life,\" she said.\n\nObama said she's \"waking up in the middle of the night because I'm worrying about something or there's a heaviness.\"\n\n\"We know that stress can lead to subclinical depression, especially when it is chronic and unmanaged, and it goes without saying that we are all living in a very stressful situation right now - the pandemic, systemic racism, economic downfall, upcoming election,\" Wright said. \"There's also a great sense of loss right now - whether it's the loss of a loved one or the loss of what was our 'normal' lives. Unfortunately, no one is immune to the stressors right now and the studies I have seen do suggest that people are experiencing increased depression and anxiety.\"\n\nObama said a number of factors are impacting her mental health.\n\nShe expressed frustration with Americans who refuse to wear masks. \"There's almost like there's a limit to our sacrifice and it was about a month and then we just got tired of the virus,\" she said. \"That's been disheartening to see so many people who have grown tired of staying at home because the virus didn't impact them.\"\n\nHer and Norris also addressed racism. As a Black woman, Obama admits it's \"exhausting\" hearing stories of racial injustice in the news.\n\n\"We talk about white women clutching their purses at the sight of us, or feeling uncomfortable when we walk in the store,\" she said, \"but I wonder, do you know how afraid we are?\"\n\n\"We know that psychological treatment such as psychotherapy is effective but there are also many lifestyle or behavioral things that people can do including exercise, meditation and mindfulness, seeking out social connection, and engaging in coping skills to improve their mood,\" Wright said.\n\nObama said staying connected with loved ones and taking a social media break helps her get out of \"a bad place.\"\n\nShe says quarantining with her husband, Barack Obama, and her two daughters, Sasha, 19, and Malia, 22, has helped lift her spirit during tough times.\n\n\"You kinda have to sit in it for a minute, to know, 'oh oh, I'm feeling off,'\" she advised. \"I gotta feed myself with something better. And sometimes for me that means turning it off. It means turning off the phone, not taking in the news, because it is negative energy. I learned that in the days of the White House.\"\n\nWright said Obama's approach is worth replicating.\n\n\"We can follow the advice of Obama and engage in the good self-care skills she mentioned she's doing,\" Wright said. \"And it's important to remember, humans are resilient. We have overcome adversity in the past - even if there were times we doubted ourselves - and have often grown stronger for it.\"",

Kay Ivey's statewide order to wear face coverings in public places to combat the spread of the coronavirus. Montgomery Circuit Judge Greg Griffin entered the order following a hearing. Real estate agent Debbie Mathis and retired sheriff's Deputies Larry Lewis and Barry Munza, all of Jackson County, filed the lawsuit against Ivey, State Health Officer Scott Harris and the State Board of Health. The lawsuit contends that the mask order was illegally adopted and that the plaintiffs face deprivation of liberty anytime they interact with others. On July 15, Ivey announced a requirement for face coverings to be worn by anyone older than age 6 who's in public and within 6 feet of someone who's not a relative. The rule makes exceptions for people who have certain medical conditions, are exercising or are performing certain types of jobs.\n\nJuneau: A crew member on a state ferry tested positive for the coronavirus, which caused a cancellation of the service in Southeast Alaska. The Alaska Marine Highway System said the planned run of the ferry M/V LeConte in Lynn Canal near Juneau was canceled Sunday after the diagnosis was obtained. The highway system, which is part of the state Department of Transportation, said the crew member recently returned home after a two-week rotation on the LeConte. It was not immediately clear when the crew member was tested. Ferries spokesman Sam Dapcevich said state transportation officials were notified Saturday that a ferry worker had the coronavirus. No close contacts with the infected crew member were identified in Juneau or on the ferry, and no specific testing or quarantine recommendations were made for crew or passengers, the marine highway service said.\n\nYuma: A massive testing blitz is underway in Yuma County, with elected leaders and health officials aiming to administer up to 10,000 free COVID-19 tests by the end of the week. The county remains a hot spot for the new coronavirus in Arizona, with infection rates double the state average, even as the number of reported daily cases has decreased significantly. Yuma County teamed up with Yuma city officials and the Arizona Department of Emergency and Military Affairs to set up the testing blitz, which started Tuesday. The blitz goes until Saturday and will take place at the parking lot of the Yuma Civic Center, one of the larger venues in the region that is able to accommodate the massive drive-in project. \"Our numbers are going in the right direction. Now is the time to move forward even harder so we can get a strong foothold, as opposed to starting to let up because the numbers are starting to go our way,\" Yuma Mayor Doug Nicholls said.\n\nLittle Rock: The state on Tuesday reported 383 new confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus and 11 more deaths from COVID-19, the illness it causes. The Department of Health said at least 50,411 people have tested positive for the virus. Of those, 6,847 cases are now active, meaning they do not include those who have died or recovered. The Arkansas COVID-19 death toll has risen to 566, but the number of people hospitalized with the illness has decreased by one to 507. Arkansas Education Secretary Johnny Key also announced that the state will begin releasing numbers of total and active cases within a school district's population. Key said the numbers will help districts as they prepare to reopen schools later this month. Gov. Asa Hutchinson has stood by plans to reopen schools for in-person instruction, despite opposition from teachers' and pediatricians' groups.\n\nSan Diego: The state's second-largest school district has announced stricter reopening guidelines than California at large, and officials say that \"it will be a matter of months - not weeks, not days\" - before students can return to campus. San Diego Unified School District made the decision Monday after health experts from the University of California, San Diego wrote in a report this week that the district should adopt stricter measures than those being enforced by the state, The San Diego Union-Tribune reports. \"We've seen the mistakes that have been made in other places ... because they made an arbitrary decision that wasn't really based on science,\" School Board President John Lee Evans said in a virtual news conference. San Diego Unified now says schools won't reopen until there are fewer than seven community outbreaks over a weeklong period. Currently, there are 24.\n\nDenver: Democratic Gov. Jared Polis has extended an executive order requiring property owners in the state to give tenants a 30-day notice before pursuing evictions as individuals struggle to make payments during the pandemic. Previously, property owners would only give 10 days' notice. Polis announced the extension Monday, hours before it was set to expire, The Denver Post reports. It is now set to expire in a month. Many residents \"continue to experience substantial loss of income as a result of business closures and layoffs, hindering their ability to keep up with their rent payments through no fault of their own,\" Polis said. Several studies have shown hundreds of thousands of Colorado residents could be at risk of eviction as unemployment remains near-record levels. Associations representing property owners have insisted evictions won't happen on a major scale because there are strong incentives to keep tenants housed.\n\nHartford: The state's acting public health commissioner was asked Tuesday to consider significantly expanding visitation rules at nursing homes and chronic disease hospitals. In a letter sent to Dr. Deirdre Gifford, a coalition of 12 advocacy groups said guidance from the Department of Public Health issued June 22 that allowed only outdoor visits \"unduly excludes people with disabilities\" and those with mobility issues. Also, they said the order has been implemented \"restrictively,\" allowing only 20-minute maximum visits. \"Life in a nursing home is isolating. When residents are further isolated by losing contact with those they love and depend on for their social and emotional needs, the results can be fatal,\" the organizations warned. The advocates agreed that nursing homes could impose \"a reasonable COVID-19 testing requirement on visitors\" wanting to see loved ones.\n\nWilmington: The state will not regularly announce positive COVID-19 cases in schools and will instead do so on a case-by-case basis, public health officials said Tuesday. It will also not require teachers and staff to undergo testing before the school year begins. \"There may be times when there's really no need for the public to know,\" said Dr. Karyl Rattay, director of the state Division of Public Health. \"For example, if a person was positive, but no one else would have been considered exposed, that's unlikely to be made public.\" The state announced last week its intent to test all teachers and staff before the start of the school year. But the state can't force school staff to get tested. That will be up to districts, said A.J. Schall, director of the Delaware Emergency Management Agency. \"It's highly encouraged, we'll put it that way,\" Schall said. \"The districts are the ones that employ the teachers.\"\n\nWashington: Amid widespread protests and unrest over the police killings of Black Americans, a national commemoration of the 1963 civil rights March on Washington is being reconfigured to comply with coronavirus protocols in D.C. Although many marchers will arrive via charter buses from surrounding communities Aug. 28, the Rev. Al Sharpton, one of the organizers, will ask some to join satellite marches planned in states that are considered hot spots for COVID-19. \"We're following protocol,\" Sharpton told the Associated Press. All participants will be required to wear masks, Sharpton said. Organizers also will provide hand sanitizing stations and conduct temperature checks throughout the event. The revised plan appears to avoid a potentially awkward face-off with Mayor Muriel Bowser's government over COVID-19 restrictions in the nation's capital.\n\nTallahassee: Gov. Ron DeSantis is pushing for college football to be played as scheduled this fall, saying Tuesday that canceling the season as some conferences are doing because of the coronavirus will put the players at more risk outside the protective bubble provided by their teams. DeSantis made his remarks shortly after the state announced 277 more deaths, a one-day record that is likely misleading. Because of reporting lags, the state health department figures do not necessarily represent deaths in a 24-hour period. Tuesday numbers often include deaths not reported over the weekend. Dr. Cindy Prins, a University of Florida epidemiologist, said Tuesday's total is not a reflection of what happened the previous day. \"You have deaths that may be going back more than a month that are just getting reported now,\" she said, but the number does reflect the deadliness of the disease during its surge in the state in late June and July.\n\nAtlanta: A federal judge on Tuesday rejected an argument that requiring voters to provide their own stamps for mail-in ballots and ballot applications amounts to an unconstitutional poll tax. A lawsuit filed in April by the American Civil Liberties Union and its Georgia chapter alleged the postage requirement is an unjustifiable burden on the right to vote. While voters can still cast ballots in person early or on Election Day, the lawsuit argued that the option of in-person voting \"does not really exist because of the pandemic\" and is also nearly impossible for some elderly or disabled voters. Some voters don't have stamps on hand and can't get to the post office or don't want to go there and risk exposure to coronavirus, the lawsuit said. U.S. District Judge Amy Totenberg in Atlanta acknowledged the potential difficulties of in-person voting, particularly during a pandemic, but said its availability means the requirement is not tantamount to a poll tax.\n\nHonolulu: While Pacific Islanders make up just 4% of the state's population, they represent 27% of the state's newly confirmed coronavirus cases, according to state Department of Health data. White people have 20% of the newly confirmed cases and make up a quarter of the state's population. The next highest rates are people of Filipino heritage, at 18%, and Native Hawaiians, with 14% of the state's cases. No other ethnic group had double-digit figures, the Honolulu Star-Advertiser reports. Lt. Gov. Josh Green said the \"Pacific Islander community has some unique challenges, particularly while living in very large, committed, multigenerational families - a lot of them in Kalihi.\" State Health Director Bruce Anderson said the disproportionate number of cases in the Pacific Islander community is rooted in socioeconomics, and state officials must help combat those inequities.\n\nBoise: The state could finish the fiscal year with $405 million in surplus tax revenue in spite of the pandemic's economic toll, according to a new revenue forecast. The state's legislative budget office late Monday released its revised general fund revenue forecast for fiscal year 2021, which started July 1. Revenue comes in at $4.1 billion, according to the new forecast - only $6.5 million below what lawmakers used in March when setting the budget and just before Republican Gov. Brad Little issued a stay-at-home order due to surging coronavirus infections. The surplus is being boosted by a nearly $100 million cut to state agencies and another nearly $100 million cut to public schools enacted earlier this year amid possible budget shortfall concerns due to the pandemic. The cuts came amid a steep economic downturn when thousands of Idaho workers lost their jobs.\n\nWaukegan: Social distancing is becoming a problem at local beaches as large crowds flock there during the pandemic, officials said. Visitation guidelines have been changed at some Lake County beaches to accommodate visitors, some of whom are from Chicago, where beaches remain closed. Bob Feffer, who has been a site manager at Illinois Beach State Park for 32 years, said he has not seen crowds like the ones during the weekends in July. The state park had about 15,000 visitors July 25-26, the Lake County News-Sun reports. \"There were just too many people for social distancing to take place,\" Feffer said. The beach is no longer open on the weekends. David Motley, Waukegan's director of marketing and public relations, said that \"there was a lot of pent-up demand for people looking to get out and do something in the area. ... We already knew we could accommodate a large number.\"\n\nMuncie: A school district that sent 228 students home to quarantine to help prevent the spread of COVID-19 has shuttered its middle and high schools for 14 days and switched to remote learning. Delaware Community Schools announced Tuesday night that it was closing Delta High School and Middle School for the period. \"Our secondary schools seem to keep ramping up with exposure/symptom related issues that increase the number of quarantined students being excluded from school,\" Superintendent Reece Mann said in a message to the school community. Parents of elementary students \"appear to be doing an incredible job of self-screening their children and keeping them home when they are exhibiting symptoms,\" Mann said. Only seven students from the district's three elementary schools had been sent home as of Tuesday morning, compared to 68 middle school and 153 high school students.\n\nDes Moines: Nearly 600,000 masks, 109,085 face shields, 22,527 gallon-sized bottles of bleach, 63,074 bottles of hand sanitizer, 233,303 pairs of gloves and 12,398 thermometers. That's what Iowa school districts have told the state they need to help protect students, teachers and staff from the coronavirus during the first 30 days of the school year - even after they've spent federal money and large sums from their own budgets to acquire supplies. They made the requests after Gov. Kim Reynolds pledged to provide up to a 30-day supply of personal protective equipment as part of Iowa's Return to Learn plan. The Iowa Department of Homeland Security and Emergency Management will begin distributing \"as many of the requested supplies as possible\" beginning next week, Department of Education Director Ann Lebo said during a news conference with Reynolds last Thursday.\n\nTopeka: Public health officials in three counties say a new state law is hurting their efforts to trace the contacts of people infected with COVID-19 by making it easier for them to refuse to cooperate. Public health departments often rely on employers to find out who has been in close contact with those infected, but the coronavirus law that was approved in June says \"third parties,\" such as employers and event hosts, must get consent from those who tested positive and close contacts to share their information to public health agencies. \"Our disease investigators hold confidentiality to the utmost importance,\" said Adrienne Byrne, director of the Sedgwick County Health Department in Wichita. \"So I'm not sure what all went behind that bill, but it has not been good for public health because being able to do contact tracing helps us identify people that might turn positive.\" Officials in Wyandotte and Johnson counties have also raised concerns about the law.\n\nFrankfort: Kentucky's secretary of state has offered a preliminary election plan that calls for expanded early voting but excludes no-excuse absentee voting by mail for all voters amid the coronavirus. His proposal would allow Kentuckians to cast mail-in ballots if they decide their age or health condition makes it too risky to vote in-person, Secretary of State Michael Adams said. That option also would apply to people living with them or caring for them, he said. \"But I don't think that we can do universal absentee (voting) because I think the system will crash,\" Adams said. Adams' proposals on how to conduct the general election amid the global pandemic were submitted this week to Gov. Andy Beshear, who has said he supports no-excuse absentee voting for November. The state's June primary, which included widespread absentee voting by mail, resulted in the highest turnout for a Bluegrass State primary since 2008 and won praise.\n\nBaton Rouge: The state's education department has set up an email for parents, teachers and others to report violations of coronavirus safety standards for schools, Superintendent of Education Cade Brumley told the state's top school board Tuesday. The Board of Elementary and Secondary Education in mid-July adopted statewide rules for schools holding in-person instruction amid the virus outbreak, such as a mask mandate for school staff and students in grades three through 12; distancing standards; temperature checks to enter school premises; and school bus capacity limits. Brumley told the education board that anyone worried a school isn't following the rules can email ldoecovid19support@la.gov. The person will receive a survey to fill out, and the information is sent to the school system's leaders to respond. \"We have received a few concerns already,\" Brumley said. Complaints reported to the department are posted online.\n\nPortland: Dozens of cities, towns and tribal governments around the state will receive $4 million in grants to improve their response to the coronavirus pandemic, the administration of Gov. Janet Mills said Tuesday. The grants are designed to help fund projects that support public education campaigns, physical distancing projects and local businesses. Maine Department of Health and Human Services Commissioner Jeanne Lambrew said the money has supported \"innovative responses on the front lines of this pandemic.\" One of the proposed projects is a campaign featuring a \"Masked Moose\" character in the town of Bethel. The campaign would include a costumed character who will visit schools and businesses to demonstrate the importance of coronavirus prevention. The round of grants is the second of its kind. The state announced nearly $9 million in grants to almost 100 municipalities in June.\n\nAnnapolis: A municipal government in China has donated 40,000 medical-grade face masks to Maryland's capital city amid the coronavirus pandemic. The donations from Changsha, China, were first offered to Annapolis officials in April, when the need for the masks among public safety workers was high in the beginning days of the pandemic, Annapolis City Manager David Jarrell said in a news release Tuesday. They arrived this month, with one of the boxes featuring stickers of American and Chinese flags with a message that read: \"Go, City of Annapolis! Best Wishes from Changsha! True unity inspires people to work as one to overcome adversity,\" The Capital Gazette reports. Annapolis' relationship with Changsha began under a former city administrator, according to the release. The two municipalities are now sister cities.\n\nBoston: State officials on Tuesday urged residents in nearly three dozen communities with concerning rates of COVID-19 infection to step up their efforts to slow the spread of the disease. Republican Gov. Charlie Baker said 33 communities across the state are seeing more than four COVID-19 cases per 100,000. The four hardest-hit communities are Chelsea, Everett, Lynn and Revere, said Health and Human Services Secretary Marylou Sudders. Baker said his administration is reaching out to local leaders in moderate- and high-risk communities to offer state support in combating the virus. State officials are encouraging residents in those communities to be sure to wear masks, keep their distance from others and avoid large gatherings. \"We're asking everyone to recognize that this virus continue to infect, injure and kill people every single day,\" Baker said.\n\nDetroit: The pandemic has temporarily shut down the Red Children's Art Museum in the city's North End, so founder Yvette Rock is bringing art to Detroiters through a mobile art gallery. Most recently, Rock has been coaxing people out of their pandemic shells to enjoy children's art through socially distanced exhibitions that are part of Live Coal Arts Mobile, a mobile gallery in an 18-foot trailer. Most recently, the gallery has featured art made of popsicle sticks and other recycled objects, as well as an exhibition where a young Detroiter can have their drawing built out of Lego blocks. Rock, 44 of Detroit, won't let the pandemic or any other challenges distract her from her mission: to transform lives through art, education and community. Before there was the Live Coal Arts Mobile and RED, there was the Live Coal Gallery, created by Rock in 2012 in Detroit's Woodbridge neighborhood with a goal of being inclusive.\n\nMankato: The Legislature was called into session Wednesday, but lawmakers don't expect much to happen. Some legislators expected this month's special session to last a day or less. Gov. Tim Walz called the session to extend Minnesota's peacetime emergency order by another 30 days. The Legislature likely won't address any financial bills this week as the state plans to sell $1.2 billion in bonds this month. The bond sale requires the state to have a steady financial outlook for a set period of time, state officials say. \"The logic is, it would be like taking out a big car loan three days before you take out a mortgage,\" said Sen. Nick Frentz, DFL-North Mankato. \"The people you're taking out your mortgage from wouldn't look kindly on a big loan.\" As a result, DFLers and Republicans likely won't consider a supplemental budget bill, a tax bill or a public works bill until late September at the earliest.\n\nJackson: Gov. Tate Reeves described college football - even amid the coronavirus pandemic - as \"essential\" Tuesday, his comments echoing a tweet President Donald Trump posted the day before. \"What do opponents of football think, these kids will end up in a bubble without it? You can get COVID anywhere,\" Reeves tweeted Tuesday afternoon. \"There are forces who want to cancel everything to avoid risk at all societal costs. It's foolish. We have to balance risk & costs.\" He said many players have been practicing for months over the summer and have built careers on football. Some have college scholarships riding on athletics. There is a way to let teams play while managing crowds, he said. \"There is risk in all of life. There are things we can do to manage it without destroying society,\" he said. \"Limit crowds and let 'em play!\" Conferences are not canceling football because of safety, he asserted, but out of fear of lawsuits and \"bad press.\"\n\nSpringfield: Drury University announced Tuesday that neck gaiters will no longer be considered acceptable face coverings on its campus. The university said in a tweet that it made the decision in consultation with the Springfield-Greene County Health Department. The announcement comes after a study released by Duke University analyzed more than a dozen different facial coverings ranging from hospital-grade N95 respirators to bandannas. Of the 14 masks and other coverings tested, the study found that popular alternatives such as neck gaiters, made of thin material, may be worse than not wearing a mask at all. The Washington Post brought the Duke study to attention through an article it posted Tuesday. The study used cameras and lasers to see the number of water droplets that come through each mask and found that a breathable neck gaiter ranked worse than the no-mask control group.\n\nHelena: The state is allocating $50 million to increase the availability of child care in response to COVID-19, Gov. Steve Bullock said Tuesday. The funding was allocated from the state's $1.25 billion in federal coronavirus relief money. The majority of the funding, $30 million, will be distributed in grants to providers who care for school-age children out of school time, officials said. An additional $10 million will be distributed to families with health needs and special needs requiring in-home care. Another $8 million will be divided among all licensed and registered child care facilities in the state to maintain and expand child care slots, cover increased staff costs, cover recruitment, address health and safety, and meet sanitation needs. The health department's Child Care Resource and Referral Agency will receive $2 million for administration and outreach.\n\nOmaha: The City Council on Tuesday approved an emergency mask mandate in indoor public places to prevent the coronavirus from spreading. The measure passed 7-0 after four hours of testimony from a divided public. The proposal had received support from many of the city's biggest companies, including Union Pacific, TD Ameritrade, Mutual of Omaha and First National Bank. The proposed ordinance would require masks in places such as schools, businesses and churches. Eating and drinking in restaurants and bars, exercising in gyms, and visiting government offices would be excluded. Douglas County, which includes Omaha, has confirmed 11,449 coronavirus cases and 138 deaths since the pandemic began, according to the county's tracking portal. The number of new daily cases has trended down over the past week. The number of cases in Lincoln has trended downward since the city began requiring masks July 20.\n\nReno: Dozens of teachers and parents gathered outside a high school Tuesday to argue against the Washoe County School District's decision to reopen schools during the coronavirus pandemic. The demonstration was held outside Spanish Springs High School in Sparks, north of Reno, where the district met in person a few days before students are expected to return Monday. The demonstration came after the district released a new reopening plan to help families prepare. But many teachers and parents have raised concerns about the safety of the plan and how to implement it. \"Too many of the answers that we're getting from the district are we don't know yet, we don't know yet, and that's not acceptable,\" said Robert Munson, a Washoe County teacher. The district meeting started at 4 p.m. and ended after 1 a.m. Wednesday. Most of the speakers were teachers who said they were frustrated with the decision.\n\nConcord: Gov. Chris Sununu issued an executive order Tuesday requiring masks to be worn at scheduled gatherings of more than 100 people. Sununu, a Republican, has resisted calls to mandate the use of face coverings to prevent the spread of the new coronavirus, and the new requirement falls far short of the mandates in the other five New England states, which generally require masks to be worn in public when social distancing isn't possible. The order will be put to the test Aug. 22-30 at the annual Laconia Motorcycle Week, which typically attracts thousands of people to the state. It's a smaller version of the 80th Sturgis Motorcycle Rally, a 10-day event that began Friday in South Dakota. The mandate won't apply to large workplaces or to schools, unless students gather for an assembly or other large event, Sununu said.\n\nTrenton: Gov. Phil Murphy said Wednesday that schools that cannot meet health and safety guidelines for an in-person start to the academic year can go with an all-remote option. The first-term Democratic governor said he will also soon sign an executive order that paves the way for the state's roughly 600 schools to begin in-person instruction in September. The ability for some schools to start entirely remotely is a change from the governor's June guidance, which required all schools to have in-person instruction. Then, in July, Murphy approved an option for parents to request all-remote learning for their children. Murphy said the change stemmed from \"our willingness to listen\" to stakeholders. The disruption stems from the COVID-19 outbreak, which led to three months of remote learning in the previous academic year. The health and safety guidelines include maintaining social distance and mask-wearing for staff and students.\n\nSanta Fe: The school year is getting underway at some of the state's largest public school districts as teachers, students and parents deal with remote learning amid the coronavirus pandemic. Albuquerque Public Schools started Wednesday. Schools in the district have been distributing technology to students, making virtual home visits, and providing guidance to staff, students and families. The Las Cruces district has outlined protocols for instruction, technology and nutrition services for that district's all-online start. \"We have prepared, and we are ready,\" Las Cruces Superintendent Karen Trujillo said in a statement. She said educators participated in more than 350 professional development webinars to prepare for the start of virtual classes, and laptops and tablets were ordered at the beginning of the summer with the aim of every student having access to a device. Some students are still waiting, though, due to shipping delays.\n\nAlbany: Evictions are still on hold in the state's courts as housing advocates worry about the fate of an estimated 14,000 renters who faced eviction before the declaration of a COVID-19 emergency. Courts spokeswoman Lucian Chalfen said Friday that the state's stay of evictions is still in effect through a March 16 order signed by the state's chief administrative judge. The announcement comes as housing advocates including the Legal Aid Society hope New York courts will heed Gov. Andrew Cuomo's call for \"no evictions\" amid the pandemic. Last week Cuomo said a new state law makes clear that no evictions are allowed while New York is in a pandemic. \"I signed the law, and the law is clear,\" Cuomo said. \"Until when? Until I say COVID is over. And you know, we'll figure out when that is.\" Still, an attorney for the Legal Aid Society said the law alone doesn't offer enough certainty to tenants.\n\nRaleigh: Gov. Roy Cooper won another legal victory defending his COVID-19 executive orders Tuesday, this time when a judge rejected Lt. Gov. Dan Forest's demand that they be blocked by declaring his lawsuit is unlikely to succeed. The Republican lieutenant governor sued Cooper last month, alleging the Democrat's orders limiting business activities and mass gatherings and mandating face coverings were unlawful because he failed to first get support from the Council of State. The 10-member council includes both of them, Attorney General Josh Stein and other statewide elected officials. Cooper's state attorneys argued in a virtual hearing last week that the governor acted properly under portions of the Emergency Management Act that don't require the concurrence of the council. They said the law lets him act unilaterally when he determines local governments are unable to respond effectively in the emergency.\n\nMinot: North Dakota Superintendent Kirsten Baesler said Wednesday that a new partnership with Minot State University will help ease the state's shortage of special education teachers. Minot State will receive a $750,000 grant to pay for scholarships for 20 paraprofessionals who work with special education students, Baesler said. The grant money will help the paraprofessionals earn bachelor of science degrees with a major in special education. The $750,000 comes from federal coronavirus relief aid approved by Congress in March, which included emergency assistance to schools. Minot State special education department chairwoman Holly Pedersen said the university is excited to have an opportunity to partner with the state and find solutions to address the special education teacher shortage that's happening nationwide.\n\nColumbus: Nearly 600,000 Ohio schoolchildren in 325 districts will return to school this fall for in-person classes, according to figures released by Gov. Mike DeWine. Almost 400,000 students in 55 districts will be attending online, while about 380,000 students in 154 districts will be doing some combination of in-person and online classes, the governor said. The state didn't have information for 78 additional districts. DeWine said he believes schools are doing a good job of getting ready for all options. But children's well-being as they return to classes, as well as their ability to do activities ranging from sports to band to theater, will be influenced by community efforts to reduce the spread of the coronavirus, the governor emphasized in Tuesday remarks. That includes continued mask-wearing, social distancing and avoiding mass gatherings.\n\nTulsa: The Tulsa State Fair has been canceled this year amid concerns about the coronavirus, joining the previous cancellation of the Oklahoma State Fair in Oklahoma City. The Tulsa County Public Facilities Authority voted 5-0 to cancel the fair scheduled for Oct. 1-11 but said the Junior Livestock Show will continue. \"I know for us it is a huge hit in the loss of money, but for me the greater concern has to be the health of our community and those who come here and then go home,\" Tulsa County Commissioner and TCPFA Chair Karen Keith said during Tuesday's meeting. Oklahoma State Fair officials announced in June the cancellation the Oklahoma City event scheduled for late September. The Oklahoma State Health Department on Wednesday reported 45,398 confirmed cases of the coronavirus and 627 deaths due to COVID-19, an increase of 670 cases and nine more deaths than reported Tuesday.\n\nPortland: The state's tallest waterfall, one of its most popular attractions, has reopened to the public with new guidelines in place amid the coronavirus pandemic. Multnomah Falls opened in the Columbia River Gorge on Tuesday, the U.S. Forest Service announced. New social distancing and face mask mandates were also announced, in addition to other strategies to keep crowds down and visitors separated from one another, The Oregonian/OregonLive reports. There will be two phases to the reopening, the forest service said. The first, effective now, is first-come, first served and allows up to 300 visitors at a time between 9 a.m. and 6 p.m. to check in and wait in a socially distanced queue to the viewing platform at the bottom of the waterfall. The second phase, expected to be implemented in the next few weeks, will involve an online ticketing system allowing 300 people to visit the waterfall each hour.\n\nHarrisburg: Mayors are challenging the state's members of Congress to help them get direct budget aid from the federal government, warning that cities of all sizes face steep deficits and deep service cuts as a result of the coronavirus' impact on the economy. With Washington in a stalemate over a new round of funding, mayors warned of severe consequences on services and the economy without an injection of federal aid to cover slackening tax collections. They also pointed out that they received little in trickle-down from a prior round of aid to cover coronavirus costs that went to states and the most heavily populated counties. Pennsylvania's 20-member congressional delegation is evenly split between Republicans and Democrats, with nearly every Republican balking at another round of federal aid.\n\nProvidence: The state will delay the reopening of public schools by two weeks, to Sept. 14, to give educators more time to prepare to welcome returning students during the coronavirus pandemic. Gov. Gina Raimondo announced her decision to give schools extra time Wednesday, saying that while she is eager for schools to resume in-person classes, it must be done responsibly. \"It gives schools a little more time to be ready,\" said Raimondo, a Democrat. \"So you can have confidence that when we reopen school we'll be in good shape. We owe it to the children.\" Under Raimondo's plan, local schools will be allowed to resume full-time in-person instruction only if they meet certain safety benchmarks. A final decision is expected the week of Aug. 31. Raimondo said local districts must put in place detailed plans dealing with details such as student transportation, in-school traffic flow, class size and mask use.\n\nColumbia: Most school districts in the state will not open their doors to students all five days a week when they start the new academic year during the COVID-19 pandemic, even though the governor demanded all schools offer a five-day per week in-person option. The state Education Department approved the last of the reopening plans for all 81 districts in the state Monday. Just 1 out of every 5 school districts will open its doors to students five days a week, and four plans start without any in-person option for classes, although those districts promised to bring in students whose parents want them to be in a school building as soon as it is safe. On July 15, Gov. Henry McMaster said he wanted to see all schools offer a five-day per week in-person option, saying that \"we must have our schools available\" and that \"parents must have a choice.\" Many school boards resisted.\n\nSioux Falls: A local company that is developing a COVID-19 therapeutic announced Tuesday that it has embarked on human trials. SAB Biotherapeutics said 28 healthy volunteers were participating in the company's phase-one trial of its antibody treatment known as SAB-185. The phase-one study will evaluate the safety of treating patients with the therapeutic, which is a human antibody that can be produced at large scale using genetically modified cattle. The 28 healthy volunteers will be given single and multiple ascending doses of SAB-185 to demonstrate its safety. A second part of the phase-one study to evaluate the safety and pharmacological activity in SAB-185 in COVID-19 patients is slated to begin later this month. Besides treating ill patients, SAB-185 is being developed for use by first responders and others as a protective treatment.\n\nNashville: Legislation designed to provide sweeping liability protections against coronavirus lawsuits to schools, health care providers and businesses advanced Tuesday. The Republican-dominated Statehouse is convening for a special legislative session to address not only COVID-19 liability but also telemedicine coverage and penalties against protesters. Gov. Bill Lee announced last week that he was convening a special legislative session to address a handful of bills lawmakers failed to advance earlier this year before adjourning in mid-June. Back then, the main dividing line over the liability bill was whether to make its protections retroactive to early March, which the Senate supported and the House opposed. The telemedicine bill was spiked as a response to the failure to pass the liability bill.\n\nAustin: The state surpassed 500,000 confirmed coronavirus cases Tuesday as Republican Gov. Greg Abbott suggested family and neighborhood gatherings are behind a sharp rise in the rate of positive tests, which has climbed to record levels just as schools are beginning to reopen across the state. He also continued to say more testing in Texas is likely after dropping off in recent weeks, a trend seen across the U.S. even as deaths mount. Texas has reported more than 1,400 new deaths over the past week, including 220 on Tuesday. Although health officials say there are encouraging signs in Texas - particularly hospitalization levels that have dropped more than 30% since July's peak - infection rates have been on a steady increase. On Tuesday, the rolling average of positive cases over the past seven days jumped to 24%, by far the highest of the pandemic, according to figures from the state Department of Health Services.\n\nSt. George: For the first time in more than 43 years, the St. George Marathon is off. The city announced in a statement Tuesday that this year's marathon, scheduled to take place Oct. 3, will be canceled \"due to concerns related to the potential spread of COVID-19 and the challenge of providing adequate health and safety protections for race participants and volunteers.\" One of the largest marathons in the country, the annual St. George Marathon traditionally sees about 7,000 runners take part. Meanwhile, organizers have officially canceled the 2020 St. George IRONMAN Triathlon, also citing concerns about the pandemic. One of St. George's biggest draws, the annual event typically draws athletes from around the world, bringing an average of $7 million in economic impact to Southern Utah. Initially scheduled for May 2, the event had earlier been postponed until September.\n\nMontpelier: With the start of school less than a month away, state officials on Tuesday announced some revisions to the school restart guidance, and Republican Gov. Phil Scott reiterated how important he thinks reopening schools is. Scott said he worries about the children of parents who don't have time to teach their kids and struggle to pay for child care and the negative effect not reopening schools would have on them and children of more vulnerable families. \"I truly believe that if we don't provide a way to get those kids back into school, we'll see the ramifications for years to come,\" said Scott, who acknowledged the anxiety of some parents and teachers. The state will likely see some cases and clusters connected to schools, even though it has the lowest number of coronavirus cases in the country, he said. But the state has worked hard to build up its testing and tracing capacity, Scott and State Epidemiologist Patsy Kelso said.\n\nVirginia Beach: Renovations have been delayed at the municipal building where a mass shooting happened last year. The Virginian-Pilot reports city officials don't have enough money to pay for it now because of the coronavirus pandemic. In a letter last week, the mayor of Virginia Beach asked the Legislature to consider allocating $10 million toward the renovations. Employees who worked in the building where 12 people were killed have been working at home and in offices across the city. The city plans to turn Building 2 into the headquarters for the police department. Plans also call for renovating several other buildings to bring former Building 2 employees back to the municipal center so that the Departments of Public Works, Public Utilities and Planning can again offer citizens services in one place.\n\nSeattle: State residents applied for relief funds as the coronavirus pandemic diminished their incomes and savings. But for undocumented workers, that wasn't an option. After months of pressure from immigration activists and organizations, Gov. Jay Inslee is launching a $40 million state fund for undocumented workers, the Northwest News Network reports. \"We're excited to have a good chunk of money allocated to our community,\" said Alejandra Perez, an immigration activist from the Seattle area who's been working with the governor's staff, Initially, the fund was a grassroots effort among several organizations to raise $100,000, but it raised $5 million over the past several months. Washington has an estimated 240,000 residents without legal authorization, according to the Pew Research Center, and they pay an estimated $368 million in state and local taxes.\n\nCharleston: The number of reported deaths from the new coronavirus in the state has jumped 23% in the past week, with six more fatalities announced Wednesday, pushing the total to at least 153. The state of 1.8 million residents has seen a smaller amount of cases and deaths compared to other places since the pandemic began. Lately, though, the numbers have been alarming. Confirmed cases have tripled in the past seven weeks, surpassing the 8,000 mark total Wednesday, while the numbers of deaths have shot up 66%. Officials have blamed the recent surge in part on vacation trips to Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, a popular destination for West Virginians. Gov. Jim Justice has constantly urged residents to wear masks but has resisted reimposing additional restrictions.\n\nMadison: University of Wisconsin-Madison Chancellor Rebecca Blank delivered a sobering message Wednesday about the state's flagship campus as the fall semester looms, saying that \"we're in a real financial crisis\" due to the coronavirus pandemic. How bad the crisis will be depends on several factors, Blank said in an online presentation at the Rotary Club of Madison. Those include whether students who are enrolled for the fall semester actually show up, how deep state budget cuts are and whether the Legislature gives the university the authority to borrow money. Blank projected the loss to UW-Madison to be about $150 million with a full student body this fall. The loss will be greater if fewer students return who have committed and if state budget cuts worsen, she said. For now, the university is on track to have its target of about 7,400 freshmen on campus, she said.\n\nCasper: Wyoming is no longer the only state without its own suicide prevention call center. The Central Wyoming Counseling Center launched the state's first and only service Tuesday, the Casper Star-Tribune reports. Wyoming has one of the highest suicide rates in the U.S. Residents previously were able to call national hotlines, but those answering don't have important knowledge about the state, counseling center CEO Kevin Hazucha said. Hazucha and Bernice Hazucha came to Wyoming from New York in 2018 and spent a year meeting with various officials on starting a suicide call line. Wyoming eventually issued a request for proposals, and the Central Wyoming Counseling Center responded. Wyoming has allocated $400,000 for the hotline for two years. The suicide hotline will be staffed 40 hours a week, but organizers hope to expand that to 24 hours a day, seven days a week.",

    "NBA bubble: What are next steps for eliminated teams leaving campus?": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "LAKE BUENA VISTA, Fla. -- As they gathered in the locker room, Sacramento Kings head coach Luke Walton had an important message to share with his players.\n\nThough they finished with a 136-122 win over the Los Angeles Lakers on Thursday, the Kings' season officially ended. But this did not mark the time for self reflection. Nor did it mark the time to share any insight on how to improve next season.\n\nInstead, Walton talked to his players about leaving the NBA Disney campus in the middle of the coronavirus outbreak.\n\n\"We have to be very smart about how we act when we get out of here,'\" Walton recalled telling his players. \"The coronavirus is still active obviously and its spreading everywhere. So we've been safe here. Now when we get home, we have a lot of responsibilities.\"\n\nThe NBA outlined a number of daily responsibilities for all 22 of the participating teams at the ESPN Wide World of Sports Complex. Every player, coach and staff member had to receive tests for COVID-19. They had to report any symptoms, their temperature and oxygen levels. They were required to wear masks in public spaces and had to follow social distancing rules. That explained why the NBA and its players union reported zero positives tests the past four weeks.\n\nOutside of the campus, the league cannot exactly enforce and monitor player, coach and staff behavior. That group will also no longer undergo mandatory testing for COVID-19.\n\nTo that end, Kings guard Buddy Hield has outlined a simple itinerary once he exits the bubble: \"stay my ass home.\"\n\nBefore teams flew to Orlando between July 7-9, the NBA said that 25 of 351 players and 10 of 884 staff members tested positive for COVID-19 between June 23-29 when testing began every other day at team practice facilities. Two out of 322 players tested positive during quarantine when the teams first arrived in Orlando. The NBA anticipated some cases since players, coaches and staff members were not subject to strict measures on a quarantine site ahead of arrival.\n\n\"When it was first announced, all of us were in the situation of saying, 'What? This is actually going to work?! There are too many moving parts. This is difficult,' \" Spurs coach Gregg Popovich said. \"But after you realize the work that the NBA put into this, it's incredible with the logistics, the safety measures, the discipline and everything required of us.\"\n\nBecause of safety concerns, the Kings, Washington Wizards, New Orleans Pelicans and San Antonio Spurs had to leave the NBA Disney campus as close to the end of their games as possible. Players were allowed to shower and change at the Coronado Springs, but they had to check out of their rooms and teams had all luggage packed at the arena.\n\nThat explains why Popovich likened this process to \"going to bootcamp with a smile.\"\n\nNBA playoff schedule released: Dates, times and TV information for all first-round games\n\nMore: LeBron James, Los Angeles Dodgers join forces to make Dodger Stadium a general election polling place\n\n\"They did a fantastic job,\" Popovich said. \"Everybody is humbled enough to hope this continues, of course. Nobody takes it for granted. But the players also should get kudos for the discipline they've showed so far. It's been remarkable in every way, shape or form.\"\n\nThe NBA will not have as much supervision after that, though.\n\n\"It's tricky times right now being away from family. Getting back to that setting is going to be another adjustment you have to get used to,\" Spurs forward DeMar DeRozan said. \"But just take care of yourself and wear a mask. Stick to the same protocols before we came to the bubble and be safe as possible.\"\n\nThat will require a lot of diligence.\n\nThe NBA Finals are scheduled to end as late as Oct. 13. Though the league has tentatively scheduled Dec. 1 as the beginning of the 2020-21 season, the NBA players union has squawked at that proposal because of the minimal time for rest and recovery for all participating teams. Both NBA Commissioner Adam Silver and NBPA executive director Michele Roberts have considered resuming next season in another campus site at either one or multiple locations.\n\n\"I'm just getting right back to it, staying ready and staying prepared,\" said DeRozan, who estimated only needing three or four days off to recharge. \"I have the utmost faith the league can put whatever needs to be put together for us to have a season next year.\"\n\nRegardless, the eliminated teams will have a long offseason. The NBA draft lottery will take place virtually on Aug. 20 to determine the draft order. Then teams will host video-conference workouts and interviews for potential prospects leading into a virtual draft on Oct. 16.\n\nAs for the current players, though, do not expect them to report to any practice facility anytime soon.\n\n\"We're definitely giving time off. Everybody needs time off: players, coaches, staff,\" Washington Wizards coach Scott Brooks said. \"We have all of our families to be able to be with them and be around them. It's definitely going to be 2-3 weeks minimum. If you need more, we'll give you more. It's not about jumping right back in it.\"\n\nStill, the NBA will allow those teams to have their facilities open for voluntary workouts.\n\nThat setup has stayed the same for the teams that did not participate in the resumed season: The Atlanta Hawks, Charlotte Hornets, Chicago Bulls, Cleveland Cavaliers, Detroit Pistons, Golden State Warriors, Minnesota Timberwolves and New York Knicks. All of those teams had to maintain social distancing, mask-wearing and sanitary rules, and head coaches were not allowed to view any of the workouts.\n\n\"We don't know when we're playing again,\" Walton said. \"We have to make sure we take care of ourselves and stay safe and healthy.\"",

        "authors": [],
        "body": "LAKE BUENA VISTA, Fla. -- As the NBA brainstormed how it would resume its suspended season in the middle of the coronavirus pandemic, the league, its 30 owners and the players union all maintained it would have to follow one uncompromising rule.\n\nAll participating players, coaches and staff members would have to get tested daily for COVID-19 before and after entering the NBA's quarantined campus at ESPN's Wide World of Sports Complex. All parties also determined they would follow these protocols, while remaining sensitive to how it would affect the outside world.\n\n\"We're not taking away from existing testing,\" said Kathy Behrens, the NBA's president of social responsibility and player programs. \"We know testing needs to happen. Our focus is on what we can do to contribute so that testing is available.\"\n\nTherefore, the NBA launched a community testing program that it says will provide thousands of COVID-19 PCR tests for free both in Orlando and in the league's 29 other team markets through August.\n\nBioReference Laboratories, which administers the tests at the NBA's Disney campus site, has partnered with the league to provide free, daily COVID-19 PCR tests at Orlando Vineland Premium Outlets (schedule an appointment here). The NBA worked with the Orlando Magic and the Orlando Sports & Entertainment District to oversee a pop-up testing event that provided hundreds of free drive-through and walk-up tests July 11 at the Geico Garage at the Amway Center. And the NBA partnered with UnidosUS and the National Urban League to secure more testing sites in the 30 team markets as well as ensure those sites help the underserved Latino and Black communities.\n\nBehrens said the NBA has not yet calculated how much the league and its partners have paid for these programs. All participants already sense, however, the programs' impact.\n\n\"My outlook is that this is a bridge to a vaccine,\" said Marc Morial, the president and CEO of the National Urban League. \"If people know they have the virus, they can self-quarantine and they can get treated.\"\n\nInitially, the NBA received criticism that some of its teams were tested once Utah Jazz center Rudy Gobert tested positive for COVID-19 in mid-March shortly before the team's game in Oklahoma City. The concerns stemmed from whether those tests came at the expense of the general public, or simply reflected the league using its financial resources to leverage access on the private market.\n\nAs USA TODAY Sports reported, however, an Oklahoma State Department of Health official said that 58 people from the Jazz or with connections to the Jazz were tested because it was a \"public health decision.\" Public health officials also advised the Toronto Raptors to receive tests since they had recently played the Jazz. The Brooklyn Nets later paid for tests on the private market, while other teams determined not to receive any tests unless a person had symptoms. The NBA only began testing league-wide June 23, about two weeks before teams would fly to Orlando for the season restart.\n\n\"There are ways to ensure that you're not taking away from the testing that needs to be available,\" Behrens said. \"If we can contribute in making sure additional testing is available at new capacities to essential Florida with these mobile testing sites, that is an important part of our restart.\n\n\"We're not just taking care of our own NBA community. But we're making sure we contribute toward taking care of the greater community because the need is so great.\"\n\nThe NBA has centralized its focus on additional pop-up testing sites in Orlando and the Orange County areas considering Florida has become one of the emerging COVID-19 hotspots.\n\nThe league has worked with The Fight Is In Us, a nationwide coalition of health officials that encourages COVID-19 survivors to donate their plasma for virus research and treatments. And the NBA has partnered with the Yale School of Public Health and the Mayo Clinic on a study that partly involves players, coaches and staff members voluntarily participating in a non-invasive saliva test for the coronavirus that could both shorten test turnaround times and reduce costs for current tests.\n\nBehrens said it is too early to report any takeaways from these initiatives. But she said the league will continue to work on \"providing the testing and contribute where we can to the ongoing research to understanding what's going on with this virus.\"\n\nRita Carreon, the deputy vice president of health at UnidosUS, says the NBA is part of their ongoing work to achieve more equality in testing.\n\n\"The NBA is one organization that is part of this effort, but you obviously rely on your national and state legislators to (be) able to support more access to testing regardless of where you come from, the language you speak and the area in which you live in,\" Carreon said.\n\n\"This virus and pandemic has exposed a lot of inequities, a lot of structural racism and barriers that existed with the lack of investments in our public health. A lot of this is going to take a long time for us to recover.\"",

Then, out of the corner of his eyes, VanVleet saw attentive fans on the sideline calling out his name.\n\nVanVleet's children wanted to greet him before tipoff.\n\n\"I miss my family,\" VanVleet said earlier this week. \"Family is huge for me. It's been a while.\"\n\nYes, it has.\n\nBefore Monday, VanVleet had not seen girlfriend Shontai Neal, his 2-year-old daughter Sanna and his 1-year-old son Fred. Jr. since Father's Day (June 20). Two days later, the Raptors traveled to Fort Myers, Florida, for practice before arriving in the NBA campus here in early July. Since then, VanVleet has stayed on the quarantined campus where his days have mostly consisted of basketball and nothing else.\n\nThe beginning of the second round of the playoffs have coincided with the league allowing players' families to stay here on the Disney campus, as the eight teams that remain have already been gone 1\u00bd months with three more rounds still to complete.\n\nTherefore, the greeting with VanVleet and his children, which VanVleet's girlfriend documented, carried more significance..\n\nThe video went viral and sparked smiles around the NBA.\n\n\"That is absolutely priceless. I had goosebumps watching it,\" Miami Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said about the VanVleet's reunion. \"I just think it's really cool. Everybody's sacrificed a lot.\"\n\nWhen NBA teams arrived here between July 7-9, the league determined that no family or friends could visit amid concerns about the coronavirus pandemic. The NBA allowed for family to visit this week since fewer teams are now staying on campus following the completion of the seed-in games and first round.\n\nAccording to the NBA's health and safety protocols, teams that advance past the first round of the playoffs can reserve guest rooms that match the team's roster size. Although it does not specify an exact number of guests allowed, the protocols state the number is \"subject to Disney's room occupancy rules and guidelines.\" A player can determine anyone a guest so long as that person is not a certified agent. Most of the players' guests are either wives, girlfriends and their children. Players can invite only one guest to a game, but they are allowed to bring small children.\n\n\"It'll just be good to be around some people that care about you, that you care about outside of your teammates,\" Los Angeles Clippers guard Lou Williams said. \"This environment can be a little mundane at times, so it's nice to have some fresh energy.\"\n\nStill, some have opted out of having their family visit for various reasons.\n\nAll guests either have to quarantine for at least three days before arriving on campus or quarantine at a house or hotel either in the player's team market or in Orlando. If guests choose to quarantine in a team market, the respective team has to oversee COVID-19 testing every other day, as well as daily meals, temperature and symptom checks. If guests choose to quarantine in Orlando, they have to pay the initial costs.\n\nAfter that process, all guests have to quarantine on campus for an additional seven days and have to receive seven consecutive negative tests before leaving their room.\n\nClippers center JaMychal Green plans to have his girlfriend and children visit should the team advance to the Western Conference finals. Yet, he still harbored concerns about his kids becoming stir-crazy on campus. People can swim, exercise, golf and fish on campus, but there are no options beyond those activities. Everyone also has to observe social distancing and mask-wearing rules.\n\n\"I didn't want them to come here and get bored,\" Green said. \"My kids like to play and like to go outside. So there's really not much here to do.\"\n\nUsually, pets do not need to feel as entertained. They are used to quarantined life even in normal times. Unfortunately, they do not meet the criteria for guests.\n\n\"I would love to have my dogs in here, but they are not allowing pets,\" said Los Angeles Lakers guard Danny Green, whose fianc\u00e9e will visit. \"But I think pets would definitely lighten the mood. That would help if anybody who has any type of say-so to get some dogs in here.\"\n\nFirst things first. Coaches and staff members wish they could invite their family, too. But the NBA prioritized limiting the number of people on campus for safety reasons. The NBA accommodated the players' wishes partly because it remained mindful that on-court performance often correlates to a person's well-being.\n\n\"It doesn't make it easier, but you can't let everybody in,\" Spoelstra said. \"There's some element of this that this is working and you want a somewhat controlled environment. So we get it. But if that can change at any point, it has my vote.\"\n\nPlayers, coaches and staff members have navigated their loss of family time in different ways. Some have carved out designated times to connect on the phone and through Facetime at either the beginning or end of their day.\n\n\"You see a lot of smiles on the players' faces when they come back to the hotel now,\" JaMychal Green said. \"Kids tend to do that to you.\"",

    "NFL COVID-19 tests give league reality check of 'false positives'": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "Just as the NFL sailed with a relatively smooth summer on the COVID-19 front that suggested it might be fully equipped to pull off its plan for a complete season amid a pandemic, along came Sunday.\n\nNews streamed in with the urgency of results from the precincts reporting on Election Night: The Browns, then the Bears. The Steelers and Vikings. Jets and Bills. Patriots. Lions.\n\nThe good news is that the flood of results were pinned on two words: false positives.\n\nThere were no NFL outbreaks. At least not yet. The fire alarm was pulled for a false alarm.\n\nYet the reality check for the NFL -- with the initial diagnosis of dozens of COVID-19 tests indicating positive cases that apparently were negative -- came in the illustration of just how quickly the best-laid plans by the league and NFL players union can collapse with a breakdown in the system.\n\nMore: Baltimore Ravens release safety Earl Thomas after training camp fight with teammate Chuck Clark\n\nMore: Aldon Smith earning rave reviews from Cowboys after nearly five-year suspension\n\nThat the multitude of apparent false positives could be traced to a single BioReference laboratory in New Jersey provided the clue. The league uses about a half-dozen labs to process the tests for the 32 teams, and none of the other labs reported any dramatic spikes.\n\nIn a statement, the NFL declared that it is working with BioReference in launching an immediate investigation. Meanwhile, affected teams went into emergency response mode as outlined in the league's protocols.\n\nSince training camps opened, the league has had an estimated 150,000 tests conducted on players, coaches and staff, with such an overwhelming amount of negative results that the number of players league-wide placed on the COVID-19 reserve list has dwindled to single digits.\n\nBut imagine if the rash of false positives over the weekend came three Sundays later - as in Sept. 13, the Sunday of Week 1?\n\nChaos. That's what you can imagine.\n\nNo, with the NFL's COVID protocols riding with the reliability of the testing process, games might be won or lost, postponed or canceled in the lab.\n\nThe weekend drama didn't cause any camp practices to be scratched, although Cleveland was in limbo for that, and a few dozen players on the affected teams couldn't practice. According to the COVID-19 protocols, if a player's positive test is presumed false, he can return after two negative tests. Many of the players who sat out Sunday were expected to return to work on Monday.\n\nSomewhere, Matthew Stafford might be cringing. Earlier this month, the Lions quarterback was stung by a false positive that underscored the need for revising the protocols to add additional layers in confirming positives in individuals showing no symptoms of the novel coronavirus.\n\nDays after the Stafford episode, the league required two confirming tests for positive cases within 24 hours - including a point-of-care test to be analyzed on site.\n\nAt the time the revised protocols were announced, Allen Sills, the NFL's chief medial adviser, acknowledged the challenge.\n\n\"We're going to learn about testing,\" Sills said during a media conference call.\n\nSills cautioned that each new positive result did not equate to a new case of COVID-19. In some cases, for example, an individual could be considered a \"persistent positive\" - someone who recovered from the coronavirus, yet still showed traces of the virus up to six months later.\n\nThere's no indication at this point that the rash of positive tests over the weekend have any type of connecting factors, such previous exposure to COVID-19.\n\nYet the weekend drama surely shows the merits of daily testing - something the players union insisted on after the NFL initially wanted a limited window for daily tests. It's also clear that the confirming tests needed to be added to the protocol.\n\nThe goal of testing, of course, is to catch the actual COVID-19 case and contain the damage by isolating the infected individual and minimizing spread.\n\nCatching the false cases is quite the challenge, too, with a different type of potential damage.\n\nThe Bills practiced Sunday without quarterback Josh Allen, a presumed victim of a faulty test result. Quick adjustments were employed. Practice happened.\n\nBills GM Brandon Beane called it a \"good fire drill.\"",

        "authors": [],
        "body": "The NFL Players Association is conducting an investigation into the testing process at the New Jersey lab that produced 77 false positive COVID-19 test results and whether all of the established protocols for t were strictly followed this past weekend.\n\nThe players union on Sunday night sent all players a letter informing them of the pending investigation.\n\nThe letter read as follows:\n\n\"This morning, we were informed after the NFL's public statement that there were a number of false positive tests for NFL players and Staff. We have initiated an investigation into both the testing process at the lab site in question and whether or not all of our protocols were followed.\n\n\"Despite the false positive results, the combination of the following protocols we insisted on are being applied to keep everyone as safe as possible:\n\nEleven teams were impacted this weekend as a total of 77 players and staff members received false positives this past weekend.\n\nThe NFL on Sunday morning released a statement that it was working with testing partner BioReference Laboratories to investigate the results while teams worked to confirm or rule out the positive results. Re-checks on all tests returned negative results. BioReference Laboratories released a statement on Monday saying its own investigation revealed that the \"likely false positive results\" were caused by an isolated contamination during the testing preparation.\"\n\nThe NFLPA is seeking answers on how such an occurrence is possible and what measures will be taken to minimize the chances of a repeat incident. NFLPA officials also questioned the NFL's decision to release a public statement on the false test results before notifying the union of the incident because the protocol agreed upon last month requires the league to inform the player and the NFLPA of the test results before any public announcements, a person with knowledge of the situation told USA TODAY Sports. The person spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to comment on the matter.\n\nThe false positives produced understandable frustration on the parts of players and teams. The experience also sparked concern over how a repeat situation during the regular season would affect game and travel schedules.\n\nSome players have wondered if faulty testing could also subject them to the risk of false negatives. NFLPA officials have stressed that the weekend's episode further illustrates the need for vigilant execution of the protocol that the union and league agreed upon this summer, which includes daily testing, contract tracing, the identification of symptoms multiple times per day and re-testing.",

        "body": "Plus: The Golden State Killer hears from victims, hope for the U.S. Postal Service and promising coronavirus news\n\nWhat could be worse than being bitten by a bear while working in an avocado field during a heatwave in the middle of a pandemic? Maybe the plague.\n\nI'm Maria Sestito, senior issues reporter with The Desert Sun in Palm Springs, with your news for today. (Yes, it is very hot here, thanks for asking.) Today's apocalypse report brings wildfires, thunderstorms, blackouts, a heatwave, the fifth bear attack of the year and -- wait for it -- the plague. Plus, the Golden State Killer is forced to hear from his victims and some promising coronavirus updates.\n\nIn California brings you top Golden State stories and commentary from across the USA TODAY Network and beyond. Get it free, straight to your inbox.\n\nAfter months of criticism by the Trump administration and cuts implemented by Postmaster General Louis DeJoy, the United States Postal Service may finally be catching a break. DeJoy, who was appointed in May, started making changes in the agency that Democrats feared would hinder mail-in voting just months before the November election, citing financial losses experienced by the agency over the last decade. He announced on Tuesday that he'd wait to make any additional changes until after the election \"to avoid even the appearance of any impact on election mail.\"\n\nDespite a warning issued to states by the Postal Service last week that ballots may not make it on time to be counted, DeJoy said that the agency will be able to handle \"whatever volume of election mail it receives this fall.\"\n\nHe said a task force on election mail would also be expanded. Due to the pandemic, it is expected that more than ever, people will be relying on mail-in voting. In California, all registered voters will automatically have their ballots mailed to them.\n\nThe Golden State Killer is hearing from victims this week ahead of his sentencing scheduled for Friday. Joseph James DeAngelo, 74, didn't look at any of the victims as he sat in a wheelchair in court on Tuesday, according to the Sacramento Bee. That didn't stop survivors and family members from trying to get his attention. One sang a song and flipped him off. The son of another brought a gift-wrapped box with a black ribbon that was empty but signified the prison cell where DeAngelo will reside until he dies.\n\n\"You will forever be known as a repulsive coward who hid behind a mask of evil. The devil can keep you company in your prison cell as he gnaws away at whatever soul you have left, at whatever life you have left,\" Kris Pedretti, who was bound, gagged and raped at 15, said to DeAngelo, according to the Ventura County Star.\n\nDeAngelo will be formally sentenced on Friday to life in prison without the possibility of parole.\n\nGov. Gavin Newsom declared a state of emergency this afternoon over dozens of significant wildfires burning throughout California as the state's power grid operator pleaded with residents and businesses to continue conserving energy to avoid rolling blackouts.\n\nWildfire evacuations were underway in the Bay Area, according to the San Francisco Chronicle. Sonoma, San Mateo, Napa, Butte, Nevada and Monterey counties all issued warnings or mandatory evacuations -- some expanding existing orders -- for certain communities.\n\nIn Southern California, evacuations continued for a week-old fire in the mountains of northern Los Angeles County.\n\nHundreds of wildfires are burning in California and lightning is blamed for two of the largest ones: The 83,261-acre July Complex Fire in the Modoc National Forest and the 40,000-acre Dome Fire in the Mojave National Preserve.\n\nReferring to three fires in Napa County, Cal Fire said that the fires were tough to fight because of rugged terrain, triple-digit heat and \"unfavorable\" fire behavior, according to the Napa Valley Register.\n\nExcessive heat warnings remain in effect throughout the state and there was even a flash flood warning this afternoon in the desert communities of Hemet, San Jacinto, Valle Vista and East Hemet.\n\nThe potential for rolling blackouts across the state continues as people at home in the AC tap into California's power grid. The blackouts, if needed, will relieve stress on the state's electrical system. Newsom said Californians can continue to help lower the potential need for rolling blackouts by:\n\nA South Lake Tahoe resident tested positive for the plague on Monday, according to the Tahoe Daily Tribune. This is the first case of the plague in California in five years. Officials think the person got it after being bitten by an infected flea while walking their dog along the Truckee River or in the Tahoe Keys area.\n\nThough it sounds pretty darn scary and, might I add, apocalyptic, the plague can be treated with antibiotics if detected early. Just look out for symptoms including fever, nausea, weakness and swollen lymph nodes.\n\nNot to be confused with the fever, nausea, fatigue, congestion, sore throat or cough, etc., associated with COVID-19. Or the flu ... because that's coming up soon too.\n\nOn Tuesday, California reported a total of 632,667 coronavirus cases, 11,342 deaths, and more than 10 million tested, according to the state dashboard.\n\nState officials believe that the coronavirus pandemic in California is stabilizing and showing other signs of improvement, according to the San Francisco Chronicle. Both cases and hospitalizations are trending downward, said Health and Human Services Secretary Dr. Mark Ghaly.\n\nTest turnaround time, which was taking as long as two weeks in some areas, has also improved in part, reports the Chronicle, because the statewide testing task force has worked to send tests to labs that can process them more quickly. \"We are starting to see the fruits of some of our labor,\" Ghaly said. \"Doing that supply-demand matching has been effective and paid off.\"\n\nSome counties have even been taken off the state watch list, including Napa County -- the first in the Bay Area to meet state-mandated metrics. San Diego and Santa Cruz counties have also been removed from the state's watch list, reported the San Diego Union-Tribune. Health officials attributed the improvement to increased use of face coverings, increased disease investigations and helping those who are sick to isolate.\n\nReporter Andrew Dyer took a look at a Facebook group where conspiracy theories, racist banter and calls for violence persist. The online community called Defend East County that organized after a Black Lives Matter protest in La Mesa has grown to more than 20,000 members.\n\nThe Facebook group has become a clearinghouse for right-wing conspiracies about who is funding Black Lives Matter and what ties it may have to liberal political funder and conservative boogeyman George Soros.

    "Notre Dame suspended classes for COVID-19 cases. What went wrong?": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "SOUTH BEND, Ind. - In May, the president of the University of Notre Dame, the Rev. John Jenkins, insisted that despite a growing number of coronavirus cases locally and across the country, it was \"worth the risk\" to bring students back to campus for the fall.\n\n\"We have availed ourselves of the best medical advice and scientific information available and are assiduously planning a reopening that will make the campus community as safe as possible,\" Jenkins wrote in an op-ed piece for the New York Times. \"We believe the good of educating students and continuing vital research is very much worth the remaining risk.\"\n\nOne week into the fall semester, the plan unraveled. The school is shifting to online classes for two weeks and not sending students home.\n\nStudents partied. Others didn't follow safety protocols. Cases immediately spiked. And the university wasn't ready for the outbreak. Some students reported that calls to the university's COVID hotline went unanswered. Many complained about waiting days to get tested on campus. Others relayed stories about a lack of preparation at quarantine areas the university had set up. Some professors were outraged they weren't notified that students in their classes had tested positive.\n\nNotre Dame welcomed 12,000 undergraduate and graduate students back to campus for classes that started Aug. 10. Now, the university is hoping it can contain the spread of the virus in the next two weeks to avoid sending everyone back home. The challenges and missteps could serve as a cautionary tale for other universities preparing to re-open their campuses.\n\nIn a letter to the student body issued late Tuesday, Notre Dame acknowledged it wasn't prepared for the spike in cases and did not \"respond to all student calls in the personal way we pride ourselves on at Notre Dame.\"\n\n\"Some students in isolation and quarantine units also were not cared for as promptly or as thoroughly as we would have hoped,\" the statement said. \"We deeply regret any inconvenience or worry these gaps in care caused our students, especially at a time they were feeling ill.\"\n\nSports affected: Notre Dame pauses football practices as campus deals with rising cases of COVID-19\n\nThe university also pledged to add \"substantial staff to our efforts\" and increase on-campus testing.\n\nBut students and professors have continued to express anger and frustration, demanding stronger measures. Two professors on Wednesday created an online petition calling on Jenkins to allow students to opt for online classes for the full semester, rather than just two weeks. The petition also demanded that COVID-19 testing of the entire student population begin immediately.\n\n\"Notre Dame needs to hold itself responsible for bringing these students back and putting them in physical danger, due to its reckless reopening plan that flew in the face of everything we know about public health during a major pandemic,\" said Eileen Hunt Botting, a political science professor. \"When I taught my seminar yesterday, especially my freshmen, they looked scared. And my grad students are scared too. That should not be the case.\"\n\nJenkins hopes a plea to students and measures announced this week, including online-only classes and the closure of public spaces for at least two weeks, will help keep the campus open. As of Wednesday, the university was reporting 222 confirmed COVID-19 cases.\n\nOf those total cases, 73 came after 355 tests were performed Tuesday. That reflects a 20.6% positive testing rate.\n\nThe university has pointed to off-campus parties as the main culprit, saying more than 70% of the students who tested positive lived off campus and attended off-campus parties or came into close contact with someone who attended one of the parties.\n\nBut Ellis Riojas, a senior, says the blame falls on both students and university administrators.\n\n\"We wouldn't be experiencing this caseload if we weren't on campus, so that's on Notre Dame,\" he said. \"We wouldn't experiencing this caseload if people would follow the procedures, so that's the students' problem.\"\n\nHe also feels like he's in the middle of a public relations \"game that I don't have much control over.\"\n\n\"I think the idea of not sending us home honestly feels like they don't want to give up on the PR thing,\" Riojas said, \"like they can distance themselves from being at fault and not take responsibility for the problem that we have on our hands.\"\n\nThe university's decision to temporarily suspend in-person classes came one day after the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill moved all of its undergraduate classes online after 130 more students tested positive. Michigan State University also ordered undergrads to stay home for the rest of the fall.\n\nShould they stay or should they go? UNC students in Chapel Hill try to make sense of coronavirus cancellations\n\nMadeline Buitendorp, an analyst at the College Crisis Initiative, based at Davidson College in North Carolina, has been tracking how colleges respond to the COVID-19 pandemic. She is following Notre Dame's actions and says colleges have no clear blueprint as they resume in-person classes.\n\n\"It definitely is an experiment, and in some ways we are in the dark about what the best mode of operation is,\" she said. \"In the cases of Notre Dame and UNC, it speaks to the need for each individual higher education institution's community to really follow the rules.\"\n\nPandemic response: How miscommunication and selfishness hampered America's COVID-19 response\n\nOne of the first clues that Notre Dame's plan could be jeopardized came the weekend before classes were set to resume. An off-campus party for law students was canceled after the school's dean learned of the plans and warned the students about coronavirus safety and the impact on their professional reputations. The organizer later said she meant well but communicated poorly and didn't meant to suggest students didn't have to wear masks.\n\nOther off-campus parties, though, were held.\n\nOn Monday, Martijn Cremers, dean of Notre Dame's Mendoza College of Business, sent an email to students after learning that the school's students \"were a large proportion of the attendees\" of two off-campus parties -- one held Aug. 6 and another on Aug. 9. He said the positive cases \"disproportionately involve Mendoza students.\"\n\nBut students have also attested to large gatherings on campus, particularly in the quad and outdoor dining areas, with many people not following safety protocols, such as wearing masks.\n\n\"There was this image that if you're outside, you don't have to worry about it,\" said Riojas, the senior. \"Although that wasn't explicitly said, a lot of students took it that way. I'd say the vast majority of students are following the policies as well as they understand them without question. Then there's a subset who will bend the rules to make it comfortable for them. And then the minority opinion is, 'This is stupid, I'm not going to follow this and I don't have to.'\"\n\nMakira Walton, a junior, says a lack of enforcement on campus has contributed to the problem.\n\n\"Last Friday, walking to my dorm, I could see crowds of probably about 100 students who, for the most part, were not wearing masks, all in close contact, close proximity around different parts of campus,\" Walton said. \"That's happened pretty much every night, especially on weekends.\"\n\n\"While I do hold my fellow students accountable, I would say I especially hold the university accountable for not enforcing the rules that they set in place,\" she added.\n\nUniversity spokesman Paul Browne said \"the vast majority of students\" have been complying with safety protocols. He acknowledged that large gatherings have occurred on campus and said members of the Student Affairs department and the Notre Dame Police Department have been dispatched across campus to monitor activity and enforce safety measures. Still, he said, the university's primary concern is student behavior outside the campus.\n\n\"Generally speaking, when it's pointed out, students comply,\" Browne said. \"Our larger or greatest concern, frankly, is off-campus gatherings.\"\n\nOpinion: Even in face of a deadly pandemic, Big Ten parents set to do unthinkable - protest for return of fall football\n\nAfter the spike in cases, complaints turned to how the university was handling the outbreak. Immediately, the speed of testing became a problem, with students saying they had to endure long waits even though the university had pledged to make on-campus testing available.\n\nStudents who were transported to off-campus apartments, which the university had secured as quarantine sites, told stories of not being fed for hours.\n\nMegan O'Gorman, a junior, has been quarantined in one of the off-campus apartments since last Thursday, after coming down with a sore throat and having difficulty breathing. She's waiting for her COVID test results to come back.\n\nShe said the stay was rocky at first, with delays in food delivery, but she received a call from Jenkins after she sent an email about her concerns to administrators. She says \"things started to improve\" and she now gets daily calls from contact tracers who check on her symptoms.\n\n\"Notre Dame was not prepared for the volume of students who are going to want to get tested,\" she said, \"and they weren't prepared for the volume of students who were going to be involved in contact tracing.\"\n\nProfessors, meanwhile, complained that the university did not notify them that students in their classes had tested positive.\n\nOne professor, who asked not to be identified to avoid the possibility of identifying students and for fear of retaliation, said he was approached by students asking for an extension on assignments after testing positive.\n\nHe pointed to an email from administrators saying anyone who had been in close contact with a person who tested positive would be notified, quarantined and tested.\n\n\"I had the assumption the moment a student of mine tested positive, they would send an email immediately to all their professors saying, 'They won't be in your class for two weeks,'\" the professor said. \"I don't think I'm being unreasonable making that assumption ... If I'm positive and I'm speaking to a class ... there could be droplets going all over that room.\"\n\nHunt Botting voiced similar frustrations, saying she received an email from a student that read, \"I need to let you know I'm in isolation. I have COVID.\"\n\nBrowne, the university spokesman, said contact tracing immediately begins after a positive test. He said the university's medical personnel have not found an instance where a student tested positive and spread the virus to anyone in a classroom. That's why, he said, professors have not been contacted by contact tracers.\n\nThe student \"shows up virtually in class the next day. They're not there in person because they tested positive, but they are before the same professor who saw them in class previously. And they're now virtual, because they tested positive,\" Browne said. \"So I think it's a little disingenuous to suggest that they don't know.\"\n\nBrowne says Notre Dame will continue to work to resolve the issues that surfaced this week. They are issues that universities nationwide may soon confront, if they haven't already.\n\nContributing: Christian Sheckler, South Bend Tribune\n\nFollow reporter Allie Kirkman on Twitter: @alliekirkman15\n\nFlint water crisis: Michigan to pay $600M in settlement; victim compensation fund created",

    "Now that Big Ten won't play football in fall, will other Power Five conferences follow?": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "By making the first move, the Big Ten has forced the rest of the Power Five to quickly address two questions that will decide the overall fate of the coming season:\n\nIs it possible to justify competition when at least one other Power Five league has decided to table play at least through the winter?\n\nAnd can four, three or even two leagues compete as standalone bodies without all the accompanying pieces to a normal season -- up to and including the College Football Playoff?\n\nEven if willing to overlook the optics of moving ahead while other conferences press pause, those members of the Power Five that continue with an altered season would do so in the face of the same medical concerns that drove the Big Ten's decision.\n\nThe Big Ten chose in early July to eliminate non-conference games as a way to provide scheduling flexibility and slightly minimize risks associated with COVID-19. That change was quickly mirrored by the Pac-12, a league long in lockstep with the Big Ten, followed by the ACC, Big 12 and SEC, though the ACC and Big 12 allowed members to play a single non-conference game under certain limitations.\n\nAs a decision, the scheduling changes achieved one primary goal: to buy time and wiggle room as conference administrators and medical advisors weighed potential options to handling health and safety concerns. In the meantime, two Group of Five conferences, the MAC and Mountain West, have opted to cancel the season.\n\nOne significant concern that has developed in the weeks since is the growing awareness of potential long-term health issues that could arise among student-athletes who may otherwise dodge the primary symptoms of the coronavirus -- including myocarditis, an inflammation of the heart muscle that can impact the heart's ability to pump blood normally.\n\nThe SEC will continue to be patient, commissioner Greg Sankey said Monday. In a series of tweets, Sankey said the conference \"has been deliberate at each step since March,\" citing as an example the decision to move the start of the regular season to the end of September.\n\n\"We know concerns remain,\" Sankey said. \"Can we play? I don't know. We haven't stopped trying. We support, educate and care for student-athletes every day, and will continue to do so...every day.\"\n\nIf medical concerns served as the driving force behind the Big Ten's move, for other Power Five leagues to play amid the same uncertainty would require accepting that student-health wellness may be the collateral damage behind competition.\n\nPlayers and coaches seem willing to take that gamble. Within the past week, several of the biggest names in college football have voiced their willingness to accept this risk, including Clemson quarterback Trevor Lawrence and Ohio State quarterback Justin Fields. At the same time, coaches such as Michigan's Jim Harbaugh have issued statements advocating for play to continue as scheduled in September.\n\nIn making an impassioned case for games to be held this fall, Nebraska coach Scott Frost said Monday that players would be lower risk for the coronavirus by staying on campus and within the confines of the football program.\n\n\"I'm passionate about this because our guys want to play,\" he said.\n\n\"If I had a son, I would want him playing football. I think this is the safest place he could be, and a lot of schools around the conference probably feel the same way, that the safest environment we can put these guys in is an environment where they're being monitored constantly, being screened, being tested, being taken care of, being protected if they do get sick.\"\n\nYet the choice rests not among players and coaches but in the hands of university presidents representing the remaining conferences in the Power Five. While acknowledging the financial stakes of not conducting a season, these administrators may eventually find themselves unable to justify how college football and COVID-19 can safely coexist.\n\nCollege football's Top 25: The preseason Amway Coaches PollFullscreen",

    "Nursing home COVID-19 cases near 10K  --  an all-time high, report says": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "Coronavirus cases in nursing homes have surged to an all-time high, driven by spread of the virus in Sunbelt states, according to a new report.\n\nAn analysis of federal data shows 9,715 COVID-19 cases during the week of July 26, the most recent data available. The figures eclipsed the previous high of 9,421 cases in the last week of May, according to the report by the American Health Care Association and National Center for Assisted Living.\n\nNearly four in five of coronavirus infections were at facilities in Sunbelt states, where total nursing home cases nearly tripled since mid-June, according to the report.\n\nDeaths are on the upswing with 1,706 COVID-19 fatalities during the week ending July 26, a 22% increase from the previous week, but still well below the 3,130 deaths reported in the last week of May.\n\nMark Parkinson, president and CEO of the American Health Care Association and National Center for Assisted Living, said community spread and slow testing turnaround that delays identifying the virus in vulnerable homes remain persistent problems.\n\n\"Unfortunately, we've definitely taken a step back,\" Parkinson said.\n\n'Pushing the frontiers': Long lines for COVID tests, stressed labs delay results as demand spikes\n\nParkinson said the rise in cases reflects last month's spread of the virus in hot-spot communities in the South and West. Nursing homes can be particularly vulnerable because residents live in close quarters and are more likely to have underlying medical conditions that make them susceptible to COVID-19 complications or death.\n\n\"The public needs to make the decision that the lives of the people in these buildings matter and then make the simple sacrifice to wear a mask,\" he said. \"That would solve a lot of this.\"\n\nThe federal government has provided hundreds of millions in emergency funds to nursing homes and long-term care facilities to prevent infections and protect residents and staff. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has said it will ship to all nursing homes point-of-care testing machines that deliver rapid results.\n\nCenters for Medicare and Medicaid Services Administrator Seema Verma said Thursday she was \"deeply concerned' about the upswing in cases. And, on Friday, her agency announced it has levied more than $15 million in fines against 3,400-plus nursing homes for infection control lapses and failure to report COVID-19 data.\n\n'States duking it out for supply': Lack of federal plan leads to coronavirus testing delays\n\nSince March, CMS and states have conducted infection-control inspections at more than 15,000 nursing homes. Deficiencies at 180 homes in 22 states triggered \"immediate jeopardy\" findings, which the agency describes as conditions that caused or were likely to cause serious injury, harm, impairment or death.\n\nParkinson said it's the wrong time to fine and shut down homes that are striving to protect workers and residents.\n\n\"We don't think the right approach is to issue fines and penalties when people are in a crisis,\" Parkinson said. \"We think the right approach is to offer a helping hand and to collaborate as we get through the crisis.\"\n\nParkinson said the next few weeks will be critical to gauge whether the surge in new cases will be followed by more fatalities, which typically lag new cases. But he said drug treatments and care for COVID patients in nursing homes has improved since the early days of the pandemic. Dozens of residents at Life Care Center in Kirkland, Washington, died after the virus swept through the home in February and March, the nation's first warning of how deadly the virus could be in such settings.\n\nOthers think testing mandates have identified cases at nursing homes and long-term care facilities sooner.\n\nPennsylvania required universal testing of staff and residents of nursing homes by the end of July and assisted-living centers by the end of August. Nursing homes have identified far more cases, but most of the cases have been mild or no symptoms, said Dr. David Nace, chief medical officer for University of Pittsburgh Medical Center Senior Communities.\n\n'Totally unacceptable': Testing delays force labs to prioritize COVID-19 tests for some, not others\n\n\"Many of these cases would have gone unnoticed otherwise,\" Nace said.\n\nNace said UPMC, which manages 35 care facilities in western Pennsylvania, has been able to isolate residents who've tested for the virus and limit the spread within facilities.\n\n\"The argument's always been detect the case early so you can isolate and limit the spread,\" said Nace, a professor and geriatrics expert. \"Maybe that's actually working.\"",

    "Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine tested positive, then negative for COVID. 7 questions you might have about testing.": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "\"This is the same PCR test that has been used over 1.6 million times in Ohio by hospitals and labs all over the state,\" DeWine said in a released statement soon after the second test's results were released.\n\nDeWine's COVID scare underscores the fact that not all tests work the same way, nor do they always provide identical results. Even the same test taken twice can show contradictory outcomes.\n\n\"It's not that a test is good or bad,\" explained Dr. Dr. Gary Procop, the director of medical microbiology at the Cleveland Clinic. \"Understand the test characteristics and use it correctly.\"\n\nDr. Michael Mina, an infectious disease epidemiologist at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, said DeWine's ability to quickly get a second test showed \"the system worked as it should.\"\n\nEvery test sometimes gives false positives - which is better than telling someone they don't have COVID-19 when they do - and being able to get a new result within a few hours meant he was inconvenienced only briefly. \"It's a whole lot better than if we weren't testing him at all and he were positive.\"\n\nHere are answers to seven common questions about diagnostic COVID-19 testing. These tests are different than antibody tests, which are used to determine whether someone has had COVID-19 in the past not an active case.\n\nA rapid test, explained Dr. Sheldon Campbell, a professor of laboratory medicine at Yale School of Medicine, is a catch-all term for any quick test. Any test that provides results in 30 minutes to one hour, he said, falls under the umbrella of rapid testing.\n\n\"Seriously, it's not a specific technical term,\" he told USA TODAY.\n\nIn rapid testing, explained Procop, there are two kinds of tests -- antigen tests and nucleic acid tests.\n\nAn antigen test, Campbell said, looks for the proteins that make up the virus coating.\n\nThink of the virus like an M&M, Campbell suggests. Antigen tests look for traces of the hard-shell exterior of the virus, so to speak.\n\nWhile they provide results more rapidly, they are not a perfect test. The Food and Drug Administration states that antigen tests are more likely to miss active coronavirus infections, and thus, cannot definitively rule out whether someone has COVID-19. DeWine's first test was an antigen test.\n\nA PCR (polymerase chain reaction) test searches for the viral genome.This test, explained Campbell, makes the virus easier to detect by \"making a billion copies of a single target bit of the virus genome.\"\n\nTo go back to the M&M analogy, Campbell likens the viral genome to the chocolate core of the candy.\n\nThese tests are more common and have a higher rate of accuracy.\n\nHere's where things get a bit tricky. Generally, PCR tests tend to be more reliable.\n\n\"It's both more likely to detect the SARS-CoV-2 virus and usually less likely to give a positive signal if no virus is present,\" said Campbell.\n\nBut Procop says the type of test is less relevant than the context in which it is performed. In a screening context, a patient generally wouldn't have symptoms of COVID-19, whereas in a diagnostic setting, patients get tested because they show symptoms.\n\n\"If you're using a highly sensitive test in a diagnostic setting,\" he said, \"you don't need follow up. If you use it in a screening setting, you should have confirmation.\"\n\nEssentially, if you're taking a test out of an abundance of caution - and don't show any symptoms - it's worth taking another one in the case of a false positive.\n\nThe super-short answer, joked Campbell, is that \"(expletive) always happens.\" A number of factors contribute to the possibility that any lab test could result in incorrect outcomes.\n\nEach test provides its own slew of errors.\n\nAntigen tests get false results because its procedure requires \"sticking a labeled probe to the virus proteins.\"\n\n\"Despite the best efforts of the people who design the tests, sometimes the probe sticks to non-virus sticky stuff in the sample,\" Campbell said.\n\nFor PCR tests, the same sensitivity that contributes to its accuracy can create false positives. A bit of viral RNA from a previous patient can turn a test positive.\n\nThere are also human errors that come into play, whether lab specimens improperly collected or labeled, or manufacturing errors with testing kits.\n\nAbsolutely. It remains unclear why that is, Campbell said, but a common theory he suggested is that \"bits of non-infectious virus\" slowly work their way out of the body even after symptoms have vanished.\n\n\"Some folks with COVID-19 stay positive for days or weeks after they get better,\" Campbell said.\n\nThat's also why the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, explained Procop, changed its criteria for employees returning back to work,from two weeks to 10 days after a positive test.\n\n\"There's a long tail of positivity after patients have recovered and we believe it's clinically meaningless,\" he said.\n\nExpect the long swab. There are different nasal swabs with varying degrees of efficacy.\n\nThe long swab, otherwise known as the nasopharyngeal swab, is probably the best and is most common if you do demonstrate symptoms of COVID-19.\n\nAn alternative is the nasal mid-turbinate swab and a less-invasive \"anterior nares\" swab, which are less effective but sufficient.\n\nStill, the long swab is the gold standard. Campbell puts it this way: \"The swab goes farther up your nose than maybe you thought it should, and done right it burns when it's up there. But it's over quickly, and feeling the burn means you know your test was done right.\"",

        "authors": [],
        "body": "Comments made earlier this week by Penn State's director of athletic medicine suggesting that roughly a third of Big Ten athletes who had contracted COVID-19 and undergone a cardiac scan showed heart-related issues were inaccurate, the university said in a statement shared Thursday evening.\n\nWayne Sebastianelli, who is also the team doctor for Penn State football, said during a meeting of the State College Area School District board of directors that these cardiac scans showed \"30 to roughly 35 percent of their heart muscles\" indicated symptoms of myocarditis.\n\nAccording to a spokesperson in the university's Office of Marketing and Communications, Sebastianelli was sharing \"initial preliminary data that had been verbally shared by a colleague on a forthcoming study, which unbeknownst to him at the time had been published at a lower rate.\"\n\n\"The research was not conducted by Dr. Sebastianelli or Penn State. Dr. Sebastianelli wishes to clarify this point, and apologize for any confusion,\" said the statement.\n\nNo cases of myocarditis have been found among Penn State athletes, the university said. In the most recent round of testing, which spanned from Aug. 24-28, Penn State conducted 222 COVID-19 tests of students with one positive result.\n\nMyocarditis, which in severe cases can be fatal, was one of the drivers behind the Big Ten's decision to postpone the coming season with the possibility to return this winter or spring.\n\n\"There is simply too much we do not know about the virus, recovery from infection, and longer-term effects,\" Big Ten Commissioner Kevin Warren wrote last month. \"While the data on cardiomyopathy is preliminary and incomplete, the uncertain risk was unacceptable at this time.\"\n\nSebastianelli's remarks came as Big Ten presidents and chancellors have come under pressure to reconsider last month's decision, particularly as three other Power Five leagues move ahead as scheduled with the start of their seasons this month.\n\nAccording to the Mayo Clinic, \"In many cases, myocarditis improves on its own or with treatment, leading to a complete recovery.\"\n\nEven in mild cases, however, the clinic suggests that \"persons should avoid competitive sports for at least three to six months.\"\n\nInflammation can lead to \"electrical malaise,\" Sebastianelli said, potentially causing arrhythmia, or an irregular heart rhythm.\n\n\"What has been seen across some of the schools is that some of the athletes affected haven't really recovered their full pulmonary function,\" he said. \"They just don't train as hard as they normally can.\n\n\"We don't know how long that's going to last. What we have seen is when people have been studied with cardiac MRI scans -- symptomatic and asymptomatic COVID infections -- is a level of inflammation in cardiac muscle that just is alarming.\"",

    "Pulse oximeters are back in stock -- here's why you may want one": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "-- Recommendations are independently chosen by Reviewed's editors. Purchases you make through our links may earn us a commission.\n\nAt the start of the coronavirus pandemic, pulse oximeters were tough to come by. These medical devices measure oxygen saturation in the blood, which some people think can be a gauge for reduced lung capacity -- often a symptom of COVID-19.\n\nNeed help finding products?: Sign up for our weekly newsletter. It's free and you can unsubscribe at any time.\n\nBut by now, many retailers have restocked their oximeter supply. And as schools, gyms, restaurants, and more places continue to reopen, you may want to make sure you have one in your first-aid kit while you're taking other safe-keeping measures like masking up and washing hands frequently. Here's the lowdown on pulse oximeters -- what they are, what they do, and if you really need to get one for yourself or your loved ones.\n\nThe type of pulse oximeter most people want is a device that is clipped over a finger, toe, or ear lobe to measure the saturation of oxygen in the blood. The device does this by emitting small beams of red light through the skin and, based on how the blood absorbs the light, can estimate the percentage of oxygen in the blood. \"If it's highly saturated, which is good, it's usually 95 to 97 percent in most healthy individuals. If it's low, in the 90 range, that's not considered very good,\" says Dr. Albert Rizzo, Chief Medical Officer of the American Lung Association.\n\nAccording to the Mayo Clinic, oxygen saturation that dips below 90 percent is considered hypoxic, which means there is a lower level of oxygen than is needed in the blood. Depleted oxygen can lead to lightheadedness, fainting, coughing, wheezing, and even death.\n\nCOVID-19 is a respiratory illness that can cause lung complications including pneumonia and acute respiratory distress, both of which deplete oxygen levels in the body, according to Johns Hopkins Medicine. Some COVID patients either do not notice or do not have other illness symptoms as their oxygen levels drop, according to Dr. Richard Levitan, who wrote in an op-ed in the New York Times that using pulse oximeters and monitoring blood oxygen saturation can help individuals recognize signs of COVID-19 before they notice any other symptoms. Most at-home pulse oximeters range in price between $25 and $200, and can be bought with pre-tax money from your FSA or HSA account. Increased demand for pulse oximeters was likely driven by people who wanted a relatively inexpensive device that gives out a number for assessing their health, rather than trying to gauge symptoms based on how they feel.\n\nYou may have had a medical professional use a pulse oximeter on you at a doctor's office or hospital as part of a routine checkup, for a pre- or post-op procedure, or as a diagnostic test for a respiratory illness. Some people purchase these devices for home use to help manage certain medical conditions, including sleep apnea, high blood pressure, or respiratory ailments that require supplemental oxygen.\n\nWhether otherwise healthy people need an oximeter depends on a few things. \"The main message I try to get across is that the pulse oximeter is just one factor that needs to be looked at when you're communicating with your doctor,\" Dr. Rizzo says. He suggests it's more important to pay attention to how you feel in general if you suspect you may have been exposed to or contracted the novel coronavirus.\n\n\"We don't know for sure, but I think as far as an oxygen level drop being the first sign of COVID-19, it doesn't seem to be the most likely scenario,\" he says. Therefore, it's important to know the confirmed symptoms of the disease, which include fever, coughing, shortness of breath, muscle pain, headaches, and loss of smell or taste, according to the CDC.\n\nStill, as an extra measure of precaution, and especially for people who are at higher risk of respiratory issues, there's no harm in getting an oximeter. Rizzo says you don't need to buy an expensive one because, as long as it's a physical device, the technology should be the same in all of them.\n\nOne thing Rizzo says to avoid (unless your doctor tells you otherwise) are phone apps that claim to work as pulse oximeters. \"The traditional pulse ox works by shooting two wavelengths of light into the tissue. It's not just white light, which is what most of the phone apps would use,\" he says. This means the technology of a phone oximeter app is fundamentally different than an actual device, so if you're relying on an oximeter for clear, consistent data, it's best to stay old-school until more testing is done on phone oximeter apps. (Physical pulse oximeters that link to a phone app to track readings are medically fine, though may cost you more for that feature.)\n\nIf you do get an oximeter, Rizzo recommends speaking with your physician about it so you have context for what the numbers it displays mean for you. \"The more information you have about what to do about the number on the pulse oximeter, the better you'll be able to handle it,\" he says. \"It's one number to be used along with everything else when you either call or do a televisit with your healthcare provider and say, 'This is how I'm feeling,' [and also mention the number on your pulse oximeter],'\" he says. \"It's just additional information. It's a matter of access and affordability.\"\n\nOximeters can be a valuable tool for gauging your health. But like any other gadget, they can be inaccurate -- Rizzo says even sometime as mundane as nail polish on fingers and toes can impact the readings -- so it's important not to overuse them to the extent that you ignore potential inaccuracies or allow the numbers to supersede other things going on with your body. \"If you start fixating on a number that is not totally accurate, but you don't know it's not accurate, then it might give you a false sense of security or a false sense of alarm,\" says Rizzo. \"If you have a cold finger or cold ear and the blood flow is not as good as it should be, the reading may not be as good. Or if the device is not fitting securely over the finger or the toe and it's moving a bit, that could make a variation.\"\n\nTo ensure you're getting correct numbers, he advises taking your own pulse with your fingers on your wrist or neck, and seeing if it's close to what's shown on the oximeter, which should display your pulse and blood saturation. If the pulse is good, the saturation level you see is more likely to be correct.\n\nUltimately, like many other medical devices, pulse oximeters are one thing you can use to have a greater understanding of your overall health, not something that can give you a full picture or a diagnosis. If you're not sure if it's right for you, talk to your doctor before you get one.\n\nThe best pulse oximeter for you is one recommended to you by your doctor. Otherwise, most major retailers sell pulse oximeters, including drugstores such as CVS and Walgreens. You can also use your pre-tax money to buy one at the FSA store.\n\nNo matter where you buy one, remember: your pulse oximeter doesn't have to be expensive to work well, but it should come from a reputable retailer. Not sure where to start? We found a few well-reviewed options that should work for most people.\n\nThis oximeter, a bestseller on Amazon, measures your pulse rate, pulse strength, and SpO2 and displays it on a large LED screen in 10 seconds. It has a spring system that makes it suitable for a wide range of finger sizes (the brand recommends it for 12-year-olds and above). The oximeter also comes with useful accessories, such as batteries that allow it to be used right out of the box, a silicon cover, and a lanyard.\n\nGet the Zacurate Fingertip Oximeter from Amazon for $29.95\n\nThe iHealth oximeter displays your SpO2, pulse rate, and pulse strength on its screen and through a smartphone app. The app keeps track of your data over time, so it's useful for people who want to take a comprehensive approach to their readings. It also comes with a lanyard and a charging cable, so you don't need to worry about changing out its batteries.\n\nThe Facelake pulse oximeter, another top seller on Amazon, displays your SpO2 and pulse rate in under 10 seconds. It also comes with batteries, a carrying case, and lanyard, and has a one-year warranty.\n\nGet the Facelake FL400 Oximeter from Amazon for $23.95\n\nThis oximeter displays your SpO2 and pulse rate.

    "School nurses brace for 'uphill fight' against coronavirus pandemic": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "DES MOINES, Iowa -- School nurses have a message for parents: Expect your kids to be sent home more quickly this year if they seem even a little ill.\n\n\"There have been a lot of kids I've sent back to class with a headache, and now I might send them home. That will be different for sure,\" said Nicole Cable, the nurse at Roosevelt High School in Des Moines, Iowa.\n\nIn normal times, a student with a headache, fatigue or slight cough would not raise alarms in a school nurse's office. But these are not normal times.\n\nCable and about 600 other Iowa school nurses -- along with their peers across the country -- will face immense challenges in trying to keep children and staff safe as classes resume amid the continuing coronavirus pandemic.\n\n\"It's an uphill fight,\" said Cable, who is leading a Des Moines school district committee working on the issue. \"It's one thing to say you have to physically distance in the classroom. It's another thing to actually do it.\"\n\nSchool nurses will be on the lookout for signs of COVID-19, the disease the virus causes. It could be especially tough to sort out those cases as late-summer allergy season brings a wave of coughs and sneezes. Then schools will see outbreaks of colds and flu, which cause many of the same symptoms that COVID-19 brings.\n\nSchool nurses always perform crucial public health tasks, from bandaging playground scrapes and ensuring kids are vaccinated to responding to teens who are considering suicide. \"It was a really complex role anyhow, and now you add COVID on top of that and it gets a whole lot more complicated,\" said Sharon Guthrie, executive director of the Iowa School Nurse Organization.\n\nSchool nurses are armed with flow charts to help discern the difference between everyday maladies and COVID-19. But they will have to employ a relatively quick hook this fall, sending kids home if there's any doubt.\n\nOnce a coronavirus case is identified, school nurses and local public health officials will have to figure out which students, teachers and other school staff might have been exposed at length to the infected person. That could lead to extensive testing and quarantining.\n\nThe challenges could be particularly daunting for nurses in rural school districts. Many of them work in more than one building, and some ride a circuit of several towns. Urban districts' nurses have backup in case they become overwhelmed or ill. Many rural school nurses lack that support.\n\nHeather Sloma-Weber is the only full-time school nurse in eastern Iowa's Tipton school district. She monitors the health of about 700 elementary and middle-school students. A part-time nurse covers the high school.\n\nSloma-Weber said she enjoys the autonomy of her job, which she likens to being on an island as the district's leading medical expert. \"Now everyone's on my island,\" she said with a laugh, describing the intense focus on health issues this year.\n\n'Like saying I don't love her': Parents torn as some schools face greater reopening risks\n\nSloma-Weber said she and many other school nurses wish the state was allowing more flexibility in deciding whether to pull back from in-person classes if COVID-19 breaks out in a community. She's concerned about state benchmarks that districts will be required to hit before they can apply for waivers to in-person teaching requirements.\n\nOne of the criteria for such a waiver is that at least 10% of students must be absent from school. \"This is going to be my ninth school year, and I've never had that many kids gone,\" even during a bad flu season, Sloma-Weber said.\n\nThe other main benchmark before a district can apply for a waiver to reduce in-person classes is that at least 15% of people being tested for the coronavirus in a county come up positive over 14 days.\n\n\"That would be pretty ugly. I hope we don't get to that point,\" Sloma-Weber said. As of Friday, Cedar County, which includes Tipton, had a positivity rate of 6%.\n\nSloma-Weber said she appreciates the support of colleagues who have been participating in weekly video chats organized by the Iowa School Nurse Organization. Dozens of members have been tuning in and sharing tips.\n\nGuthrie, executive director of the professional group, said many school nurses weren't being paid during the summer, but they devoted countless hours to planning how to prevent outbreaks.\n\nShe said some rural members of her group serve three or four schools in different towns. \"A lot of people have an assumption that there's a nurse in every building every day, all day,\" she said. \"There really isn't.\"\n\nGuthrie, a former school nurse who now directs graduate nursing programs at Mount Mercy University in Cedar Rapids, wishes schools had their own coronavirus testing equipment. If they did, nurses could quickly determine if a child or staffer was infected with the virus. But such equipment is not likely to be available any time soon, she said.\n\nFrom Stanford med to blueberry fields: Student laborer gets lesson in COVID perseverance\n\nLike teachers and other staffers, school nurses face the risk of becoming infected at work. But Melissa Walker, a nurse practitioner who coordinates school-nurse programs for the Iowa Department of Education, said she hasn't heard of a wave of Iowa school nurses resigning or retiring because of the risk.\n\nWalker said some school districts have hired additional nurses or health associates to help respond to the pandemic. Iowa school districts employed the equivalent of 645 full-time nurses last school year, the education department reports. Walker said some districts also contract out with local clinics or hospitals to provide nursing services to students.\n\nFace masks will be one of the main ways of limiting the spread of the virus in schools this fall. Some districts will just encourage their use. Others, including Tipton and Des Moines, will require them for almost everyone.\n\nNurses said they don't expect major problems in persuading students to comply.\n\nCable, the Des Moines high school nurse, said it will be important for adults to set an example by wearing masks properly all the time.\n\n\"We all have a responsibility to keep each other safe,\" she said.\n\nSloma-Weber noted that everyone is under stress, but she's optimistic parents and school staff will show each other grace and patience as they work their way through difficult times, including the mask issue.\n\n\"We all want the same thing,\" she said. \"We all love these kids and we all want the best for them.\"",

    "South Dakota, COVID-19 hot spot, follows Sturgis rally with state fair": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "South Dakota is one of the nation's hot spots for COVID-19 infections. That didn't stop another large-scale event from kicking off Thursday.\n\nThe rural South Dakota State Fair, which reported an attendance of 205,000 people last year, is set to run through Labor Day with more hand-washing stations, social distancing reminders and an encouragement -- but not a requirement -- for attendees to wear masks. It comes on the heels of the state's two largest events: The Sturgis Motorcycle Rally and the The Sioux Empire Fair.\n\nIn the weeks following those events, South Dakota has emerged as a virus hotbed, according to data analysis. State and national health experts say the rise in cases is likely fueled by a combination of factors, including school reopenings, small gatherings and major events.\n\nInside the numbers: The coronavirus spread is slowing in some states. It's getting worse in others.\n\nThose larger events have been made possible by South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem's steadfast resistance to restrictive measures aimed at slowing the spread of the virus. She has discouraged schools from requiring masks, instead promoting hand-washing as the best way to prevent infections, and railed against an \"elite class of so-called experts\" whose opinions impact individuals' liberties.\n\nBut as cases surge in the state, public health officials are grappling with the impact of the Sturgis rally, which gained national attention as one of the largest events to be held since the onset of the pandemic.\n\nThe event has so far been linked to one death. In South Dakota, 118 residents who attended the rally subsequently tested positive for COVID-19. Nationally, about 300 cases have been linked to the rally.\n\nWhile that's less than 1% of the more than 460,000 people who converged on Sturgis, Dr. Robert J. Kim-Farley said it's likely \"the tip of the iceberg.\"\n\nKim-Farley, a professor of epidemiology and community health sciences at the UCLA Fielding School of Public Health, told USA TODAY on Thursday that COVID-19 is a particularly difficult virus to trace to its infection point. Symptoms might not show up for weeks, if at all, in an infected person. Meanwhile, that person could be spreading the virus.\n\nCellphone location data analyzed by the nonprofit COVID Alliance has found evidence that rally participants came from each of the 48 continental United States and more than half of the nation's counties.\n\nThe data also suggests participants were less likely to practice social distancing -- they stayed at home less and traveled more compared to their neighbors. This behavior continued before and after the August rally, COVID Alliance data shows.\n\nWhile the rally's impact ripples across the nation, a spike in cases in South Dakota is also gaining national attention.\n\nThe Mouth Rushmore State has recorded the nation's third-highest rate of coronavirus cases per capita over the last two weeks, according to The Associated Press, and the highest per-capita rate in the nation for the past seven days, according to New York Times data.\n\nA statement from Noem's office emailed to USA TODAY on Thursday says the Republican governor \"remains focused on our hospitalization rate, and we are encouraged by the fact that only 6% of our ICU beds are currently occupied by COVID patients.\"\n\nMapping coronavirus: Tracking the U.S. outbreak\n\nWhile hospitalizations are a more accurate metric for studying COVID-19 spread than cases, there's a lag time from days to weeks, Kim-Farley said.\n\nIt's \"a little bit early to say that hospitalizations haven't been affected,\" Kim-Farley said.\n\nState epidemiologist Josh Clayton acknowledged there is typically a two-week lag between increases in cases and hospitalizations. Currently, less than 100 COVID-19 patients are hospitalized, well within the state's capacity.\n\nThe pandemic and the surge of cases is impacting the state fair, Candi Briley, the event's assistant manager, told USA TODAY.\n\nWhile organizers are \"ready to welcome fairgoers\" to Huron, about 125 miles northwest of Sioux Falls, they \"understand some people might not feel comfortable coming out and we respect (their decision),\" Briley said.\n\nFor those who do, they'll be encouraged to keep their distance. Among the reminders, according to Briley, are signs featuring pigs that read, \"Have a squeal of a time at the fair. Stay 6 feet apart.\"",

    "Southwest, Spirit, others tighten coronavirus face mask rules": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "Airlines are tightening face mask rules three months after making masks mandatory on board.\n\nMost major airlines have eliminated any medical exemptions to the rule, and several are cracking down on the types of face coverings allowed. Passengers who refuse to wear masks will generally be denied boarding and might be prohibited from flying the airline again. Delta said it's banned about 130 passengers to date, and Alaska says it will cancel any connecting flights or return flights for travelers who refuse to wear one in flight.\n\nAll airlines are insisting passengers wear a mask as soon as they step into the airport and to keep it on throughout the travel journey except to briefly remove to drink or eat.\n\nThe goals: further thwart the spread of the coronavirus, which causes the disease COVID-19, and help convince travelers its safe to fly.\n\n'Flying is not dangerous': Frontier CEO says CDC should update coronavirus travel advice\n\n\"We all need to look out for each other during this health emergency, and the best way we can do that - and prevent the spread of the virus - is to simply wear a mask or face covering when we're around each other,\" Max Tidwell, Alaska Airlines' vice president of safety and security said in a statement Friday. \"Our tougher policy shows how important this issue is to us and our guests. If you don't wear a mask, you won't be flying with us.\"\n\nProhibited face coverings: Masks with direct exhaust valves, face shields without masks underneath and face coverings that don't cover a passenger's nose and mouth.\n\nMedical exemptions: Passengers with medical conditions that prevent the use of a face covering must present documentation from a medical doctor to the gate agent one hour prior to departure.\n\nProhibited face coverings: None. Face shields must be worn with a mask or other face covering underneath. The airline says cloth scarfs and bandannas are allowed if they cover your nose and mouth.\n\nDetails: American website\n\nWho must wear: Passengers ages 2 and older. Young children who cannot maintain a face covering and unaccompanied minors are exempt.\n\nMedical exemptions: Passengers with an underlying medical condition that prevents them from wearing a mask must complete a \"clearance-to-fly'' process including a medical consultation over the phone with the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center at the airport, a process it says takes an hour before the flight. The airline notes that it's encouraging those who can't wear masks to \"reconsider flying'' during the pandemic.\n\nProhibited face coverings: Any mask with an exhaust valve. Plastic face shields must be worn with an approved face covering.\n\nProhibited face coverings: Open-chin triangle bandannas; face coverings with vents, valves or mesh; and face shields without masks underneath. Face coverings must fit snugly over your nose and mouth and be secured under the chin.\n\nMedical exemptions: Beginning Aug. 17, passengers requesting a medical exemption will go through a remote medical assessment at the airport to determine whether they are fit to fly and free of COVID-19 symptoms. Those who do not pass or falsely claim to have a medical condition or disability, will not be allowed to fly.\n\nProhibited face coverings: Masks with vents or exhalation valves are not permitted. Plastic face shields may be worn in addition to a face covering but not in place of one.\n\nProhibited face masks: Face coverings with holes, including exhaust valves; face coverings made solely of mesh or lace; bandannas and other face coverings that cannot be secured under the chin; face shields without a face covering underneath. Neck gaiters are allowed if they cover the nose and mouth and are secured under the chin.\n\nProhibited face masks: Open-chin triangle bandannas, face coverings containing valves or mesh material, and face shields worn alone. All face coverings must fit snugly over the nose and mouth and be secure under the chin and have at least two layers of fabric.\n\nMedical exemptions: Passengers with a medical condition are permitted to wear a face shield, no mask required underneath.\n\nProhibited face coverings: The face mask or covering may not have any vents or openings. A face shield alone does not count as a face covering.",

        "body": "The first COVID-19 death associated with a massive biker rally in Sturgis, South Dakota has been reported weeks after the event attracted more than 400,00 vehicles and drew widespread concern from public health officials.\n\nThe death was reported by Minnesota Department of Health Infectious Disease Director Kris Ehresmann at a Wednesday briefing. Minnesota -- South Dakota's neighbor to the east -- is tracking an ongoing outbreak of 50 cases tied to the August event, Ehresmann said.\n\nA Minnesota man who died was in his 60s and had underlying health conditions. The 50-case outbreak only includes people who attended the event, Ehresmann said, noting that those infected individuals may have spread the virus to others.\n\nInfections linked to the event have been reported among people in states from coast to coast.

The #Sturgis motorcycle rally starts this weekend, and we're excited for visitors to see what our great state has to offer!\"\n\nAttendees were largely free of social distancing restrictions common elsewhere in the country during this year's 10-day festival.\n\nSouth Dakota has seen the bulk of cases tied to the rally, with the Department of Health reporting 105 tied to the rally. The city of Sturgis made coronavirus tests available to residents and city employees after the rally in an attempt to uncover people who had infections but no symptoms.\n\nThe rally ended on Aug. 16, and virus symptoms can take up to two weeks to present, according to the CDC. Severe illness or death can lag days or weeks behind the beginning of COVID-19 symptoms.",

    "Testing slowdown: Fewer coronavirus tests casts doubt on falling case counts": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "Official case counts have dropped nationally but reporting problems and generally reduced testing in some states makes it hard to place any confidence that infection rates are improving. And in some states with more reliable data, testing slowdowns coincide with increasing or stable positive rates.\n\n\"The enhanced positivity rate is the thing that bothers people more than anything else,\" said Dr. William Schaffner, a professor of preventive medicine and infectious disease specialist at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine. \"Because it suggests this virus is circulating still very briskly, especially in certain parts of the country. In fact, much of the country.\"\n\nThe WHO recommends 5% or fewer tests should be positive two consecutive weeks before a community loosens restrictions on businesses opening. If a positive test rate is above that benchmark, it's a sign an area is only testing the sickest patients and not adequately tracking the virus.\n\nThe average number of coronavirus tests reached 793,000 per day in the last two weeks of July. But testing dropped to fewer than 650,000 per day during the first 12 days of August, according to figures from the COVID Tracking Project.\n\nMore than half of states nationwide have positive rates above 5%, and a dozen states are above 10%.\n\nAs testing has slowed, positive rates increased over the last week in 35 states as of Friday, according to Johns Hopkins University's Coronavirus Resource Center.\n\n\"If testing is going down and positivity is going up, that is what you would expect in an uncontrolled outbreak,\" said Amesh Adalja, a senior scholar at Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security.\n\nAlthough positive rates are still too high, Adalja sees positive signs such as fewer hospitalizations and declining case counts.\n\nExperts believe several factors are leading to a testing decline in parts of the nation.\n\nA surge in testing demand in July showed more Americans sought tests than the nation's labs could process in a timely manner. Even when people got tested last month at a doctor's office, testing site or clinic, wait times ballooned - making it too late to trace contacts of an infected person.\n\nStorms temporarily closed testing centers in states such as Florida, New York and New Jersey. And people might be more relaxed after an early summer surge in the South and West relented and case counts drop.\n\nBut experts say dropping case counts can be a deceiving sign when the share of positive tests holds steady or increases.\n\nTexas Gov. Greg Abbott acknowledged this week testing had dropped and positive rates increased, but he announced more surge testing would help get the state's positive rate back down to 10%.\n\nIn Texas, the one-week average for positive rates reached 24.5% before dropping to 16% on Wednesday. The rate dropped even more, down to 12%, as of Friday, according to the Texas Department of State Health Services.\n\nThe state health department is investigating the high rate of positive tests as the number of hospitalized COVID-19 patients decreases. The lab reporting system was upgraded Aug. 1 and a hospital lab and commercial lab resolved coding errors. Fewer people also visited community testing sites, a spokeswoman said.\n\nThe state also is working to clear a backlog of 1.1 million \"pending\" tests that had incomplete paperwork or were not assigned to the patient's home county. Those cases already have been counted in the totals and would not affect positive rates, the spokeswoman said.\n\nAngela Clendenin, an epidemiologist at Texas A&M University School of Public Health, said too many Texans don't pursue testing because there's still confusion over who's eligible for testing. Other factors include a belief that things are safer after the governor ordered people wear masks, closed bars and limited restaurant seating.\n\n\"It's a false sense of security,\" she said.\n\nFatigue and skepticism also are factors, Clendenin said, especially among people whose social circles or communities have had few infections.\n\n\"If you don't know anybody who's been infected by COVID-19, why are you going to worry about it?\" Clendenin said. \"There's been a lot of skepticism about the evidence and science behind the guidance we are providing.\"\n\nAlthough Texas case counts have dropped the last week, she said the drop in testing is concerning. \"The high positivity rate is indicative of the fact all we're doing is testing symptomatic people.\"\n\nOthers cite an urban-rural divide on testing. Metro regions have abundant testing options, easy access and people more willing to get tested. But some rural resident are far more skeptical, especially if they live in a community where there are few known cases.\n\n\"There are still many parts of the country, and as you get more rural, the notion becomes stronger, they're really questioning the validity of all of this information,\" Schaffner said. They think, \"'Is this all really all just a hoax of some sort?'\"\n\nSchaffner sees the skepticism in Tennessee's rural counties where \"compliance just plummets\" on proven strategies of social distancing, mask wearing and testing. The state's testing has remained stable but the positive rate ticked up slightly in the past week to a still manageable 8%.\n\n\"If we had more testing, I think we'd find more cases, find more people who are genuinely sick and many who have only minimal symptoms, documenting that this is a virus that truly is circulating in rural communities, as all of us think it is,\" he said.",

    "US Open tennis has strict COVID protocols; one player tests positive": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "NEW YORK - In its effort to bring back Grand Slam tennis safely from its seven-month, virus-induced hiatus, the U.S. Tennis Association (USTA) has adopted strict testing and behavioral protocols that run almost the length of the runways at nearby LaGuardia Airport.\n\nEverything was going splendidly until Sunday morning, the day before America's biggest tennis tournament was set to begin, when Benoit Paire, a 31-year-old Frenchman, became the first player to test positive, according to a tournament official who spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to speak publicly on the matter.\n\nPaire, the No. 17 seed, was scheduled to begin his Open on Tuesday against Poland's Kamil Majchrzak. He will be replaced in the draw by Spain's Marcel Granollers. His result was only the second positive in over 7,000 tests that began being administered on Aug. 15; a non-player had a positive result several days after testing began.\n\nPaire played in a tuneup tournament in Flushing Meadows, the Western & Southern Open, last week, but did not appear well and retired after losing seven straight games.\n\nTournament officials were conducting contact tracing to determine whether any other players were in close proximity to Paire. The French newspaper L'Equipe reported that Paire's countrymen - Richard Gasquet, Adrian Mannarino, Gregoire Barrere and Edouard Roger-Vasselin - were asked to self-isolate in their hotel rooms after Paire's positive test.\n\nThe news was a jarring development for the USTA, which is staging the Open without fans in a modified bubble that essentially keeps players and coaches in a controlled environment for the duration of the tournament. After COVID-19 forced the postponement of the French Open and the cancellation of Wimbledon, Open organizers moved ahead cautiously, working for months on elaborate health and safety regulations and procedures that had to be approved by the New York State Department of Health.\n\nU.S. OPEN: How ballpersons will honor frontline workers\n\nOPINION: Serena is an underdog, and that could help her\n\nAsked if he were surprised at Paire's test result, Austria's Dominic Thiem, the No. 2 seed, said, \"There's so many people involved in this tournament. The possibility that somebody is going to be positive is pretty high. I just wish all the best to Benoit. Hopefully nobody else is positive, as well.\"\n\nThiem said he was completely comfortable with the protocols in place.\n\n\"I think there is no safer place in the world right now than here. Maybe you can lock yourself somewhere in a cave or something, I don't know, in the middle of the sea.\"\n\nLike every other corner of the sports world in the pandemic era, the 2020 Open bears no resemblance to its former self. Instead of 50,000 people cramming onto the grounds of the Billie Jean King National Tennis Center for Day 1 of the U.S. Open, there will be fewer than 3,000 - at the peak - none of them fans. The ranks of ballpersons has been reduced from 280 to 135. Print and photo media credentials have been cut from about 1,100 to 15.\n\nEveryone not holding a racquet will be wearing a mask and staying at least six feet apart; roving health and wellness monitors will be on the grounds to ensure compliance.\n\nEach day before entry, every person has to fill out a digital health questionnaire and have a temperature screening. All 365 players were tested upon arrival, and had to be negative to get a credential. A second test was administered 48 hours later; follow-up tests are required every four days.\n\nThe USTA has even taken the unprecedented step of making Manhattan off limits.\n\nThat's right. A world-class city is a long forehand away, and it's closed.\n\nPlayers can't stay there, dine there, or even go for a socially distanced walk in Central Park. If a player posts an Instagram photo of himself or herself at Rockefeller Center, he/she will be invited to leave. Almost every player is staying in one of two Long Island hotels that have been turned over to the USTA, and players aren't permitted to go anywhere but Flushing Meadows.\n\n\"New York State, and the residents of the state, have done a great job getting the coronavirus under control,\" said Chris Widmaier, the USTA's managing director of communications. \"We know that this event has to be buttoned up as tightly as possible.\"\n\nThe biggest single sporting event to be held in the U.S. since March, the Open has long been the brassiest and loudest stop of the tennis year, a rollicking two weeks in Queens that typically packs in heat, humidity and the occasional 2 a.m. finish in Arthur Ashe Stadium, the world's biggest tennis venue. Tournament officials' hope was that the only noise that came out of this year's tournament would involve tennis, but Paire's positive test for COVID-19 scuttled that, at least for now.\n\nThe Open health and safety plan is based on four pillars: a three-tiered personnel setup that minimizes interaction between groups; rigorous testing protocols and contact tracing capabilities; universal masking; and physical distancing. Each credential includes an RFID (radio frequency identification) code that enables health officials to trace where a person who might test positive has been, and who they might have been close to.\n\nPlayers and their immediate circle (coaches, physio, guests) are in Tier I. Media, tournament staff, officials and ballpersons comprise Tier II. Tier III includes other tournament staffers in food service, security, housekeeping, outside vendors and delivery people.\n\n\"All of these (pillars) put together decrease the likelihood that someone is going to run into someone with COVID-19 symptoms,\" Dr. Bernard Camins, the Medical Director for Infection Prevention for the Mt. Sinai Health Systems, and a member of the USTA Medical Advisory Group, told USA TODAY Sports. \"We can't guarantee it will be zero - nobody can do that - but by doing all this we can make sure even if someone tests positive, we can minimize the number of people who are exposed.\"\n\nCamins said there was no hard number for how many positives it would take to shut down the tournament; it would depend on the results of contact tracing. If there were an outbreak among men, say, in theory the women's draw could continue, but such a scenario would be most unlikely, since players are not separated by gender in their hotels, dining locations or training facilities.\n\nAs recently as three months ago, the idea of holding a major event in a city that was the global epicenter of the pandemic seemed unthinkable. But then months of sheltering in place began to pay off, and New York had a precipitous decline in COVID-19 cases. In April, the city's positive infection rates exceeded 60 percent on multiple days, and the one-day COVID-19 death total was as high as 813. At the end of last week, the positive infection rate was well under 1 percent, and there was a day with a single fatality.\n\nOn June 17, the USTA announced the Open was on, having gotten the go-ahead from the state, and officials went about implementing their plan and working with the Department of Homeland Security to make sure there were no slipups with almost 2,000 incoming flights, a number of them coming from virus hotspots.\n\n\"It was a high-wire act to figure how we could safely put on a U.S. Open, because everything was constantly changing,\" Widmaier said. \"That made it nerve-wracking at times, but it was nobody's fault. It's just what happens when you are in a terrible pandemic that the whole world is going through.\"",

    "US coronavirus data needs improvement across states, experts say": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "Ali Mokdad, an epidemiologist at the University of Washington, has been trying to make sense of this summer's COVID-19 surge. He says he can theorize only in a general way about why the virus spread and what to do about it.\n\n\"Yes, the new cases appear to be mainly young people,\" he said. \"Yes, they may be letting down their guard. Yes, it might make sense to close the bars.\"\n\nBut as a global health expert at the university's Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, he says he should be able provide much more nuanced answers.\n\n\"Why can't we figure out what's contributing to the recent spread? It is very simple,\" Mokdad said. \"No access to data.\"\n\nIn a move seen as potentially obstructing access to COVID-19 information even more, the Trump administration last month ordered hospitals to stop sending data to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and instead send it to a private data firm under contract with the Department of Health and Human Services, whose secretary reports directly to the White House.\n\nSkyrocketing cases, clashes among federal leaders and a hodgepodge of state data have left many Americans asking how the United States will get back to anything resembling normal life.\n\nThe answer is straightforward, Mokdad and other epidemiologists say: wearing masks, social distancing, more testing - and better data.\n\nUS coronavirus map: Tracking the outbreak\n\nEpidemiologists insist that standardizing the COVID-19 data states and localities publish is essential to helping people navigate their daily lives and enabling political leaders to make science-based decisions the public can support.\n\nIt's particularly critical now, they say, as parents, teachers and elected officials are deciding when to open schools and how to keep them open.\n\n\"This virus isn't disappearing,\" said Dr. William Schaffner, professor of preventive medicine and infectious diseases at Vanderbilt University's medical school. \"COVID will be here three years from now in some form. We hope we get a vaccine soon. But even when we do, people will need data to see the impact of vaccinations.\"\n\nState and local health officials say providing better data isn't so simple. Meager budgets, stodgy technology and disjointed state and local reporting systems make standardizing data an arduous undertaking.\n\n\"It's a nice idea,\" said Oscar Alleyne, chief of programs and services at the National Association of County and City Health Officials. \"But it's not the highest priority in most jurisdictions right now.\n\n\"Local health departments are focused on what's in front of them, and that's the data they need to decide how to open schools without getting caught up in a whirlwind of amplifying disease.\"\n\nStill, epidemiologists point out that every other developed country battling the virus has been able to publish the kind of data average people and scientists need to track the course of the disease each day and pivot their individual behavior and public response accordingly.\n\nThe nation's lack of federal leadership has caused it to fall behind other countries in combating the virus, said Dr. Tom Frieden, former CDC chief, at a news briefing last month.\n\nHe and other public health experts urged state and local health agencies to adopt a uniform system of reporting on testing, positive cases, hospitalizations and deaths, as well as on the effectiveness of contact tracing efforts and the percentage of people wearing masks.\n\nSeparately, researchers at Stanford University and the University of California who are trying to determine what caused California's COVID-19 surge reported last month that the state had refused to release crucial data, citing privacy concerns and workload constraints.\n\nCalifornia COVID-19 cases spiked after July 4th: Family gatherings helped the spread, experts say\n\nDetailed case and contact-tracing data from state and county health authorities, they said, could point to more effective, targeted approaches to slowing the pandemic. Without the data, the scientists said, little more can be done.\n\nFor the states' part, Janet Hamilton, executive director of the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists, said privacy protections and worries about publishing incomplete data are major concerns.\n\n\"It's a matter of trying to present data in ways that get people to make behavior changes, which usually happens when people are impacted personally or when they have local information,\" she said. \"We want to provide data as locally as possible without violating privacy rights or confusing people. But we know we have information gaps.\"\n\nFor example, she said, in some communities where very little testing is available and, therefore, very few cases are reported, people could decide that they are not at risk, when they actually are.\n\n'We're in for a bad and rocky ride': Ex-WHO doctor who helped eradicate smallpox predicts COVID-19 turmoil for years\n\nPublic health officials and advocates argued in a new report that without uniform data, the United States will continue to lag behind the rest of the world in fighting the pandemic.\n\nThe groups included Frieden's organization, Resolve to Save Lives, along with the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, the American Public Health Association, Trust for America's Health and the Association of Schools and Programs of Public Health.\n\nPeople need to know what their local health departments are doing to contain the virus and hold them accountable, said Dr. Cyrus Shahpar, who directs the epidemics prevention team at Resolve to Save Lives, an initiative of Vital Strategies, in an interview with Stateline.\n\nShahpar, who lives in California, said, \"If there's a bunch of fires outside, I want to know how many are contained. Right now, we know there are big fires everywhere. But we have no idea which ones are contained.\n\n\"We also need to compare cities and states. If I'm in New York state, I need to know which states to restrict travel from. I also need to know which states and cities are safe to visit.\"\n\nAn important piece of missing information, he said, is the lag time between collecting a test sample and getting the results. Is the delay the same in every ZIP code? Are poor neighborhoods and predominantly Black and brown neighborhoods experiencing greater testing delays? No states are providing that type of data, Shahpur said.\n\nPublic health agencies need to tell the public what the local data means, Shahpur said. Five cases could be a crisis in a tiny rural town, while 50 could be manageable in a medium-sized city. The average person doesn't know that on their own, he said.\n\nSome states and cities have developed red, orange, yellow and green alert level systems that include a list of guidance for each age and demographic group at each risk level, Shahpur said. That type of graphic presentation can help guide businesses and residents as they plan their days, he said.\n\nTo let people know how well their local health department is controlling the virus, cities and states should report the percentage of new cases arising from so-called community spread, outside of known transmission chains, said Dr. Amesh Adalja, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security.\n\n\"How many new cases were already on their radar and how many weren't? That's really important, because if too many cases have unknown sources, the virus could be spiraling out of control,\" Adalja said. \"People need to know that.\"\n\nOnly a handful of states do that.\n\nOregon's health department measures the success of contact tracing based on the percentage of new cases that are tied to a known source. Every day, the state posts those percentages on its COVID-19 dashboard.\n\nFor most of July, the daily number of new cases rose in Oregon, as did the percentage of cases with no known source. As of July 28, more than 73% of new cases had no known source. The goal, according to the state, is that no more than 30% of new cases are without a known source.\n\nVirginia also tracks contact tracing by publishing the percentage of new cases and contacts the health department is able to reach within 24 hours of receiving test results. As of last week, the state reported reaching 75% of all new cases and 85% of their contacts the same day.\n\nInvestigation: How a mysterious company tied to 'Titanic' villain landed government coronavirus contracts\n\n\"Far too often states provide numbers to show their success, when it really is not success at all,\" Dr. Georges Benjamin, executive director of the American Public Health Association, said at the Resolve to Save Lives news briefing.\n\nEpidemiologists say many state and local websites provide numbers that can be misconstrued or that require people to do their own math to put them in context.\n\nFor example, daily test totals mean nothing, Adalja said, unless the percentage of positive tests is provided along with the date the samples were taken. Those numbers should be parsed at the county or ZIP code level and presented as a number per capita so they can be compared among states, counties and cities. And while daily case counts may be useful, the trend is more revealing, he said.\n\nThe daily number of hospital admissions is important data for epidemiologists but is not helpful for average people, Adalja said. They need to know how many COVID-19 patients are in their local hospital on any given day and whether the hospital is near capacity. They also need to know how many health care workers have tested positive for the virus and how many people are coming into emergency departments with flu-like symptoms.\n\nAccording to Frieden's organization, states are providing only 40% of the data needed to fight the pandemic, with some states reporting less relevant data than others.\n\nNo state is reporting data on testing delays, and few are reporting on contact tracing. Frieden said the nonprofit is working with states to help them provide more data, much of which he said they already have.\n\n\"It's no surprise we haven't been able to get this virus under control,\" said Dr. Ali Khan, dean of the University of Nebraska Medical Center's public health school and a former CDC official. \"States don't have timely, complete, relevant or transparent data. And they lack the political will to develop it. That needs to change.\"\n\nRetirement: $100,000 is not enough for retirement, a sum many seniors can't reach\n\n'It is what it is': Trump says of rising coronavirus deaths as he insists outbreak is 'under control'",

        "body": "ST. GEORGE, Utah - Cedar High School athletic director Danny Lewis was prepared.\n\nHe had everything ready for the Reds' season opener against Spanish Fork last Friday: his mask, a thermometer to scan foreheads and the required questions he had to ask before letting anyone on the sidelines. He asked if they had a cough, headache, sore throat or if they lived with someone who had tested positive for COVID-19 in the past 14 days.\n\nThis is how high school football is in Utah, for now.\n\nTemperature checks, questioning, masks and distancing are all part of the Friday night lights scene in the Beehive State.\n\nThis makes Utah's situation unique. It is the first state playing high school football in a pandemic-stricken America where 15 states -- California, Colorado, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Mexico, North Carolina, Oregon, Vermont, Virginia and Washington -- have decided not to play this fall, according to the National Federation of State High School Associations.\n\nMany football coaches and athletic directors believe playing a football season during a pandemic is possible, especially after actually playing that first game.\n\nMARK YOUR CALENDAR: SEC announces its full 2020 college football schedule\n\nFOOTBALL GOES ON: North Carolina football unaffected by school's move to online-only classes\n\nOthers don't harbor the same confidence, which is easy to understand after seeing the number of people who did not socially distance and did not wear masks as if it were a typical Friday night. The only piece missing was the pep band. Cheerleaders and dance teams led halftime entertainment.\n\nSocial distancing and masks were strongly encouraged by administrators, the Utah High School Activities Association and local school districts. When it comes to testing for the virus itself, local school districts and the UHSAA say they can't require an athlete to get tested.\n\nSome players simply felt content they were able to get one game in.\n\n\"I know a lot of other states are canceling football or postponing it, and are probably going to cancel it after they postpone,\" Crimson Cliffs running back Creed Leonard said. \"I'm just so grateful that we get this opportunity to come out and play one game for senior year during these times.\"\n\nUtah has had more than 46,800 confirmed cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, and 364 deaths, according to the state's department of health. At the peak, between July 17-19, Utah averaged more than 700 cases of COVID-19 daily, which led Gov. Gary Herbert to challenge Utahns to get to a rolling average of under 500 cases per day by Aug. 1. He upped that goal Aug. 10, challenging his state to get to under 400 cases by Sept. 1.\n\nAs of Monday, the seven-day average of new cases in Utah was 358 cases a day. More than a week earlier, the seven-day rolling average was 443 cases.\n\nWith the state showing a downward trend in new cases since July 24, Utah high schools began football practice in pods of no more than 50 players. Players practiced with their own towels, clothes, water bottles and equipment, were required to shower at home and launder their own uniforms.\n\nFor about a month, teams practiced with precautions. Some schools had players test positive, like Bingham High, which canceled its Aug. 14 season opener against Weber when three players tested positive two days before the game.\n\nThursday's game between Herriman and Davis, high schools located outside Salt Lake City, was the first game played in the state. Herriman has dealt with the difficulty of managing COVID-19 after a staff member tested positive in June. Four more players also had COVID-19, the Salt Lake Tribune reported, although all recovered and were cleared to play Thursday.\n\nHerriman assistant coach Ryan Jensen wrote a letter to the UHSAA board of trustees on Aug. 11 expressing concerns about high schools having the resources to keep athletes safe. He noted that universities have more resources to deal with COVID, but many have decided not to play this fall.\n\n\"They have money, they have doctors, they have the real health boards, they have the resources -- all the things you unfortunately do not have and they still see it as a huge liability,\" Jensen wrote, according to the Tribune. Jensen decided not to coach this season.\n\nStill, most of Utah's teams made it to Aug. 14. In southern Utah, Cedar's 28-21 double overtime win over Spanish Fork was the apex of the action, where players and coaches alike were elated to finally get on the field.\n\n\"We're very thankful we got to play this one tonight,\" Cedar coach Josh Bennett said. \"Hopefully we just keep going in a positive direction.\"\n\nIt wasn't simple for southern Utah, either. The five-county region of southwest Utah ended the month of April with 99 confirmed cases of COVID-19. By June that number had jumped to 1,519 cases. The startling trend led coaches like Crimson Cliffs' Jaron Tate to adopt the idea of playing every game as if it could be the team's last.\n\n\"With the quarantining and everything, and the cases bumped up here, everyone was starting to go out and practices were getting shut down,\" Leonard said. \"Coach Tate told us, 'Play like it's your last game.'\"\n\nDixie High athletic director Mike Bair was clear in his directive during game week: Attendees at Walt Brooks Stadium were required to wear a mask.\n\nAs one of four home games in southern Utah, Dixie did all it could to encourage safety among its spectators. Attendants at the four entrances were checking entrants for masks, but it was difficult to keep track of those wearing masks during games.\n\nThe UHSAA also encouraged social distancing and masks in its return-to-play guidelines, as well as on social media with a #MaskUpUtah campaign but could only do so much.\n\nThe stands were filled with fans and spectators that disregarded the guidelines. Few wore masks and many ignored social distancing of staying 6 feet apart.\n\nIt was a difficult reality to juxtapose some fans throwing caution to the wind with teams who were hoping to do whatever they could to play on Friday.\n\n\"All summer long we tried to get our kids just to realize, we're going to move on as normal and this is our normal,\" Hurricane football coach Skyler Miller said. \"For a moment, it hit me earlier in the day that, wow, we're one of the few teams that's playing football tonight.\"\n\nMiller's was one of the southern Utah teams that played a road game Friday, traveling about two hours north and heeding precautions to make sure his team stayed healthy throughout the Tigers' trip to Richfield. Miller's moment of realization on Friday helped him think of the athletes that weren't able to play football this fall.\n\n\"In my mind, it was just a somber moment of reflection and to be able to have a dedicated moment of our game, to be able to fight and play for the kids who haven't had a chance throughout the nation.\"\n\nAround the sidelines all over southern Utah, players wore gaiters in place of a face mask. This was part of the protocols instructed by the UHSAA.\n\nThe UHSAA also encourages players to get tested if they experience symptoms, but, much like the Washington County School District in which nine high schools are located in southern Utah, they cannot require athletes to get tested.\n\nWashington County School District doesn't administer tests, either. For an athlete to get tested, the parent needs to make that decision and then take their child to a local testing center or hospital.\n\n\"We cannot require student-athletes to get tested, just like we cannot require a drug test of anybody,\" Washington County School District spokesperson Steve Dunham said. \"Any student that is exhibiting symptoms or has a temperature is sent home.\"\n\nStill, coaches like Crimson Cliffs' Tate understand the precautions in place are necessary if they want to continue playing this fall.\n\n\"If we don't take those precautions and all of the sudden we do get shut down, then we're going to have to take ownership,\" Tate said. \"If we do what we're supposed to do and we wear our masks, sanitize and temperature check and then still get shut down, then at least we know we did our part.\"",

        "body": "Vanderbilt paused football activities Friday after an undisclosed number of players tested positive for COVID-19.\n\nThe Commodores had completed four practices to open the preseason this week. Practice was canceled Friday morning, as was a Zoom call media availability with coach Derek Mason and defensive coordinator Ted Roof.\n\nVanderbilt spokesperson Alan George declined to provide the number of positive tests or whether they included players, coaches or support staff.\n\nA statement released by the university late Friday said it was a \"small number of positive COVID-19 test results within our program.\"\n\n\"The results were determined through our ongoing testing procedures, which are among a number of prevention protocols we have in place to protect the health and safety of our student-athletes and our larger community,\" the statement continued.\n\n\"The student-athletes that tested positive for COVID-19 have been placed in isolation per the university's protocols. Everyone is working closely with our Public Health Command Center and other health officials to identify close contacts and ensure that they are not interacting with others on campus or in the Nashville community.\"\n\nVanderbilt is scheduled to play at No. 13 Texas A&M on Sept. 26 in the season-opening game. The team has not announced any revisions to its practice schedule.\n\nSEC guidelines require players and staff to be tested once per week during preseason practice and three times during game weeks, including a rapid diagnostic test close to the game.\n\nAdditionally, anyone who tests positive for COVID-19 and recovers will not be required to test again for 90 days, which is consistent with the Centers for Disease Control guidelines. One exception is that a player showing COVID-19 symptoms during those 90 days may require retesting.\n\nOpinion: Protesting parents don't get it.

Senior linebacker Dimitri Moore, an NFL draft prospect and the team's top tackler, was the most notable. He joined placekicker Oren Milstein and offensive linemen Cole Clemens, Jonathan Stewart and Bryce Bailey.\n\nOn Monday, Mason said \"several\" players opted out, but he declined to provide a specific number or the players' names before the five already reported.

    "When should I get my flu shot this year? Everything to know about flu season during the coronavirus pandemic": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "It's hard to know for sure how COVID-19 will mix with this year's flu season: Will mask wearing and social distancing contain flu transmission as it's meant to do with SARS-CoV-2? Or will both viruses simultaneously wreak havoc on the nation as some schools reopen for in-person learning?\n\n\"This fall, nothing can be more important than to try to increase the American public's decision to embrace the flu vaccine with confidence,\" Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Robert R. Redfield said Thursday speaking to the editor of JAMA. \"This is a critical year for us to try to take flu as much off the table as we can.\"\n\nHere are what doctors say you should know about the flu vaccine as we approach the start of this year's season.\n\nDr. Susan Rehm, vice chair at the Cleveland Clinic's Department of Infectious Diseases, said it's important for patients to get the influenza vaccine as soon as possible.\n\nCVS stores already have the flu vaccine in stock, and it became available Monday at Walgreens.\n\n\"I plan to get my flu shot as soon as the vaccines are available,\" Rehm said. \"My understanding is that they should be available in late August, early September nationwide.\"\n\nOther doctors, however, are recommending patients get their flu shot in late September or early October so protection can last throughout the flu season, which typically ends around March or April. The vaccine lasts about sixmonths.\n\nThe CDC recommends people get a flu vaccine no later than the end of October - because it takes a few weeks for the vaccine to become fully protective - but encourages people to get vaccinated later rather than not at all.\n\nHealthy people can get their flu vaccine as soon as it's available, but experts recommend older people and those who are immunocompromised wait until mid-fall to get their shots so it lasts throughout the entire flu season.\n\nPeople over the age of 65 should get Fluzone High-Dose vaccine because it contains four times the amount of antigen than the standard dose vaccine and provides better protection against flu viruses. However, doctors recommend getting the standard dose if the high dose is not available.\n\nThe CDC recommends everyone six months and older get a flu vaccine every year. State officials announced Wednesday the flu vaccine is required this year for all Massachusetts school students enrolled in childcare, preschool, K-12 and post-secondary institutions.\n\n\"It is more important now than ever to get a flu vaccine because flu symptoms are very similar to those of COVID-19 and preventing the flu will save lives and preserve health care resources,\" said Dr. Larry Madoff, medical director of the Bureau of Infectious Disease and Laboratory Sciences at the Massachusetts Department of Public Health.\n\nAccording to the CDC, hundreds of millions of Americans have safely received flu vaccine over the past 50 years. Common side effects for the flu vaccine include soreness at the injection spot, headache, fever, nausea and muscle aches.\n\nDr. William Schaffner, professor of infectious diseases at the Vanderbilt Medical Center in Nashville, Tennessee, emphasizes these symptoms are not the flu as the vaccine cannot and does not cause influenza.\n\n\"That's just your body working on the vaccine and your immune response responding to the vaccine,\" he said. \"That's a small price to pay to keep you out of the emergency room. Believe me.\"\n\nSome studies have found a small association of the flu vaccine with Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome (GBS), but Dr. Len Horovitz, a pulmonary specialist at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City, says there's a one in a million chance of that happening.\n\nNot only is the flu vaccine safe, but the pharmacies, doctor's offices and hospitals administering it are also safe.\n\nHorovitz and Schaffner said hospitals are taking all the necessary precautions to make sure patients are protected against COVID-19. Some hospitals send staff out to patients' cars for inoculation while others allow patients to bypass the waiting room. All offices require masks, social distancing and are routinely disinfected.\n\n\"Call your health care provider to make sure you can get in and out quickly,\" Schaffner advises. \"It's safe to get the flu vaccine and very important.\"\n\nWhile experts speculate any vaccine could hypothetically provide some protection against a virus, there's no data that says the flu vaccine can protect against the coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, which causes COVID-19.\n\n\"We don't want to confuse people of that ... because there's simply no data,\" Schaffner said. \"Flu vaccine prevents flu; we're working on a coronavirus vaccine. They're separate.\"\n\n\"Even before COVID, what we say about the flu is that it's predictably unpredictable,\" Rehm said. \"There are some years that it's a light year and some years that it's horrible.\"\n\nFlu experts say they sometimes look at Australia's flu season to get a sense of the strain and how it spreads as winter in the Southern Hemisphere started a few months ago.\n\nAccording to the country's Department of Health surveillance report, influenza has virtually disappeared reporting only 85 cases in the last two weeks of June - compared to more than 20,000 confirmed cases that time last year.\n\n\"Australia has had a modest season, but they were very good at implementing COVID containment measures and, of course, we're not,\" Schaffner said. \"So, we're anticipating that we're going to have a flu season that's substantial.\"\n\nThe CDC says there are two types of vaccines available for the 2020-2021 season. One vaccine contains two flu A strains and one flu B strain, called a trivalent vaccine, while the other contains those three strains plus an additional flu B strain, called quadrivalent. Most trivalent vaccines are high-dose.\n\nWhile some doctors may have both vaccines, others may only have one depending on the hospital's supply chain. Dr. Natasha Bhuyan, a practicing family physician in Phoenix, Arizona, says don't delay. Patients should get whatever vaccine is available to them.\n\n\"Vaccines are a selfless act, they're protecting yourself and your friends through herd immunity,\" she said. \"Any vaccine that you can get access to, you can get.\"\n\nHorovitz said vaccine production and distribution has been on schedule this year, despite international focus on coronavirus vaccine development. He's already received his shipment to the hospital and plans to begin administering the flu vaccine with four strains closer to the start of the season.\n\n\"I don't think anything suffered because something else was being developed,\" he said. \"(The flu vaccine) has been pretty well established for the last 20 to 30 years.\"\n\nProducers are boosting supplies of the flu vaccine this year to meet what they expect will be higher demand. Vaccine maker Sanofi announced Monday it will produce 15% more vaccine than in a normal year.\n\nRedfield told JAMA the CDC arranged for an additional 9.3 million doses of low-cost flu vaccine for uninsured adults this year, up from 500,000. The agency also is expanding plans to reach out to minority communities.\n\nAfter the 2009 swine flu pandemic, several studies showed the nasal spray flu vaccine was less effective against H1N1 viruses leading the CDC and the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices to recommend against it.\n\nHowever, since the 2017-2018 season, ACIP and the CDC voted to resume the recommendation for its use after the manufacturer used new H1N1 vaccine viruses in production.\n\nWhile these agencies and advisory committees don't recommend one vaccine over the other, some pediatricians prefer the nasal spray arguing that it's easier to administer to children than a shot.\n\nOther doctors prefer the flu shot as some of the nasal spray side effects mimic respiratory symptoms and include wheezing, coughing, and a runny nose, according to the CDC. Horovitz said anything that presents cold symptoms should probably be avoided, especially among children who are known vectors of respiratory diseases.\n\n\"Giving them something that gives them cold (symptoms) for two or three days may expel more virus if they're asymptomatic with COVID,\" he said.",

    "Will my child be sent home for cough, runny nose? What to know about day care guidelines during COVID-19": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "But with flu, cold and allergy season almost here, pediatricians and child care experts say \"other signs of illness\" are almost inevitable at these facilities.\n\n\"We have families where parents are working outside the home or have a real need to focus on kids in school virtually,\" said Dr. Colleen Kraft, a pediatrician at Children's Hospital Los Angeles.\n\nSo, what are parents supposed to do?\n\nA runny nose and cough are common symptoms of many childhood illnesses and seasonal allergies.\n\nBut Kraft says context is key. If a child comes from a household where family members have been infected by the virus, that runny nose could be a symptom of COVID-19. This is why most child care providers will survey the child or parent when they arrive at the facility.\n\n\"We like to do health assessments when children are getting to the door,\" said Amber Horton, the regional manager for Learning Care Group's Great Lakes region. \"Do all the health questionnaires with the parents right there on the spot.\"\n\nHorton says the teacher and staff will monitor a child throughout the day if symptoms develop throughout the day. If they're concerned, they'll separate the child.\n\nWhile child care providers say they won't request a parent pick up their child in the middle of the day, they will notify the parent of the child's symptoms and advise they see a pediatrician or primary care doctor.\n\nAs parents, teachers and doctors navigate child care during a pandemic, Dr. Laura Jana, a pediatrician and previous Primrose Schools Franchise owner, says good communication is essential.\n\n\"That's what puts us in the position to allow child care to continue safely and realistically, and be prepared for whatever this virus throws at us,\" she said.\n\nSarah Redgrave, vice president of Center Operations for KinderCare Education, said the organization has always had a policy of notifying families if there's an illness in their child's classroom, however, Learning Care Group says a runny nose, cough or fever alone is not something they would typically communicate to all families.\n\n\"Children with a runny nose should be able to stay particularly if they're over two years of age and if their masks are worn,\" Kraft said. Some providers don't require children under age 5 to wear masks.\n\nIf the child is old enough to wipe their nose, then they will be instructed to wash their hands right after, a spokesperson with Learning Care Group said. If they're not old enough to wipe their own nose, staff will step in wearing gloves and wash their hands afterward.\n\nMost child care providers are doing temperature checks and will not allow a child to enter the facility with a temperature above 100.4 degrees, as recommended by the CDC and most local health departments.\n\nOther facilities have a lower threshold and send children home with a temperature above 99.7 degrees.\n\nMost providers don't require a child to take a COVID-19 test as testing is still not widely available in some parts of the country. However, they do require that children be fever-free without medication for 24 to 48 hours, or more depending on local health department guidelines.\n\nThese fever policies were in place in most day care centers prior to COVID-19, however, they've heightened procedures to include anyone entering the building including staff, children, families and vendors. Staff conducting these temperature checks must wash their hands, put on gloves and have a cloth face covering.\n\nAccording to Learning Care Group, health checks are also conducted throughout the day to ensure the child's wellbeing.\n\nHorton and Redgrave also refer to local health department guidelines if a child tests positive for COVID-19. Most health departments follow CDC guidelines that say a person should be quarantined for at least 14 days and symptom-free.\n\nSome providers temporarily close the center for up to 72 hours to clean and disinfect the building. Almost all programs say they notify parents when there's a positive test in the school but they exclude identifying information to maintain the child's privacy.\n\n\"The emphasis continues to be transparency and sharing and partnering with parents,\" Jana said.\n\nAlmost all child care providers say all adults in the facilities will wear masks throughout the day.\n\nDepending on age, some children will be asked to wear masks, especially in common areas. In some cases, parents can write a letter saying their child will not wear a mask if they have prior issues with respiratory health, or if they're not able to put on masks by themselves.\n\nFrequent hand-washing has always been enforced in child care programs even before the coronavirus pandemic. However, social distancing has forced facilities to become more creative, especially with younger children.\n\nSome classrooms are grouped into pods, teachers are assigned to a specific room and are not allowed to mix with other classrooms. Many child care programs have also established staggered pick-up and drop-off times, socially distanced nap times and scheduling playtimes with enough time to disinfect outdoor play structures.\n\nWhile these policies are in place for the moment, pediatricians and child care programs say it's important parents stay flexible and understand that these guidelines might change as scientists learn more about the virus.\n\n\"It's a difficult decision for a lot of parents,\" said Dr. Dane Snyder, a primary care physician at Nationwide Children's Hospital. \"My best advice is to learn what's going on locally, be ready to be flexible and just ask a lot of questions.\"",

        "body": "OSHKOSH, Wisc. - An annual event on Lake Butte des Morts in Wisconsin is under scrutiny after photos and videos surfaced over the weekend on social media showing large crowds during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nSand Bar Bash, an annual event that benefits Old Glory Honor Flight, was scheduled for Saturday. Photos and videos appeared to show a mass gathering with little social distancing.\n\nWinnebago County health officials urged anyone who attended to be on watch for COVID symptoms and to limit contact with others for 14 days.\n\nThe Oshkosh Northwestern, part of the USA TODAY Network, cannot independently verify that all images were from 2020, though time stamps on multiple platforms indicate they were taken Saturday, the day of the event, which was promoted on Facebook and was listed on the Oshkosh Convention and Visitors Bureau website.\n\nA statewide mask mandate that went into effect Saturday applies only indoors.\n\nBy Monday morning, photos and videos from the event's official Facebook page, along with the page itself and a related Facebook event, had been removed from the social media platform.\n\nA separate Facebook event organized by \"USA Top Event HD\" includes a livestream video with the title \"Sand Bar Bash llc 2020 Live 2020.\" However, The Northwestern was unable to access the video.\n\nSome travelers still take trips abroad during COVID-19 pandemic: 'I feel safer exiting America'\n\nEvent organizers and the Winnebago County Sheriff's Office didn't respond to interview requests Monday. Late last week, Sheriff John Matz said he would not enforce the state's mask mandate but would forward any reports of violations to the Health Department.\n\nWinnebago County Health Director Doug Gieryn said in a statement, \"In regards to reports of a Sandbar Bash on Lake Butte des Morts this weekend, the Winnebago County Health Department encourages anyone who has attended a gathering or event with people from outside of their household, where actions were not taken to prevent the spread of COVID-19, to monitor for symptoms and limit contact with others for 14 days from the event.\"\n\nAsymptomatic cases account for 40% of COVID-19 cases, according to the Centers for Disease Control, which makes wearing masks and social distancing even more crucial, Gieryn said.\n\nDid coronavirus cancel your travel plans? You can still enjoy your 2020 vacation days",

        "body": "Jason Gonzales logged into Skype, awaiting an outcome he feared.\n\nPresident of Poway Pop Warner Football & Cheer (PPW), Gonzales was hosting a virtual meeting with the rest of the association's board June 30. He allowed each of the 10 other board members five minutes to share doubts, concerns, data, anecdotes - anything to assert their stance.\n\nAs the novel coronavirus continued to decimate communities across the United States, the board was debating whether it should approve a 2020 season in the fall. At the end of the meeting, they would vote.\n\nMORE: In COVID-19 hot spots like Florida and Texas, youth sports have patchwork response to rising cases\n\nFall without football: How America would look without its favorite sport\n\nPerched twenty-some miles northeast of San Diego, Poway had been seeing confirmed COVID-19 cases swell throughout the region. By the start of June, San Diego County reported 7,674 confirmed infections, according to data compiled by the county. By the end of the month, that number almost doubled to 14,623.\n\nTwo hours north, in Los Angeles County, it was much worse. Total confirmed cases spiked to 110,544 on June 30, after opening the month at 58,656.\n\nFor Gonzales, a father of four whose two youngest boys play for Poway, the decision weighed heavily.\n\nThe final tally: six to cancel, two against, two abstentions.\n\nGonzales, through the dejection of a fall without football, felt something unexpected: relief.\n\n\"What if Poway Pop Warner would've started and we would've gotten unlucky?\" Gonzales told USA TODAY Sports. \"What if we got one kid sick, cheerleader or football player? And that poor child passed away? I wouldn't be able to forgive myself. For us, as a board, it just became too problematic. There were way more problems than there were benefits.\"\n\nPPW is far from alone. It was the first squad in the 22-team West Coast Conference to cancel. As of Thursday evening, six more have followed and several others are yet to make a final determination in a pattern sweeping across the U.S.\n\nThe American Youth Football League, which has 15 teams across South Florida, voted unanimously July 15 to cancel. In the letter announcing the decision, the AYFL board wrote it \"could not provide a safe football experience.\"\n\nWestern North Carolina Youth Football and Cheerleading, which has 18 teams in five counties, also canceled. There are dozens more.\n\nBut several associations and leagues are planning their seasons as scheduled, raising questions about the morality, ethics and safety of playing in a pandemic.\n\n\"You see videos of hospitals at capacity,\" Gonzales continued. \"I don't want to add to that. I don't want to see one of our little boys or one of our little girls or someone I've come to know in this community, hooked up to tubes. I love this game. It has given me so much in my life. But it's not worth a little kid, worth a parent getting sick.\"\n\nPop Warner Little Scholars (PWLS), the national organization of which Poway is an affiliate, is the largest youth football, cheer and dance program in the U.S. with around 325,000 participants aged 5 to 16. Jon Butler, executive director of PWLS, said he expects participation to be about 15% of typical years and stressed that \"the most important thing\" for teams who play is to observe local public health measures.\n\nThrough guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, public health officials and the Pop Warner Medical Advisory Committee, PWLS crafted its return to play guidelines.\n\nThey mandate that any state, county, or city ordinances \"take precedence if they are more restrictive.\" PWLS has opted not to make any national cancellations and is leaving decisions up to local chapters. Rather, its guidelines provide the structure if teams deem it safe and reasonable to play.\n\n\"Our position was if you can have a season and you choose to, we'll support you,\" Butler told USA TODAY Sports.\n\nButler said PWLS has encouraged associations to explore alternatives, such as flag football or 7-on-7 passing leagues, activities USA Football has deemed to have lower risk levels. On the cheerleading side, PWLS also developed a no-mount division that eliminates physical contact.\n\n\"We said, 'Look, anything you can do is better than doing nothing,' \" Butler said. \"We want to give them the opportunity to get the kids out there safely and we're being very flexible because in so many areas in life, we have to be when we're in a pandemic.\"\n\nThe CDC, though, advises against all competitions in its Considerations for Youth Sports. The guidance lists a spectrum of activities and the risk they carry, ranging from lowest (drills or conditioning at home) to highest (full competition between teams from different geographic areas).\n\nParents seem to agree. According to a survey published in June by USA Football, 61% of youth sports parents with children aged 5-14 felt that tackle football is high risk, while 30% said they thought flag football was high risk. Twenty percent of parents also indicated they wouldn't feel comfortable returning to youth sports until 2021.\n\nFor reference, Gonzales estimated that on any given game day between two Pop Warner teams, about 180 people are on the field, not counting spectators.\n\nDr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told CNN in June that \"unless players are essentially in a bubble ... and tested nearly every day ... it would be very hard to see how football is able to be played this fall.\"\n\nPWLS teams won't have capacity to perform COVID-19 tests, but will check temperatures. Among the other measures, coaches are required to wear masks and observe social distancing and balls and equipment must be sanitized.\n\nGonzales told any parents frustrated by Poway's decision that he would support them to join nearby associations that were moving forward with their seasons.\n\nHeather Speer is the mother of three boys, two of whom played for Poway. On Gonzales' advice, she took her sons to Scripps Ranch Pop Warner, about five miles to the south, to initiate their registration. Three weeks after PPW canceled, Scripps Ranch did, too.\n\nHer 16-year-old son is participating in outdoor weight training, through his school, for his wrestling and football teams. But her 10-year-old doesn't have such an outlet.\n\n\"There's nothing for him right now,\" Speer said. \"He's the one that I'm more concerned about. He's frustrated a lot more these days. He's cooped up. He doesn't have any release. He doesn't have his friends to hear their complaints and commiserate with.\n\n\"His temper is a little bit quicker than it normally is. I would love for him to be exercising under somebody else's voice, other than my own.\"\n\nSpeer won't pursue joining any other associations because she doesn't feel it's responsible to mix with communities farther away, potentially creating unnecessary exposures. She would have preferred, rather, that associations that have canceled their seasons to have explored simply holding practices and to have listened more closely to concerns of the parents.\n\n\"I'm not ignoring social responsibility, I just feel that there's a lot of freedoms that were taken away without us having a choice,\" Speer said. \"I don't think this is good for anybody's well-being in the slightest. These guys need something more for their emotional well-being. I just wonder, what is this going to look like for them in the future? What will this mean? That has my concern.\"\n\nPWLS mandates all participants - players (through their parents), coaches, volunteers and league officials - to complete and sign a waiver provided on its website. The organization also provides instructions for teams on how to administer and enforce it.\n\nThe waiver asks about potential exposures, symptoms and outlines temperature check requirements. It also requires participants to inform local health officials if they develop symptoms, come in contact with someone who has tested positive or become infected.\n\n\"Further, attending Pop Warner activity could increase the risk of contracting COVID-19,\" the waiver states.\n\nThe participant also voluntarily agrees \"not to sue\" PWLS or any of its affiliates, but the waiver might not provide the legal protection that it intends, experts say.\n\nAccording to N. Jeremi Duru, who teaches sports law, civil procedure and employment discrimination at American University, a participant still holds the right to sue. PWLS would likely appeal to the presiding judge with a motion to dismiss, Duru said, citing the signed waiver. It would be up to the judge to determine the validity of the waiver as a legal document.\n\n\"I don't think there is a legal officer out there who believes that this waiver, or a waiver like it, is an ironclad guarantee that you're not going to be successfully sued,\" Duru told USA TODAY Sports.\n\nDuru compared it to the \"notoriously weak\" fine print on the back of baseball tickets that \"courts often don't enforce\" and that declares an assumption of risk of getting hit by a foul ball.\n\n\"The real challenge to being successful is not getting over the waiver, it's establishing causation,\" Duru said of proving that a participant became infected at a PWLS event. \"That's the bigger mountain to climb.\"\n\nFor that reason, Duru said the \"chances of winning are slim,\" before noting that philosophical discrepancies among judges and jurisdictions further complicate any potential cases.\n\nDr. Susan Mullane, associate professor and undergraduate program director for sport administration at the University of Miami, acknowledged that waivers can protect against frivolous law suits. She said, however, that \"it becomes very unethical\" when they seek to eliminate certain essential rights.\n\n\"When we say for other people that it's OK to be negligent, sports are based on responsibility and safety, and kids depend on other people to be responsible,\" Mullane said. \"You kind of negate that responsibility.\"\n\nSetting aside the legal and ethical implications, a certain burden falls on parents, who must ultimately weigh the health benefits of sports after months of quarantine against health risks to children and their families by potentially increasing their exposure to the virus.\n\nMullane suggested creating virtual training sessions instead. In them, coaches could offer instruction and ask children to work on specific drills to improve their performance once play resumes. That would empower children, Mullane said, and would allow parents to engage in non-academic activities, a departure from in-home learning that has consumed families across the country.\n\n\"We need to, with all of these discussions with sports, go back to the original reasons and principles of sport,\" Mullane said. \"They're all the same throughout youth, high school, college, professional. There are supposed to be elements of fun and responsibility and accountability and, clearly, safety. In order to be ethical, we have to adhere to values that are important. \"",
