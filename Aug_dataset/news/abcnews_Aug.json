    "'Rock star' doctor tackles virus on California-Mexico border": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "CALEXICO, Calif. -- Dr. Tien Vo's last stop of the night is the home of a 35-year-old woman who has diabetes, asthma, rheumatoid arthritis and, now, the coronavirus. The virus killed her father six days earlier. The oldest of her four children, a 15-year-old boy, learned he had it that morning.\n\nTilted back in a reclining chair at her bedside using an oxygen device, Cynthia Reyes tells the doctor she can no longer stand up herself.\n\n\"I can't catch my breath. It takes a long time to get to the restroom. I feel like I'm going to faint,\" she says anxiously.\n\nVo, who exchanges text messages with Reyes every few hours and speaks with her almost daily, listens and nods.\n\n\"I've tried my best already, but sometimes, you know, we can't do enough,\" Vo says after leaving.\n\nReyes lives in California's often-forgotten Imperial County, a farming region along the Mexican border. Until recently, it had the state's highest coronavirus infection rate and its two hospitals were overwhelmed. The county is largely Latino and low income, groups that have suffered disproportionately from the virus.\n\nVo is \"a rock star\" for bringing medical services, says Alex Cardenas, a former mayor of El Centro, the county seat. The doctor's two clinics have done more than 27,000 coronavirus tests since March 23, with a positive rate between 25% and 30%.\n\nVo and his wife, a nurse, emigrated from Vietnam as teenagers. They drifted west from New York to settle 10 years ago in Imperial County, which produces a major share of vegetables in U.S. supermarkets during the winter.\n\nVo, 43, says he stayed because people are friendly and appreciative. He sees happiness in their eyes when they greet him.\n\n\"They really need a doctor here,\" he says from the front seat of a company van between house calls. \"They're not very hard to please. They chat with me. They text me every day.\"\n\nTo date, Imperial County has had more than 5,200 cases for every 100,000 people, nearly triple that of hard-hit Los Angeles County, the nation's largest county. Nearly 20% of Imperial patients have tested positive, compared with 6.3% statewide.\n\nDeaths have reached 220 in a county with about 180,000 residents. San Francisco has five times the population but two-thirds fewer deaths.\n\nEl Centro Regional Medical Center, which briefly stopped taking patients in May, is \"bursting at the seams,\" says Dr. Adolphe Edward, chief executive officer. Tents set up in a parking lot serve COVID-19 patients, one an emergency room and one an intensive care unit.\n\nA lack of beds has forced the transfer of more than 600 coronavirus patients to hospitals elsewhere in California and brought an influx of state and federal aid, including a spillover 80-bed hospital in a community college gymnasium and additional intensive-care beds.\n\nThere is no single reason for Imperial County's plight, but inequalities loom large. It often has the highest unemployment rate among the nation's 389 metropolitan areas. The jobless rate was 27.3% in June.\n\nImperial is 85% percent Latino, with elevated rates of diabetes and obesity. Wind-blown dust contributes to asthma. Its 21% poverty rate is among California's highest. Crowded, multigeneration households spread the virus quickly.\n\nMexicali, Mexico, an industrial city of 1 million people, brings additional strain when people cross the border for medical care. Many are U.S. citizens and legal residents.\n\nImperial County is surrounded on three sides in the U.S. by vast, uninhabited desert and Mexicali's urban sprawl to the south. Settlers diverted Colorado River water with a dike that breached in 1905, causing a two-year flood. Large farms have been passed through generations of families of white European descent.\n\nColorado River water gravitates through hundreds of canals along highways and dirt roads to the farms, getting saltier before it empties into the Salton Sea, California's largest lake. It was once a desert playground for speedboat racers and Hollywood entertainers but now is evaporating as less water seeps down from the river.\n\nThe lake's shores occasionally are blanketed with the carcasses of oxygen-starved tilapia, while dust from newly exposed lakebed is kicked up by desert winds, helping explain why air quality in the area violates federal standards.\n\nDulce Garcia, who was born in Mexico and settled with her family in California's Central Valley when she was 12, moved to Mexicali 10 years ago after her husband was deported. She walks across the U.S. border to her job in Calexico to work as a medical assistant at a El Centro Regional Medical Center clinic. She is one of the hospital's 60 employees who live in Mexicali.\n\nGarcia, 38, rents a room in a Calexico house with other women, letting her register her U.S.-born sons, ages 17 and 15, in the city's public schools. She sleeps some nights on the U.S. side but usually returns to her apartment in Mexicali. Her husband picks her up in their 2001 Chevrolet Monte Carlo for a 10-minute drive to their leafy neighborhood with a large park for evening strolls.\n\nGarcia, a naturalized U.S. citizen, is uncomfortable crossing the border daily to be around COVID-19 patients but, like many others, sees no alternative. A U.S. salary goes much further with Mexico's cost of living and makes up for the scant wages her husband's construction job pays in Mexicali.\n\n\"Everybody's scared of the pandemic, but we have to cross,\" Garcia said after pulling out her travel documents for U.S. border inspectors at the end of a hallway, where a guitarist sang Mexican ballads for morning commuters. \"We have to survive.\"\n\nDuring harvests, Garcia is part of a second wave of daily commuters, made up of workers with later hours and students.\n\nThousands of farmworkers who live in Mexicali begin lining up shortly after midnight at the border, filling streets of tiny downtown Calexico until buses take them to fields to pick lettuce, spinach, broccoli, onions, cauliflower, carrots, cabbage and celery. In spring, they harvest cantaloupe, honeydew and watermelon.\n\nVo's clinic is just outside the sleepy downtown shopping area, which gives way to wide streets and large strip malls. President Donald Trump visited the city of 40,000 people last year to see his new border wall of 30-foot (9-meter) steel poles coated in black paint.\n\nCars filled Vo's parking lot when he began drive-through virus testing in March. He soon began taking walk-ins, with lines wrapping around his building.\n\nVo met his wife when she was in college in New York City and he was doing his residency there. They moved to upstate New York, Phoenix, Yuma, Arizona, and finally Imperial County, where he says they have about 40,000 patients. They also own a 31-bed nursing home.\n\nPart of the appeal is proximity to family in Southern California's Orange County, a magnet for Vietnamese immigrants where they were raised as teenagers in the 1990s. Their parents still live there. The couple have two sons, 9 and 10.\n\nThe indefatigable doctor is often on the move in blue scrubs, even after his clinic closes at 6 p.m. weekdays. He eases up slightly on Sundays, when he shuts down at 2 p.m.\n\nCardenas, the former El Centro mayor and lifelong resident, is Vo's driver on a recent night of meal deliveries for people who are quarantined and don't have anyone to shop for them.\n\nTheir first stop is the mobile home of a 62-year-old man who lives alone with diabetes and asthma. Next is the modest, two-story house of a 55-year-old diabetic, one of seven people infected with the virus in a household of 12 people spanning three generations.\n\nJudith Aguirre, 53, believes her husband got the virus at his dialysis center because so many other patients got it. She, a pregnant daughter and four of eight grandchildren got it next in their five-bedroom house.\n\n\"Doctor, we really appreciate what you do for the valley,\" Aguirre said after Vo delivered boxes of barbecue beef, macaroni and cheese, bread and coleslaw. \"I've heard that you call in the middle of the night. You do house calls.\"\n\nAt Vo's last stop, Reyes talks about her 69-year-old father, a \"very strong man\" who died three weeks after being diagnosed with the virus.\n\n\"All of a sudden, he went to the hospital and he couldn't breathe,\" she said.\n\nA week later later, Reyes' symptoms had improved, but she was still on the oxygen device and a long way from a full recovery.",

    "15 years after Hurricane Katrina, New Orleans battles COVID-19": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "Erica Elaine Harris lives a quiet life in San Francisco as an in-demand nanny with an infectious love for children.\n\nShe rarely reflects on the fact she survived the deadliest natural disaster in United States history.\n\nSome 15 years ago, many New Orleanians braced for what they believed to be just another hurricane. Some, in classic New Orleans fashion, even attended hurricane parties. No forecasts, no predictions could have prepared the city for what struck that Monday.\n\nThe storm seemed manageable at first -- until the flood.\n\nAround 9 a.m., a levee was breached in the Lower Ninth Ward, with more breaks elsewhere. Hundreds of people were trapped on rooftops or in attics as floodwaters rushed through low-lying areas of the city.\n\nThe Ninth Ward was devastated. Harris, then 10, ventured through the flood with her mother. They caught a ride on a boat that eventually sank, then walked through the water until finding a bridge slightly higher than the submerged suburbs. They did their best to sleep.\n\nThe next day, they made it to New Orleans' beloved Superdome, which hundreds of other newly homeless neighbors were calling home. But it was far from being a safe haven. At one point, ambulances halted evacuations of people after gunshots were fired. One ambulance service told ABC News at the time it would have to cut back rescue efforts if security didn't improve.\n\n\"They have us living like pigs,\" a refugee told ABC News' Bob Woodruff, pointing to the trash and urine on the turf where some were expected to sleep.\n\nWoodruff turned to a girl and asked her if she had received food or water.\n\n\"I am not drinking that water, that water is hot,\" Harris responded. \"And people are selling ice, they aren't just giving it away.\"\n\nHarris detailed her experience in the Superdome, but despite the situation, Harris saw the world differently.\n\n\"I was a really strange child in the sense that I thought this was kind of cool -- I'm a part of history,\" she recalled. \"I knew this was big and monumental and that if I wanted to I could write stories about it one day, so that was my attitude.\"\n\nThis week, Woodruff once again talked to Harris -- and her attitude hasn't changed.\n\n\"It changed the trajectory of my life,\" Harris told Woodruff. \"I think [Katrina] contributed to me getting an education that I probably wouldn't have gotten had we not gotten this house in the suburbs of Cypress, Texas. I went to a great school.\"\n\nAfter she was evacuated to Texas, Harris devoted much of her time to helping others across the globe who'd lost their homes. In 2014, she visited Haiti, helping refugees who also had been hit by a merciless natural disaster.\n\n\"My time in Haiti was definitely one of those defining-life experiences -- in a way that also shapes who you are and how you view the world,\" Harris said. \"I went to Greece in 2017 -- that was also a mission trip where we got to work with refugees. We just wanted to try to love the people there and help them because they were transitioning from some pretty rough circumstances.\"\n\nIn photos from her trips, Harris often is seen holding refugee children who've somehow managed a smile despite the dire circumstances.\n\n\"I love kids wherever I go -- all kids are just beautiful and wonderful,\" Harris said. \"If I'm in any country and there's a baby, I'm probably going end up holding the baby just cause I love babies.\"\n\nStill, Harris attributes her doing good deeds more to her faith than to surviving Katrina.\n\n\"If me being a good person is attributed to anything, it is going to be attributed to god,\" she said.\n\nAccording to the National Hurricane Center, 1,833 fatalities are directly or indirectly related to Hurricane Katrina, with most of those -- 1,577 -- in Louisiana.\n\n\"We were told, 'Y'all need to get upstairs,'\" recalled Pennie Favalora, an ER nurse at Tulane Medical Center, holding back tears as she remembered that Monday evening. \"We ended up going upstairs, and then that's when the information came out that the levees had breached.\"\n\nThe Tulane Medical Center emergency room flooded that night. Health care workers aided patients from the upper levels, and were the last to be evacuated from the city.\n\n\"But the city came back, banded together and made itself better than it was pre-Katrina,\" Favalora said.\n\nBut now a new crisis has befallen New Orleans: COVID-19.\n\n\"I know several people in my family who have gotten it,\" Harris told Woodruff. \"My dad had very minimal symptoms, whereas my stepmom had every single symptom you heard about.\"\n\nThe city of New Orleans has had over 11,200 total COVID-19 cases, peaking in April with a seven-day moving average of 440 new cases per day. As of Aug. 23, that figure had dropped to 28 new daily cases, but that's after new daily cases in July still topped 100 on several days.\n\nHarris said her family members all survived the virus. According to data through Monday, New Orleans had reported 570 coronavirus-related deaths -- 425 of which were Black people.\n\n\"I don't even know how to explain it here -- it was terrible, every patient that was coming in was positive for COVID,\" said Favalora, recalling the Tulane emergency room as the city's cases spiked. \"I think I was looked upon for guidance ... because a lot of the younger nurses knew I had been around for Katrina.\"\n\nFavalora said she and her staff thought back to the last time so many were needed to do so much.\n\n\"We can take care of patients no matter what, in the middle of a flood or in the middle of COVID, whatever is thrown at us,\" she told ABC News.\n\nShe and her colleagues received food donations to help buoy their spirits.\n\nWoodruff asked Harris what lessons from Katrina could be useful in dealing with the this latest tragedy. With most schools in San Francisco using distance learning in the fall, she said she's planning to offer free educational support to children and families in need.\n\n\"I was initially impacted financially and lost work,\" she said. \"But that is why I think, 'OK, how can I be proactive in helping people who have been even more affected than I am?'\"",

    "1st Mediterranean cruise to set sail after virus tests": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "ROME -- Cruise ship passengers were having their temperatures checked and taking COVID-19 tests Sunday so they could set sail on what is being billed as the first Mediterranean cruise after Italy's pandemic lockdown.\n\nThe cruise ship company MSC has made the procedures, for crew as well as passengers, part of its new health and safety protocols. The MSC Grandiosa, which was christened last year, was scheduled to depart from the northern Italian port of Genoa on Sunday evening for a seven-night cruise in the western Mediterranean.\n\nAny one testing positive, or with a fever, or having other COVID-19 symptoms will be denied boarding, the company said. Guest must wear face masks in elevators and other areas where social distancing is not possible. The crew spent time in quarantine before the start of the cruise.\n\nEarlier this month, the Italian government gave its approval for cruise ships to once again depart from Italy's ports. But cruise ships are being limited to 70% capacity.\n\nMSC declined to say how many passengers were sailing on this cruise.\n\nAmong the port calls for the Grandiosa, MSC's flagship, are Naples, Palermo, Sicily and Valletta, Malta.\n\nMalta is one of four Mediterranean countries that Italy now requires travelers arriving from to have COVID-19 tests.\n\nFor now, MSC is limiting its guests to those who are residents of Europe's 26-nation Schengen visa free travel zone.\n\nMSC said every guest and crew member on board will be given a wristband that \"facilitates contactless transactions around the ship as well as providing contact and proximity tracing.\"\n\nCruise ships and the business they bring to many Italian cities during port excursions make up an important segment of Italy's vital tourism industry. An estimated 12 million cruise ship passengers arrived or departed from Italian ports last year or made port calls in Italy during their trip, according to industry figures.\n\nFollow AP's pandemic coverage at http://apnews.com/VirusOutbreak and https://apnews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak",

        "authors": [],
        "body": "ELOY, Ariz. -- Immigration and Customs Enforcement has reported 233 more confirmed cases of COVID-19 at one of its facilities in Arizona.\n\nThe infections are at the La Palma Correctional Center in Eloy, which has so far seen a total of 356 cases. No other facility reported even close to as many cases as La Palma did on Friday, with most detention centers seeing single-digit increases.\n\nIt's unclear how many people are detained at La Palma, but overall there are more than 21,000 people being held in ICE custody on civil immigration violations nationwide.\n\nICE spokeswoman Yasmeen Pitts O'Keefe said in a statement that the agency recently expanded virus testing at La Palma, testing 1,000 detainees. Most were asymptomatic.\n\n\"U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is firmly committed to the health, welfare and safety of detainees in our care, and this is one of the agency's highest priorities,\" Pitts O'Keefe wrote.\n\nThe Florence Immigrant & Refugee Rights Project, an advocacy group that provides legal services, said the high number of infections underscores the need to release immigrants from detention.\n\nThe organization says its clients at La Palma report that large sections of the detention center are locked down and that they're being fed cold, boxed meals three times a day.\n\nAdvocacy groups across the country have filed several lawsuits seeking to release vulnerable populations during the pandemic, and ICE has on some occasions released detainees who have health conditions that make them susceptible to getting seriously sick from the coronavirus.\n\nThe agency reported 850 new positive cases nationwide on Friday for a total of 5,300 overall cases since the pandemic began.\n\nFor most people, COVID-19 causes mild or moderate symptoms that clear up in a few weeks. But for some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia and death.",

    "A Black participant in Moderna's COVID-19 vaccination trial: Trust the vaccine": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "Sophia Upshaw was one of two Black participants in Moderna's first 45-person COVID-19 vaccination trial.\n\nNow, Upshaw is sharing her experience and has a message for the Black community: The vaccine is safe.\n\n\"I was scared at first, for my health [and] for exposing myself to something that hasn't been tested in humans before,\" she said. \"I was technically patient No. 10.\"\n\nAs her hometown of Atlanta was being hit hard by the virus, Upshaw decided to participate in Moderna's first vaccination trial at Emory University on March 16. As a Ph.D. student of biomedical engineering there, she was excited to be a part of scientific history.\n\n\"This vaccine is the first one ever made with mRNA, or messenger RNA, and it's the first time it's been put in humans ever, in the history of the world,\" she said. \"I was geeking out about it.\"\n\nModerna, an American pharmaceutical company, is one of the front-runners in the race for a COVID-19 vaccine. The current phase 3 trial is slated to enroll 30,000 people; however, only about 19% of Moderna's study is comprised of Black or Hispanic volunteers. Pfizer, another company with a late-stage trial, said roughly 19% of its volunteers are Black or Hispanic and about 4% are Asian.\n\nIt's not enough, according to health officials.\n\n\"I would like to see a percent enrollment commensurate with the percent represented in society,\" Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's top infectious disease doctor, told ABC News. About 40% of the nation is non-white, according to the most recent census data.\n\n\"Optimally, although it might be difficult to attain, I would like to see a number somewhat greater than this and approaching the percentage of disease,\" said Fauci, who explained that minority groups struck by the pandemic should ideally be overrepresented in vaccine trials, to ensure one works in those who may need it the most.\n\nAs a scientist, Upshaw knew the importance of vaccines to create preventative health measures, but as a Black woman, it held personal importance. Black Americans continue to fight two pandemics -- racism and COVID-19 -- but the race toward a vaccine connects them. While COVID-19 decimates the Black community, the nation's history of non-consensual medical experimentation on Black Americans has instilled wide mistrust of the vaccine.\n\nUpshaw is keenly aware of this conundrum. She hopes her positive experience in Moderna's study will offer the Black community a relatable perspective, potentially encouraging others to volunteer for a trial.\n\n\"Honestly, they have a valid reason not to trust the medical community because of its horrible past like the Tuskegee trials, HeLa cells,\" said Upshaw, referring to two infamous case studies of unethical scientific experiments in which researchers did not obtain consent from Black patients.\n\nThese historical injustices inspired massive reform in the medical industry today, including implementing safety regulations and mandatory ethical reviews of scientific studies.\n\nStill, said Upshaw, \"it's going to take a long time to repair that damaged trust between the two communities. This is an opportunity to repair that damage and build up some trust. I'm hoping my story will inspire Black people to take the vaccine when it comes out.\"\n\nDr. Asefa Mekonnen, an investigator for Meridian Clinical Research, has been encouraging minorities to trust and participate in Moderna's phase 3 vaccination trials administered by his hospital.\n\n\"People always mention the historical past missteps in science, but today we're in a different situation,\" he said. \"There is a huge knowledge gap in terms of what vaccine trials are, what are their purposes, and how they are conducted.\"\n\nInitially, Upshaw admitted she was scared and her family thought she was \"insane\" for participating in the trial. But her fears subsided as she only experienced common vaccine symptoms, including muscle soreness, fatigue and a slight fever that lasted two to three days. The entire process took about two hours of her day and she had follow-up doctor appointments to monitor her response. Since then, she's tested negative for coronavirus and developed COVID-19 antibodies.\n\nAs a scientist herself, Upshaw is dismayed to see the way Black celebrities, like musician Trey Songz, have used their influence to discourage their followers from taking the vaccine. For Upshaw, Songz's Instagram post was the last straw that inspired her to speak out about her experience.\n\n\"It's discouraging to see a lot of Black people who look like me pre-declare that they won't get the vaccine when it comes out,\" she said. \"It discourages me because our people are being disproportionately affected by it.\"\n\nSongz did not respond to ABC News' request for comment.\n\nBut her message is simple: Vaccines are safe. She hopes people that look like her will trust her experiences and the science behind the COVID-19 vaccine.\n\n\"As an influencer, what you say influences how people conduct themselves and what they do,\" she said. \"I'm not a celebrity, but I hope people can take my story into account. Listen to voices of reason, not voices of dissent.\"\n\nUpshaw rejects common perceptions that young people do not need to get vaccinated because they may be at a lower risk of being infected with the virus. The World Health Organization has warned that young people are emerging as a main spreader of the coronavirus.\n\n\"I've had people ask me, 'Why would they test this on a 22-year-old?' I think a huge purpose of the testing on younger people first was to confirm the safety even more before exposing older people to it. So that's why they included 55 to 70-year-olds afterward,\" she said.\n\nShe went on, \"The fact is that every other young person is not completely immune.

Between April and the start of August, more than 2,000 infected patients gave birth there, with 120 newborns testing positive.\n\nOne in four people in Peru's capital of 10 million people could be infected with the coronavirus, according to a study published by health authorities in July, with more than 483,000 confirmed infected across the country of 32 million and more than 21,000 dead.\n\nDespite wearing personal protective equipment and taking other measures to avoid infection, 400 of the 2,000 workers in the institute have also been infected, said its director, Enrique Guevara.\n\nThe institute has barred partners or other relatives from attending births, and pregnant women are moved through the hospital in wheeled beds protected by transparent covers to block the virus from spreading.\n\nMart\u00ednez returned to Peru in November after five years working in an electronics store in Chile.\n\nAlvarez became pregnant, and after the coronavirus hit Peru, both went to work for a friend sewing face masks.\n\nMart\u00ednez became ill and died in June. Alvarez took a test that came back positive, but never experienced symptoms.\n\nShe felt contractions on July 29, and rushed to the hospital with a set of blue clothing for the boy that doctors had said was coming. To her surprise, she gave birth to a girl.\n\nDays after giving birth, as she recovered in her isolated bed, she said she had still not decided what to name her daughter.\n\n\"What I know,'' she said.

    "Africa passes 1M confirmed virus cases; true number far more": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "JOHANNESBURG -- Africa's confirmed coronavirus cases have surpassed 1 million, but global health experts say the true toll is likely several times higher, reflecting the gaping lack of testing for the continent's 1.3 billion people.\n\nWhile experts say infection tolls in richer nations can be significant undercounts, large numbers of undetected cases are a greater danger for Africa, with many of the world's weakest health systems.\n\nThe World Health Organization calls the milestone a \"pivotal point\" for Africa as infections in several countries are surging. The virus has spread beyond major cities \"into distant hinterlands\" where few health resources exist and reaching care could take days.\n\nImmediately knowing they were at a disadvantage, African nations banded together early in the pandemic to pursue badly needed testing and medical supplies and advocate for equitable access to any successful vaccine. Swift border closures delayed the virus' spread.\n\nBut Africa's most developed country, South Africa, has strained to cope as hospital beds fill up and confirmed cases are over a half-million, ranking fifth in the world. The country has Africa's most extensive testing and data collection, and yet a South African Medical Research Council report last week showed many COVID-19 deaths were going uncounted. Other deaths were attributed to other diseases as people avoid health centers and resources are diverted to the pandemic.\n\nIt's all a warning for Africa's other 53 countries of what might lie ahead. While dire early predictions for the pandemic have not played out, \"we think it's going to be here at a slow burn,\" the WHO's Africa chief, Matshidiso Moeti, said Thursday.\n\nJust two African countries at the start of the pandemic were equipped to test for the virus. Now virtually all have basic capacity, but supplies are often scarce. Some countries have a single testing machine. Some conduct fewer than 500 tests per million people, while richer countries overseas conduct hundreds of thousands. Samples can take days to reach labs. Even in South Africa, turnaround times for many test results have been a week or longer.\n\n\"We are fighting this disease in the dark,\" International Rescue Committee expert Stacey Mearns said. In addition, Africa has just 1,500 epidemiologists, a deficit of about 4,500.\n\nAfrican nations overall have conducted just 8.8 million tests since the pandemic began, well below the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's goal of 13 million per month. Countries would love to increase testing if only supplies weren't being snapped up by richer ones elsewhere.\n\nAfrica CDC director John Nkengasong said estimating the true number of cases on the continent is \"very tricky.\" Some 70% of infections are asymptomatic, he has said. Africa's young population also might be a factor. Without a dramatic increase in testing, \"there's much we don't know.\"\n\nBut some experts are making their best guesses.\n\nAfrica likely has at least 5 million infections, said Ridhwaan Suliman, a senior researcher at South Africa's Council for Scientific and Industrial Research. He believes the true number in South Africa alone is at least 3 million. The country has conducted far more tests than any other in Africa -- more than 3 million -- but in recent days about 25% have come back positive. Because of shortages, South Africa largely limits testing to health workers and those showing symptoms.\n\nExperts see South Africa as an indication of what's to come elsewhere.\n\nSema Sgaier, an assistant professor of global health at Harvard and director of the Surgo Foundation, thinks the number of infections across Africa could be more than 9 million. The U.S.-based Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation puts the number at more than 8 million. And Resolve to Save Lives, led by Tom Frieden, former director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, estimates it could be 14 million.\n\nFor Resolve to Save Lives senior vice president Amanda McClelland, the more worrying number is not the overall cases but the health workers infected across Africa -- now about 35,000. That affects care for everyone on a continent whose shortage of workers has been called catastrophic.\n\nReflecting the pandemic's diverse nature across Africa, just five countries account for 75% of confirmed cases: South Africa, Egypt, Nigeria, Ghana and Algeria. Nigeria alone could have had close to 1 million cases by now if Africa's most populous country hadn't acted quickly, the Africa CDC's Nkengasong said.\n\nStill, with insufficient testing, people live with the fear that loved ones may have had the virus without knowing for sure.\n\nIn Burkina Faso, Yaya Ouedraogo lost his uncle and cousin in April. Both were in their 70s with a history of high blood pressure and diabetes, and both had complained of shortness of breath, fever and body pain, he said.\n\n\"They had all the symptoms of coronavirus, but in certain areas no one was investigating it and they didn't get tested,\" he said.\n\nThe WHO Africa chief has said officials don't think the continent is seeing a \"silent huge epidemic,\" with thousands dying undetected, but she acknowledged under-reporting of cases.\n\n\"What we'd like to see -- to be able to be really confident -- is higher testing rates,\" Moeti told reporters last week, and she criticized the \"very distorted global market\" in which richer countries have the bulk of testing materials while poorer ones scrape by on just hundreds of tests a day.\n\nMoeti also worries about a related danger for which even less data exists: the number of deaths from diseases such as malaria, HIV and tuberculosis as resources are diverted to COVID-19.\n\nWhatever Africa's real coronavirus toll, one South African church has quietly been marking the country's \"known\" number of deaths by tying white ribbons to its fence. The project's founders say each ribbon really stands for multiple people.\n\nAlready, the Rev. Gavin Lock wonders about what to do when the length of fence runs out. Maybe they'll change the ribbons' color to represent 10 people, or 50.\n\nAssociated Press writer Sam Mednick in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso, contributed to this report.\n\nFollow AP pandemic coverage at http://apnews.com/VirusOutbreak and https://apnews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak",

        "body": "MONTGOMERY, Ala. -- The University of Alabama reported Friday that an additional 481 students have tested positive for COVID-19, bringing the total to more than 1,000 infections since students returned to campus for the fall.\n\nThe University of Alabama System released new numbers on its dashboard of cases for all three campuses. The additional 481 cases on the Tuscaloosa campus were reported between Aug. 25 and Aug. 27. The university system said no students are hospitalized.\n\n\"We are closely monitoring our data daily, and we will continue to adjust operations as the situation warrants,\" said UA System Chancellor Finis St. John in a statement accompanying the release of the numbers. He said testing for the virus was a \"key pillar\" of the university's health and safety plan.\n\nSt. John said every student on the three campuses has the option of moving to fully online instruction at any time, remaining either on campus or returning home to continue their course work.\n\nThe university has not announced official fall enrollment figures. Kellee Reinhart, a spokeswoman for the university system, said the enrollment will be upwards of 30,000, which would equate to infections being reported in about 3.3 percent of all students.\n\nThe quick rise in COVID-19 cases on campus prompted action from city and university officials to try to limit student gatherings and off-campus socializing.\n\nThe university last week announced a 14-day moratorium on all in-person student events outside classroom instruction. Social gatherings are prohibited on and off campus and the common areas of dormitories and fraternity and sorority houses are closed, according to the new guidelines. Visitors are not allowed in dormitories or sorority and fraternity houses.\n\nOn Monday, the mayor of Tuscaloosa ordered bars closed for the next two weeks. Maddox said an unchecked spread of the virus threatens both the health care system and the local economy if students are sent home for the semester to do remote learning.\n\n\"The truth is that fall in Tuscaloosa is in serious jeopardy,\" Tuscaloosa Mayor Walt Maddox said earlier in the week.\n\nThe university system said in a news release that because it takes several days after exposure for an individual to test positive, the benefits of the bar closing measure and other compliance strategies \"will not be reflected in testing data for several more days.\"\n\nSt. John thanked Maddox for taking that action.\n\n\"We remain concerned that off-campus transmission is our greatest risk, which is why we asked Mayor Maddox to consider that action. We thank him for making that difficult decision to protect our campus community and Tuscaloosa.\"\n\nThe Tuscaloosa campus has accounted for the bulk of student cases in the three-campus university system. Since Aug. 19, there have been 10 student cases at the University of Alabama at Birmingham and 10 student cases at the University of Alabama at Huntsville.\n\nWhile most people who contract the coronavirus recover after suffering only mild to moderate symptoms, it can be deadly for older patients and those with other health problems.\n\nFollow AP coverage of the outbreak at https://apnews.com/VirusOutbreak and https://apnews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak.",

        "body": "COPENHAGEN, Denmark -- A cruise ship with 123 passengers on board and a crew of 85 docked Wednesday in the Norwegian harbor of Bodoe but no one could disembark after a former passenger from Denmark tested positive for the coronavirus upon returning home.\n\n\"We take the situation very seriously,\" Mayor Ida Pinneroed told Norwegian broadcaster NRK, adding that authorities were in contact with the Norwegian Institute of Public Health on whether the remaining passengers should be tested. The crew will be tested.\n\nIn a statement, ship owner SeaDream Yacht Club said \"we sincerely hope that there is no COVID-19 on board, and we are not aware of any other guests or crew who are infected or have any symptoms, but we are taking all necessary precautions.\"\n\nThe ship owner said the former passenger on Tuesday was found to be positive for the virus during a routine check upon arrival in Denmark. The person had no symptoms of COVID-19 during the voyage and traveled home from Tromsoe on Aug. 2 as planned.\n\nMeanwhile, the number of people on another Norwegian cruise ship, the MS Roald Amundsen, who have tested positive for the virus has reached 44, authorities said. It's not clear how that outbreak began.\n\nFollowing that outbreak, the ship's owner halted all cruise trips Monday and Norway closed its ports to cruise ships for two weeks.\n\nThe Norwegian Institute of Public Health late Tuesday said 35 crew members and nine passengers tested positive. All passengers were registered as living in Norway.\n\nThe Hurtigruten cruise line often acts like a local ferry, traveling from port to port along Norway's west coast. Some disembarking passengers may have spread the virus to local communities.",

        "body": "The Power Five conference commissioners met Sunday to discuss mounting concern about whether a college football season can be played in a pandemic, and players took to social media to urge leaders to let them play.\n\nBig 12 Commissioner Bob Bowlsby said no decisions on the season has been made, but conceded the outlook has not improved.\n\n\"Are we in a better place today than two weeks, ago?\" he said. \"No, we're not.\"\n\nBowlsby cited \"growing evidence and the growing pool of data around myocarditis.\"\n\nMyocarditis is inflammation of the heart and it has been found in some COVID-19 patients. There is concern it could be a long-term complication of contracting the virus even in young, healthy people, a group that has usually avoided severe cardiovascular symptoms.\n\nAlso Sunday night, the Big Ten's university presidents and chancellors were having a previously unscheduled meeting, a person with knowledge of the meeting told The Associated Press. The person spoke on condition of anonymity because the meeting was not announced by the conference.\n\nThe final call on whether major college football will played this season rests in the hands of the university presidents who oversee the largest conferences.\n\nAll this activity comes a day after the Mid-American Conference became the first among 10 leagues that play at the highest tier of Division I college football to cancel fall sports because of concerns about keeping athletes from contracting and spreading COVID-19.\n\nThe MAC's decision came less than a month before the first games are scheduled to be played and raised questions if other conferences might follow.\n\nAlso on Saturday, the Big Ten slowed its ramp up to the season, announcing its teams would not be permitted to start full contact practices until further notice. The Big Ten season is scheduled to start Labor Day weekend.\n\nMeanwhile, college football players took to social media Sunday to push for the season to go on, led by Clemson quarterback Trevor Lawrence with a series of tweets.\n\n\"People are at just as much, if not more risk, if we don't play,\" Lawrence tweeted. \"Players will all be sent home to their own communities where social distancing is highly unlikely and medical care and expenses will be placed on the families if they were to contract covid19.\"\n\nPenn State tight end Pat Freiermuth had a similar message.\n\n\"Since day one coming back to campus the Penn State Football staff and medical experts have put our health and safety first, above anything else,\" he tweeted. \"The guidelines put into place keep us safe while playing the game we love. We are ready to play and we want to play.\"\n\nOther players tweeted with the hashtag #WeWantToPlay.\n\nThe parents of Ohio State football players weighed in, too, posting a letter saying they were confident in the university's plan to keep their sons safe.\n\n\"We believe that this age group represents some of the healthiest individuals, while we recognize the risk cannot be eliminated, we believe the risk is minimal and the season can safely and responsibly occur,\" wrote the Football Parents Association at Ohio State.\n\nNotre Dame athletic director Jack Swarbrick said he has heard the same from Fighting Irish football players. Notre Dame has had only two COVID-19 cases since it began testing athletes.\n\n\"I've been around our guys and they thinks it's safe and they want to try and play,\" Swarbrick said. \"If we change course, we better be able to articulate the reason for doing so to our student-athletes. They are going to want to know why.\"\n\nFollow Ralph D.

        "body": "MELBOURNE, Australia -- The Australian state of Victoria recorded 466 new cases of COVID-19 and 12 deaths, including another man in his 30s. The figures were released as the city of Melbourne remained in lockdown and under an overnight curfew.\n\nVictoria Premier Daniel Andrews said that six of the deaths were connected to outbreaks at aged care facilities.\n\nOn Friday, when the state reported 450 new cases and 11 deaths, the chief health officer said the coronavirus infection rate in the hard-hit state had been \"relatively flat\" in the past week. That was down from a record 725 infections reported a week earlier\n\nThe deaths announced Saturday took the state's toll to 193 and the figure for COVID-19 deaths in Australia to 278.\n\nMeanwhile, Queensland state's border with New South Wales has officially closed with road access blocked to everyone except essential workers and locals living along the interstate boundary. Police reported that nearly 150 people had been turned away in the early hours of the shutdown.\n\nQueensland Chief Health Officer Jeannette Young declared New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory, which contains the national capital Canberra, coronavirus hot spots on Saturday as the southern border closed for the second time since the coronavirus crisis began.\n\nThe Queensland government will review the border closure at the end of August. It has had few new COVID-19 cases in the past month.\n\nIn other developments in the Asia-Pacific region:\n\n-- China has reported 31 new cases of COVID-19 in the latest 24-hour period, mainly in the far west Xinjiang region where an outbreak has infected about 750 people. The National Health Commission said Saturday that 25 new cases had been confirmed in Xinjiang. The other six were people who had arrived from outside mainland China. China largely stopped the domestic spread of the disease in March, but it has had several local outbreaks since then. The current one in Xinjiang, centered on the city of Urumqi, is the largest to date. The latest confirmed cases brought China's cumulative total to 84,596 since the pandemic began. Of those, 4,634 have died. China's case count does not include people who test positive but show no symptoms.\n\nFollow AP's pandemic coverage at http://apnews.com/VirusOutbreak and https://apnews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak",

Fatalities reached 321 after five more deaths overnight.\n\nThe Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Saturday that 249 of the new cases came from the densely populated Seoul metropolitan area, where about half of the country's 51 million people live. Health workers have struggled to track infections linked to churches, restaurants, schools and apartment buildings.\n\nThe country has added 4,630 cases over the last 16 days, raising fears about overwhelming hospitals.\n\nFor eight days starting Sunday, restaurants will provide only deliveries and takeouts after 9 p.m. Franchised coffee shops like Starbucks will sell only takeout drinks and food while gyms and after-school academies will be shut to slow the viral spread.\n\nIn other developments in the Asia-Pacific region:\n\n-- The Australian state of Victoria has reported 18 more COVID-19 deaths and 94 new cases -- the first time in almost two months that new infections have dropped below 100. The deaths take the state toll to 514 and the Australian COVID-19 death total to 601. Since Monday there have been no more than 150 new daily cases in Victoria, adding to speculation about an easing of lockdown restrictions across Melbourne, which include a daily 8 p.m. to 5 a.m. curfew. But state Premier Daniel Andrews says it is too soon to dramatically relax the rules. \"It will have to be gradual and steady because we've all got to be really careful to make sure nothing we do makes it more likely that we find ourselves back here at exactly this place,\" Andrews said. \"We want to defeat the second wave ... that means we can avoid a third wave.\"\n\n-- China's government on Saturday reported nine new coronavirus cases in the previous 24 hours, all in patients who are believed to have been infected abroad. The National Health Commission has tallied 85,022 cases since the start of the pandemic and 4,634 deaths. China also recorded 10 new cases of people who tested positive but have no COVID-19 symptoms.

        "body": "TOKYO -- A governor in central Japan announced a state of emergency Thursday due to rising virus cases and asked businesses and people to curb their activities, especially during an upcoming holiday.\n\nAichi prefecture has been seeing more than 100 new infections reported daily since mid-July after an extended period of zero new daily cases. The prefecture includes the major city of Nagoya and the headquarters of Toyota Motor Corp., Japan's top automaker.\n\nGov. Hideaki Ohmura told reporters businesses are being asked to close altogether or close early, and people are being asked to stay home at night, to prevent infections from spreading.\n\nThe requests continue through Aug. 24, a period that coincides with Japanese Obon holidays, when schools and many companies close.\n\n\"Please avoid non-essential activity during the Obon holidays,\" Ohmura said, asking people not to dine out in big crowds or go out partying. \"The situation we are in is very serious.\"\n\nAbout 70% of the recent cases were people in their 30s, and most were showing no or mild symptoms, but Ohmura said worries were growing about more vulnerable people getting sick.\n\nJapan has not had a lockdown. The voluntary emergency measures put in place in April, asking for social distancing to be used and businesses to close, were gradually lifted.\n\nThe national government's actions have been called inadequate, pushing economic growth at the risk of human life, such as the \"GoTo\" campaign, which encourages domestic travel with government-backed discounts.\n\nLast week, the southwestern island prefecture of Okinawa also declared its own local emergency. Other regional governments may take similar action.\n\nJapan has so far nearly 42,700 coronavirus cases and about 1,000 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University tally based on official figures.\n\nIn other developments in the Asia-Pacific region:\n\n-- The leader of Australia's hot spot Victoria urged residents not to panic-buy as he announced reductions in meat productions. The state capital Melbourne began its first full day of tough lockdown restrictions on Thursday as Victoria posted 471 new virus infections and eight deaths. Premier Daniel Andrews said beef, lamb and pork production will be reduced by one third from late Friday because of the virus transmission risks in abattoirs and meat processing plants. Poultry production will be reduced by 20%. \"All of these measures are designed to drive down to the lowest numbers of workers we can practically get to without at the same time delivering a shortage of products,\" Andrews said. Andrews said there was no need for shoppers to stockpile. \"You may not necessarily be able to get exactly the cut of meat that you want, but you will get what you need and you will get all the products that are, basically, fundamentally important to you,\" he added.\n\n-- China's biggest recent outbreak of coronavirus has grown slightly. More than 600 people have developed COVID-19 in the far northwestern region of Xinjiang, with 27 new cases reported Thursday in its capital and largest city, Urumqi. Another three cases were reported in the northeastern port city of Dalian, where a smaller outbreak has been traced to a seafood market, and seven cases were reported among Chinese travelers arriving from overseas for a total of 37 over the previous 24 hours. Hong Kong reported 85 new virus cases and one additional death. The origin of 33 of the cases remains unknown, according to the city's Center for Health Protection. Hong Kong has recorded 43 deaths from the virus among more than 3,700 cases.",

They say the government should instead use its financial resources to improve the compensation of trainees and encourage them to move to areas outside Seoul where health professionals are more needed.\n\nSouth Korea's Centers for Diseases Control and Prevention reported 320 new cases of COVID-19, including 237 from the Seoul region, which has been the center of a viral resurgence in recent weeks. Health workers have struggled to stem transmissions linked to churches, schools, restaurants and door-to-door salespeople.\n\nIn other developments in the Asia-Pacific region:\n\n-- China has suspended a flight from Abu Dhabi to Shanghai for a week after five passengers on board tested positive for the coronavirus. Etihad flight EY862 was put on hold from Tuesday, the Civil Aviation Administration of China said. For the 10th consecutive day, China has reported only imported cases, with another 15 added on Wednesday. China currently has 347 people in treatment for COVID-19, while another 365 people are being monitored in isolation for having tested positive for the virus without showing symptoms. The country has reported 4,634 deaths among 84,996 cases of COVID-19 since the virus was first detected in the central Chinese city of Wuhan late last year.\n\n-- Australia's hard-hit Victoria state on Wednesday recorded one of its deadliest days of the pandemic despite new COVID-19 infections continuing to trend down. The 24 fatalities in the latest 24-hour period is the largest death toll since Aug. 17. Victoria's Health Department reported 149 new cases on Wednesday following 148 infections on Tuesday. Wednesday's count brought the weekly average to 175 new cases a day, down from 279 in the previous week.\n\nFollow AP's pandemic coverage at http://apnews.com/VirusOutbreak and https://apnews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak",

        "body": "MELBOURNE, Australia -- The premier of Australia's Victoria state says more than 2,700 active cases have no known source and remain the primary concern of health authorities.\n\nVictoria on Sunday saw a welcome drop in its new COVID-19 cases with 394 but a record 17 deaths, including two people in their 50s. It took the hard-hit state's toll to 210 and the Australian total of deaths to 295.\n\nVictoria Premier Daniel Andrews said confirmed cases also include almost 1,000 health care workers.\n\nThe city of Melbourne has been under tough restrictions since a week ago, including an overnight curfew and mandatory wearing of masks, but won't see the results of their efforts for another one to two weeks.\n\nAlmost 270 Victorian residents have been fined over the past 24 hours for breaching the restrictions, including a man helping a friend to move a television 27 kilometers (17 miles) across the city.\n\nVictoria Police issued 268 fines to individuals in the past 24 hours, including 77 for curfew breaches and 38 for failing to wear a mask when leaving home.\n\nIn other developments in the Asia-Pacific region:\n\n-- The Indian Medical Association says 196 doctors have died of COVID-19 so far and, in an open letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, requested adequate care for physicians and their families. The Health Ministry on Sunday recorded nearly 64,000 new coronavirus cases in the past 24 hours for a total of 2,153,010. India also recorded 861 fatalities, driving the death toll to 43,379. India has been posting an average of around 50,000 new cases a day since mid-June and has the third-highest caseload in the world after the United States and Brazil. It has the fifth-most deaths but its fatality rate of about 2% is far lower than the top two hardest-hit countries.\n\n-- Hong Kong has seen a further decline in new coronavirus cases, with just 69 reported as of Sunday. Hong Kong's Center for Health Protection said 67 were locally transmitted and the other two brought from overseas. No new deaths from COVID-19 were reported, leaving the total for the semi-autonomous southern Chinese city at 47 among 3,938 cases. Hong Kong has instituted strict measures to prevent new infections and the center urged members of the public to avoid going out, having social contact or dining out. Last week, authorities said they would offer free testing to all 7.5 million residents in order to track those who might have the virus while not showing symptoms and reassure the public that the outbreak is under control.\n\n-- Chinese authorities on Sunday announced 15 new cases in the northwestern region of Xinjiang and eight others brought from outside the country. A total of 817 people remain in treatment, 43 of them in serious condition, and 276 are under monitoring in isolation for showing signs of COVID-19 or testing positive for the virus without displaying symptoms. China has reported a total of 4,634 deaths from COVID-19 among 84,619 cases. Xinjiang's main city of Urumqi was the center of China's latest major outbreak, but strict measures including travel restrictions and the lockdown of some residential communities appears to have contained the spread.\n\n-- South Korea has reported 36 additional coronavirus cases amid an uptick in local community infections. The additional figures Sunday took the national tally to 14,598 with 305 deaths. Thirty of the new cases were locally transmitted while the rest were associated with international arrivals. South Korea on Saturday also recorded 30 domestically transmitted cases, the first time the figure hit above 30 in about two weeks. Heath officials say many of those were linked to church gatherings. Health authorities have said imported cases are less threatening as they enforce two-week quarantines on all people arriving from abroad.\n\nFollow AP's pandemic coverage at http://apnews.com/VirusOutbreak and https://apnews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak",

        "authors": [],
        "body": "TOKYO -- Asian shares were mostly higher Tuesday as investors hung onto hopes the coronavirus pandemic may come under control as treatments get developed.\n\n\"The positive coverage on potential COVID-19 vaccines and treatments opens the door wide open to a rotating carousel of stocks,\" said Stephen Innes, chief global markets strategist at AxiCorp.\n\nIf symptoms of the infection could become as mild as a cough or runny nose during a flu, the economy could return to normal, he added.\n\nJapan's benchmark Nikkei 225 index rose 1.7% to 23,378.47. South Korea's Kospi gained 1.5% to 2,364.25. Australia's S&P/ASX 200 added 0.5% to 6,159.60. Hong Kong's Hang Seng edged down 0.2% to 25,498.77, while the Shanghai Composite was up 0.2% at 3,392.49.\n\nInvestors are also awaiting a speech by U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell later this week that he would normally give at Jackson Hole, Wyoming. This year's economic policy symposium will be online due to the pandemic.\n\nInvestors closely follow speeches at the annual Jackson Hole event, where Fed officials sometimes generate market-moving headlines. This year's event is titled \"Navigating the Decade Ahead: Implications for Monetary Policy.\"\n\nWhile signs that the increase in COVID-19 cases around the world may be slowing down gradually are cause for optimism, worries about recurring waves remain.\n\n\"The news that a Hong Kong man has been proven to be reinfected with COVID-19 means that the assumption of the market that it is only a matter of time before a vaccine comes and brings back the old life again, is more questionable,\" said Robert Carnell, regional head of research, Asia Pacific, at ING.\n\n\"But perhaps we should be tempering our optimism,\" he said.\n\nOn Wall Street, the S&P 500 rallied 1% to 3,431.28 and added to the all-time high it set last week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.4% to 28,308.46, and the Nasdaq composite added 0.6% to 11,379.72.\n\nPharmaceutical companies working toward a possible vaccine for COVID-19 is helping invigorate shares of industries that have been beaten by the pandemic. Airlines climbed, for example, amid the possibility that people may feel safe enough to travel again in the future. Delta Air Lines rose 9.3%, and American Airlines Group added 10.5%.\n\nOne winner of the new normal, Zoom Video Communications, stumbled. Its shares fell 2.6% after it reported partial outages in its Zoom Meetings service, which has become the default way for classrooms and businesses around the world to communicate. By midday on the East Coast, it said it had resolved the issue.\n\nAlso Monday, it was announced that some big names in the Dow Jones Industrial Average are slated to be dropped from the 30-company index. Exxon Mobil, Pfizer and Raytheon Technologies will be replaced before trading opens next Monday by Salesforce.com, Amgen and Honeywell International.\n\nBenchmark U.S. crude oil slipped 5 cents to $42.57 a barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. It rose 28 cents to $42.62 per barrel Monday. Brent crude, the international standard, rose 11 cents to $45.24 a barrel.\n\nThe dollar inched up to 105.90 Japanese yen from 105.82 yen. The euro cost $1.1805, down from $1.1817.\n\nAP Business Writers Stan Choe and Damian J. Troise contributed. Yuri Kageyama is on Twitter https://twitter.com/yurikageyama",

        "authors": [],
        "body": "HARARE, Zimbabwe -- Zimbabwean journalist Hopewell Chin'ono has been granted bail after being held in jail for more than a month on charges of inciting violence.\n\nChin'ono's application for bail was approved by a magistrate who stipulated that while he awaits trial he must not post on social media such as Facebook or Twitter. The charges against Chin'ono stem from the support he expressed on Twitter for an anti-government protest.\n\nChin'ono had previously been denied bail three times and his lawyers say prison authorities forced him to mingle with other prisoners despite showing symptoms \"consistent\" with COVID-19.\n\nHe has become ill in prison this week, according to his lawyers who say he is suffering from \"a headache, fever and distorted taste,\" symptoms consistent with COVID-19. Lawyers are still waiting for results of tests carried out this week.\n\nOne of his lawyers, Taona Nyamakura told a magistrates' court during a routine remand hearing Tuesday that prison authorities had tricked Chin'ono to think that he was going to see his private doctor but then bundled him into a waiting prison van and forced him to attend court.\n\nThis was despite a warning by Chin'ono's personal physician that the reporter was a risk to other inmates due to the symptoms he is exhibiting and should be isolated from other prisoners until the results of his test are known.\n\nProsecutors denied Chin'ono is a risk to other inmates, claiming that prison doctors have ascertained that he wasn't showing any signs of COVID-19.\n\nChin'ono has been in detention for more than a month after he was arrested together with opposition politician, Jacob Ngarivhume, and accused of inciting violence for publishing on social media his support for an anti-government protest. That protest was foiled by the military and police on July 31.\n\nThe duo's lawyers have previously told the courts that they fear for their clients' safety as overcrowding, poor diet and lack of protective equipment put their health at risk.\n\nJournalists' organizations, western embassies and human rights groups say Chin'ono is being punished for exposing government corruption on Twitter.\n\nChin'ono had alleged corruption involving a $60 million purchase of protective equipment for health workers. President Emmerson Mnangagwa later fired the health minister, who has been formally charged with corruption.",

    "Belarus' leader faces toughest challenge yet in Sunday vote": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "MINSK, Belarus -- After 26 consecutive years in office, the autocratic leader of Belarus is confronting something unfamiliar as he tries to win a sixth term: circumstances beyond his control.\n\nDiscontent over a worsening economy and his government's dismissive response to the coronavirus pandemic has helped fuel the country's largest opposition rallies since the collapse of the Soviet Union, when Alexander Lukashenko became independent Belarus's first and only elected president, so far.\n\nRumblings among the ruling elite and a bitter rift with Russia, Belarus's main sponsor and ally, compound the reelection challenge facing the 65-year-old former state farm director on Sunday.\n\nLukashenko, who once acquired the nickname \"Europe's last dictator\" in the West for his relentless crackdowns on dissent, has made it clear he won't hesitate to again use the government's authority and, if necessary, force to quash any attempt by his opponents to protest the results of the presidential election.\n\nElection officials already barred the president's two main prospective rivals from what is now a five-person race. Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, a 37-year-old former teacher and the wife of a jailed opposition blogger, has managed to draw strong support, with tens of thousands flocking to her campaign rallies.\n\nIn an interview with The Associated Press, Tsikhanouskaya described herself as a \"symbol of change\"\n\n\"It was brewing inside for more than 20 years,\" Tsikhanouskaya said. \"We were afraid all that time and no one dared to say a word. Now people vote for a symbol of change.\"\n\nTsikhanouskaya has crisscrossed the country, tapping public frustration with Lukashenko's swaggering response to the pandemic and the country's stagnating Soviet-style economy.\n\nThe president has dismissed the coronavirus as \"psychosis\" and refused to introduce any restrictions to stem the outbreak, suggesting that Belarusians protect themselves against the disease with a daily shot of vodka, visits to sauna and hard work in the fields.\n\n\"They were telling us that the virus doesn't exist and dismissed it as 'psychosis' while tens of thousands of Belarusians have got sick,\" said Diana Golubovich, 54, a lawyer who attended Tsikhanouskaya's rally in Brest, a city on the border with Poland. \"Suddenly everyone realized that the social-oriented state that Lukashenko was boasting about doesn't exist.\"\n\nBelarus, a country of 9.5 million people, has reported more than 68,500 confirmed virus cases and 580 deaths in the pandemic. Critics have accused the authorities of manipulating the figures to downplay the death toll.\n\nLukashenko announced last month that he had been infected with the virus but had no COVID-19 symptoms and recovered quickly, allegedly thanks to doing sports. He defended his handling of the outbreak, saying that a lockdown would have doomed the nation's weakened economy.\n\nBelarus still has sustained a severe economic blow after its leading exports customer, Russia, went into a pandemic-induced recession and other foreign markets shrank. Before the coronavirus, the country's state-controlled economy already had been stalled for years, stoking public frustration.\n\n\"Lukashenko lacks a plan to modernize the country. He has taken political freedoms away, and now he is depriving people of a chance for economic growth,\" said Valery Tsepkalo, a former Belarusian ambassador to the United States who planned to challenge Lukashenko for the presidency but fled to Russia with his children last month to avoid imminent arrest. \"That is the main reason behind protests.\"\n\nWhen the presidential campaign began, authorities cracked down on the opposition with a renewed vigor. More than 1,300 protest participants have been detained since May, according to the Viasna human rights center. The campaign chief for one of the candidates race was arrested outside a polling station Friday and sentenced to 10 days in jail for allegedly organizing an unauthorized mass gathering.\n\nStanding outside the Minsk Tractor Plant in Belarus's capital, one worker spoke about his low salary, rising prices and \"no glimpse of hope\" in Belarus.\n\n\"No one trusts the government's promises any more,\" said Anton Rubankevich, 46, who makes the equivalent of $480 a month. \"If this president stays, we will continue falling into a pit.\"\n\nPolitical observers say the election campaign also exposed divisions among the Belarusian elite as some of its members entered politics for the first time.\n\nAlong with former ambassador Tsepkalo, the head of a major Russia-controlled bank contemplated running against Lukashenko. The well-connected potential rival was jailed in May on money laundering and tax evasion charges that he rejected as politically driven.\n\nIn what the political opposition and many independent observers regarded as an attempt to shore up the incumbent's sagging public support, Belarusian authorities last week arrested 33 Russian military contractors and charged them with plans to stage \"mass riots.\"\n\nThe arrest of the Russians marked an unprecedented spike in tensions between neighboring Belarus and Russia, which often have acrimonious disputes despite their close ties.\n\nWhen Russia and Belarus signed a union agreement in 1996, Lukashenko aspired to use it as a vehicle to eventually lead a unified state as the successor to Russia's ailing president, Boris Yeltsin. The tables turned after Vladimir Putin became Russian president in 2000; the Belarusian leader began resisting what he saw as a Kremlin push for control over Belarus.\n\nAlexander Klaskovsky, an independent political expert based in Minsk, said he thinks the Kremlin hopes the stormy election campaign in Belarus will help erode Lukashenko's grip on power and make him more receptive to a closer integration of the two countries.\n\n\"Moscow is interested not in Lukashenko's ouster, but his maximal weakening so that he comes out of that campaign with undermined legitimacy, spoiled relations with the West and the economy in a poor shape,\" Klaskovsky said. \"A weakened and emaciated Lukashenko would be a gift for Moscow.\"\n\nKlaskovsky nevertheless expects election officials to declare Lukashenko the winner by landslide.\n\n\"It will be about 80% of the vote for Lukashenko, so that his entourage doesn't think that the leader has grown weaker,\" he predicted. \"The government has enough resources and brute force to keep the power and suppress protests, but it lacks the answer to the main question about the path of Belarus' development. Lukashenko will undoubtedly win, but it will be a Pyrrhic victory.\"",

        "authors": [],
        "body": "MINSK, Belarus -- Election officials in Belarus say the country's longtime authoritarian leader Alexander Lukashenko has won his sixth consecutive presidential term, taking over 80% of the votes, according to preliminary results of Sunday's election that resulted in mass protests all over Belarus and a violent crackdown on demonstrators.\n\nThe country's central election commission announced on Monday that all the ballots have been counted and Lukashenko took 80.23% of the votes, while his main opposition challenger Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya had only 9.9%.\n\nThe announcement may exacerbate tensions with opposition supporters who believe the results of the vote were rigged.\n\nThousands of people took to the streets in a number of Belarusian cities and towns on Sunday night, protesting the early count suggesting Lukashenko's landslide victory.\n\nTsikhanouskaya, a former English teacher and political novice, rejected the official figures, saying \"I will believe my own eyes -- the majority was for us.\"\n\nHer supporters quickly took to the streets of the capital to protest what they saw as official manipulation of the vote. They faced rows of riot police in black uniforms who moved quickly to disperse the demonstrators, firing flash-bang grenades and beating them with truncheons.\n\nThe brutal crackdown followed a tense campaign that saw massive rallies against Lukashenko, who has ruled the ex-Soviet nation with an iron fist for 26 years. Lukashenko has not yet commented on the election results or the protests.\n\nSeveral other cities across the country saw similar crackdowns on protesters. According to the Viasna human rights group, over 100 protesters were detained, with the number likely to be much higher.\n\nInterior Ministry spokeswoman Olga Chemodanova said that police efforts to restore order were continuing overnight, but wouldn't say how many people were detained. On Monday morning, Belarus' Investigative Committee opened a criminal probe into mass riots and violence toward police officers.\n\n\"What has happened is awful,\" Tsikhanouskaya told reporters Sunday.\n\nAn AP journalist was beaten by police and treated at a hospital.\n\nAt Minsk's Hospital No. 10, an AP reporter saw a dozen ambulances delivering protesters with fragmentation wounds and cuts from stun grenades and other injuries.\n\n\"It was a peaceful protest, we weren't using force,\" said 23-year-old protester Pavel Konoplyanik, who was accompanying his friend who had a plastic grenade fragment stuck in his neck. \"No one will believe in the official results of the vote, they have stolen our victory.\"\n\nKonoplyanik, whose legs were also cut by fragments of police grenades, said he doesn't want to leave the country but fears that he might have no other choice.\n\nTwo prominent opposition challengers were denied places on the ballot, but Tsikhanouskaya, the wife of a jailed opposition blogger, managed to unite opposition groups and draw tens of thousands to her campaign rallies, tapping growing anger over a stagnant economy and fatigue with Lukashenko's autocratic rule.\n\nLukashenko was defiant as he voted earlier in the day, warning that the opposition will meet a tough response.\n\n\"If you provoke, you will get the same answer,\" he said. \"Do you want to try to overthrow the government, break something, wound, offend, and expect me or someone to kneel in front of you and kiss them and the sand onto which you wandered? This will not happen.\"\n\nThree journalists from the independent Russian TV station Dozhd were detained after interviewing an opposition figure and were deported.\n\nThe Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, whose assessments of elections are widely regarded as authoritative, was not invited to send observers.\n\nTsikhanouskaya had crisscrossed the country, tapping into public frustration with a worsening economy and Lukashenko's swaggering response to the pandemic.\n\nBelarus, a country of 9.5 million people, has reported more than 68,500 coronavirus cases and 580 deaths but critics have accused authorities of manipulating the figures to downplay the death toll.\n\nLukashenko has dismissed the virus as \"psychosis\" and declined to apply measures to stop its spread, saying a lockdown would have doomed the already weak economy. He announced last month that he had been infected but had no symptoms and recovered quickly, allegedly thanks to playing sports.\n\nYet for some voters, Lukashenko's long, hard line rule was a plus.\n\n\"He is an experienced politician, not a housewife who appeared out of nowhere and muddied the waters,\" retiree Igor Rozhov said Sunday. \"We need a strong hand that will not allow riots.\"\n\nAssociated Press journalists Jim Heintz, Vladimir Isachenkov and Daria Litvinova in Moscow contributed to this story.",

        "body": "MINSK, Belarus -- As Kseniya Milya's grandfather lay dying of COVID-19 at a hospital in Belarus' capital of Minsk, the country's authoritarian leader was blithely dismissing the pandemic as \"psychosis,\" and recommending an unusual remedy: Have a regular shot of vodka and work hard in the fields.\n\nLike many other Belarusians angry with the government's cavalier approach to the pandemic, Milya joined large opposition protests ahead of Sunday's presidential vote in which President Alexander Lukashenko is seeking a sixth term. The outpouring of public discontent poses the most serious challenge yet to Lukashenko after 26 years in office.\n\nMilya said her 86-year-old grandfather, Ivan Shelesny, believed Lukashenko and took no precautions as the pandemic swept through the ex-Soviet nation.\n\n\"(He) trusted Lukashenko and TV, who said that COVID-19 doesn't exist, and he died,\" said Milya, a 26-year-old movie producer. \"That was a result of the government's policy.\"\n\n\"He was attending veterans' meetings and visiting street markets,\" she added. \"And he was greatly surprised when he tested positive.\"\n\nMilya's grandfather died of coronavirus-induced pneumonia at a hospital in March, after a week on a ventilator.\n\n\"On the day they called me from intensive care to say that my granddad has died of confirmed COVID-19, I switched on the TV and saw the president saying that no one has died of the virus in Belarus,\" Milya told The Associated Press.\n\nIt wasn't until April that the government reported the country's first COVID-19 deaths.\n\nMilya and her family were all infected, and couldn't attend the funeral. Her 46-year-old father spent a month on a ventilator and barely survived, and her mother-in-law has remained in intensive care since April.\n\n\"The government was refusing to recognize the virus' existence or provide assistance, wasting time,\" she said.\n\nShe said when her father was hospitalized, no one bothered to test him for COVID-19. Only after a week did authorities do a CT scan and put him on a ventilator for 31 days.\n\nAs the pandemic engulfed the world, Lukashenko ignored the World Health Organization's call for a lockdown.\n\nInstead, the 65-year-old former state farm director advised Belarusians to \"kill the virus with vodka,\" go to saunas and work in the fields to avoid infection. \"Tractors will cure everybody!\" he proclaimed.\n\nLukashenko has refused to impose any restrictions, making Belarus the only country in Europe to keep holding professional soccer games with fans in the stands while the outbreak was in full swing. Religious services and other mass gatherings continued unimpeded, and a massive military parade was held in May to mark the 75th anniversary of the Nazi defeat in World War II.\n\nLast month, Lukashenko abruptly announced that he got the virus himself but had no symptoms and allegedly recovered quickly thanks to doing sports. He has staunchly defended the government response, claiming that extensive testing helped prevent the uncontrolled spread of the disease and arguing that a lockdown would have been deadly for the economy.\n\nHis approach, combined with a painful economic fallout from the global pandemic, has helped swell the opposition ranks ahead of the vote.\n\nPreviously apolitical, Milya was among the tens of thousands who flocked to campaign rallies for Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, a 37-year-old former teacher and the wife of a jailed opposition blogger who is challenging Lukashenko in Sunday's vote.\n\n\"The offer to use tractors and vodka was like spitting in people's faces,\" Tsikhanouskaya told the AP in an interview. \"That disrespectful, disdainful attitude ... had a strong impact at a time when people badly needed help amid the pandemic. And all they got was that boorishness.\"\n\nThe country of 9.5 million has reported more than 68,500 confirmed infections and 580 deaths. Critics have accused authorities of manipulating the figures.\n\n\"No one, even the authorities themselves, trusts Belarus' official statistics,\" said Pavel Paleichik, an ambulance doctor from the western city of Lida who was handed a 7-day jail term and lost his job after complaining -- at an opposition rally -- about the lack of protective gear.\n\nPaleichik claimed that authorities urged doctors to attribute COVID-19 deaths to other reasons.\n\n\"The situation is horrible. We lack protective gear, people have to wait for an ambulance for 3-4 hours,\" Paleichik told the AP. \"I didn't want to tolerate that and keep silent like others. And I faced harsh reprisals from the authorities because of that.\"\n\nWhile the authorities have sat back, a broad volunteer movement has spread across the country to collect money for doctors and to help expand public awareness of the pandemic.\n\n\"The outbreak has shown that the Belarusians are capable of strong solidarity,\" said Andrei Tkachev, a coordinator for the BYCOVID-19 volunteer group that has collected money and protective gear for medical workers.\n\nThe volunteers have collected $350,000 for the hospitals and provided medical workers with 450,000 respirators, hazmat suits and other protective gear.\n\n\"Everybody is equal in the face of the coronavirus, we have offered protective means to the military and police as well,\" Tkachev said.\n\nAuthorities in Belarus have seen the volunteer movement as a challenge. Andrei Strizhak, one of the leaders of BYCOVID-19, had to flee to Ukraine with his family after receiving threats.\n\n\"The coronavirus has become an impulse that triggered massive discontent with the government, and specifically with Lukashenko,\" Tkachev said. \"Many people have grown tired of being afraid and keeping silent.\"\n\nAlthough Belarus didn't impose a lockdown, its economy has still been badly battered by the global pandemic.\n\nRussia, which buys the bulk of Belarus' exports, is in recession, and other export markets also have shrunk. Amid economic disputes, Moscow this year withdrew a steep discount on its oil supplies, depriving Lukashenko's government of an estimated $700 million in annual revenues from exporting oil products made of cheap Russian crude.\n\nSpeaking outside the Minsk Tractor Plant where he works, 24-year-old Kirill Egotin lamented stagnant wages and mounting consumer prices.\n\n\"I have grown up under Lukashenko, but increasing poverty, stagnation and helplessness in the fight against the coronavirus have undermined trust in his government,\" said Egotin, who makes the equivalent of $415 a month. \"Everybody has got sick of him.\"\n\nFollow AP's pandemic coverage at http://apnews.com/VirusOutbreak and https://apnews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak",

        "authors": [],
        "body": "WASHINGTON -- In a notable change, Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden and his running mate, Kamala Harris, will now be regularly tested for the coronavirus as the race heats up, a campaign aide confirmed Monday.\n\n\"This announcement is another step demonstrating Joe Biden and Kamala Harris' commitment to turn the page on Trump's catastrophic mismanagement during the worst public health crisis in 100 years,\" said Biden spokesperson Andrew Bates.\n\nBates declined to comment Monday when asked if Biden had been tested yet, though deputy campaign manager Kate Bedingfield said Sunday that he hadn't been.\n\nA campaign aide said the decision to move forward with regular testing was based on the recommendations of the campaign's medical advisers. It comes as the candidate and his running mate are expected to ramp up in-person campaigning in the final 10 weeks of the election. The news was first reported by Bloomberg.\n\nStaffers who interact with the candidates will also be tested regularly. And the campaign has pledged to make public if either Biden or Harris tests positive for the virus.\n\nBiden had said multiple times over the past few months that he hasn't been tested for the virus, noting he's experienced no symptoms. Still, the former vice president is 77 and remains at higher risk for severe illness if infected than the greater population, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nThe Democratic presidential nominee has avoided large public campaign events in favor of virtual campaigning from his Wilmington, Delaware home, and when he does hold in-person events, they are small, socially distanced gatherings where Biden and all attendees are required to wear a mask.\n\nBut the lack of testing last week came as Biden delivered remarks for the Democratic National Convention in front of a small pool of reporters, all of whom were tested daily for the coronavirus and were required to have a negative result to attend the remarks.\n\nThe Biden campaign has pummeled President Donald Trump on his handling of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\n\"For the entirety of this outbreak, Joe Biden has lived his values, modelling and strongly encouraging responsible behavior to keep Americans safe while proposing the kind of desperately-needed national strategy for defeating this pandemic that Donald Trump still has not provided,\" Bates said. \"Donald Trump has been the opposite.\"\n\nIn the early weeks of the pandemic, Trump also went without a coronavirus test, first taking one in March. But he shifted to daily tests in May, after one of his personal aides tested positive for the virus.",

        "body": "RIO DE JANEIRO -- Chief Raoni Metuktire, an Indigenous leader who became a symbol of the fight for the preservation of the Amazon forest in Brazil, was hospitalized with symptoms of pneumonia and tested positive for the new coronavirus, the Raoni Institute said Monday.\n\nThe nearly 90-year-old Kayap\u00f3 ethnic leader does not have a fever and is breathing normally without the aid of oxygen, the institute said.\n\nRaoni previously met several European leaders to denounce Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro's calls for the economic development of Indigenous land in the Amazon rainforest. Bolsonaro alleges that such development is key to the economic prosperity of the local population and the country.\n\nAbout 30,000 Indigenous people have contracted the virus and more than 700 have died since the beginning of the pandemic, according to data released by the Association of Indigenous Peoples of Brazil, a nonprofit group. On Aug. 4, a Supreme Court ruling forced the government to present within 60 days a plan to create sanitary barriers that protect Indigenous communities from COVID-19.\n\nA month ago, Raoni was hospitalized for 10 days after suffering diarrhea and dehydration in his home in the Xing\u00fa Indigenous reserve, in the state of Mato Grosso. Raoni also had low blood pressure, anemia and ulcers, and had to receive two blood transfusions.\n\nFor years, Raoni has campaigned for the protection of Indigenous territories in the Amazon. A 1978 documentary, \"Raoni: The Fight for the Amazon,\" contributed to his fame, as did a 1989 tour with British musician Sting.",

        "body": "MILWAUKEE -- Milwaukee Brewers bench coach Pat Murphy suffered a heart attack during a Saturday team workout at Miller Park, but team officials said he was resting comfortably and should be out of the hospital later this week.\n\nBrewers general manager David Stearns said the 61-year-old Murphy received a stent and is expected to get released from Froedtert Hospital \"in a couple of days.\" Stearns said it was too early to estimate when Murphy might be back in uniform.\n\n\"The prognosis for a recovery is good, and Pat is certainly going to be back in the dugout at some point,\" Stearns said Sunday. \"I could not venture to guess as to when that is. Right now the most important thing for Pat is to focus on his recovery and health. We'll let him focus on that.\"\n\nUSA Today first reported that Murphy had suffered a heart attack.\n\nStearns said that Murphy started experiencing symptoms while on the Miller Park field and reported them to the team's medical staff, which immediately realized the gravity of the situation and called an ambulance. Stearns says the ambulance arrived \"in a matter of minutes\" and transported Murphy to Froedtert Hospital, which had a team of cardiologists waiting for him.\n\n\"This is an outcome here where everyone did the right thing,\" Stearns said. \"Pat reported his symptoms. Our medical staff immediately identified what was going on and the folks at Froedtert did an incredible job of facilitating his entry immediately and getting him the care he needs.\"\n\nMurphy is beginning his fifth season as the Brewers' bench coach under manager Craig Counsell, who played for him at Notre Dame from 1989-92. Murphy posted a 42-54 record as the San Diego Padres' interim manager in 2015 after the firing of Bud Black.\n\nHe also was a college head coach for 25 years, including stints at Notre Dame (1988-94) and Arizona State (1995-2009). He led Arizona State to a runner-up finish in the 1998 College World Series.\n\n\"The good news is Pat is well, he's resting comfortably, he will recover and he's going to have the full support of the organization as he goes through this,\" Stearns said.\n\nThe Brewers are scheduled to play their home opener Monday against the Chicago White Sox after their three-game weekend series with St. Louis was postponed because multiple Cardinals tested positive for the coronavirus.\n\nMilwaukee will play that game without two-time All-Star outfielder Lorenzo Cain and former NL MVP Ryan Braun. Cain announced Saturday he was opting out of the remainder of the season, and Braun was placed on the injured list Sunday due to an infected right index finger.\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP -- Sports",

        "authors": [],
        "body": "LONDON -- The British government announced Thursday that it is investing in a coronavirus test that gives results in as little as 20 minutes, touting it as the latest milestone in efforts to take the U.K. to the front of the global pack in testing for COVID-19.\n\nHealth Secretary Matt Hancock said the government is expanding trials of two new rapid tests -- a simple no-swab saliva test and another that gives results in minutes. Britain also is examining the feasibility of repeat testing of people without symptoms, something Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said could lessen the need for social distancing measures.\n\nThe government says it will spend up to 500 million pounds ($660 million) on efforts to achieve mass population testing, a project it has named \"Operation Moonshot.\"\n\n\"Short of a vaccine, this is the best chance we have of reducing social distancing whilst controlling the virus, especially with winter coming, with all the challenges that brings,\" Hancock told the BBC.\n\nBritain lacked mass testing capacity when its virus outbreak began and in March abandoned efforts to track and test the contacts of all people with confirmed cases, a decision authorities now say they regret.\n\nThe U.K. has hugely expanded its testing capacity since then. Anyone with coronavirus symptoms is eligible for a test, either at home or at a testing center, and officials say most get the results within 24 hours.\n\nBut the BBC reported Thursday that people are sometimes being directed to drive-through centers hundreds of miles away when they enter their postcodes into the government's website.\n\nCritics also say the British government is still not doing enough to find and isolate people with the coronavirus.\n\nThe government says it has the capacity to perform almost 350,000 tests each day, though only about 180,000 a day are getting processed. It's goal is to reach the capacity for 500,000 tests a day by the end of October.\n\nA nationwide test-and-trace program designed to isolate those who had contact with infected individuals has reached 325,000 people but is still failing to find almost a third of the contacts in confirmed cases. A phone app once touted by the government as a key contact-tracing tool is still in the testing stage.\n\nHancock insisted the system was working well despite some \"operational challenges from time to time.\"\n\nBut Alan McNally, director of the Institute of Microbiology and Infection at the University of Birmingham, said he thinks the government acted too slowly. Britain's official coronavirus death toll is more than 41,500, the highest in Europe.\n\n\"I think the time was right to think about scaling up testing to the wider community and asymptomatic testing over the summer when we were relatively COVID-secure, knowing that autumn and winter would come\" and bring a possible second wave, McNally told the BBC.",

    "CDC expects 2020 outbreak of life-threatening AFM in children": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued a call to action to warn of a potential outbreak between the end of this summer and winter of a rare, but potentially lethal disease that affects young children, where seeking medical attention right away could make all the difference.\n\nAcute flaccid myelitis \"is a medical emergency that requires immediate recognition and care,\" urged CDC director Robert Redfield, on a conference call with the media Tuesday.\n\nAFM is a rare, rapid onset neurological disease affecting the spinal cord leading to paralysis. Symptoms of AFM include sudden arm or leg weakness, difficulty walking, limb pain, back pain or neck pain. AFM can cause paralysis over the course of hours to days, which may require a ventilator for breathing.\n\nIt most commonly affects young children. Parents are being asked to seek medical care immediately if a child develops a sudden arm or leg weakness.\n\nMost children with AFM will have a fever or respiratory illness about six days before weakness occurs. For this reason, AFM has been associated with viruses, and specifically one called Enterovirus D68.\n\nBut why some children get AFM and some don't isn't yet clear.\n\n\"We've learned a lot, but we have a lot to learn about AFM ... We are working at CDC and collaborating with the NIH on a couple of prospective large studies, which will help us better understand risk factors for AFM,\" said Redfield.\n\nThe CDC began tracking cases of AFM in 2014 and a wave of cases has occurred every other year since then. In 2018, the US experienced the third and largest outbreak of AFM with 238 cases in 42 states between August and November.\n\nThe average age was just 5 years old.\n\nAt least 98% of those children were hospitalized, and over half were admitted to the intensive care unit, while 20% required a ventilator to breathe.\n\nAnd while most parents sought medical attention within one day of developing AFM symptoms, a concerning 10% were not hospitalized after four days of weakness.\n\nWhile many children will recover to their usual state of health after AFM, unfortunately, many kids will have permanent disability.\n\n\"Early and aggressive physical therapy and occupational therapy can help strengthen the functioning they will retain and go about their lives with the best functioning possible,\" said Dr. Thomas Clark, a pediatrician and CDC deputy director of the division of viral diseases.\n\nWith the 2020 peak season looming, AFM is a priority for CDC as it prepares for an outbreak this year.\n\n\"As a parent and a grandparent my heart goes out to the families affected by AFM,\" Redfield said.\n\nParents should look out for any sudden weakness of the arms or legs in addition to pain in these areas, the neck or the back. If your child recently had a viral cold or fever, this should heighten your suspicion for AFM.\n\nClark urged pediatricians and other health care providers to \"consider and properly recognize [AFM], hospitalize immediately, take specimens as soon as possible and report [the case] to local health authorities.\"\n\nIf suspecting AFM, health care providers should order an MRI in order to distinguish AFM from other neurological conditions.\n\n\"It's vital that all health care providers maintain a high index of suspicion for AFM in children with acute limb weakness or neck or back pain that develops after an upper respiratory illness from late summer through fall,\" said Dr. Robert Glatter, an Emergency Physician at Lenox Hill in New York City.\n\n\"We expect that AFM will likely have another peak in 2020. That said, it's still unclear if or how COVID-19's recommended social distancing measures and attention to mask wearing and hand hygiene will impact how much enterovirus we end up seeing, along with cases of AFM,\" Glatter said.\n\nThe same hygiene precautions for COVID-19 apply to viruses that cause AFM.\n\nAs some of the symptoms of COVID-19 may overlap with AFM, parents should be on high alert this season.\n\nNon-COVID-19 emergency room visits dropped off sharply in 2020 due to fear of COVID-19. If this trend continues, parents need to know that time is critical and potentially lifesaving with AFM, so even in the age of COVID-19 seek medical attention immediately if your child has sudden numbness in their arms or legs.\n\n\"We are concerned in the midst of a COVID-19 pandemic that cases [of AFM] might not be recognized or that parents might be concerned about taking their kids to the doctor,\" Clark said.",

        "body": "SIOUX FALLS, S.D. -- A Minnesota man who attended the Sturgis Motorcycle Rally in South Dakota last month has died from COVID-19, Minnesota health officials reported on Wednesday.\n\nThe death is the first reported from the biker rally that drew hundreds of thousands of people. Infections linked to the event have been reported among people in states spanning coast to coast. The rally went forward despite fears it could become a super-spread event, with South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem welcoming bikers and the tourist dollars they spend.\n\nRallygoers crowded into bars and rock shows, mostly ignoring social distancing recommendations. Few wore masks.\n\nThe man who died in Minnesota was in his 60s, had underlying health conditions and was in an intensive care unit at a hospital before he died, said Doug Schultz, a spokesman for the Minnesota Department of Health.\n\nThe Washington Post first reported the death.\n\nFor 10 days in August, the rally created a travel hub in western South Dakota comparable to a major U.S. city, according to an analysis of anonymous cellphone data from Camber Systems, a firm that aggregates cellphone activity for health researchers. The researches found that 61% of all the counties in the U.S. have been visited by someone who attended Sturgis.\n\nSouth Dakota has seen the bulk of cases tied to the rally, with the Department of Health reporting 105 tied to the rally. The city of Sturgis made coronavirus tests available to residents and city employees after the rally in an attempt to uncover people who had infections but no symptoms.\n\nCases among people who attended the rally have been reported in 11 other states, from Washington state to New Jersey.",

    "COVID-19 lockdowns blocked flu in some places but fall looms": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "JOHANNESBURG -- Winter is ending in the Southern Hemisphere and country after country -- South Africa, Australia, Argentina -- had a surprise: Their steps against COVID-19 also apparently blocked the flu.\n\nBut there's no guarantee the Northern Hemisphere will avoid twin epidemics as its own flu season looms while the coronavirus still rages.\n\n\"This could be one of the worst seasons we've had from a public health perspective with COVID and flu coming together. But it also could be one of the best flu seasons we've had,\" Dr. Robert Redfield, director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, told The Associated Press.\n\nU.S. health officials are pushing Americans to get vaccinated against the flu in record numbers this fall, so hospitals aren't overwhelmed with a dueling \"twindemic.\"\n\nIt's also becoming clear that wearing masks, avoiding crowds and keeping your distance are protections that are \"not specific for COVID. They're going to work for any respiratory virus,\" Redfield said.\n\nThe evidence: Ordinarily, South Africa sees widespread influenza during the Southern Hemisphere's winter months of May through August. This year, testing tracked by the country's National Institute of Communicable Diseases is finding almost none -- something unprecedented.\n\nSchool closures, limited public gatherings and calls to wear masks and wash hands have \"knocked down the flu,\" said Dr. Cheryl Cohen, head of the institute's respiratory program.\n\nThat not only meant lives saved from flu's annual toll, but it \"freed up our hospitals' capacity to treat COVID-19 patients,\" Cohen added.\n\nIn Australia, the national health department reported just 36 laboratory-confirmed flu-associated deaths from January to mid-August, compared to more than 480 during the same period last year.\n\n\"The most likely and the biggest contributor is social distancing,\" said Dr. Robert Booy, an infectious diseases expert at the University of Sydney.\n\nThe coronavirus is blamed for about 24 million infections and more than 810,000 deaths globally in just the first eight months of this year. A normal flu year could have the world's hospitals dealing with several million more severe illnesses on top of the COVID-19 crush.\n\nBack in February and March, as the worldwide spread of the new virus was just being recognized, many countries throughout the Southern Hemisphere girded for a double whammy. Even as they locked down to fight the coronavirus, they made a huge push for more last-minute flu vaccinations.\n\n\"We gave many more flu vaccinations, like four times more,\" said Jaco Havenga, a pharmacist who works at Mays Chemist, a pharmacy in a Johannesburg suburb.\n\nSome countries' lockdowns were more effective than others at stemming spread of the coronavirus. So why would flu have dropped even if COVID-19 still was on the rise?\n\n\"Clearly the vigilance required to be successful against COVID is really high,\" said CDC's Redfield. \"This virus is one of the most infectious viruses that we've seen.\"\n\nThat's in part because 40% of people with COVID-19 show no symptoms yet can spread infection, he said.\n\nFlu hasn't disappeared, cautions a World Health Organization report earlier this month. While \"globally, influenza activity was reported at lower levels than expected for this time of year,\" it found sporadic cases are being reported.\n\nPlus, some people who had the flu in Southern countries might just have hunkered down at home and not seen a doctor as the coronavirus was widespread, WHO added.\n\nBut international influenza experts say keeping schools closed -- children typically drive flu's spread -- and strict mask and distancing rules clearly helped.\n\n\"We don't have definitive proof, but the logical explanation is what they're doing to try to control the spread of (the coronavirus) is actually doing a really, really good job against the flu as well,\" said Richard Webby of St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, who is part of a WHO committee that tracks flu evolution.\n\nIn contrast, the U.S. and Europe didn't impose coronavirus rules nearly as restrictive as some of their Southern neighbors -- and in many cases are reopening schools and relaxing distancing rules even as COVID-19 still is spreading and the cooler months that favor influenza's spread are fast approaching.\n\nSo the U.S. CDC is urging record flu vaccinations, preferably by October. Redfield's goal is for at least 65% of adults to be vaccinated; usually only about half are.\n\nThe U.S. expects more than 190 million doses of flu vaccine, about 20 million more than last year. States are being encouraged to try drive-thru flu shots and other creative ideas to get people vaccinated while avoiding crowds.\n\nIn an unusual move, Massachusetts has mandated flu vaccination for all students -- from elementary to college -- this year. Typically only some health care workers face employment mandates for flu vaccine.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, Prime Minister Boris Johnson likewise is urging widespread flu vaccination.\n\nTo be clear, the flu vaccine only protects against influenza -- it won't lessen the chances of getting the coronavirus. Vaccines against COVID-19 still are experimental and several candidates are entering final testing to see if they really work.\n\nBut for coronavirus protection, Redfield continues to stress vigilance about wearing masks, keeping your distance, avoiding crowds and washing your hands.\n\n\"Once one stops those mitigation steps, it only takes a couple weeks for these viral pathogens to get back on the path that they were on,\" he said.\n\nWhile the U.S. has been mask-resistant, most states now have some type of mask requirement, either through statewide orders issued by governors or from city and county rules.\n\nMeanwhile, countries where flu season is ending are watching to see if the Northern Hemisphere heeds their lessons learned.\n\n\"It could be very scary -- we honestly don't know. But if you're going to get the two infections at the same time, you could be in big trouble,\" said Booy, the Sydney infectious diseases expert.\n\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute's Department of Science Education.

    "COVID-19 measures could disrupt rare polio-like disease": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "NEW YORK -- Health experts once thought 2020 might be the worst year yet for a rare paralyzing disease that has been hitting U.S. children for the past decade.\n\nBut they now say the coronavirus pandemic could disrupt the pattern for the mysterious illnesses, which spike every other year starting in late summer.\n\nScientists say it's possible that mask wearing, school closures and others measures designed to stop spread of the coronavirus may also hamper spread of the virus suspected of causing the paralyzing disease.\n\nDr. David Kimberlin, a researcher at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, called it \"the million-dollar question.\"\n\n\"We just simply don't know right now,\" said Kimberlin, who is co-leader of a national study to gather specimens from children who develop the paralyzing condition.\n\nThe pandemic is dominating public health work right now, but officials are trying to draw attention to the polio-like condition they call acute flaccid myelitis, or AFM. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Tuesday made a public call for parents and doctors to watch for it, and act.\n\n\"We are concerned that in the midst of a COVID pandemic, that (AFM) cases might not be recognized. Or we're concerned that parents might be worried about taking their child to the doctors with something as serious as limb weakness,\" said Dr. Thomas Clark, a CDC official overseeing AFM surveillance.\n\nThat was a problem before COVID-19. In 2018, 10% of patients were not hospitalized until four or more days after limb weakness started, the CDC reported.\n\nHundreds of U.S. children have developed AFM since 2014. Most had a cold-like illness and fever, seemed to get over it, then descended into paralysis. In some cases it started small -- for example, a thumb that suddenly wouldn't move. Some children went on to lose the ability to eat or breathe.\n\nThe CDC on Tuesday released a study of cases from 2018 that found that the median age of the affected children was 5 years old. Nearly a quarter needed to be put on breathing machines.\n\nMany families say their children have regained at least some movement in affected limbs, but stories of complete recovery are unusual.\n\nIt's been difficult to come up with definitive proof, but experts believe the main culprit is an enterovirus called EV-D68. Enteroviruses are a large family of viruses. Some, such as polio, can damage the central nervous system, while many others cause mild symptoms or none at all. Another enterovirus, called EV-A71, has also been linked to some cases.\n\nDoctors think extremely rare cases of AFM have popped up since at least 2008. But it became national concern in 2014, when a wave of EV-D68 infections was followed by a burst of at least 120 AFM cases.\n\nWhat followed was an even-year, odd-year pattern: U.S. cases dropped to 22 in 2015, then jumped to 153 in 2016. They fell again in 2017 and hit 238 in 2018. There were 46 cases last year.\n\nThis year, as of the end of June, 16 cases have been reported, at least one of them fatal. Typically, most cases happen in August through November.\n\nThe Associated Press Health & Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute's Department of Science Education.

    "COVID-19 tests will now be required for nursing home staff": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "WASHINGTON -- Scrambling to check the spread of COVID-19 in nursing homes, the Trump administration announced Tuesday it will require facilities to test staff regularly or face fines.\n\nThe move comes months after the White House first urged governors to test all nursing home residents and staff. With residents, nursing homes are being required to offer them coronavirus tests if there is an outbreak or if any show symptoms.\n\nLong-term care facilities represent less than 1% of the U.S. population, but they account for 42% of the COVID-19 deaths, with more than 70,000 fatalities reported by the COVID Tracking Project.\n\nThe plight of frail elders in nursing homes is politically sensitive for President Donald Trump, who is trying to maintain support from older voters amid disapproval of the government's pandemic response. His administration is distributing fast-test machines to nursing homes, but there are continued reports that cases have been rising and facilities still face shortages of supplies like masks.\n\n\"Our recommendations for testing in nursing homes go back as far back as March and April,\" said Seema Verma, head of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS. \"What's different about today is that this is now a requirement ... we want to make sure every single nursing home is complying.\"\n\nIndependent research indicates that the coronavirus most likely gets into nursing homes via staffers who unwittingly bring it in from surrounding communities where it has started to spread. Staffers who have yet to develop symptoms may have no clue that they're infected.\n\nVerma said the testing requirement for staff will be keyed to the level of virus activity in local areas. If the positive rate is below 5%, nursing homes will have to test staff once a month. If the rate is 5% - 10%, testing will be required once a week. If the rate is above 10%, staff will have to be tested twice a week. Florida, Iowa and Nevada are examples of states where the COVID-19 positive rate is now above 10%.\n\nThe government will provide $2.5 billion to help nursing homes with testing costs, Verma also announced. The administration's campaign to distribute fast-test machines and an initial supply of tests is supposed to be done by the end of September.\n\nThe nursing home industry said it supports mandatory testing as long as facilities are given what they need to comply with requirements.\n\nMark Parkinson, head of the industry group American Health Care Association, said nursing homes in many parts of the country still can't get timely results on COVID-19 tests.\n\nCMS \"must factor in the delays that continue to be a reality,\" Parkinson said in a statement. \"Otherwise facilities could face fines for circumstances beyond their control and be conducting tests that are so delayed that they have little clinical value.\"",

    "California governor on the hot seat over pandemic response": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- California Gov. Gavin Newsom has had a summer of muddled messaging and bad news in the coronavirus fight, a trend crystallized this week by his delayed response to a data error that caused a backlog of nearly 300,000 virus test results.\n\n\"The buck stops with me, I'm accountable,\" he said in a tense Monday news conference, his first appearance since state officials revealed the error a week earlier. \"No one's trying to hide that, no one's trying to mask that, we're owning that, we're moving forward to address those issues.\"\n\nHis tone couldn't have been more different than it was in March, when California's public battle with the virus began and the state initially avoided the worst outcomes. In commanding news conferences held almost daily, he announced the country's first statewide stay-at-home order and won mostly adherence from the state's 40 million residents.\n\nBut things began to change in May, when Newsom, under pressure from business leaders, allowed parts of the economy to begin reopening under a complicated, county-by-county process. Within weeks he reversed course as confirmed cases and the positive test rate rose.\n\nThe data backlog, which began at the end of July and continued because of a series of errors, led to the state under-counting the rate of virus spread and halted decision-making about what parts of the economy could open. Newsom has repeatedly stressed that those decisions will be made based on data.\n\nThe snafu also poses a political problem for Newsom, a Democratic rising star who is up for reelection in 2022 and is believed to have his eye on even higher office. His decisions in the crisis will help forge his legacy -- good or bad -- and so far, they are getting mixed reviews.\n\n\"The reopening was inconsistent and confusing, the criteria that he had set up in order to enter those different phases he appeared to discard,\" said Rob Stutzman, a Republican and former communications adviser to then-Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger who said Newsom started out strong at the beginning.\n\nDr. Eric Topol, head of the Scripps Research Translational Institute in San Diego, said the data collection problem is related to the state's abrupt reopening. California appeared to be on a \"golden path\" by shutting down early and leading the way in its effort to contain the virus. Since then, it's been \"one mistake after another\" when Newsom began allowing things to reopen, Topol said.\n\nThe surge of cases meant the state suddenly had more data than it could process, he said, asserting the state was woefully unprepared.\n\n\"You would think we could have the best IT for the pandemic. There's just no excuse. And we've had months,\" he said.\n\nNewsom's announcement last week that things were trending in a positive direction was immediately overshadowed by news of the data errors. The state's top public health official, Dr. Sonia Angell, abruptly resigned, and Newsom declined to get into the details. He later said \"decisions were made\" to change the team.\n\nThe glitch wasn't the first time Newsom and his administration gave unclear or incomplete responses to virus-related issues. Since early summer, schools had sought guidance from the state on when and how they could reopen, and by July many districts were making decisions on their own. Then, Newsom announced schools in most counties couldn't immediately reopen for in-person instruction, sending many parents into panic mode. He later clarified that some elementary schools could apply for waivers, though the process for doing so was far from simple.\n\nLawmakers from both parties have also criticized him for not acting swiftly enough to fix problems at the state employment department, as some claimants face weeks-long delays to get unemployment checks.\n\nAdvocates also say Newsom's administration failed to act quickly enough to protect Latino workers from the virus and its economic harm. Latinos make up nearly 60% of the state's confirmed cases even though they represent 39% of California's population.\n\nJacqueline Martinez Garcel, chief executive officer of California's Latino Community Foundation, said access to financial help for those who have lost jobs has been difficult.\n\n\"Why is it that the fifth-largest economy in the world and the tech hub of the country and the world can't figure out the computer problems that we're having for people to access unemployment?\" she said.\n\nRepublican Assemblyman Kevin Kiley, a frequent Newsom critic, called for a legislative oversight hearing about the data failures, but Democratic Speaker Anthony Rendon isn't planning one.\n\n\"For months Californians have put their lives on hold based on data. Now we've learned the data is wrong, and the Assembly can't be bothered to investigate,\" Kiley said in a statement.\n\nOthers noted the governor is operating in an unprecedented crisis. For most people, the new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia and death.\n\nDemocratic state Sen. Scott Wiener said Newsom and his team \"have been drinking water from a fire hose\" for months.\n\n\"No matter what he does he will be criticized. He'll be criticized for not doing enough to restart the economy or he will be criticized for reopening too quickly leading to more virus spread,\" Wiener said. \"My take is that he has accepted that and that's the price of leadership.\"\n\nAssociated Press writer Adam Beam also contributed to this report.",

    "California virus cases underreported, health official says": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "LOS ANGELES -- Figures showing California has slowed the rate of coronavirus infections may be in doubt because a technical problem has delayed reporting of test results, the state's top health official said.\n\nFor days, California hasn't received full counts on the number of tests conducted nor the number that come back positive for COVID-19, Health and Human Services Secretary Dr. Mark Ghaly said Tuesday.\n\nHe blamed an unspecified technical problem affecting the state's database that provides test results to local health departments. Ghaly said it's unclear when the issue would be fixed, adding that the state is relaying information manually to county health officials.\n\nThe announcement came a day after Gov. Gavin Newsom gave his most optimistic report on the state's virus efforts since a second surge of cases in early June. Newsom said daily cases had dropped by an average of 2,200 in the last week and the infection rate of 6.1% was significantly lower than the nearly 8% recorded last month.\n\nThe latest daily tally posted Tuesday on California's COVID-19 data page showed 4,526 additional confirmed positives, the lowest total in more than six weeks and a precipitous drop from the record of nearly 13,000 reported two weeks ago.\n\nHowever, the page now carries a disclaimer saying the actual daily number of positive cases is being underreported.\n\nAt issue is CalREDIE, a state system that electronically receives COVID-19 test data from lab providers. The name is short for the California Reportable Disease Information Exchange.\n\n\"There's a specific component that feeds information from labs to both the state's system and the local public health system,\" Ghaly said. \"That may actually be the place where data is getting stuck.\"\n\nCounties including Orange and Sacramento have noted the delays, and Placer County posted on its website that its virus cases are likely underestimated as a result.\n\nWendy Hetherington, Riverside County's chief of epidemiology and program evaluation, said she believes hundreds of cases a day haven't been reported in her county since late last week.\n\nThat makes it hard to find newly infected individuals and to reach out to people who've had close contact with them in order to trace and reduce the spread of the virus.\n\n\"We're delaying case investigations. We're delaying follow up,\" she said, adding: \"Until this lab issue is fixed, we can't really say what the true picture is.\"\n\nLos Angeles County health officials said the state convened an emergency call Monday night to discuss the issue. Now, a team from the county is reaching out to more than 80 labs to obtain test results for the past nine days to determine an accurate case count, and set up a system to receive data directly in the future so contact tracing efforts aren't delayed, the county's health department said in a statement.\n\nEven with the underreporting of cases, California has recorded more positive tests than any other state, about 520,000.\n\nGhaly said hospitalization data, which doesn't run through the same troubled system, has seen signs of improvement. The latest count Tuesday showed 6,302 people were hospitalized, a 12% drop from the high recorded in July. Deaths have now topped 9,500.\n\nAside from the delays, the number of infections is generally thought to be higher than the reported cases because many people haven't been tested, and studies suggest people can be infected without feeling sick. For most people, the virus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough, but for some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia, and death.",

        "body": "LOS ANGELES -- California has stopped removing or adding to a list of counties facing more restrictions on businesses and schools as it tries to resolve a technical problem with the state's coronavirus testing database, health officials said Wednesday.\n\nThe state has recorded a highest-in-the-nation 525,000 positive tests. But California health officials say the true number is even higher. They don't know how much so until they can add backlogged testing data and fix the problem with the California Reportable Disease Information Exchange, also known as CalREDIE.\n\nThe incomplete data in the nation's most populous state has hampered public health officials' ability to follow up with those who test positive and contact people who have been around them to limit the spread.\n\n\"Back in February and March when we didn't have enough testing, I would say we felt blind,\" said Dr. Sara Cody, Santa Clara County's public health director. \"I would say now we're back to feeling blind. We don't know how the epidemic is trending.\"\n\nIn Los Angeles County, which has a quarter of the state's 40 million residents, public health officials have reached out to labs to get testing data directly so they don't depend on the state. Barbara Ferrer, the county's health director, said she hopes to have an updated case count by the end of the week.\n\nThe CalREDIE system collects data from testing labs around California. The state uses data such as infection rates to determine which counties land on a watch list. Counties must come off the list for 14 days to be able to reopen certain businesses and offer in-classroom instruction for elementary students. There are 38 counties on the list, including Los Angeles and every other major county.\n\nIn a statement, the state Department of Public Health said as it works to \"assess the impact of the data issues on disease transmission metrics,\" no counties would be moved on or off the list \"until further notice.\"\n\nThe problem comes as California appears to be making progress against a surge of infections that led Gov. Gavin Newsom last month to close bars and indoor restaurant dining statewide and shutter school campuses in much of the state. On Wednesday, the state reported only about 5,300 new virus cases, a far cry from the peak of nearly 13,000 reported about two weeks ago.\n\nThe state's infection rate, a harbinger of how much hospitalizations are likely to increase, has dropped rapidly in the last week, when the data problem became apparent. It stood at 5.5% on Wednesday, but it's unclear if when the additional data is added the decline will be as pronounced.\n\nMeantime, the data on hospitalizations has shown improvement. It's collected differently, and in the last two weeks has fallen by more than 12% to 6,184 patients.\n\nCounty health officials say without knowing how many cases are missing it's hard to know where the virus is heading.\n\nIn Riverside County, public health officer Dr. Cameron Kaiser said the county's virus case rate now is frozen at a level that's too high for elementary schools to seek a waiver to reopen classrooms. Kaiser told school officials in a letter that the state won't accept waivers until the county has a reliable case rate and it's below the level mandated by the state -- 200 cases for every 100,00 residents. Riverside's rate now is 202.\n\nIn San Francisco, public health officials receive test reports directly from labs so they don't depend on the state to track or trace cases, said Dr. George Rutherford, epidemiologist at University of California, San Francisco. But long delays can make contact tracing -- seen as a critical tool to stop the spread of disease -- futile, he said.\n\n\"From a disease control standpoint, the more time people have walking around who are infected and infectious without getting isolated, the more people that are going to get exposed,\" he said.\n\nIn Los Angeles County, Ferrer urged anyone who tests positive to call county health officials so they can conduct a contact tracing interview and identify those who may have been exposed so they can avoid infecting others.\n\n\"We are really worried about the fact that we're losing some cases, and that that may in fact result in some small increases in transmission in the weeks ahead,\" she said.\n\nFor most people, the new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia and death.\n\nAssociated Press writer Olga Rodriguez in San Francisco and Adam Beam in Sacramento contributed to this report.",

        "body": "It seems possible, though how often it happens isn't known.\n\nResearchers in Hong Kong recently reported evidence of a person who got the coronavirus a second time, months after an initial infection.\n\nThe finding has not yet been published in a journal. But scientists said the 33-year-old man had mild symptoms the first time and none the second time, suggesting his immune system may have provided some protection against serious illness even if it could not prevent a reinfection. His more recent infection was detected through screening and testing at the Hong Kong airport, and researchers said genetic tests revealed different strains of the virus.\n\nSeveral other possible cases have been reported, including a U.S. man who was sicker the second time than the first.\n\nEven if people can get reinfected, the World Health Organization says it likely wouldn't happen regularly.\n\nHealth experts generally believe people who had COVID-19 will have some immunity against a repeat infection. But they don't know how much protection, or how long it would last.\n\nThis is important because if immunity wears off, it could pose a challenge for vaccines. Some experts say booster shots may be needed.\n\nIt's also unclear whether reinfected people would be able to spread the virus to others. That's another reason scientists say people should continue to wear masks, social distance and practice good hygiene.\n\n-- -- -- --\n\nThe AP is answering your questions about the coronavirus in this series.

        "body": "ST. LOUIS -- St. Louis Cardinals catcher Yadier Molina says he's one of the players on the team who tested positive for COVID-19.\n\nThe nine-time All-Star revealed his results Tuesday in a Spanish-language Instagram post. Soon afterward, the Cardinals issued a release naming six of the players who have tested positive.\n\nThe others are infielders Paul DeJong, Edmundo Sosa and Rangel Ravelo along with pitchers Junior Fernandez and Kodi Whitley.\n\n\"I am saddened to have tested positive for COVID-19, even after adhering to safety guidelines that were put in place,\" Molina said in a release issued by the team. \"I will do everything within my power to return as soon as possible for Cardinals fans, the city of St. Louis and my teammates.\"\n\nCardinals general manager John Mozeliak said Monday that seven players and six staff members had tested positive. At the time, Mozeliak said the people to test positive hadn't been identified publicly because they had declined to have their names released.\n\nThe Cardinals said Tuesday that six players had decided to grant permission to have their names revealed.\n\n\"I will approach my healing as I do all other things in my life - with education, commitment, and persistence. I look forward to re-joining the team soon and ask that you respect my privacy at this time,\" DeJong said in a statement released by the team.\n\nThe outbreak resulted in the postponement of the Cardinals' scheduled three-game weekend series at Milwaukee as well as a four-game series with Detroit that was supposed to run Monday through Thursday. The Cardinals have played just five games this season and are hoping to return to action Friday hosting the Chicago Cubs.\n\nAs of now, the Cardinals who have tested positive have returned home while the rest of the team remains isolated in Milwaukee hotel rooms. Their last game was July 29 at Minnesota.\n\nMozeliak said Monday that five of the 13 overall members of the Cardinals' traveling party to test positive were asymptomatic. The other eight had minor symptoms including headaches, coughs, sniffles and low-grade fevers. Mozeliak said none of the eight had required hospitalization.\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP -- Sports",

    "Choctaw Indians bear brunt of virus outbreak in Mississippi": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "PHILADELPHIA, Miss. -- When Sharon Taylor died of coronavirus, her family -- standing apart, wearing masks -- sang her favorite hymns at her graveside, next to a tiny headstone for her stillborn daughter, buried 26 years ago. Fresh flowers marked row after row of new graves. Holy Rosary is one of the only cemeteries in this Choctaw Indian family's community, and it's running out of space -- a sign of the virus's massive toll on the Choctaw people.\n\nAs confirmed coronavirus cases skyrocket in Mississippi, the state's only federally recognized American Indian tribe has been devastated. COVID-19 has ripped through Choctaw families, many of whom live together in multigenerational homes. Almost 10% of the tribe's roughly 11,000 members have tested positive for the virus. More than 75 have died. The once-flourishing Choctaw economy is stagnant, as the tribal government put in place tighter restrictions than those imposed by the state.\n\nJuly brought a glimmer of hope, with some numbers dropping among Choctaws, but health officials worry that with cases rising elsewhere in the state, the reprieve is only temporary. On Friday, Mississippi recorded its highest single-day coronavirus-related fatality count, 52.\n\nAs a community health technician, Taylor, 53, took the virus seriously from the start. She answered calls from tribe members with symptoms and delivered medicine. In June, she fell ill herself.\n\nKristina Taylor, 18, one of Sharon's five children, learned just before her mother was admitted to the hospital that she'd been named valedictorian of the tribal high school. Sharon had predicted the accomplishment for years -- in some of their last moments together, Kristina showed her mom the speech she'd prepared for graduation and the Choctaw beadwork her sister used to decorate her cap.\n\n\"We were just in tears. Usually, if I started crying, she started crying too,\" she said. \"She always had that faith in me, that I could do it, even when I doubted myself. She knew I could do it before I did.\"\n\nThat day, Sharon Taylor took her daughter to the family plot at Holy Rosary. It was always special: a place to mark important events, to be together, to visit the grave of baby Kerri. Other relatives are buried there, too, and it's where Sharon wanted her final resting place.\n\nBut the Rev. Bob Goodyear says there's not much more room to expand, in part because of another pandemic. The Spanish flu of 1918 took lives so quickly residents didn't even have time to put up markers, and 400 victims are buried in an open field on cemetery grounds.\n\n\"I pray it doesn't come to that this time,\" said Goodyear, whose Catholic church has always buried Choctaws, regardless of faith. The tribe recently voted to establish a community cemetery nearby, which will ease the burden, said Goodyear, who isn't a Choctaw but has ministered in the reservation community for decades.\n\nDr. Thomas Dobbs, the state health officer, said that like other Native American communities, coronavirus deaths among the Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians have been driven by underlying conditions such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease and high blood pressure, present in more than 80% of deadly Mississippi cases. The reservation hospital, where Taylor worked, can't handle severe coronavirus cases. They're sent to facilities elsewhere in the state - Taylor died 80 miles (129 kilometers) from home, in Jackson.\n\nIn Neshoba County, named for the Choctaw word for wolf, more than 25% of residents live under the poverty line. It's a rural area, characterized by dusty red clay and rolling pine-filled hills. The Golden Moon Casino on Highway 16, with a glittering moon on its roof, serves as a welcome to Choctaw land. From there, the reservation spreads out over 35,000 acres (14,164 hectares).\n\nChoctaw Indians used to live across millions of acres in southeastern Mississippi but were forced off the land. Under an 1830 treaty, the Choctaws were to move to Oklahoma. Those who remained in Mississippi endured segregation, racism and poverty.\n\nIn the 1990s, the Choctaws started building what became a strong tribal economy. They own a family-style resort with a water park and two casinos; the tribe is a leading employer in eastern Mississippi.\n\nBut the tribal government has been more conservative in reopening efforts during the pandemic than Republican Gov. Tate Reeves and other Mississippi officials. The tribe passed a mask requirement July 1, but Reeves refused to implement one statewide, until Tuesday. Choctaw casinos remain closed, more than two months after the state allowed casinos to reopen. About 2,000 employees are furloughed, the tribal chief said. The annual Choctaw Indian Fair, which draws thousands, was canceled.\n\nThe tribe has long been a target of hate, members say, and the virus has only made things worse. On social media, people blame Choctaws for high case numbers. Choctaw employees have been harassed at their jobs; others are called names in stores.\n\n\"We've heard so many bad things about ourselves and our people -- the first thing people turn to is blame and hate,\" said Marsha Berry, a tribe member who helped form a group that delivers food and other necessities to people self-isolating.\n\nAnita Johnson lives near the funeral home that has handled arrangements for all the Choctaws lost to the virus. Each time a funeral procession passes her house, her family stops what they're doing to pray.\n\n\"It seemed like in Choctaw families, that's all that was in front of us: You're going to get sick, you're going to get the fever, you're going to end up going to the hospital, and you're going to die,\" she said.\n\nWhen Sharon Taylor died, her family couldn't grieve as Choctaws normally would. Because of the chief's ban, there was no bonfire for the occasion, no wake with people dropping by for days to pay respects and drop off meals.\n\nInstead, at her graveside, her family shared stories of the woman who valued their tight-knit family and community above all else, who never missed a gathering and always had a grandchild on her lap. They sang the hymns she loved, the ones she'd sung to her kids, and then her grandkids.\n\nHer 25-year-old daughter, Kristi, is pregnant, and she'd like to name her baby girl for Sharon.\n\n\"She was always looking out for other people,\" Kristina Taylor said. \"Now, she's watching over us.\"\n\nLeah Willingham is a corps member for the Associated Press/Report for America Statehouse News Initiative.

        "body": "CHAPEL HILL, N.C. -- College freshman Mackenzie Holland spent two weeks in her dorm at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill before she found herself moving back out again on Tuesday, after the university canceled in-person classes for undergraduates when clusters of coronavirus infection surfaced among students.\n\nHolland said she sobbed for an hour after learning the news.\n\n\"I kind of expected it, but I'm just kind of disappointed in my classmates and the people that are out partying and stuff because now I can't finish my college experience,\" Holland said. \"I know that we'll be back one day, but it's just sad right now.\"\n\nThe virus that closed down North Carolina's flagship public university is making its mark on colleges -- and college towns -- around the United States. Some universities are reconsidering plans to hold in-person classes or implementing new testing regimes. Others are threatening crackdowns on students who get too close with others, in violation of social distancing rules.\n\nThe University of Oklahoma is requiring its sororities to recruit new members virtually after learning of students attending large social events without taking precautions against the virus.\n\nIn the last few days alone, college students in places including North Carolina, Tennessee, Oklahoma, Vermont, Kansas, Colorado and the Air Force Academy have tested positive, creating a ripple effect that has put hundreds of other students into quarantine or isolation.\n\nThe U.S. leads the world in the number of coronavirus cases, with 5.4 million cases reported as of Tuesday, and more than 170,000 confirmed dead, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.\n\nIn Chapel Hill, the university on Monday reported a spike in the proportion of its COVID tests coming back positive, prompting the university to move all classes online starting Wednesday.\n\n\"We had anticipated and planned for COVID cases on our campus this fall,\" UNC Chancellor Kevin Guskiewicz told faculty members in a Zoom call Monday. \"However, seeing the COVID-19 positivity rate rise from 2.8% to 13.6% at Campus Health over the past week is very concerning.\"\n\nOn Tuesday, a smattering of UNC-Chapel Hill students packed up their belongings and headed back home with their families. Oyeronke Popoola, a 17-year-old freshman living near two COVID-19 clusters, was taking a mix of online and in-person classes. She did not anticipate having to moving back to Raleigh with her family just eight days after classes started.\n\n\"I was surprised because I thought we were going to be better, but I guess not,\" Popoola said.\n\nHolland said she wants other colleges to learn from the Chapel Hill students who participated in large, maskless gatherings.\n\n\"A lot of kids our age don't understand the result of their actions, and this is kind of showing what can result of that,\" Holland said.\n\nStudents at the University of Tennessee at Knoxville could face punishments as stiff as expulsion if they are \"irresponsible\" in hosting big parties, if they won't cooperate with COVID-19 contact tracing or if they don't complete forms documenting their self-isolation, the chancellor said Tuesday.\n\n\"It's possible that you could be expelled from school and I will not hesitate to do that if people, our students, are irresponsible,\" Chancellor Donde Plowman said in a video conference.\n\nPlowman also noted five cases linked to an off-campus party last week.\n\nWednesday is the first day of classes at the flagship Knoxville campus. School officials have confirmed 75 active COVID-19 cases there, involving 66 students and nine employees. About 6,500 students have moved in on campus, while another 30,000-plus live off campus.\n\nThe campus currently has 270 people in isolation due to contacts, symptoms or positive tests, including 51 students living on campus, Plowman said.\n\nSome neighbors in college towns are fearful that students could spread the virus outside of campus and overwhelm local health care systems. In Flagstaff, Arizona, Vice Mayor Adam Shimoni said he would like the University of Northern Arizona to cancel in-person classes for the semester.\n\nHe told the Arizona Daily Sun this month that he wasn't sure how the influx of students might affect spread of the virus, \"but what we do know is that COVID is alive and well ... and it's not necessarily getting better.\"\n\nIn Ames, Iowa, a retired Iowa State professor wrote in an op-ed to the Des Moines Register that he was alarmed at what he witnessed while driving through the Iowa State campus last weekend.\n\n\"Hundreds of students, out on the sidewalks, out on the front lawns, out in the street; in some places, sitting in chairs or milling aimlessly or running around and hugging each other because they hadn't seen each other since last school year,\" Richard Haws said.\n\nHe estimated that 1% of the students were wearing masks.\n\nMeanwhile, the University of South Carolina said it would use saliva tests for students, faculty and staff as part of its plan to reopen for in-person classes on Thursday. The tests, which require a single spit sample, are an alternative to nasal swab tests and typically deliver results within 24 hours.\n\nOther higher education institutions in South Carolina, including Clemson University and the College of Charleston, are delaying the start of in-person teaching due to the pandemic.\n\nThe University of South Carolina said Nephron Pharmaceuticals donated 50,000 sample tubes and a robot for processing samples. The university is one of a handful of universities nationwide approved for the tests.\n\nLiu reported from Columbia, South Carolina.

        "body": "FORT COLLINS, Colo. -- Colorado State president Joyce McConnell says she will launch an investigation into how the athletic department handled COVID-19 safety protocols amid a report that players were told not to reveal symptoms.\n\nThe investigation stems from an article published in the Coloradoan on Tuesday. According to the newspaper report, Colorado State football players and members of the athletic staff say coaches told them not to report coronavirus symptoms and threatened players with reduced playing time should they quarantine.\n\nMcConnell promised a swift investigation and full transparency.\n\n\"The story raises concerns about whether the health and well-being of our student athletes is truly the top priority of Colorado State University,\" McConnell said in a statement. \"Let me reiterate: the health and well-being of the CSU community is our top priority.\"\n\nColorado State voluntarily paused football team activities on July 29. The school said there have been 16 positive cases among all student-athletes, including 11 in football.\n\nOn Monday, Colorado State announced it had conducted 150 tests on student-athletes for the coronavirus. The results are expected later this week.\n\n\"We take the concerns of our student athletes extremely seriously,\" McConnell said. \"If we learn that there are any employees of CSU Athletics who do not share Colorado State University's commitment to student health and well-being above all else, we will address the issue immediately.\"\n\nDirector of athletics Joe Parker said in a statement he embraces the investigation. He said the report that student-athletes were instructed to withhold symptoms would \"run counter to repeated communications we have had with our staff and student-athletes.\"\n\n\"This is unacceptable and will be dealt with swiftly,\" Parker maintained.\n\nRams football head coach Steve Addazio added in a statement: \"Health and welfare of our student-athletes on the Colorado State football team is our top priority, and I fully support president McConnell's investigation into concerns about whether these protocols were properly followed by everyone involved with our program.\"\n\nAddazio was hired in December after spending seven seasons with Boston College. The Rams are scheduled to open the season Sept. 19 by hosting Northern Colorado.\n\nMore AP college football: https://apnews.com/Collegefootball and https://twitter.com/AP -- Top25",

        "body": "FORT COLLINS, Colo. -- Colorado State is pausing all football activities after an investigation started by the president of the university into the program's handling of COVID-19 cases uncovered allegations of racism and verbal abuse toward athletes.\n\nAthletic director Joe Parker said he asked President Joyce McConnell to expand the investigation she announced Tuesday to include a comprehensive review of the athletic department and football program.\n\n\"Today, we learned of some extremely troubling allegations of racism and verbal abuse from CSU's athletic administration generally and in the football program specifically,\" Parke said.\n\nParker's statement did not mention any particular member of the coaching staff or athletic department. Steve Addazio is in his first season as head coach of the Rams.\n\nMcConnell announced the investigation Tuesday after an article published in the Coloradoan that quoted unidentified football players and members of the athletic staff saying coaches told them not to report coronavirus symptoms and threatened players with reduced playing time should they quarantine.\n\n\"Colorado State University is committed to being an anti-racist university, and we will not tolerate any behavior or climate that goes against that core value,\" Parker said. \"Moreover, CSU Athletics is committed to the health and well-being of student-athletes above all other priorities, and this includes their mental health.

    "Companies test antibody drugs to treat, prevent COVID-19": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "With a coronavirus vaccine still months off, companies are rushing to test what may be the next best thing: drugs that deliver antibodies to fight the virus right away, without having to train the immune system to make them.\n\nAntibodies are proteins the body makes when an infection occurs; they attach to a virus and help it be eliminated. Vaccines work by tricking the body into thinking there's an infection so it makes antibodies and remembers how to do that if the real bug turns up.\n\nBut it can take a month or two after vaccination or infection for the most effective antibodies to form. The experimental drugs shortcut that process by giving concentrated versions of specific ones that worked best against the coronavirus in lab and animal tests.\n\n\"A vaccine takes time to work, to force the development of antibodies. But when you give an antibody, you get immediate protection,\" said University of North Carolina virologist Dr. Myron Cohen. \"If we can generate them in large concentrations, in big vats in an antibody factory ... we can kind of bypass the immune system.\"\n\nThese drugs are believed to last for a month or more and could give quick, temporary immunity to people at high risk of infection, such as health workers and housemates of someone with COVID-19. If they proved effective and if a vaccine doesn't materialize or protect as hoped, the drugs might eventually be considered for wider use, perhaps for teachers or other groups.\n\nThey're also being tested as treatments, to help the immune system and prevent severe symptoms or death.\n\n\"The hope there is to target people who are in the first week of their illness and that we can treat them with the antibody and prevent them from getting sick,\" said Dr. Marshall Lyon, an infectious disease specialist helping to test one such drug at Emory University in Atlanta.\n\nHaving such a tool \"would be a really momentous thing in our fight against COVID,\" Cohen said.\n\nVaccines are seen as a key to controlling the virus, which has been confirmed to have infected more than 20 million people worldwide and killed more than 738,000. Several companies are racing to develop vaccines, but the results of the large final tests needed to evaluate them are months away.\n\nThe antibody drugs are \"very promising\" and, in contrast, could be available \"fairly soon,\" said Dr. Janet Woodcock, a U.S. Food and Drug Administration official who is leading government efforts to speed COVID-19 therapies. Key studies are underway and some answers should come by early fall.\n\nOne company, Eli Lilly, has already started manufacturing its antibody drug, betting that studies now underway will give positive results.\n\n\"Our goal is to get something out as soon as possible\" and to have hundreds of thousands of doses ready by fall, said Lilly's chief scientific officer, Dr. Daniel Skovronsky.\n\nAnother company that developed an antibody drug cocktail against Ebola -- Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc. -- now is testing one for coronavirus.\n\n\"The success with our Ebola program gives us some confidence that we can potentially do this again,\" said Christos Kyratsous, a Regeneron microbiologist who helped lead that work.\n\nRegeneron's drug uses two antibodies to enhance chances the drug will work even if the virus evolves to evade action by one.\n\nLilly is testing two different, single-antibody drugs -- one with the Canadian company AbCellera and another with a Chinese company, Junshi Biosciences. In July, Junshi said no safety concerns emerged in 40 healthy people who tried it and that larger studies were getting underway.\n\nOthers working on antibody drugs include Amgen and Adaptive Biotechnologies. The Singapore biotech company Tychan Pte Ltd. also is testing an antibody drug and has similar products in development for Zika virus and yellow fever.\n\n\"I'm cautiously optimistic\" about the drugs, said the nation's top infectious diseases expert, Dr. Anthony Fauci. \"I'm heartened by the experience that we had with Ebola,\" where the drugs proved effective.\n\nWhat could go wrong?\n\n-- The antibodies may not reach all of the places in the body where they need to act, such as deep in the lungs. All the antibody drugs are given through an IV and must make their way through the bloodstream to wherever they're needed.\n\n-- The virus might mutate to avoid the antibody -- the reason Regeneron is testing a two-antibody combo that binds to the virus in different places to help prevent its escape.\n\nSkovronsky said Lilly stuck with one antibody because manufacturing capacity would essentially be cut in half to make two, and \"you will have less doses available.\" If a single antibody works, \"we can treat twice as many people,\" he said.\n\n-- The antibodies might not last long enough. If they fade within a month, it's still OK for treatment since COVID-19 illness usually resolves in that time. But for prevention, it may not be practical to give infusions more often than every month or two.\n\nA San Francisco company, Vir Biotechnology Inc., says it has engineered antibodies to last longer than they usually do to avoid this problem. GlaxoSmithKline has invested $250 million in Vir to test them.\n\nGiving a higher dose also may help. If half of antibodies disappear after a month, \"if you give twice as much, you will have two months' protection,\" Lilly's Skovronsky said.\n\n-- The big fear: Antibodies may do the opposite of what's hoped and actually enhance the virus's ability to get into cells or stimulate the immune system in a way that makes people sicker. It's a theoretical concern that hasn't been seen in testing so far, but large, definitive experiments are needed to prove safety.\n\n\"As best as we can tell, the antibodies are helpful,\" Lyon said.\n\nMarilynn Marchione can be followed on Twitter: @MMarchioneAP\n\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute's Department of Science Education.

        "authors": [],
        "body": "KINSHASA, Congo -- Congo is seeing an upsurge in cases of the plague, as the vast Central African nation also battles outbreaks of COVID-19 and Ebola.\n\nSince June, Congo has recorded at least 65 cases of the plague, including at least 10 deaths, in the eastern Ituri province according to Ituri provincial chief of health Dr. Louis Tsolu.\n\nWhile the plague is endemic in Ituri province, the number of cases is increasing and has already surpassed the total recorded in 2019 which had 48 cases and eight deaths, according to WHO.\n\nThe new plague outbreak appears to have started in June when a 12-year-old girl in the Rethy health zone died with symptoms related to the plague -- headache, cough, enlarged lymph nodes, and a fever. More deaths in that area were later recorded with symptoms of the plague, which manifests in three different forms: Bubonic, septicemic and pneumonic.\n\nThe transmission of bubonic plague between humans usually occurs when people do not take preventive measures, especially in Congo when they follow traditional burial practices in which they wash and touch the corpses of those who died from the disease, authorities say. The plague is initially transmitted to humans who are bitten by fleas living on rodents. Antibiotics are usually used in treatment.\n\nThis year health workers are finding it difficult to assist people in eastern Congo because of insecurity caused by armed militias. The plague cases have also increased while Congo is also fighting COVID-19, which has infected more than 10,100 people and killed at least 260. There is also an Ebola outbreak in the western Equateur province, which has killed 43 people, although in June Congo succeeded in bringing to an end a larger Ebola outbreak in the east that lasted for nearly two years and killed nearly 2,300 people.\n\nThe plague is mostly endemic in Congo, Peru and Madagascar, which saw a large outbreak in 2017 with more than 2,300 cases and 202 deaths, according to WHO.",

    "Depression rates tripled during the pandemic: Study": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "Widespread trauma could have a devastating effect on mental health.\n\nThe percentage of Americans reporting symptoms of depression more than tripled during the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, according to a new study.\n\nIn surveys conducted prior to the pandemic, 9% of respondents reported depressive symptoms, researchers found. Once the pandemic hit, that percentage jumped to 28% of respondents, according to new survey data.\n\nThe nationally representative survey was conducted between March 31 and April 13, 2020.\n\nMental health effects following widespread traumatic events, such natural disasters, terrorist attacks and civil unrest, are well documented in scientific literature. Despite that existing research, Catherine Ettman, lead author of the study, which was published in JAMA Network Open on Wednesday, said the magnitude of depression symptoms during COVID-19 surprised her.\n\n\"The scope is much larger than what we've seen in the past,\" said Ettman, a doctoral student at Brown University's School of Public Health who works at the Boston University School of Public Health.\n\n\"These rates were higher than what we've seen in the general population after other widespread trauma,\" she added, referring to depression and anxiety that researchers observed following Hurricane Katrina, the 9/11 terrorist attacks and more recently following extended civil unrest in Hong Kong.\n\nA confluence of factors are likely driving the surge in depression symptoms, Ettman explained. \"This is both COVID and the fear and anxiety around COVID, as well as the dramatic economic consequences,\" she said.\n\nLike the pandemic itself, which has disproportionately affected marginalized people and front-line workers, the mental health burden of COVID-19 is borne primarily by poor people with few societal resources.\n\nCompared to 28% of general population, 47% of people with a household income less than $20,000 and 41% of people with household savings under $5,000 reported symptoms of depression.\n\nAdditional stressors like losing a job, having a friend or family member die of COVID-19 or financial problems were also linked to feeling depressed. Forty-three percent of respondents with high exposure to traumatic stressors during the pandemic reported symptoms of depression, researchers found. Since the United States' COVID-19 outbreak hit different parts of the country at different times, researchers were not able to investigate regional differences in depression.\n\nGiven the disproportionate burden on people with fewer resources, the survey results speak to the need for public services, like livable wages, affordable housing and health insurance that's not tied to employment, Ettman said.\n\n\"Societal efforts to support people with fewer resources will be essential to mitigate the mental health burden of this pandemic,\" she said. \"We need to make sure people have resource that they need to weather difficult times.\"\n\nMany people with depression and anxiety weren't getting necessary treatment even before the pandemic. Fewer than one third of people who could benefit from mental health care got the services they need, according to the National Alliance on Mental Illness.\n\nSuicide rates in the United States were also on the rise before COVID-19. Experts worry that the pandemic could drive rates even higher. Sales of firearms, which are the most common suicide method for men and for women, have skyrocketed during the pandemic, with an estimated 2 million excess weapons purchased between March and May than normally would have been bought, according to Federal Bureau of Investigation's background check data.\n\nA separate paper Ettman published this summer in the American Journal of Epidemiology examined the link between financial strain and suicide. In a commentary published with the paper, Ettman noted that the pandemic \"presents a unique set of risk exposures to populations, which may lead to an increase in suicide.\"\n\nThere are four dimensions of financial strain -- debt, unemployment, past homelessness and lower income -- that are associated with subsequent suicide attempts, Ettman explained. Then she drew a sobering conclusion. \"With populations facing record-breaking unemployment, economic recession, and reduced wages, we can anticipate an increase in suicide in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic,\" she wrote.\n\nIf you are struggling with thoughts of suicide or worried about a friend or loved one help is available. Call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-8255 [TALK] - for free confidential emotional support 24 hours a day 7 days a week. Even if it feels like it - you are not alone.",

    "Depression, anxiety spike amid outbreak and turbulent times": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "Mental health therapists' caseloads are bulging. Waiting lists for appointments are growing. And anxiety and depression are rising among Americans amid the coronavirus crisis, research suggests.\n\nIn the latest study to suggest an uptick, half of U.S. adults surveyed reported at least some signs of depression, such as hopelessness, feeling like a failure or getting little pleasure from doing things. That's double the rate from a different survey two years ago, Boston University researchers said Wednesday in the medical journal JAMA Network Open.\n\nThe study did not ask about any diagnosis they might have received, and for many people, the problem is mostly angst rather than full-blown psychiatric illness. But experts say the feeling is genuine and deserving of professional help.\n\nFor some people, it stems from lost loved ones and the financial distress and social isolation the outbreak has caused. Experts say Americans are also feeling anxiety over the racial and political upheaval of the past few months, though the BU study was conducted before the recent tumult.\n\n\"There is no question that many people in the U.S. and worldwide are experiencing real and often distressing emotional reactions to the COVID-19 pandemic and, in some cases, to contracting the virus,'' said psychiatrist Dr. Ronald Pies, a retired professor at SUNY Upstate Medical University.\n\nThe global outbreak has caused more than 850,000 deaths and almost 26 million confirmed infections. U.S. cases total 6 million, with about 185,000 deaths. The crisis has also thrown millions out of work, crippled the economy and forced shutdowns of bars, restaurants, theaters and gyms.\n\nCalls to the U.S. government-funded Disaster Distress Helpline, which offers counseling and emotional support, surged 335% from March through July.\n\n\"Helpline counselors have reported callers expressing feelings of isolation and interpersonal concerns related to physical distancing such as being cut off from social supports,\" said Hannah Collins, a spokeswoman for Vibrant Emotional Health, a group that runs the helpline.\n\nWhile not all calls are COVID-19-related, many people have sought help for anxiety and fear about getting the virus, distress over being diagnosed, or anguish over the illness or death of a loved one, she said.\n\nThe BU study involved a survey of 1,440 U.S. adults questioned about depression symptoms in early April. Symptoms were most common in young adults, low-income participants and in those who reported several outbreak-related troubles, including financial problems, lost jobs or COVID-19 deaths of relatives. Almost 1,000 participants had experienced at least of three such struggles.\n\nThe study results echo research from China early in the outbreak, and studies done during the Ebola and SARS crises and after major hurricanes and 9/11, said lead author Dr. Sandro Galea, a BU public health expert.\n\nThe survey was done before the U.S. spike in civil unrest, including the May 24 death of George Floyd, who authorities say was killed when a Minneapolis police officer pressed a knee on his neck for several minutes. But Galea said that other studies have shown increases in depression symptoms after traumatic events and that it is likely the unrest has contributed to American angst.\n\nAt Cityscape Counseling in Chicago, the new client caseload jumped from 95 to 148 over the past two months, said executive director Chelsea Hudson. The group's 17 therapists see about 500 clients a week, and Hudson said she has hired two more therapists to deal with the increased demand.\n\n\"We see a lot of single young professionals. I think it's been especially tough on them. The isolation, lack of connection, often enhances depression,\" she said.\n\nHudson said many clients are distressed about social justice issues. With more free time, she said, they are paying more attention to the news, and Chicago has been hit by vandalism and protests over killings by police.\n\nShe said there is \"a general consensus in the mental health field on our need to be ready to brush up on our trauma training. Right now people are still in a state of shock.\"\n\nWendy Zirbel of Dodge County, Wisconsin, said she developed anxiety and depression after testing positive for the virus in June. She said that was partly from getting sick -- she still has breathing and memory troubles -- and partly from her husband's reaction.\n\n\"He thought COVID was a joke and that it's all Democrats trying to get Trump out of office,\" she said. \"It still hurts.\"\n\nZirbel, 45, said she spent days in tears, and her doctor prescribed an antidepressant.\n\n''It was just overwhelming for a couple of weeks. I just couldn't function,\" she said. \"That's totally not me. I'm usually the one that's making people laugh.\"\n\nThe first therapist she called had a waiting list. She is hoping sessions with the one she found will help.\n\n\"I need someone to help me get the tools to cope,\" she said.\n\nTodd Creager, a Southern California therapist who specializes in relationship troubles, has upped his weekly workload from 22 hours of therapy to 30 to handle increased demand. He is seeing anxiety, depression and stress related to financial woes brought on by the pandemic. And in some cases, virus-related shutdowns have amplified existing strife.\n\n''In the past, people could get distracted by going to concerts and dinners. Now their problems are kind of staring them in the face,\" he said. ''I've heard people say, 'This pandemic has made me realize how toxic my relationship is.'\"\n\nFollow AP Medical Writer Lindsey Tanner at @LindseyTanner.\n\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute's Department of Science Education.

    "Distrust of authority fuels virus misinformation for Latinos": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "MEMPHIS, Tenn. -- When Claudia Guzman suspected she had caught the coronavirus, her friends and family were full of advice: Don't quarantine. Don't get tested. A homemade tea will help cure you.\n\n\"They were saying, 'Don't go to the hospital,' because supposedly, if you are admitted into the hospital, they administer the virus into your body,\" said Guzman, who was born in Chicago to parents from Mexico and now lives in Memphis, Tennessee.\n\nFalse claims and conspiracy theories, ranging from bogus cures to the idea that the virus is a hoax, have dogged efforts to control the pandemic from the beginning. While bad information about the virus is a problem for everyone, it can pose a particular threat to communities of people of color who already face worse outcomes from the virus.\n\nAmong Latinos in the U.S., misinformation around the coronavirus has found fertile ground because many in their communities have higher levels of distrust in government, less access to medical care and may need to be reached by Spanish-language public health resources. It's a dangerous mix that could discourage people from taking precautions, participating in contact-tracing efforts, or getting treatment.\n\n\"There isn't much evidence-based information in Spanish for them. And this is a new disease, so the science is evolving every day,\" said William Calo, a Pennsylvania State University researcher who studies Hispanics and public health. \"We are struggling with providing good information in English -- just imagine adding a second language.\"\n\nWith a population of 60 million, Hispanic people in the U.S. are now four times more likely than non-Hispanic white people to be hospitalized because of COVID-19, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Other studies also show Latinos in some areas are also twice as likely to die from the illness. (Native Americans and Black people face similarly stark disparities.)\n\nThese vulnerabilities have many causes. Among them are the fact that many Latinos are less likely to have health insurance or access to quality health care -- sometimes because they can't afford it and sometimes because of their immigration status. Many work in industries that are deemed essential and cannot be performed remotely, such as food service, sanitation, meat packing, construction and retail. And many live in larger, multigenerational households where social distancing is difficult.\n\nAdded to this already dangerous mix is a higher level of distrust in authority among Latinos -- as is the case for other minority communities -- that is helping fuel the spread of misinformation about the virus.\n\n\"If I'm hearing something from the government, from people who I, for a variety of reasons, don't trust, then I'm not going to do anything,\" said Monica Feli\u00fa-M\u00f3jer a Puerto Rican native and Harvard-trained neurobiologist who works to encourage Latinos to pursue science careers. \"But if I hear this from my friend who I believe in, and who I trust, then it's more likely that I'm going to act on that information.\"\n\nFor many, the reluctance to get tested or seek treatment stems from fear of deportation in a community with a significant percentage of immigrants. That may be particularly true under President Donald Trump, said New York State Sen. Gustavo Rivera, a Democrat who represents a largely Hispanic district in the Bronx. Trump ran on promises to crack down on both illegal and legal immigration and has repeatedly painted immigrants -- especially nonwhites -- as posing a public health and safety danger.\n\nThat distrust could discourage people from getting treatment or from cooperating with government contact tracers trying to identify who an infected person had come into contact with.\n\n\"It's a real concern,\" Rivera said of the worries some Latinos have about contact tracing. \"We need to secure that information, and there needs to be a guarantee of its privacy.\"\n\nLanguage barriers make the situation even worse. Many areas face a shortage of Spanish-speaking health care workers, and most of the accurate online information about the virus in the U.S. is in English. That forces some Latinos who need information in Spanish to rely on less-trusted sources like social media. And while a growing number of fact-checking organizations are trying to identify and correct false claims spreading online, very few publish their work in Spanish. The Associated Press publishes some of its fact checks in Spanish.\n\nAll of this means Latinos may not receive good information about how to slow the spread of the virus -- and may not act on it if they do. Guzman, for instance, thinks she contracted the virus at a vigil last month for her grandfather, who died of cancer soon after. Many of the people there either weren't wearing facial masks or didn't have them on correctly. About 10 family members subsequently were diagnosed with the coronavirus.\n\nGuzman, who is a medical assistant, knew to push back when friends and relatives passed along false claims and theories. For example, her parents suggested she wouldn't have to quarantine if she drank a homemade tea of lemon, honey and ginger.\n\n\"I had to tell them, 'No, that's not true. In order to stop spreading it, you have to stay home,'\" said the 27-year-old, who had mild symptoms that lasted a few days. She spent time in quarantine before returning to work.\n\nHer boss, Venezuela-born Dr. Pedro Velasquez-Mieyer, is the chief medical officer of two clinics in Memphis that serve mainly Latino and Black patients. He said he's heard from patients who won't wear masks, or who liken COVID-19 to the chicken pox and say they want to get infected so they'll develop immunity.\n\n\"They are part of their own network of misinformation, and nobody is actually saying, 'This is false, this is not reliable,'\" he said. \"They keep sending the message.\"\n\nFeli\u00fa-M\u00f3jer says it's just as important to control rumors as it is to control the virus.\n\n\"Just like people can stay home and wear masks and wash their hands and keep their physical distance to prevent the spread of the coronavirus, people can also take simple steps to prevent the spread of misinformation,\" she said.\n\nKlepper reported from Providence, Rhode Island, and Garcia Cano from Washington.",

Energy level is high. Really no symptoms whatsoever. I'm very fortunate.\"\n\nThe 52-year-old Pederson enters his fifth season as Philadelphia's head coach. He has led the Eagles to three straight playoff appearances and the franchise's first Super Bowl victory following the 2017 season.\n\n\"I think one of the things I've learned this offseason is, I can still run the team virtually,\" Pederson said. \"I just finished up a bunch of player meetings. Duce assumes my role in the day-to-day activities in the building.

The league canceled the exhibition schedule and players are going through intense testing.\n\n\"My confidence hasn't changed at all,\" he said. \"I'm extremely optimistic. I feel like we're going to play. I'm confident we're going to play.\"\n\nThe Eagles placed offensive linemen Lane Johnson and Jordan Mailata and linebacker Nathan Gerry on the Reserve/COVID-19 list last week. The list is for players who either test positive or have been exposed to someone who has. Johnson later said he tested positive.\n\nWide receiver Marquise Goodwin opted out of playing this season due to family concerns.\n\nPer NFL protocols, Pederson can return to the team's practice facility after waiting 10 days since his first positive test if he remains asymptomatic, or at least five days if he has consecutive negative tests at least 24 hours apart during that five-day span.\n\nPederson is the second NFL head coach known to test positive.

    "Experts flag risks in India's use of rapid tests for virus": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "NEW DELHI, India -- In June, India began using cheaper, faster but less accurate tests to scale up testing for the coronavirus -- a strategy that the United States is now considering.\n\nThese rapid tests boosted India's testing levels nearly five-fold within two months. But government numbers suggest some parts of the country might have become over reliant on the faster tests, which can miss infections. Experts warn that safely using them requires frequent retesting, something that isn't always happening.\n\nCases surged faster than labs could scale up testing once India's harsh lockdown was relaxed. So far authorities have rationed the use of the more precise molecular tests that detect the genetic code of the virus. But on June 14, India decided to bolster these with faster tests that screen for antigens, or viral proteins.\n\nAlbeit less accurate, these tests are cheap and yield results in minutes. Most don't require a lab for processing or any specialized equipment or trained personnel. The plan was to rapidly increase testing to identify infected people and prevent them from spreading the virus. Samples tested using both tests increased from 5.6 million in mid-June to 26 million two months later, and nearly a third of all tests conducted daily are now antigen tests, health officials say.\n\nBut India's experience also highlights the inherent pitfalls of relying too heavily on antigen tests, at the expense of more accurate tests. The danger is that the tests may falsely clear many who are infected with COVID-19, contributing to new spread of the virus in hard-hit areas.\n\nRapid test results can be backstopped with more accurate laboratory tests, but these are slower and expensive. Experts also warn that since the two types of tests vary in accuracy, they need to be interpreted separately to properly assess the spread of infection -- something India isn't doing.\n\nThe U.S. faces a similar need to strike a balance between speed and precision, with overburdened labs struggling to keep pace with the outbreak. Researchers at Harvard and elsewhere are proposing developing a $1 saliva-based antigen test for all Americans to test themselves daily, something that has not yet been approved by the Food and Drug Administration.\n\nHarvard's Dr. Michael Mina says antigen tests don't catch as many patients early in the infection, when virus levels are low. But these people aren't considered the greatest threat to spreading the disease since it's only after virus levels surge that they become more infectious, and by then they will be picked up by antigen tests, he said.\n\nBecause a negative antigen test doesn't guarantee a person is virus free, people should be retested regularly, said Dr. Ashish Jha, director of Harvard's Global Health Institute. \"If their symptoms change, you want to think about retesting those people.\"\n\nIndia's strategy is different. Health officials have asked for those who test negative with antigen tests but have symptoms to be retested with the more accurate laboratory tests.\n\nBut India has largely been opaque about how many negatives were being retested, and what type of tests were being used.\n\nDelhi state, which includes the Indian capital, New Delhi, and where the High Court is monitoring testing, was among the first to aggressively use antigen tests to screen patients for free. Centers were created in dispensaries, schools and government offices. But only 0.5%, or 1,365 of over 260,000 people who tested negative from June 18 to July 29, were retested, court documents show. Delhi conducted over 280,000 tests in this period.\n\n\"That is abysmally low,\" said Dr. S.P. Kalantri, a public health specialist in Maharashtra, India's worst-hit state. He said the decline in use of more precise lab tests by nearly half, from a capacity of 11,000 tests daily to just 5,400 tests per day, was a worrying trend\n\nUnder guidelines set by the World Health Organization, India should be conducting around 140 daily tests per million people in order to safely relax coronavirus restrictions.\n\nRajesh Bhushan, India's top health official, has repeatedly pointed to India's cumulative total of the two types of test to assert that India is testing more than the WHO standard. Authorities also use this to calculate the percentage of samples testing positive, which is a key metric for judging testing performance.\n\nBut Jha said combined data from the two types of tests can't be used to conclude that infections in India are going down, since using less accurate tests would automatically drive down the number of positive results.\n\nExperts fear that over-reliance on antigen tests without retesting could impede efforts to contain the virus as it spreads to states with fragile health care systems, like Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, with a combined population of over 300 million.\n\nThe two states now conduct over 100,000 tests daily, the most in India. But only a fraction -- 6,100 in Bihar and 30,000 in Uttar Pradesh -- use laboratory tests.\n\nJha said the antigen tests were a way to expand testing for people who don't have access to laboratory tests, but that didn't mean use of the more accurate tests should lessen.\n\n\"I want both,\" he said. The rapid test \"isn't a perfect substitute.\"\n\nPerrone reported from Washington.

    "Facing a coronavirus crisis, Israel calls in the army": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "RAMLE, Israel -- Over a three-decade military career, Israeli Maj. Gen. Ori Gordin has led commando raids, fought in wars and even earned a degree at Harvard. But he has never seen anything quite like his latest mission.\n\nAs head of the Israeli army's Home Front Command, Gordin is now overseeing the military's coronavirus \"task force,\" formed last month to bring one of the developed world's worst outbreaks under control. Its main responsibility is taking the lead in contact tracing and breaking chains of infection.\n\n\"This is a operation on a different scale,\" Gordin told The Associated Press, speaking in his first interview since taking over the Home Front Command in May.\n\nIsrael appeared to be a model of crisis management last spring, when the coronavirus first arrived. Authorities quickly sealed the borders and imposed tough lockdown measures, bringing the number of new infections down to just a handful each day in May.\n\nBut officials reopened the economy too quickly, and the virus soon returned. Throughout the summer, the rate of new cases has remained at record levels, while the death toll has steadily climbed to over 900 people.\n\nUnder heavy public pressure, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in July appointed Dr. Ronni Gamzu, a respected hospital director and former Health Ministry director, as the national \"coronavirus project manager.\"\n\nOne of Gamzu's first acts was to turn to the military for help, giving it the critical mission of cutting the chain of infections.\n\n\"You have to have the best operational forces, and in Israel, it's the IDF,\" he told journalists recently, referring to the Israel Defense Forces.\n\nFounded in the wake of Iraqi Scud missile attacks on Israel during the 1991 Gulf War, the Home Front Command serves as Israel's civil defense force. It helps maintain the country's network of bomb shelters and air raid sirens, and is trained to assist civilians during wars and natural disasters. It has sent rescue teams around the world to help countries coping with earthquakes, tsunamis and other emergencies.\n\nFor months, the command has been managing a network of coronavirus hotels, providing both isolation facilities and recovery services for infected people with mild symptoms. Its soldiers have also distributed food and supplies in hard-hit areas -- including communities that have had little contact with the military, such as Arab towns and ultra-Orthodox Jewish neighborhoods.\n\nMorad Ammash, the head of the municipal council of the Arab town of Jisr al-Zarqa, said the command worked well with his community when it dealt with an outbreak in March.\n\n\"They helped us with public information, managing the system, handing out food to the needy,\" he said. \"A good connection was formed.\"\n\nGordin said public trust in the military is perhaps his most important asset. He said the army's experience in emergency management and its bottomless pool of manpower also are key strengths.\n\nWorking under the direction of the Health Ministry, his task force acts largely as a coordinator and support body for civilian authorities in four key areas: expanding the number of tests; working with labs to speed up the results; interviewing those who are infected to identify who has been in contact with them; and quickly placing those at risk into quarantine.\n\nIt is also working closely with municipalities, other government ministries, medical rescue services, police and public and private labs to help streamline the national response.\n\n\"It's like the management of one large factory,\" Gordin said. \"I can bring them all to one table and cooperate effectively and synchronize them in an effective manner.\"\n\nAt the Home Front Command's headquarters in central Israel, the task force has already set up a situation room. On a recent day, masked military officials sat alongside officials from the Health Ministry and other government ministries, representatives of municipalities and health-care providers, plotting strategies as they analyzed data on large TV screens.\n\nUpstairs was the \"hotel unit,\" where workers keep tabs on the thousands of people staying in the 25 facilities the force is managing. In nearby military tents, dozens of uniformed soldiers sat in front of computer screens, interviewing newly infected patients to retrace their steps and contacts.\n\nEpidemiological experts from the Health Ministry, including an Arabic speaking Druze nurse, hovered about to offer guidance and answer questions. The contact-tracing data is fed in real time to the Health Ministry.\n\n\"Our goal is to stop the chain early on,\" Gordin said. \"If you don't do it fast enough, it's not relevant.\"\n\nIsrael is not the first to enlist the military in the war on the coronavirus. Throughout Latin America, soldiers have delivered food, monitored traffic and and enforced stay-at-home orders, while in China, the Communist Party's military wing brought some 1,400 doctors, nurses and experts to the city of Wuhan, the epicenter of the pandemic, to build two hospitals and treat patients early this year.\n\nA military-led task force in Australia has helped local authorities with contact tracing, and Spain announced last week that the military is offering 2,000 soldiers to regional governments to assist in contact tracing.\n\nGiven Israel's relatively small size of just 9 million people, the new task force appears to be among the world's most ambitious efforts. It already has enlisted 2,300 soldiers and expects to soon hit 3,000, in addition to the many civilian local officials and medical professionals.\n\nWhile the task force is still in its early stages, Gordin said it has already been able to increase the number of daily tests and shorten the time for receiving results. Soldiers have conducted almost 2,000 interviews.\n\n\"I think that by Nov. 1 we should be in control of the situation. That's our desire,\" he said.\n\nDespite the ambitious goals, the country faces some serious obstacles.\n\nMedical professionals say the nation's epidemiological system is overstretched after years of government neglect.\n\nGamzu, the national coronavirus czar, has also found himself feuding with politicians and powerful interest groups, all while trying to avoid another national lockdown.\n\nHe has been clashing with politically powerful religious parties, for instance, over his refusal to allow traditional September pilgrimages to the grave of a revered rabbi in Ukraine. Arab communities continue to hold large weddings -- a popular custom despite the high infection rate plaguing the Arab population. The reopening of schools and upcoming Jewish high holidays also will present challenges.\n\nDr. Nadav Davidovitch, chairman of Ben Gurion University's school of public health and a member of a board of advisers helping Gamzu, said there is no guarantee of success, but agreed that bringing in the army is a good move.\n\n\"If the right balance is achieved with the oversight and guidance and training by the Ministry of Health, I think that's the right way of doing it,\" he said. \"This should have been done long ago.\"\n\nAssociated Press writers Rod McGuirk in Canberra, Australia; Christopher Sherman in Mexico City and Aritz Parra in Madrid contributed to this report.",

    "Fear and empathy at LA funeral home serving Black families": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "LOS ANGELES -- When people began dying from the coronavirus in the United States, for a few weeks funeral home owner Candy Boyd declined to receive the remains of such patients.\n\nThere were too many unknowns, and Boyd didn't feel like her employees had the training or equipment to safely handle the remains of people who may have active COVID-19 infection in their bodies. But the calls kept coming. Desperate families said other funeral homes were also not receiving people who died of the virus.\n\nBoyd, 53, decided she had to make it work. She reminded herself that she got into the funeral home business more than 10 years ago after running a construction company because she wanted to help people in their most vulnerable state. And the communities her funeral home serves, Black people and others of color in South Los Angeles, were clearly being hard hit.\n\n\"It tugged at my heart strings,\" said Boyd. \"To hear some of the stories I've heard in the last three months has been incredible. People having to say goodbye through an iPad, a window.\"\n\n\"Many have not seen their family members in 30 days. The next time they see them is in a casket,\" she said.\n\nWith some other homes still not taking bodies, Boyd said her facility's workload has increased by 40% while constantly adapting to changing state and local regulations.\n\nThe first months, she had trouble sleeping and eating. Her 32-year-old daughter, who also works at the funeral home, persuaded her to stop watching the news.\n\n\"When the pandemic first started, I had nightmares, I would wake up in a cold sweat thinking about this,\" said Boyd.\n\nBoyd is among many funeral home directors and morticians with misgivings about whether to accept those felled by the virus. For most people, the new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia and death.\n\nCarol Williams, executive director of the Georgia-based National Funeral Directors and Morticians Association, said many of its 1,200 members have struggled to get high-grade protective equipment and decided not to.\n\n\"When you have somebody pick up a COVID case, they can catch the disease,\" said Williams. \"As an embalmer, you need a surgical mask, the same thing that doctors have in the hospital.\"\n\nToday at the Boyd Funeral Home, workers and visitors wear masks at all times. Visitors have their temperature checked at the door. When making arrangements, only two people are allowed in the office. For casket viewings, only five people are allowed in the chapel at a time. They can't congregate, must maintain physical distance and are not allowed to linger. Until a few weeks ago, funeral services were limited to 25 people. Now those services must be held outside.\n\n\"I've gotten a lot of push back from families,\" said Boyd. \"We had one lady who said she was going to punch me in the eye because she couldn't stand in the chapel.\"\n\nFounded in 1963 by Boyd's husband, Reginald Boyd, the funeral home is in Westmont, an area of South Los Angeles that has historically had many Black residents and today also has large numbers of Latinos. Both communities have been disproportionately affected by the coronavirus, which has killed more than 165,000 people in the U.S.\n\nBoyd has close relationships with many families in Los Angeles. Workers recently handled the remains and organized the service for the 34-year-old daughter of family friends.\n\nNot long before she died in the hospital, the woman told her mother, \"I think COVID has got the best of me. If something happens, please tell Ms. Candy to come and pick me up,\" Boyd recalled the mother telling her.\n\n\"I've seen heads decapitated, legs taken off. I've seen everything. I can't say I've ever seen anything like this,\" said Boyd. \"What bothers me is that they keep saying that a lot more people are going to die.\"\n\nAssociated Press writer Peter Prengaman in Phoenix contributed to this report.",

        "body": "ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. -- Florida surpassed 500,000 coronavirus cases Wednesday as testing ramped up following a temporary shutdown of some sites because of Tropical Storm Isaias, state officials said.\n\nA long line of cars waited outside Hark Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens on Wednesday morning for a coronavirus testing site to reopen after being closed because of the storm.\n\nFlorida reported 225 new deaths Wednesday, bringing its seven-day average of daily reported deaths to a high of 185, behind Texas with 197. Florida's rate is approaching a quarter of that seen in New York at its peak in mid-April.\n\nThe number of people treated in hospitals statewide for the coronavirus continued a two-week decline, with 7,622 patients late Wednesday morning -- a decrease of 175 from the previous day and down from highs of 9,500 two weeks ago.\n\nThe Florida Department of Health reported 5,409 new coronavirus cases Wednesday.\n\nThe Hard Rock site, which is now offering antigen testing, briefly shut down Wednesday because of lightning in the area. Testing resumed once the weather cleared.\n\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis this week announced that quicker antigen testing, with results in about 15 minutes, would be offered at the stadium and at Marlins Park.\n\n\"Obviously if you are somebody that is symptomatic and you don't get your result back for 7 days that is not helpful. For asymptomatic test takers, if it takes 7 days then the test is basically useless at that time,\" DeSantis said at a news conference.\n\nThe antigen tests reveal whether someone is currently infected with COVID-19. The site is offering these tests to children between 5 and 17, and for anyone 65 and up, regardless of symptoms. Anyone in the 18 to 65 age group who is experiencing symptoms can also be tested at the site, which also has self-swab testing for those 18 to 64 who aren't experiencing symptoms of the coronavirus, according to officials.\n\nAntigen testing reveals whether a person is currently infected with COVID-19. It differs from antibody testing because once the infection is gone, antigens won't be present.\n\nMiami TV stations showed video of long lines outside the stadium on Wednesday morning.\n\nFollow AP coverage of the virus outbreak at https://apnews.com/VirusOutbreak and https://apnews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak.\n\nAP photographer Wilfredo Lee contributed to this story.",

He was asymptomatic, but soon his mom and dad started having symptoms.\n\n\"Their temperature skyrocketed, they had headaches, a horrible cough,\" Hunter, 17, told WSB. \"They just felt very lazy.\"\n\nAfter both his parents were admitted to the same hospital, his father, Eugene Hunter, 59, a musician, died on July 26, WSB reported.\n\n\"The last thing he said was, 'I love you and I'm going to get better, and I'm going to keep fighting,'\" Hunter, a senior at Johns Creek High School in the Atlanta metro area, told WSB.\n\nHis mother, Angie Hunter, 57, a human resources executive, died just four days later, on July 30, according to WSB. Before she passed, she told Hunter she loved him and \"God has you,\" he told WSB.\n\nJohns Creek is in Fulton, the hardest-hit county in Georgia, with more than 18,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 398 deaths, according to state data.\n\nHunter said his family was careful and doesn't know how they contracted the virus.\n\n\"We were a regular family, just trying to stay safe during this pandemic,\" Hunter told the station. \"My mom, when she would go to the store, she would be wearing a mask, she would be wearing gloves.\"\n\nNow, he's urging other people to wear a mask.\n\n\"If you don't wear it for yourself, wear it for the next person, because you could be saving that person's life,\" he told WSB.\n\nHunter, an only child, will now be staying with relatives, according to WSB.\n\nA GoFundMe for the teen has already raised more than $216,000.

    "Getting COVID-19 and the flu at the same time: What are the risks?": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "With fall around the corner and novel coronavirus cases still prevalent throughout the country, experts are bracing for what some have called a \"twindemic\" of COVID-19 and the flu.\n\nAlthough these are two very different viruses, experts are now exploring what might happen if people get COVID-19 and the flu at the same time, and whether being ill with one virus might make you more susceptible to the other.\n\n\"It is certainly possible, although we aren't clear how coinfection occurs,\" said Dr. Jay Bhatt, an ABC News contributor and former chief medical officer of the American Hospital Association. \"We will learn more as we get into the flu season.\"\n\n\"Limited data suggests that is possible, but much more work needs to be done,\" added Dr. John Brownstein, an epidemiologist, ABC News Medical Contributor and Boston Children's Hospital's chief innovation officer.\n\nIn all likelihood, being infected with both viruses at the same time would be more dangerous than just one. And experts warn that older Americans -- already more vulnerable to both COVID-19 and the flu -- may be particularly at risk. That's why, especially this year, older adults are strongly encouraged to get a flu shot.\n\n\"There have been cases of coinfection and the result is far worse than the impact of either of the viruses alone,\" Brownstein said.\n\nA study published earlier this year in the Journal of the American Medical Association found that 20% of patients were infected with another respiratory virus in addition to COVID-19, including one who had the flu -- showing it is a possibility.\n\n\"We could see rising COVID cases during flu season and some of that may depend on how effective we are at maintaining consistency in our prevention behaviors we know work,\" said Bhatt.\n\nAlthough COVID and influenza are different viruses, they both spread between people in close contact, which occurs more often as the weather gets colder.\n\n\"Increased indoor interaction and decreased humidity are potential factors that lead to a broad rise in respiratory illness,\" said Brownstein. \"The concern is that we have these rising epidemics at the same time posing both increased individual risk and a deepening strain on health care capacity.\"\n\nHowever, limited evidence from Australia, which is in the midst of its own flu season, seems to indicate that social distancing for COVID-19 is helping curb the spread of the seasonal flu.\n\n\"There is a potential silver lining,\" said Brownstein, \"that the current efforts around social distancing and mask wearing may have an impact on influenza transmission as well.\"\n\nWhen it comes to the effects of COVID-19 and influenza on children, more research is needed to see how likely it is for someone to become infected with COVID-19 and the flu at the same time.\n\nAlthough most children appear to be relatively unharmed by COVID-19, they are more vulnerable to the seasonal flu.\n\n\"The risk of complications for healthy children is higher for flu compared to COVID-19,\" said Bhatt. \"However, infants and children with underlying medical conditions are at increased risk for both flu and COVID-19. We know that if you are immunocompromised and in close contact with people, you increase risk of transmission and being infected.\"\n\nAnother challenge this flu season is that while COVID-19 and the flu are very different viruses, they often create similar symptoms.\n\n\"Common symptoms that COVID-19 and flu share include fever or feeling feverish, chills, cough [or] shortness of breath or difficulty breathing,\" said Bhatt.\n\nThis could complicate an already strained health care system, as doctors and nurses try to discern whether patients have COVID-19 or the flu.\n\nRecommendations for lessening the possibly significant impact of COVID during flu season is similar as in previous years: The flu vaccine is one of main tools to reduce the risk of getting the flu. The flu shot is recommended for children, adults and seniors, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend getting it in September and October -- although getting the flu shot late in the season is better than not at all.\n\n\"While the flu vaccine is broadly recommended each year, this year public health is going to be making an extra push to increase uptake,\" said Brownstein. \"Anything we can do to help protect our already strained health care system, the better.\"\n\nBhatt agreed that as we move into flu season, COVID-19 mitigation strategies will become more important than ever.\n\n\"Mask up, watch your distance and wash your hands,\" said Bhatt.",

        "authors": [],
        "body": "MITO, Japan -- The number of confirmed coronavirus cases worldwide topped 20 million on Tuesday, more than half of them from the U.S., India and Brazil.\n\nHealth officials believe the actual number is much higher than that tally kept by Johns Hopkins University, given testing limitations and the fact that as many as 40% of those who are infected have no symptoms.\n\nIt took six months or so to get to 10 million cases after the virus first appeared in central China late last year. It took just over six weeks for that number to double.\n\nAn AP analysis of data through Aug. 9 showed the U.S., India and Brazil together accounted for nearly two-thirds of all reported infections since the world hit 15 million coronavirus cases on July 22.\n\nThe number of new daily cases has continued to rise in India, hitting a rolling seven-day average of 58,768. In the U.S., which has more than 5 million cases, the average has decreased since July 22nd, but remains high at 53,813 new cases a day.\n\nIn the 45 days it took global reported infections to double to 20 million, the number of reported virus deaths climbed to 736,191 from 499,506, according to the count kept by Johns Hopkins University. That's 236,685 new deaths, an average of more than 5,200 a day.\n\nAbout one-fifth of reported deaths, or more than 163,000, have been in the U.S., the highest in the world.\n\nCaseloads are still rising quickly in many other countries, including Indonesia and Japan.\n\nIn Mexico, President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, like Brazil's Jair Bolsonaro and President Donald Trump, seldom wears a mask and has resisted calls for a strict lockdowns, saying Mexicans should be convinced to observe social distancing, not forced to do so by police or fines.\n\nWith nearly 500,000 cases and more than 50,300 deaths, Mexico has struggled with how to curb outbreaks given that just over half its people work off the books with no benefits or unemployment insurance.\n\nA full lockdown would prove too costly for people with little savings and tenuous daily incomes, said Assistant Health Secretary Hugo L\u00f3pez-Gatell, the president's point man on the epidemic, noting \"we do not want a solution that would, in social terms, be more costly than the disease itself.\"\n\nMexico's relatively high death rate results partly from the country having one of the world's highest rates of obesity and diabetes. There has also been relatively little testing. Of all tests done, 47% are positive, suggesting that only seriously ill people are getting tests. That has hindered contract tracing.\n\nIn Japan, where outbreaks have been widening as officials urge people to consider this year's summer holidays \"special\" and stay home, the positivity rate of tests in Tokyo, the worst hit region, has been climbing but remains at 7%.\n\nThe pandemic has waxed and waned in many regions, with the U.K. and Spain seeing new outbreaks after the worst of the early waves of cases paralyzed much of Europe.\n\nIn Asia, Vietnam went from having reported no confirmed deaths and very few cases to battling fresh outbreaks that emerged in the seaside city of Danang. Australia was preparing to reopen travel with neighboring New Zealand, which has had no confirmed locally transmitted cases in more than 100 days, when fresh clusters of coronavirus cases popped up in Melbourne and the surrounding region.\n\nThat outbreak held steady Tuesday with 331 new cases and 19 more deaths in Victoria, which includes Melbourne, raising hopes a strict, renewed lockdown in Australia's second-largest city was working.\n\nMeanwhile, outbreaks in mainland China and semi-autonomous Hong Kong declined, with the number of new community infections in China falling to 13, all in the northwestern region of Xinjiang. Hong Kong counted 69 new cases.\n\nSimilar to many other Asian countries, China requires testing and a two-week quarantine of all new arrivals and has barred most foreigners from entering the country.\n\nBorder closures, masks, lockdowns and infection data are now the new way of life for much of the world, not the politically combustible factors they are in the U.S.\n\nA review by the Kaiser Health News service and The Associated Press found that at least 49 state and local public health leaders have resigned, retired or been fired since April across 23 states. The list has grown by more than 20 people since the AP and KHN started keeping track in June.\n\nContributing to that attrition and burnout of badly needed experts have been attacks on public health experts and institutions from the highest levels, including President Donald Trump, who has sidelined the Centers for Disease Control during the pandemic.\n\n\"The overall tone toward public health in the U.S. is so hostile that it has kind of emboldened people to make these attacks,\" said Dr. Tom Frieden, former director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nStevenson reported from Mexico City.

        "authors": [],
        "body": "TOPEKA, Kan. -- Kansas Gov. Laura Kelly tested negative for the coronavirus Friday as a Republican legislative leader faced criticism from some Democrats for not telling colleagues until this week that he'd been infected and hospitalized before he, Kelly and other top lawmakers had a public meeting last month.\n\nFellow Republican leaders defended House Speaker Ron Ryckman Jr., saying he took more than adequate precautions to prevent spreading the virus after learning he might have it July 10 and had been cleared by a doctor before attending a meeting with Kelly on July 29 at the Statehouse. They also accused the Democratic governor of politicizing his case.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Anthony Hensley, a Topeka Democrat, said also he would get tested, adding that the House speaker \"can't be trusted.\" Kelly has called Ryckman's attendance at the July 29 meeting \"reckless and dangerous.\" Ryckman informed fellow House Republicans of his positive test in a Thursday email.\n\nThe dispute played out as the Kansas Department of Health and Environment reported an additional 921 coronavirus cases since Wednesday, an increase of 3.1% to bring the total number of confirmed and probable cases for the pandemic to 30,638. The health department also reported 12 additional COVID-19-related deaths, an increase of 3.3%, to bring the total to 380.\n\nThe number of infections is thought to be far higher because many people have not been tested, and studies suggest people can be infected with the virus without feeling sick.\n\n\"People just need to be careful,\" said Sen. Carolyn McGinn, a Wichita-area Republican who participated in the July 29 meeting by phone. \"I made a decision early to wear a mask and made that decision because I wanted to protect the people around me.\"\n\nRyckman is the highest-ranking Kansas official known to have been infected. Republican Gov. Kevin Stitt of neighboring Oklahoma tested positive last month.\n\nKelly was tested Friday morning and received her negative result quickly, said spokesman Sam Coleman.\n\nRyckman texted that he is glad that the governor is well and added that he followed doctors' orders, wore a mask, maintained social distancing, and was \"well beyond\" the recommended isolation period when the meeting occurred. Kelly said in a statement Thursday that Ryckman took his mask off during the meeting.\n\nHensley is so far the only legislative leader who was at the meeting who plans to get tested, though he said he's had no symptoms. The other six who attended said they doubted that Ryckman exposed them.\n\n\"Why is she making a big deal of this?\" House Majority Leader Dan Hawkins, a Wichita Republican, said of Kelly. \"Politics.\"\n\nKelly and Republican lawmakers have been at odds for months over how best to slow the virus' spread, with the GOP successfully pushing to have local officials make decisions, well before confirmed and probable cases statewide rose by 81% over the past month.\n\nSome Republicans argue Kelly's administration is painting an overly gloomy picture.\n\nSenate President Susan Wagle, another Wichita Republican, noted that the percentage of reported cases resulting in deaths is at its lowest point since the first fatality was reported in March. It was at 1.24% as of Friday. More than half the reported deaths have been associated with nursing homes.\n\n\"The theatrical red curtain is now wide open on Governor Kelly's political effort to spread fear and anxiety rather than stories of hope and recovery,\" Wagle said in a statement texted to The AP.\n\nRyckman said he learned July 10 that he'd had contact with someone who might have the virus. He tested positive July 13 and was later hospitalized for about a week. He said he told everyone with whom he'd been in contact.\n\nHensley said he was not contacted even though he and Ryckman were among seven legislative leaders who met July 9 at the Statehouse to discuss administrative matters.\n\nRyckman did not immediately respond to Hensley's comments, but Hawkins rejected the idea that Ryckman could have spread the virus then.\n\n\"We were all around him and none of us got it,\" Hawkins said.\n\nFollow John Hanna on Twitter: https://twitter.com/apjdhanna",

    "Half-million California homes, businesses could lose power": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "SAN FRANCISCO -- Millions in California were expected to lose power Monday night in rolling blackouts to ease pressure on the state's electric grid as a days-long heat wave engulfing the West Coast created an energy shortage.\n\nThe California Independent System Operator said it would likely order utility companies to shed their power load as demand for electricity to cool homes soars beyond the power available in the grid.\n\n\"I know that that's going to be highly disruptive to people. I truly, truly wish there were other options that we had at hand,\" California ISO CEO and President Steve Berberich said.\n\nHowever, the estimated number of affected homes and businesses dropped dramatically from 3.3 million to around a half-million because temperatures were slightly lower and people were conserving electricity, the grid operator said.\n\nThat still could represent millions of residents.\n\nBerberich didn't say where the outages might occur, a decision that is up to the state's utilities. As of 7 p.m., the grid operator had not ordered the utilities to power down.\n\nThe first rolling blackouts in nearly 20 years came Friday as unusually hot weather overwhelmed the electrical grid. The three biggest utilities -- Pacific Gas & Electric, Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas & Electric -- turned off power to more than 410,000 homes and businesses for about an hour at a time until the emergency declaration ended 3 1/2 hours later.\n\nA second but shorter outage hit Saturday evening, affecting more than 200,000 customers. Californians packed beaches and river banks over the weekend to cool off from scorching triple-digit temperatures that raised the risk of more wildfires and fears of the coronavirus spreading.\n\nAn irate Gov. Gavin Newsom signed an emergency proclamation Sunday allowing some energy users and utilities to tap backup energy sources. He acknowledged Monday that the state failed to predict and plan for the energy shortages.\n\n\"I am not pleased with what's happened,\" he said during a news briefing. \"You shouldn't be pleased with the moment that we're in here in the state of California.\"\n\nNewsom also sent a letter demanding that the state Energy Commission, state Public Utilities Commission and the California Independent System Operator investigate the blackouts.\n\nThe Democratic governor said residents battling a heat wave and a pandemic in which they're encouraged to stay home were left without the basic necessity of electricity. In Southern California, temperatures reached a record high of 110 in Lancaster and 111 in Palmdale.\n\n\"These blackouts, which occurred without prior warning or enough time for preparation, are unacceptable and unbefitting of the nation's largest and most innovative state,\" Newsom wrote in the letter. \"This cannot stand. California residents and businesses deserve better from their government.\"\n\nDuring a grid operator board meeting Monday, Berberich said the weekend blackouts could have been avoided had regulators listened to its previous concerns about a power shortfall. In call later with reporters, he softened his tone, saying he knows the Public Utilities Commission is working to find the right balance of energy sources.\n\n\"It's substantial, no question about it,\" he said of the outage.\n\nThe Public Utilities Commission said it would work with the other agencies to figure out what happened. The demand for electricity in the last few days has been consistent with expectations, spokeswoman Terrie Prosper said.\n\n\"The question we're tackling is why certain resources were not available,\" she said.\n\nThe last time a California governor faced power outages, he was successfully recalled. Gray Davis, a Democrat, was recalled in October 2003 and replaced by Arnold Schwarzenegger, a Republican.\n\nDaniel Kammen, an energy professor at the University of California, Berkeley, said the state needs to do more to store and sell clean energy sources, and he hopes this week's blackouts will prompt officials to act.\n\n\"This is kind of a stress test on the system,\" he said. \"We have not built up enough of a smart enough system to take advantage of all the renewables we have in place.\"\n\nCustomers are asked to reduce energy use through Wednesday night, especially during peak evening hours.\n\nBonnie Wikler, 66, worried about her husband, who is recovering from open heart surgery. She said it was very stressful to lose power twice over the weekend at their home in Coalinga, a city in central California where temperatures reached 109 Fahrenheit (43 Celsius).\n\nThey thought about driving somewhere but were too afraid of coronavirus exposure, so they stayed home and cooled off with ice water, she said.\n\n\"If there was a fire or an earthquake, I would understand, but to cut power without letting you know, it just seems outlandish to me,\" Wikler said.\n\nBerberich acknowledged that his agency should have given more public notice, saying, \"We own that and are sorry we didn't do more.\"\n\nIn Marin County, just north of San Francisco, officials opened a cooling center that only 21 people visited over the weekend, spokeswoman Laine Hendricks said. It's equipped with a backup generator, and employees are screening for COVID-19 symptoms and ensuring people are wearing masks, she said.\n\n\"We're still in a shelter-in-place environment,\" Hendricks said. \"Even though it's hot outside, COVID hasn't gone away.\"\n\nCalifornia also still faces the threat of power outages to prevent wildfires. Thousands were without power for days last year when Pacific Gas & Electric and other utilities shut off lines amid high, dry winds in order to prevent wildfires.\n\nBeam reported from Sacramento. Associated Press writers Olga R. Rodriguez in San Francisco and Christopher Weber in Los Angeles also contributed to this report.",

        "authors": [],
        "body": "ANAHEIM, Calif. -- Andrew Heaney allowed only three hits over seven innings and the Los Angeles Angels defeated San Diego 2-0 on Thursday, spoiling Mike Clevinger's debut with the Padres.\n\nWith most of the attention focused on Clevinger, who was acquired in a multiplayer deal with Cleveland before Monday's trade deadline, it was Heaney (3-2) who ended up pitching a gem. The right-hander struck out six and walked two while throwing a career-high 117 pitches.\n\nMike Mayers and Felix Pe\u00f1a each worked a scoreless inning in handing the Padres their second shutout this season. San Diego had won 12 of its last 15 and entered the day leading the majors in runs scored. It was Pe\u00f1a's second career save and his first since 2016.\n\nClevinger (1-2) didn't have a sharp outing against the Angels, who drafted him in 2011 before trading him to the Indians three years later. The 29-year-old long-haired right-hander -- who is nicknamed \"Sunshine\" -- came in with a 4-0 career mark against Los Angeles and allowed two runs on seven hits in six innings.\n\nClevinger didn't retire the Angels in order until the sixth and allowed the leadoff batter aboard in each of the first four innings.\n\nAndrelton Simmons and Justin Upton each had two hits and an RBI for the Angels, who snapped a three-game losing streak.\n\nJared Walsh's double led off the third before he scored on a one-out single by Simmons.\n\nLos Angeles added to its lead in the fourth on Upton's RBI single. Anthony Rendon led off the inning with a triple after Wil Myers was unable to make a diving catch in right field.\n\nWEB GEM\n\nThe Angels could have had more runs in the third, but San Diego left fielder Jurickson Profar was able to cleanly field Simmons' single on the bounce and fired a throw to third to get Jo Adell for the second out.\n\nTRAINER'S ROOM\n\nPadres: Myers came off the injured list after a one-day stint. San Diego has been cautious with players who have shown even the slightest of COVID-19 symptoms.\n\nAngels: IF David Fletcher was placed on the injured list retroactive to Monday after spraining his left ankle during Sunday's loss to Seattle.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nPadres: RHP Zach Davies (5-2, 2.61 ERA) has won his last three starts as San Diego opens a three-game series at Oakland.\n\nAngels: RHP Dylan Bundy (4-2, 2.47 ERA) is fourth in the AL in ERA as Los Angeles begins a four-game set against Houston.

        "authors": [],
        "body": "HONG KONG -- Hong Kong will offer free coronavirus tests to its residents starting Sept. 1 as it grapples with its worst outbreak since the pandemic began, leader Carrie Lam said Friday.\n\nThe testing program, which will last up to two weeks, will allow every Hong Kong resident to be tested on a voluntary basis, she said.\n\n\"For the good of yourself and others, and for safeguarding public health, please take part in the scheme,\" Lam said. \"What we're doing today is so that we can come off the epidemic as soon as possible, so that we can resume our economic activities.\"\n\nThe testing is aimed at identifying people who are infected with the coronavirus but have exhibited no symptoms, officials said. The city, which has 7.5 million people, has conducted over 1.2 million coronavirus tests so far.\n\nA new surge in infections which started in July has more than tripled the number of cases in the city to 4,632.\n\nBusinesses such as beauty salons and bars have been temporarily shuttered and there is a ban on dine-in services after 6 p.m. as part of social distancing measures. The city's economy contracted 9% in the second quarter of this year, marking a full year of recession due to last year's anti-government protests and the pandemic.\n\nLam said the testing was possible because of support from Beijing, which is providing resources such as laboratory staff to boost testing capacity in the semi-autonomous Chinese city.\n\nThe city's government has faced pushback from skeptical residents and critics who are worried about privacy issues, given that the program is supported by the Chinese Communist Party. Some fear the tests will be used to produce DNA records of residents.\n\nCriticism of the mainland government has grown since it imposed a new national security law in Hong Kong which has been viewed as an attack on the \"one country, two systems\" framework under which the city has been governed since its return to China in 1997.\n\nLam brushed aside such concerns, saying that no matter what the government does, there will always be people who come up with conspiracy theories.\n\nDr. Gagandeep Kang, an infectious diseases expert at the Christian Medical College in Vellore in southern India, said universal testing can help wipe the virus out provided that those who test positive are immediately isolated and frequent retesting is conducted to ensure that the tests do not miss people who fall sick later.\n\nAssociated Press writer Aniruddha Ghosal in New Delhi contributed to this report.",

        "authors": [],
        "body": "HONG KONG -- Hong Kong began a voluntary mass-testing program for coronavirus Tuesday as part of a strategy to break the chain of transmission in the city's third outbreak of the disease.\n\nThe virus-testing program has become a flash point of political debate in Hong Kong, with many distrustful over resources and staff being provided by the China's central government and fears that the residents' DNA could be collected during the exercise.\n\nThe Hong Kong government has dismissed such concerns, saying that no personal data will be attached to the specimen bottles and that samples will be destroyed in Hong Kong after the exercise.\n\nThe testing program began at 8 a.m. with residents heading to more than 100 testing centers staffed by over 5,000 volunteers.\n\nMore than 500,000 people in the city of 7.5 million signed up in advance for the program, which will last at least a week. It is aimed at identifying silent carriers of the virus -- those without symptoms -- who could be spreading the disease.\n\nThe government expects 5 million people will take part in the program, which could be extended to two weeks depending on demand.\n\nHong Kong's worst outbreak in early July was blamed in part on an exemption from quarantine requirements for airline staff, truck drivers from mainland China and sailors on cargo ships.\n\nAt its peak, Hong Kong recorded more than 100 locally transmitted cases a day, after going weeks without any in June.\n\nThe outbreak has slowed, with the city reporting just nine cases on Monday, the first time in two weeks that daily infections had fallen to single digits. However, the government and some experts say that community testing can help detect asymptomatic carriers to further stop the spread of the virus.\n\nRespiratory medicine expert professor David Hui that even though infections have dwindled, the proportion of cases with untraceable sources of infection remain between 30% and 40%.\n\n\"That means there must be some silent transmission going on, so community testing has some role in picking up these silent transmitters,\" said Hui, who is a public health adviser to the city's government. \"Hopefully if we can identify these people and isolate them for a period of time that may help to break the transmission chain in the community.\"\n\nThe program is more effective if most of the population takes part, Hui said.\n\n\"If only 1 or 2 million people take part, then we may not be able to achieve that objective,\" he said.\n\nOther experts, such as Dr. Leung Chi-chiu, a respiratory specialist and a member of the Medical Council of Hong Kong, said that the testing program plays only a supplementary role in controlling the pandemic in the city, due to the long and variable incubation period of the coronavirus.\n\nLeung said that mass-testing may not be the most cost-effective method, as it is not easy to pick up the disease in its early development, especially if a person is not having symptoms or have not had recent exposure to an infected patient.\n\nEven if mass-testing could identify infected patients, they may already be past the infectious stage, he said.\n\nLeung said that large-scale testing will not be able to replace traditional methods of social distancing and contact tracing measures, and should only be used as a complementary measure.",

        "authors": [],
        "body": "A community college in Ohio has had no reported cases of COVID-19 traced to the school since reopening for in-person classes three months ago.\n\nAs of Wednesday, the school, Stark State College, said it hasn't had any confirmed cases across its multiple locations.\n\nThe news is somewhat surprising, as most college campuses have not been free of the virus this summer. A New York Times report, looking at a mix of public and private four-year universities, found that at least 6,600 confirmed cases of COVID-19 were traced to about 270 colleges during the pandemic. One notable outbreak occurred in the University of Washington's Greek Row.\n\nStark State, which has a main campus in Canton, has implemented a range of protocols to operate with a limited number of students and staff on campus during the pandemic. An overview of their measures and other school factors demonstrate the number of variables that go into safely reopening schools.\n\nFor Stark State, the goal has been to take \"a measured approach, and then some,\" Marisa Rohn, vice president of advancement, human resources and partnerships at Stark State, told ABC News.\n\n\"We know we're not immune,\" Rohn said. \"Our hope is to mitigate that and take these measured approaches that really limit that risk.\"\n\nBuilding off safety and response protocols the school had originally created for H1N1, Stark State has also worked with the local health departments in the counties that it serves, referred to guidelines from the governor and state health department and regularly monitors CDC guidance.\n\n\"We have gone point-by-point down the governor's RestartOhio plan for higher education and ensured that we meet, or in most cases exceed, those guidelines for return to the classroom protocols,\" Rohn said.\n\nFor instance, temperature scans -- which the state guidelines do not list as a requirement for returning students -- are conducted at all entrances. The school has also required that anyone on campus wear a facial covering since it reopened for in-person learning in early May. (The initial state guidance recommended students wear masks, and last month it became a statewide mandate.) The school also regularly cleans its air filtration systems, a protocol that is not listed among the state guidelines.\n\nThe summer semester features a smaller on-campus population in general, with about 80% of students online already, Rohn said. For in-person classes, the school has prioritized classes that require hands-on learning, including commercial drivers license, automotive and health care programs. A little more than 750 students have been to school in person this summer across two campuses and automotive and commercial drivers license locations.\n\nThe school has deployed several measures to promote social distancing. There are fewer entrances, to better manage foot traffic as well as conduct health screenings. Class times are staggered throughout the day to limit the arrival and departure of students and at any given time. Class sizes have ranged from 10 to 12 students, with an even smaller number in the commercial drivers license program. (Training in the truck went from a student-instructor ratio of 4:1 to 1:1.)\n\nIn common areas and computer labs, seating is roped or marked off to enable a six-foot distance. The cafeteria capacity was cut in half.\n\nThe school has also ramped up sanitizing protocols. Hand sanitizing stations are located at all entrances and throughout the campuses. Classrooms are sanitized after each use, including door handles, counters and tables and students are provided cleaning wipes.\n\nSignage at each entrance gives a rundown of the school's safety protocols, as well as a list of COVID-19 symptoms. If someone forgets a mask, there is a supply of facial coverings available, and they are for sale in the bookstore. Should someone become sick, the school will isolate them in a designated area until they can be brought to a clinic or hospital.\n\nSocial distancing and sanitizing measures also apply to the school's employees: Faculty and staff rotate on-campus shifts, plexiglass separators have been installed in offices and cleaning supplies are accessible to all.\n\nStark State has established protocols should a student or staff member test positive for COVID-19, is notified of exposure or needs to be tested. The school would collaborate with the health department in the county in which the person resides, which would conduct contact tracing and advise the school on quarantining.\n\nSo far, the school has had a few reported exposures of staff members off campus who were asked to self-quarantine and monitor symptoms, Rohn said. Should it be notified by a county health department of any confirmed cases linked to its campuses, the school has to notify the public on its website.\n\n\"We are prepared, we have our protocols in place,\" Rohn said. \"For us, it's that balancing act. We really need to keep our teaching and learning mission in the forefront, but we also need to keep people safe.\"\n\nThe Ohio health department monitors COVID-19 spread using a four-level system based on seven different indicators -- such as new cases, hospital admissions and ICU bed occupancy -- that's updated weekly for each county. The counties that Stark State's campuses are in -- Stark and Summit -- are both in the second level, meaning there's increased exposure and spread and residents should exercise a \"high degree of caution.\" In one indicator, Stark has just above 50 new confirmed cases of COVID-19 per 100,000 residents, while Summit has 75. The counties surrounding Stark and Summit are in the first, second or third levels.\n\nLow community spread is key in reopening schools, health experts say.\n\n\"If you don't have a lot of community spread, then the chances are it's less likely that you're going to be seeing a lot of cases in the schools,\" said Dr. Simone Wildes, an infectious diseases physician at South Shore Health in southeastern Massachusetts and an ABC News contributor.\n\nThe fact that a majority of the college's enrollees are part-time -- about 72% -- may also help with a staggered schedule of students on campus.\n\nThe community college also doesn't have dorms or athletics: two key concerns with reopening colleges.\n\n\"You don't have people in the dorms, people in close quarters -- that's something they have going in their favor,\" Wildes said.\n\nStark State's fall semester starts Aug. 31, at which point it's expected about a third of students will be fully online, a third will be fully in-person and a third will be doing a hybrid, officials said. Annually, the school typically serves around 15,000 students.\n\nHaving more people on campus this fall will put their new protocols to the test.\n\n\"On a small scale, I think most people are able to manage things very well,\" Wildes said. \"But as we expand the numbers, then things get a lot harder to control.\"",

    "Hundreds of protesters gather against new flu vaccine mandate in Massachusetts": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "Hundreds of people gathered Sunday to protest a new flu vaccine mandate for Massachusetts students, enacted as school districts prepare to reopen during the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nAt the demonstration in front of the Massachusetts State House in Boston, protesters -- some of them children -- held signs that read \"Unavoidably unsafe,\" \"My child, my choice,\" \"Parents call the shots\" and \"I am not a threat.\" \"No forced shots\" was written in chalk in front of the statehouse. Many demonstrators were not wearing masks or social distancing, according to photos and videos taken of the event.\n\nThe protest follows an Aug. 19 announcement from state officials that influenza immunization will be required for all children ages 6 months or older who are attending Massachusetts child care, pre-school, kindergarten, and K-12. Full-time undergraduate and graduate students under 30 and all full and part-time health science students attending school in the state must also get the vaccine.\n\nSeveral protesters said that the flu shot should be a choice -- an argument frequently used against mask mandates, including in schools -- due to the pandemic.\n\n\"The flu vaccine should not be a mandate. It should be a choice,\" Jessica Marchant told ABC Boston affiliate WCVB.\n\nOther protesters told the station they believe state officials are \"taking advantage\" of the fear caused by the virus.\n\n\"I think parents are vulnerable right now. They need their kids to go to school and they backed us into a corner,\" Taryn Proulx told WCVB. \"We feel like we have to just comply or rearrange our whole lives and homeschool our children.\"\n\nThe mandate comes as experts are bracing for what some have called a \"twindemic\" of COVID-19 and the flu. Children are more vulnerable to the seasonal flu than COVID-19, medical experts told ABC News. Those under 5 years old are at the highest risk of developing serious flu-related complications, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\n\"It is more important now than ever to get a flu vaccine because flu symptoms are very similar to those of COVID-19 and preventing the flu will save lives and preserve health care resources,\" Dr. Larry Madoff, medical director of the Massachusetts Department of Public Health's Bureau of Infectious Disease and Laboratory Sciences, said in a statement announcing the flu requirement.\n\nUnder the mandate, students must now receive the vaccine annually by Dec. 31. Medical or religious exemptions are allowed. Home-schooled or off-campus college students are also exempt. Elementary and secondary students who are remote are not exempt.\n\nA majority of school districts in the state, including Boston, plan to reopen in the coming weeks with hybrid learning, according to an analysis by WCVB.\n\nMassachusetts has some of the highest vaccination rates in the country. During the 2018-2019 flu season, 81% of children ages 6 months to 17 years and 53.5% of adults got the vaccine, according to the CDC.\n\nMassachusetts is the first state to mandate the flu vaccine for all children and joins a handful of states that already require it for child care and/or preschool enrollees, according to research by the Immunization Action Coalition.",

    "In coronavirus fight, new mandate for nursing homes: Test or face fines": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "Nursing homes that fail to test residents and staff for coronavirus could face fines under new measures announced by the Trump administration Tuesday, part of what officials called a \"dramatic ramp up in our efforts\" to address the steep toll the virus is taking on some of the most vulnerable Americans.\n\n\"The testing requirement is very critical,\" said Seema Verma, the administrator at the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, the federal agency that regulates nursing homes. \"You can see that it's part of an overall strategy.\"\n\nWhile the agency has been recommending widespread testing for months, this is the first time nursing homes could see financial consequences for failing to test residents or staff if there are hints of an outbreak, like symptoms of COVID-19 among residents or staff.\n\n\"What that means is that, if a nursing home is not compliant with this, they are subject to fines and penalties,\" Verma said in an interview with ABC News.\n\nVerma said the cost of widespread testing has proven to be a barrier for some nursing homes, so federal agencies have tried to address that concern by providing point-of-care testing kits to 15,000 nursing homes around the country and more than $5 billion in broad financial support from a series of rescue packages passed by Congress.\n\nAs of two weeks ago, tests have been delivered to 1,500 locations, federal officials said then.\n\nThe agency is calling on nursing homes to conduct widespread testing of residents and staff if any resident has shown symptoms or tested positive for the virus. In regions where cases are rising, nursing homes will be expected to test staff more frequently. The agency requires all nursing homes in states with a 5% positivity rate or greater, to test all nursing home staff each week. And in areas where rates are greater than 10%, staff must undergo testing twice a week.\n\nVerma said her agency would be dispatching inspectors to nursing homes to make sure they are adhering to the testing rules. Facilities that do not comply, she said, could face enforcement sanctions including fines of $400 per day, or over $8,000 for each instance of noncompliance.\n\nTuesday's announcement came as the agency discussed several other steps the government will be taking, including a new national training program that aims to provide clear guidance for front-line workers on how to protect residents from the contagion.\n\nFederal officials said the training program is based on lessons learned during the opening weeks of the outbreak, when scores of nursing homes were overrun by the virus, leading to thousands of deaths. Nursing homes remain one of the deadliest settings of the pandemic -- and still account for roughly 40% of all coronavirus deaths, according to a recent ABC News analysis of state health data.\n\nThe training program unveiled Tuesday focuses on the importance of screening visitors, isolating residents who test positive, safe admission and transfer of residents, and the proper use of personal protective equipment.\n\nThose new training measures come on the heels of studies that show that among the key defenders against the coronavirus are nursing home staffs themselves.\n\nA study released last week by The Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA), found that across eight states those facilities that were able to maintain more, qualified staffing in the homes had fewer COVID-19 cases than staffing in homes the study rated as low-performing.\n\nThe report acknowledged the importance of infection control practices but pointed out that policies that provide immediate staffing support \"may be more effective at mitigating the spread of COVID-19.\"\n\nVerma said her agency has seen similar patterns and acknowledged that increased testing of staff will put added pressure on facilities as they are forced to sideline healthcare workers who test positive. She said federal strike teams have been sent to assist nursing homes when staffing shortages became acute, and the federal government is \"prepared to provide back-up\" to nursing homes.\n\n\"If there is an outbreak in a nursing home, you have to send home workers. I can tell you that HHS [Health and Human Services] and FEMA [the Federal Emergency Management Agency] stand ready to assist nursing homes,\" Verma said.\n\nEric Carlson, a long-term care expert with the advocacy group Justice in Aging, previously told ABC News that when facilities don't have enough staff, residents suffer from lower quality of care.\n\n\"When nurse aides are responsible for too many residents, they don't have the time to follow the proper infection prevention procedures,\" said Carlson. \"It's penny wise and pound foolish for facilities to short-staff facilities, since this research shows that overworked staff leads to infections and deaths.\"",

        "authors": [],
        "body": "After weeks of encouraging people to get tested if they may have been exposed to COVID-19, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention abruptly changed course this week and is now telling the public testing might not be necessary.\n\nThe public health reasons for the change were not immediately clear.\n\nWhen asked to explain, the Department of Health and Human Services -- not the CDC -- responded.\n\nA spokesperson said in a statement that the new guidelines were updated to ensure testing is \"used appropriately\" and to \"place an emphasis on testing individuals for post clinical and/or public health reasons,\" including asymptomatic people.\n\n\"CDC recommends the decision to be tested should be one made in collaboration with public health officials or your health care provider based on individual circumstances and the status of community spread,\" according to the HHS statement.\n\nThis new guidance directly contradicts what CDC Director Robert Redfield told ABC News last month: You don't need symptoms to get tested.\n\nRedfield's comments came as case numbers in the U.S. were on the rise and health officials worried that younger people -- attending protests and campaign rallies, as well as parties and bars -- were driving the transmission.\n\nAlso in July, the CDC updated its guidelines online to specifically urge people without symptoms to get tested if they've come in contact with someone who has COVID-19, such as working the same shift at a job.\n\n\"Anyone who thinks they may be infected -- independent of symptoms -- should get a test,\" Redfield told Dr. Jennifer Ashton, ABC's chief medical correspondent, in July.\n\nSince then, however, there have been reports of testing backlogs as much of the country tried to reopen and several universities tried to mandate testing for incoming students.\n\nIn new guidance dated Aug. 24, CDC says that so long as a person doesn't show symptoms testing not necessary.\n\n\"You do not necessarily need a test unless you are a vulnerable individual or your health care provider or State or local public health officials recommend you take one,\" the CDC states.\n\nThe quiet change comes amid questions on whether politics has leaked into public health guidance.\n\nThis week, the head of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Stephen Hahn, acknowledged that he overstated the benefits of convalescent plasma. With President Donald Trump at his side, he announced he was authorizing the treatment -- frustrating some researchers who say they wanted to continue to conduct placebo-controlled clinical trials to see if it worked.\n\nTrump later bragged that he got the FDA to act, despite the agency's insistence that politics hadn't influenced its decision.\n\nOn Wednesday, Hahn said he wanted to work on building trust with the public ahead of the vaccine trial.\n\n\"We at FDA recognize that we must build public trust so there is confidence in future decisions about vaccines for #COVID19,\" he tweeted Wednesday. \"I am concerned when I see public surveys that many people will decline taking a vaccine.\"",

    "Insider Q&A: Quidel CEO talks rapid testing for coronavirus": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "WASHINGTON -- Speed and accuracy are key features when screening for coronavirus.\n\nQuidel Corp. is one of a handful of U.S. companies authorized to sell a rapid test for COVID-19, yielding results in about 15 minutes. The test is run on a small machine that is used in clinics and doctor offices. Unlike some other quick tests, U.S. regulators have ruled that Quidel's test is nearly as accurate as older tests that take hours to run in a laboratory, known as the PCR test.\n\nThe Associated Press spoke with Quidel's CEO Douglas Bryant about the company's technology and the prospects for boosting U.S. testing in coming months. The interview has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nQ: When does it make the most sense to use a rapid test like Quidel's?\n\nA: If you're at an urgent care clinic where you present with symptoms and you're within five days of the onset of symptoms, then this product is going to agree with that PCR test 96.7% of the time. So in that particular case, it's really good.\n\nIf you're actually in the hospital and you're sick and time is not an issue -- why not do the more sensitive product and run the PCR test? Because you're not going anywhere. You're in the hospital.\n\nSo the advantage is speed and cost. The disadvantage, relative to other technologies, is it relies on a certain concentration of the virus being present. So it's not as sensitive as a molecular test. We make both, by the way.\n\nQ: What's the demand like for the rapid tests right now?\n\nA: The demand right now, in terms of just the orders from our traditional market, is about four times what we're able to supply. We're making about 1.9 million of these tests per week. I should be at 3.8 million tests per week early in the first quarter of next year. And then the funding that we got from the (National Institutes of Health) is meant to bring forward another two manufacturing lines. So theoretically we would have just under 6 million tests per week by the middle of next year.\n\nQ: How much more testing is the country going to need to do going forward?\n\nA: We've got the testing we're doing now and that's quite large. We're still not meeting the demand from the traditional segment. These are people who come in contact with somebody and now they want to be tested or they actually have symptoms.\n\nBut on top of that, we have 76 million school kids. Are we going to need to test them frequently? Is it weekly or is it every other week? And then you've got various industries like cruise lines. There are 26 million people that ordinarily would be on a cruise during a year. Nobody's doing it now. And frankly, I don't know that I would go on one unless I felt safe. And the only way I'm going to feel safe is if I know everybody on the ship has been tested and tested negative.\n\nYou start adding up all the people that need to be tested frequently: nuclear plant employees, food handlers of any sort, people working in restaurants. The numbers are staggering if you think about it.",

    "Isaias near hurricane strength as it crawls toward Carolinas": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "VERO BEACH, Fla. -- Isaias was forecast to be near hurricane strength as it approached the Carolinas Monday, just a day after bands of heavy rain from the tropical storm lashed Florida's east coast.\n\nOfficials dealing with surging cases of the coronavirus in Florida kept a close watch on the storm that was weakened from a hurricane to a tropical storm Saturday afternoon, but still brought heavy rain and flooding. Parts of the Carolinas were due for up to 6 inches (15 centimeters) of rain, storm surge and possible tornadoes Monday.\n\nIsaias was just shy of a Category 1 hurricane with maximum sustained winds at 70 mph (110 kph), according to the U.S. National Hurricane Center's 2 a.m. advisory. A Category 1 hurricane has winds of 74 to 95 mph (119 to 153 kph).\n\nThe tropical storm was centered 330 miles (530 kilometers) south of Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, and 65 miles (105 kilometers) northeast of Cape Canaveral, Florida, forecasters said.\n\n\"Don't be fooled by the downgrade,\" Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis warned at a news conference after the storm -- pronounced ees-ah-EE-ahs -- spent hours roughing up the Bahamas.\n\nUpper-level winds took much of the strength out of Isaias, said Stacy Stewart, senior hurricane specialist at the hurricane center in Miami.\n\n\"We were expecting a hurricane to develop and it didn't,\" Stewart said Sunday. \"It's a tale of two storms. If you live on the west side of the storm, you didn't get much. If you live east of the storm, there's a lot of nasty weather there.\"\n\nAuthorities closed beaches, parks and virus testing sites, lashing signs to palm trees so they wouldn't blow away. DeSantis said the state is anticipating power outages and asked residents to have a week's supply of water, food and medicine on hand. Officials wrestled with how to prepare shelters where people can seek refuge from the storm if necessary, while also safely social distancing to prevent the spread of the virus.\n\nIn Palm Beach County, about 150 people were in shelters, said emergency management spokeswoman Lisa De La Rionda. The county has a voluntary evacuation order for those living in mobile or manufactured homes, or those who feel their home can't withstand winds.\n\n\"We don't anticipate many more evacuations,\" she said, adding that the evacuees are physically distant from each other and are wearing masks, due to the virus.\n\nIn Indian River County, north of West Palm Beach, Florida, emergency shelters were clearing out Sunday after Isaias was downgraded to a tropical storm.\n\nOfficials told TCPalm newspapers that 38 people registered at three schools used as shelters. Those areas now must be cleaned to ensure no traces of the coronavirus remain as teachers and staff report Monday to prepare for the upcoming school year.\n\nNo one checked in with COVID-19 symptoms. Temperature checks were done at the door, officials said, and isolation rooms were designated in case anyone came in with symptoms.\n\n\"The center of Isaias will pass just to the east of the Florida east coast through this morning,\" the hurricane center said in its advisory early Monday. \"The center of Isaias will then move offshore of the coast of Georgia and southern South Carolina later today, move inland over eastern South Carolina or southern North Carolina tonight and move along the coast of the mid-Atlantic states on Tuesday.\"\n\nThe storm was moving north, northwest at 9 mph (15 kph), forecasters said.\n\nA tropical storm warning was in effect from the Volusia/Brevard County Line in Florida to Fenwick Island, Delaware, and included Pamlico and Albemarle Sounds in North Carolina, as well as Chesapeake Bay southward from Smith Point.\n\nThe storm did not affect the successful return of two astronauts aboard the SpaceX Dragon capsule, which splashed down into calm waters in the Gulf of Mexico off the coast of Pensacola. Test pilots Doug Hurley and Bob Behnken rode the capsule back to Earth less than a day after departing the International Space Station and two months after blasting off from Florida.\n\nIsaias already has caused destruction in the Caribbean: On Thursday, before it became a hurricane, it uprooted trees, destroyed crops and homes and caused widespread flooding and small landslides in the Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico. One man died in the Dominican Republic. In Puerto Rico, the National Guard rescued at least 35 people from floods that swept away one woman, whose body was recovered Saturday.\n\nIsaias snapped trees and knocked out power as it blew through the Bahamas on Saturday.\n\nWith coronavirus cases surging in Florida recently, the added menace of a storm ratcheted up the anxiety. State-run virus testing sites closed in areas where the storm might hit because the sites are outdoor tents, which could topple in high winds.\n\nNatalie Betancur, stocking up at a grocery in Palm Beach Gardens, said that the storm itself doesn't cause her a great amount of concern.\n\n\"The hurricane is not that serious, but I feel that the public is really panicking because it's a hurricane and we're in the middle of a pandemic,\" she said.\n\nOfficials in the Bahamas opened shelters for people in Abaco island to help those who have been living in temporary structures since Dorian devastated the area, killing at least 70 people in September 2019.\n\nCoto reported from San Juan, Puerto Rico.

        "body": "ROME -- Former Italian Premier Silvio Berlusconi says he no longer has fever or aches from the \"insidious disease\" of COVID-19 as he recovers in quarantine at one of his private villas.\n\nBerlusconi spoke by phone Thursday to the leaders of his Forza Italia party who were in Genoa campaigning for Italy's upcoming regional elections.\n\nOnly a day earlier, Italian media had quoted his doctor as saying that Berlusconi had tested positive but had no symptoms. Berlusconi turns 84 later this month.\n\nBerlusconi, a TV and real estate mogul, had told supporters he would continue campaigning for his small, center-right party while in quarantine at his estate near Milan.\n\n\"I have no more fever, I have no more pains,\" Berlusconi said. \"I want to reassure you that I am well enough and continue to work and will participate in all possible ways in the electoral campaign underway.\"\n\nItaly was the epicenter of Europe's outbreak in February and March, and has seen about 35,500 people die in the pandemic, the second-highest toll in Europe after Britain. Experts say all figures understate the true impact of the pandemic, due to limited testing and other factors.\n\nMany of those recently testing positive in Italy have returned from popular Mediterranean Sea destinations, among them Sardinia, where clusters of coronavirus infections have erupted. Berlusconi has a seaside villa on Sardinia's Emerald Coast and spent some of his summer vacation there.\n\nAmong those receiving thanks from Berlusconi for their get-well wishes was the governor of Lazio, the region which includes Rome. Gov. Nicola Zingaretti, from the rival Democratic Party, had COVID-19 early in the outbreak and recovered.\n\nFollow AP's pandemic coverage at http://apnews.com/VirusOutbreak and https://apnews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak",

These have been some very difficult days, very complicated. Sometimes you think it's not going to hit you, and it hit me, and it hit me very hard,\" Balvin, speaking in Spanish in a soft tone.\n\nThe 35-year-old Latin Grammy winner told fans to take the virus seriously.\n\n\"I'm sending a message to all those who follow me, to all the youth, to people in general, that they take care, that this is not a joke ... the virus as such exists. It's very dangerous. Take a lot of care of yourselves,\" he said.\n\nBalvin has released a number of Latin and pop hits, including \"Mi Gente\" with Beyonc\u00e9, \"X\" with Nicky Jam, \"I Like It\" with Cardi B and Bad Bunny, \"Con Altura\" with Rosal\u00eda and \"Ritmo (Bad Boys for Life)\" with The Black Eyed Peas, among other successes.\n\nAt Premios Juventud 2020, which aired on Univision, Balvin won five honors, tying with Karol G. Bad Bunny was the show's top winner, earning eight awards.\n\nFor most people, the new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks.

        "body": "HARARE, Zimbabwe -- A Zimbabwean journalist in jail for more than a month is \"seriously ill\" and exhibiting symptoms \"consistent with COVID-19,\" one of his lawyers said, but prison authorities claim the journalist \"is well.\"\n\nJournalist Hopewell Chin'ono looked \"visibly ill,\" according to Doug Coltart, a lawyer who visited the reporter in jail Monday.\n\nA private doctor who later assessed the scribe noted that Chin'ono was suffering from \"a headache, fever and distorted taste. It's consistent with COVID-19,\" said Coltart.\n\n\"Tests were done and we are waiting for the results. Fears of COVID-19 are real because people have been testing positive for the virus in jail. It is overcrowded and the personal protective equipment is not enough,\" Coltart said Tuesday.\n\nChin'ono has been in detention for more than a month after he was arrested together with opposition politician, Jacob Ngarivhume, and accused of inciting violence for publishing on social media his support for an anti-government protest. That protest was foiled by the military and police on July 31.\n\nThe duo's lawyers have previously told the courts that they fear for their clients' safety as overcrowding, poor diet and lack of protective equipment put their health at risk.\n\nChin'ono and Ngarivhume return to court for a bail ruling Wednesday, having already been denied bail three times. Journalist organizations, western embassies and human rights groups say Chin'ono is being punished for exposing government corruption on Twitter.\n\nChin'ono had exposed alleged corruption involving a $60 million purchase of protective equipment for health workers. Chin'ono's reports led President Emmerson Mnangagwa's government to fire the health minister, who has been formally charged with corruption.\n\nA prisons' spokeswoman told the state-run Herald that reports of Chin'ono's illness had taken them by \"surprise.\"\n\n\"As far as we are concerned, he is well,\" the Herald on Tuesday quoted prisons spokeswoman Meya Khanyezi as saying.",

    "Kids with AFM explore treatment options as public health professionals brace for next outbreak": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "Quinton Hill was only 8 years old when he underwent a potentially life-changing surgery.\n\nIt was one that could not only affect his future but that of other children who one day might be diagnosed with the rare and mysterious \"polio-like\" illness acute flaccid myelitis (AFM).\n\nIn 2018, Quinton was one of at least 237 children in 41 states who were diagnosed with AFM, a debilitating disease that causes muscle weakness and paralysis and can sometimes lead to deadly complications, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The disease carries almost no warning signs. It comes on quickly and mostly affects children.\n\nQuinton was in church when his father said he began feeling symptoms of a cold.\n\n\"He started complaining that he just had a little bit of a sore throat ... the beginning signs of a cold,\" James Hill, Quinton's father, said. \"So we're like, 'We'll go home early. We don't want to make anyone else sick.'\"\n\nBut Quinton's condition worsened. After enduring a week of flu-like symptoms, his father said he became unable to move his left arm.\n\n\"We went into the hospital and even they were confused ... they ran a ton of tests. He had two MRIs, initially. He had a spinal tap. He had X-rays,\" said Hill.\n\nAfter two weeks of testing, doctors told the Hill family that Quinton might have AFM.\n\n\"That's the first time that we heard the term AFM,\" Hill said. \"I literally didn't sleep that night. I Googled a lot of stuff and tried to figure out next steps and whatnot. And it was all unknown ... no known cure. No known treatment. Don't know how it spreads.\"\n\nThousands of confused and scared parents were given the same news that year -- that their kids were affected by the 2018 AFM outbreak. Minneapolis, where Quinton lived with his family, was the outbreak's epicenter.\n\nCamdyn was diagnosed at 4 years old with AFM at the Kennedy Krieger Institute in Baltimore. The disease had struck at a crucial point in his development, leaving him mostly paralyzed from the neck down -- only able to move his right leg and left hand.\n\n\"Nightline\" first met 4-year-old Camdyn in October 2018 while he was recovering at the Kennedy Krieger Institute, which specializes in treating AFM patients. At the time, therapists were working tirelessly to help Camdyn regain some mobility in his limbs.\n\nToday, Camdyn is still paralyzed but improving. His father, Chris Carr, says the disease has affected his son in \"every way, shape or form you can imagine.\"\n\n\"He can't use a bathroom on his own. Can't scratch his own nose [or] arm. Can't eat. ... He's got a [gastronomy] tube, his own trach tube.\"\n\nMoreover, the disease has taken an immense mental toll on the young boy, his father said.\n\n\"The [post-traumatic stress disorder] is starting to eat away at that good, wholesome little child and starting to turn him into an angry old man at 5 years old,\" Carr said. \"It's just awful to watch. It really is.\"\n\nInitially unable to afford a home nursing aide, Camdyn's parents took full responsibility for his care after returning home from the hospital following his diagnosis. The Carr home is now filled with medical supplies and medication lists for Camdyn.\n\n\"The scary thing about coming home was knowing it was all on myself because I'm the only certified caregiver,\" Carr said. \"So I'm the only person that can do anything in an emergency situation for him. If I mess up and my son passes away, it's on my shoulders. No one else's.\"\n\nCarr said that most of the time, he's fearful something will happen to Camdyn.\n\n\"You're always on edge,\" he said. \"You always feel like something is going to happen at any given time. That's why I don't sleep.\"\n\nA CDC task force was created in 2014 after an outbreak of the disease to research and track the rare condition. Since then, it has found that the disease seems to emerges in greater numbers every two years during the fall, and that each outbreak is worse than the last. This year, health experts are sounding the alarm that another AFM outbreak could coincide with the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nSince the CDC began looking into the disease, it has discovered that viral infections -- like the flu -- are common in many patients who are diagnosed with AFM. In fact, over 90% of patients diagnosed with AFM also had mild respiratory illness or fever associated with a viral infection before developing AFM, according to the CDC.\n\nDr. Benjamin Greenberg, a neurologist at the University of Texas Southwestern who is also on the CDC task force, has been researching AFM for nearly a decade. He says he can \"pretty much guarantee that there were more cases than we know of\" before the CDC began tracking the disease in 2014.\n\n\"It goes back to 2009, when we had several patients admitted to our hospital here in Dallas ... who had what we described as an atypical transverse myelitis, which means inflammation of the spinal cord,\" Greenberg said.\n\n\"But these kids just seemed different. We didn't know why at the time,\" he continued. \"It wasn't until 2014 that we put all the pieces together and recognized those were our first cases of acute flaccid myelitis.\"\n\nSarah Todd Hammer, 19, is one patient who'd developed AFM early on, in 2010. She said doctors didn't seem to have answers at the time and that \"no one really knew how to treat me.\" She'd been diagnosed with a different disease before seeing Greenberg in Texas last year when he confirmed her diagnosis as AFM, she said.\n\nTodd Hammer's condition, however, hasn't stopped her from doing her best to live life ably. She's learned how to drive and was accepted into Davidson College, where she plans to live on campus. She's also written several children's books about her experience while also making a clothing line for children with disabilities.\n\n\"One big thing that I've learned is that you can have a great life no matter what,\" she said. \"I don't think having a disability can stop you from achieving what you want to achieve and I feel although it might be harder, of course, it's still possible.\"\n\nThe CDC task force has made crucial progress in determining what causes AFM. So far, it's narrowed down a few viral culprits, including the enterovirus strains A71 and D68.\n\n\"Knowing which virus is involved is critical for understanding what's actually happening in children who are getting paralyzed,\" Greenberg said. \"If we know the specific virus that is involved, we can work on antiviral therapies to try and kill the virus and prevent it from causing more damage in the infected child.\"\n\nGreenberg said that his team is also \"gaining knowledge\" on why the virus, over time, has begun paralyzing patients. In part, he said, it's because \"the virus has mutated.\"\n\nWhile Greenberg's team continues looking for a way to root out the disease, other doctors are using experimental treatments to lessen the nerve damage already caused by AFM.\n\nDr. Mitchel Seruya, a neurosurgeon at Children's Hospital Los Angeles, has been performing nerve transplant surgeries on AFM patients since 2014. However, he says it's hard to treat, comparing the surgery to \"electrical engineering for the human.\"\n\n\"It turns off the nerve in the spinal cord, so medically speaking, right now we don't have a good way to just flip back on that 'circuit breaker switch' in the spinal cord,\" Seruya said. \"It's daunting for families because, medically, it's not as if we could just take a pill or an injection and it turns back on.\"\n\n\"You need to divert power from somewhere else and tap into that supply,\" he continued.\n\nFor Quinton, who underwent the surgery, that meant harvesting functioning nerves from his chest and connecting them to the paralyzed nerves in his body so that they can reconnect with the spine. Once the connection is made -- glue helps to reinforce it, Seruya said -- the body parts that were once paralyzed should be able to move, albeit after months of therapy.\n\n\"He will have to think about new ways to turn on muscles. Meaning, if we look at your ribs, for instance, your ribs control coughing or whistling. He'll have to think about coughing or whistling to get a shoulder to reach up for things,\" Seruya said.\n\nAfter six hours in the operating room, however, Quinton's surgery was only partially successful. Seruya said that although Quinton will likely see improvement around his elbow, they weren't able to implant functional nerves around his shoulder, so he'd need another surgery.\n\n\"It was challenging,\" Seruya said. \"Basically, every AFM kid ... comes to the table with a different set of things that were affected and a different set of nerves that are strong donors. ... For me, I want the best for all the patients that I take care of, and unfortunately, what's disappointing to me is that it's out of my hands in the sense that you can only work with what you have.\"\n\nQuinton had his arm in a cast for eight weeks, his father said, and he seemed to be healing well when it was removed. Later, they decided to put Quinton through a second surgery, which was successful. After several months of rehab, Quinton has slowly begun to regain strength in his left side.\n\n\"Today, he continues to get stronger and he'll brag to you that he can lift a pound or a couple pounds against gravity in actual weight.,\" James Hill said. \"So it's been fun to see that.\"\n\nUltimately, Quinton's parents hope that he can one day be as non-disabled as possible.\n\n\"Just the day that he can raise both arms and give me a two-armed hug ... that'll be a happy day, right?\" Hill said. \"So, anything we can do to give him some normalcy, to where he can be able to be as functional as possible, is kind of the goal, right?\"\n\n\"Yeah, we just want to make sure he has every possibility to be as healthy as can be,\" Erika Hill, Quinton's mother, said.\n\nSimilarly, after two years of helping Camdyn deal with his AFM, his parents refuse to let go of hope for his future.\n\n\"I would like to see him being in school, having normal activities,\" Carr said. \"More therapies. You know, physical therapies during the day. I mean, move him forward. I wanna see him moving again.\"\n\nAs fall approaches, the CDC has already reported 16 cases of AFM in 10 states and the District of Columbia. The CDC also confirmed for the first time since it began recording data on the disease that two deaths had occurred during the acute phases of the disease -- one in 2017 and another this year.\n\nAlthough Greenberg said public health professionals are in a better place to treat AFM than they were in 2018, he's concerned the pandemic will create new challenges in AFM treatment.\n\n\"This season is going to be unlike any other because of what we're seeing with the COVID-19 pandemic,\" he said. \"One of our concerns is that with all of the focus on it, as kiddos come to our emergency rooms with respiratory problems, everybody is testing for the coronavirus. But we have to test for other viruses as well. So, in this case, we are reminding our colleagues across the country to not just test for coronavirus but to look for enteroviruses and other respiratory infections that could be related to AFM.\"\n\nHe also reminded parents to trust their instincts when it comes to their children's health, noting that many AFM illnesses begin as a cold-like symptoms.\n\n\"The cold isn't the concern,\" he said. \"It's afterward. If you ever have a child who either shows symptoms of weakness, complains of weakness, or you notice that they aren't using an arm or a leg in the same way that they normally do, that should definitely prompt you to seek medical attention.\"",

        "authors": [],
        "body": "SEOUL, South Korea -- North Korean leader Kim Jong Un directed his government agencies to act immediately to stabilize the livelihoods of residents in a city locked down over coronavirus concerns, state media reported Thursday.\n\nNorth Korea declared an emergency and locked down Kaesong near the inter-Korean border in late July after finding a suspected virus case there. It hasn't confirmed yet if the person tested positive and still says the country hasn't had a single case of COVID-19, a claim questioned by outside experts.\n\nKim presided over a meeting Wednesday of the ruling Workers' Party's executive policy council where they discussed a special supply of food and funds to Kaesong, the Korean Central News Agency said. The report didn't specify the measures that were to be taken.\n\nNorth Korea has said the suspected virus patient is a runaway who had fled to South Korea three years ago before slipping back to Kaesong last month. Some experts speculate North Korea is aiming to hold South Korea responsible for a potential virus spread in the North or try to save its face before winning aid items from the South.\n\nDescribing its anti-virus efforts as a \"matter of national existence,\" North Korea earlier this year shut down nearly all cross-border traffic, banned foreign tourists and mobilized health workers to quarantine anyone with symptoms. But the Kaesong lockdown is the first such known measure taken in a North Korean city to stem the pandemic.\n\nForeign experts say a coronavirus outbreak in North Korea could cause dire consequences because of its fragile public health care infrastructure and chronic lack of medical supplies. They are also skeptical about North Korea's claim of having had no infections because the country shares a long, porous border with China, its biggest trading partner, where the pandemic emerged last year.\n\nKaesong, a city with an estimated population of 200,000, is just north of the heavily fortified land border with South Korea. It once hosted the Koreas' jointly run industrial complex, which has been shut since 2016 amid nuclear tensions, and an inter-Korean liaison office North Korea demolished earlier this year.",

        "body": "Antibodies that people make to fight the new coronavirus last for at least four months after diagnosis and do not fade quickly as some earlier reports suggested, scientists have found.\n\nTuesday's report, from tests on more than 30,000 people in Iceland, is the most extensive work yet on the immune system's response to the virus over time, and is good news for efforts to develop vaccines.\n\nIf a vaccine can spur production of long-lasting antibodies as natural infection seems to do, it gives hope that \"immunity to this unpredictable and highly contagious virus may not be fleeting,\" scientists from Harvard University and the U.S. National Institutes of Health wrote in a commentary published with the study in the New England Journal of Medicine.\n\nOne of the big mysteries of the pandemic is whether having had the coronavirus helps protect against future infection, and for how long. Some smaller studies previously suggested that antibodies may disappear quickly and that some people with few or no symptoms may not make many at all.\n\nThe new study was done by Reykjavik-based deCODE Genetics, a subsidiary of the U.S. biotech company Amgen, with several hospitals, universities and health officials in Iceland. The country tested 15% of its population since late February, when its first COVID-19 cases were detected, giving a solid base for comparisons.\n\nScientists used two different types of coronavirus testing: the kind from nose swabs or other samples that detects bits of the virus, indicating infection, and tests that measure antibodies in the blood, which can show whether someone was infected now or in the past.\n\nBlood samples were analyzed from 30,576 people using various methods, and someone was counted as a case if at least two of the antibody tests were positive. These included a range of people, from those without symptoms to people hospitalized with signs of COVID-19.\n\nIn a subgroup who tested positive, further testing found that antibodies rose for two months after their infection initially was diagnosed and then plateaued and remained stable for four months.\n\nPrevious studies suggesting antibodies faded quickly may have been just looking at the first wave of antibodies the immune system makes in response to infection; those studies mostly looked 28 days after diagnosis. A second wave of antibodies forms after a month or two into infection, and this seems more stable and long-lasting, the researchers report.\n\nThe results don't necessarily mean that all countries' populations will be the same, or that every person has this sort of response. Other scientists recently documented at least two cases where people seem to have been reinfected with the coronavirus months after their first bout.\n\nThe new study also found:\n\n-- Testing through the bits-of-virus method that's commonly done in community settings missed nearly half of people who were found to have had the virus by blood antibody testing. That means the blood tests are far more reliable and better for tracking spread of the disease in a region and for guiding decisions and returning to work or school, researchers say.\n\n-- Nearly a third of infections were in people who reported no symptoms.\n\n-- Nearly 1% of Iceland's population was infected in this first wave of the pandemic, meaning the other 99% are still vulnerable to the virus.\n\n-- The infection fatality rate was 0.3%. That's about three times the fatality rate of seasonal flu and in keeping with some other more recent estimates, said Dr. Derek Angus, critical care chief at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center.\n\nAlthough many studies have been reporting death rates based on specific groups such as hospitalized patients, the rate of death among all infected with the coronavirus has been unknown.\n\nThe news that natural antibodies don't quickly disappear \"will be encouraging for people working on vaccines,\" Angus said.\n\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute's Department of Science Education.

        "authors": [],
        "body": "BEIRUT -- Lebanon on Friday began a two-week partial lockdown and nighttime curfew after coronavirus cases increased sharply following an explosion in Beirut that killed and injured thousands of people.\n\nConfirmed cases of the virus have increased from 5,417 a day after the massive blast on Aug. 4 to nearly 11,000 on Friday, leading officials to announce the lockdown.\n\nOn Thursday, Lebanon's Health Ministry tallied a record 605 confirmed new cases in the previous 24 hours, raising the total registered cases since late February to 10,952.\n\nThe pandemic has killed 113 people in the tiny country, which was successful in limiting the spread of the virus during the early months.\n\nMany businesses were closed Friday morning in Beirut even though some sectors, including banks, groceries, book shops and pharmacies were allowed to open. Restaurants, night clubs, beaches and clothes shops are among the businesses ordered to close by the Ministry of Interior.\n\nVirus cases had already been on the rise since the beginning of July, when an earlier lockdown was lifted and Lebanon's only international airport was reopened. At the end of June, Lebanon registered 1,778 cases. That number has since multiplied more than five times in seven weeks.\n\nBut the numbers shot up dramatically following the Aug. 4, explosion of nearly 3,000 tons of ammonium nitrate stored at Beirut's port. More than 180 people were killed, more than 6,000 injured and a quarter of a million people were left with homes unfit to live in. The blast overwhelmed the city's hospitals and also badly damaged two that had a key role in handling virus cases.\n\nAfter the blast, medical officials have warned of increased risk of catching the virus because of crowding at hospitals and funerals, or as people searched through the rubble. Protests and demonstrations also broke out after the blast as Lebanese vented their anger at authorities.\n\nThe virus causes mild to moderate symptoms in most people, who recover within a few weeks. But it is highly contagious and can cause severe illness or death, particularly in older patients or those with underlying health problems.\n\nLebanon's health sector has been challenged by the pandemic that hit amid an unprecedented economic and financial crisis.\n\nIn the United Arab Emirates, a health official warned that nighttime curfews and lockdowns could resume in parts of the country as coronavirus case numbers spike.\n\nDr. Saif al-Dhaheri of the UAE's National Emergency Crisis and Disasters Management Authority made the comments late Thursday in an interview aired on a state-owned television channel.\n\nAsked if those measures could be taken, al-Dhaheri said: \"Yes. If we found that the number of cases is increasing in a specific area, we could.\"\n\nReturning to lockdowns could hurt Dubai, the skyscraper-studded city that's reopened for tourists just a few weeks ago. It also could affect the UAE's efforts to host the Indian Premier League beginning next month.\n\nOn Wednesday and Thursday, the UAE discovered over 400 confirmed cases of the virus, its highest numbers in about a month amid an aggressive testing campaign. Officials have blamed the rise in infections on the public not taking wearing masks and social distancing seriously.",

        "authors": [],
        "body": "MIAMI -- Miami Marlins CEO Derek Jeter blamed the team's coronavirus outbreak on a collective false sense of security that made players lax about social distancing and wearing masks.\n\nInfected were 21 members of the team's traveling party, including at least 18 players. None is seriously ill, Jeter said Monday, and he expects all to return this season.\n\nWith more than half of the team sidelined, Jeter said the Marlins still can be competitive when their season resumes Tuesday at Baltimore after a hiatus of more than a week.\n\nFollowing an MLB investigation, Jeter said, it's impossible to know where the first Marlins player became infected or how the virus reached their clubhouse. They left South Florida last week to play two exhibition games in Atlanta, and then opened the season with a three-game series in Philadelphia, where the outbreak surfaced.\n\n\"Guys were around each other, they got relaxed and they let their guard down,\" Jeter said. \"They were getting together in groups. They weren't wearing masks as much as they should have. They weren't social distancing. The entire traveling party got a little too comfortable.\"\n\nJeter said his players were annoyed by speculation that reckless misbehavior was to blame.\n\n\"Our guys were not running all around town in Atlanta,\" he said. \"We did have a couple of individuals leave the hotel. We had guys leave to get coffee, to get clothes. A guy left to have dinner at a teammate's house. There were no other guests on site. There was no salacious activity. There was no hanging out at bars, no clubs, no running around Atlanta.\"\n\nBy Sunday, the outbreak had become so serious that the Marlins' season was temporarily suspended, with the team stranded in Philadelphia. The infected players have since returned by bus to South Florida, where they are quarantined.\n\n\"We have a lot of players who are asymptomatic, and we have players who are showing mild symptoms,\" Jeter said.\n\nHe said he is optimistic his players will closely adhere to the MLB virus protocols the rest of the season.\n\n\"We've been given an opportunity to hit the reset button,\" Jeter said. \"I hope people look at what happened to us and use that as a warning to see how quickly this is able to spread if you're not following the protocols 100%.\"\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP -- Sports",

        "authors": [],
        "body": "JACKSON, Miss. -- Most Mississippi legislators wore masks and practiced social distancing Monday as they returned to the state Capitol for the first time since the start of the largest coronavirus outbreak in any statehouse in the U.S.\n\n\"Please separate yourselves. I know it's tempting to congregate and talk,\" Republican Speaker Philip Gunn told members of the House.\n\nThe state health officer, Dr. Thomas Dobbs, said Monday that 49 Mississippi legislators have tested positive for the virus -- more than 25% of them. Legislative leaders say most cases have come from the House.\n\nDobbs said at least four legislators have been hospitalized, with three requiring intensive care.\n\nAt least 12 other people who work in the Capitol have tested positive, and one of them has died, Dobbs said.\n\nThe updated numbers are a significant increase from mid-July, when the state Health Department said 30 legislators and 11 others from the Capitol were known to have tested positive for COVID-19.\n\nThe outbreak among Mississippi lawmakers comprises nearly half of the more than 100 state lawmakers who have tested positive nationwide, according to an Associated Press tally.\n\nMississippi lawmakers were in session Monday to finish parts of the state budget. They left the Capitol on July 1 after working there throughout June, many without wearing masks or following social distancing recommendations. Crowded elevators were common in June, as were gatherings in which unmasked people leaned close to talk to one another. The first virus cases among legislators were confirmed in the early days of July.\n\nRepublicans hold wide majorities in the Legislature. Among those who tested positive for the virus were Gunn, who had mild symptoms, and Republican Lt. Gov. Delbert Hosemann, who said he felt miserable for several days in July\n\nRepublican Gov. Tate Reeves last week issued a statewide order for people to wear masks in public. He has also encouraged people to post photos of themselves on social media, saying who they're trying to protect when they \"mask up.\"\n\n-- -- -- --\n\nAssociated Press writer David Lieb contributed to this report from Jefferson City, Missouri.

        "body": "Matthew McConaughey interviewed Dr. Anthony Fauci for 40 minutes on Instagram Thursday with the fast-talking, Oscar-winning actor getting a chance to grill the nation's top infectious disease expert on COVID-19.\n\nMcConaughey rapidly fired questions at the 79-year-old doctor on everything from how concerned people should be about getting the virus from touching a door knob (not as much as sharing close physical space with someone who is infected, Fauci says) to whether Advil makes symptoms worse (it doesn't).\n\n\"OK, true-false: Sunlight kills the virus?\" McConaughey asked.\n\n\"It does,\" Fauci replied, supporting a theory pushed by President Donald Trump. \"That's the truth.\"\n\nWhat about letting everyone get infected so we all become immune and the disease dies out?\n\nNo way, Fauci said. That would cause big problems, particularly in America, where obesity is prevalent and related conditions like diabetes and hypertension are considered risk factors in how sick a person gets.\n\n\"If everyone contracted it ... a lot of people are going to die,\" Fauci said.\n\n\"The death toll would be enormous and totally unacceptable,\" Fauci added. \"And that's the reason why we're against saying, 'Let it fly. Let everybody get infected and we'll be fine.' That's a bad idea.\"\n\nFauci also said Americans need to choose between getting to party this summer and opening schools in the fall: \"You want to open the bars or you want to open the schools?\"\n\nMcConaughey also asked Fauci if he had millions of dollars invested in a vaccine.\n\nFauci laughed. \"Matthew, no. I got zero! I'm a government worker. I have a government salary.\"\n\nMcConaughey, known for his laid-back style and often photographed shirtless, instead wore a white-collared dress shirt and glasses for the interview. He turned philosophical at points, expressing his own personal disappointment and what he said was rage with the nation's response to the pandemic.\n\n\"Like a lot of people, I've been more than disillusioned -- actually quite full of rage -- at how COVID has been politicized,\" including masks, McConaughey said.\n\nPeople, he added, are \"looking for identity and purpose in a big time of unknown. And man, so many people have become disillusioned with our leadership,\" he said. \"But also so many people have fervently [clung] to the fringes of the right and left, which causes further divide a lack of unity.\"\n\nBy the end of their discussion, McConaughey seemed heartened by Fauci's suggestion that the nation could pull together again, because it's done it in the past after World War II and 9/11.\n\n\"This is equivalent to that, Matthew. We've got to pull together, absolutely,\" Fauci said.\n\n\"That's it. ... We can have our freedom and our party later. Right now, let's pull together,\" McConaughey said.",

        "authors": [],
        "body": "MEXICO CITY -- Mexican officials on Thursday downplayed the country's rate of coronavirus infections and deaths among medical personnel, appearing to dispute reports this week that Mexico had the highest rate in the world.\n\nThe Health Department said 1,410 doctors, nurses and other hospital employees had died from COVIED-19, while a total of 104,590 medical workers had tested positive for the coronavirus.\n\nInfections among among health care personnel represented about 17% of Mexico's total 616,900 coronavirus cases, though such workers account for only about 1% of the population. Deaths in the sector were only about 2% of Mexico's total deaths, and the government said the fact that health care workers died less frequently than other severe cases showed they weren't particularly hard hit by the pandemic.\n\nThe argument appeared to ignore that health care workers are younger in general than other severe cases -- almost half of those severely ill from COVID-19 are above retirement age -- and that they presumably have better medical knowledge and access to care which tend to improve their chances of survival.\n\nOnly people with severe symptoms are tested in Mexico -- 99% of Mexicans have never had a coronavirus test, leading most observers to conclude that the country's infections are vastly under counted.\n\nThe government acknowledged that only about 283,000 medical workers had gotten tests so far, probably equivalent to one-third or one-fourth of the country's health care employees, depending on how that is defined. There are about 650,000 government health care workers in Mexico and nearly that many in the private health care sector.\n\nThe Health Department said as many as 12.3% of front-line medical personnel caring for COVID-19 patients got infected, compared to a confirmed infection rate of only about 0.5% for the population as a whole.\n\nOfficials sought to deflect criticism that medical workers have not had adequate protective gear by saying workers who took leaves from government hospitals during the pandemic were infected at only slightly lower rates than those who remained on duty. However, many of those on leave had outside jobs, probably at other health care facilities, and many took leaves because their age or underlying health conditions made them more vulnerable to developing severe COVID-19 symptoms if infected.\n\nHealth professionals have staged protests over a lack of adequate personal protective equipment, and early in the pandemic there were at least two confirmed outbreaks at hospitals that sickened dozens of health care professionals.\n\nThe government has claimed since March that hospital workers have had all the protective gear they need, but on several occasions hospital employees have blocked streets in Mexico City displaying what they said was ill-fitting, insufficient or substandard gear.\n\nIn a report Wednesday, Amnesty International said Mexico leads the world in coronavirus deaths among its health care workers, surpassing the United States at 1,077, the United Kingdom at 649, and Brazil at 634. It said nurses accounted for 42% of those infected, doctors made up 27% and other hospital employees such as technicians, aides and maintenance and cleaning staff were 31%.\n\nDeath statistics vary, depending on who each country classifies as a health care worker, how deaths are considered confirmed, and how they are reported.\n\nThe Pan American Health Organization, for example, reported 2,506 COVID-19 deaths among all health workers in the Americas, and gave the same numbers for Mexico as Amnesty, but listed only 240 deaths for Brazil and 660 for the United States.",

    "Michigan Legislature cancels session after senator's test": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "LANSING, Mich. -- The Michigan Legislature on Monday canceled this week's session and hearings after a Lansing-area state senator tested positive for the coronavirus through screening required by his service in the Michigan Army National Guard.\n\nRepublican state Sen. Tom Barrett, of Charlotte, said he was told the results Sunday afternoon after being tested Friday. The 39-year-old said he was tested because the guard implemented a COVID-19 screening policy for all soldiers one week before they are to depart for training events.\n\nHe said he tested positive despite having taken \"reasonable precautions.\" Videos show him wearing a mask during several committee meetings last week and the week before.\n\nBarrett sponsored a bill in April that would repeal a law that has given Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer broad emergency powers to act unilaterally during the pandemic. The Senate-passed bill is pending in the House but would surely be vetoed by the governor if it passed.\n\n\"Thankfully I do not have any significant symptoms at this time, and I will be self-isolating according to medical guidelines,\" Barrett said in a statement. \"I have done my best to make contact with those I have been around in the past couple weeks so that they may also seek medical advice. I look forward to resuming my normal work schedule as quickly as possible.\"\n\nThe state Senate and House canceled a voting session that had been scheduled for Thursday and all committee hearings that had been set for Wednesday and Thursday.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mike Shirkey, a Clarklake Republican, encouraged caucus members to be tested.\n\n\"We all wish Senator Barrett a speedy recovery\" he said in a statement.\n\nIn July, a coronavirus outbreak in the California Legislature delayed the return from a scheduled summer recess. Many state legislatures shut down earlier this year as the pandemic took hold, but many eventually returned to work, with restrictions in place to limit the spread of the virus.\n\nThursday was when legislators might have voted on bills related to the start of the school year, including proposed changes to redefine \"attendance\" so that students would not have to be physically present in schools during the pandemic and limiting snow day forgiveness so that distance learning is done instead.\n\nOne controversial part of the plan approved by House Republicans would require districts to offer the option of in-person instruction to kids in kindergarten through fifth grade. Several schools have already announced plans to begin the academic year solely with remote teaching.\n\nBarrett is the third known Michigan state legislator -- and first state senator -- with a confirmed coronavirus case. A fourth, Democratic Rep. Isaac Robinson of Detroit, likely died of COVID-19 in March, though he was not tested for it, his mother said.\n\nFollow David Eggert at https://twitter.com/DavidEggert00",

        "body": "WASHINGTON -- A U.S. Naval Academy midshipman has been sentenced to 25 years after a military panel found him guilty of sexual assault and other charges.\n\nThe Capital Gazette reported Friday that Nixon Keago also was dismissed from the service and sentenced to forfeit all pay and allowances.\n\nThe 25-year-old also was found guilty of attempted sexual assault, obstruction of justice and burglary during a court-martial at the Washington Navy Yard. The charges stem from four separate incidents involving three women who were Naval Academy midshipmen at the time of the assaults.\n\nThe court-martial was delayed after Keago showed symptoms of COVID-19. He has since tested negative for the disease caused by the coronavirus.\n\nReneau Kennedy, a psychologist and government witness who studies forensic recidivism, testified last month that Keago has a low rehabilitation potential.\n\nIn closing arguments, Lt. Cmdr. Chris Cox said criminal charges did not prevent him from attempting to sexually assault women. He noted the last incident, which happened after Keago knew he was charged with sexual assault.\n\n\"Confinement is the only way to stop it,\" Cox said.\n\nDefense attorney Lt. Cmdr. Andrea Kissner urged the members to focus on Keago as a father, a son, a brother and a midshipman.\n\n\"Midshipman Keago is a person,\" Kissner said. \"And as a person, Midshipman Keago deserves a fair sentence.\"\n\nThe sentence represented nearly a middle ground between the defense and government. It was 20 years more than the defense asked for and 15 years less than the government's request.",

        "body": "LONDON -- Migrants crossing the English Channel arrived in the southern English port of Dover for the 10th day in a row Thursday, as British officials hardened their rhetoric against asylum-seekers.\n\nThe migrants, including children, were brought aboard a Border Force patrol boat into Dover harbor, where immigration officials conducted routine assessments for symptoms of the coronavirus.\n\nMore than 650 migrants have crossed the Channel, one of the world's busiest waterways, in small boats so far this month, encouraged by favorable weather. The numbers peaked on Aug. 6, when a record 235 migrants made it to England.\n\nThe Kent County Council, which oversees the area around Dover, said it could be just \"days away\" from being unable to look after more asylum-seeking children arriving on local shores.\n\nThe government asked for military assistance in a bid to make the crossing \"unviable\" for small boats. The Royal Air Force in recent days has been patrolling the English Channel with a new plane designed for anti-submarine warfare.\n\nBut Britain's attempts to put pressure on France to take tougher action to stop migrants from setting out on the perilous voyage has drawn ire from French officials.\n\nThe mayor of the French port of Calais reportedly said Wednesday that proposals to send the Royal Navy into the English Channel to tackle migrant crossings was a \"declaration of maritime war.\"\n\n\"We in Calais no longer want to be permanent hostages enduring the lectures of British leaders,\" Mayor Natacha Bouchart told regional channel France 3 in an interview.\n\nBritish and French officials met Tuesday in the latest talks to put more muscle into efforts to stop the record number of migrant crossings. The two sides have long cooperated to stop migrants who mass around Calais and Dunkirk from sneaking onto trains or hiding in trucks to enter Britain, but migrants' success at using small boats is putting renewed pressure on officials to act.\n\nBritish daily newspaper The Times reported Thursday that British Home Secretary Priti Patel vowed to improve the U.K.'s asylum system, which she reportedly described as one \"exploited by leftie Labour-supporting lawyers\" seeking to hinder government attempts to deport people.\n\nDavid Lammy, from the opposition Labour party, called the comments \"extremely distasteful.\"",

        "authors": [],
        "body": "HOUSTON -- Inside a sweltering housing unit with no power and a stench of human waste, men at one Louisiana immigration detention center pounded on the windows and pleaded to be let outside. It had been nearly two days since Hurricane Laura had knocked out electricity in their unit, according to two of the detainees.\n\nThe guards let them out into the yard, and power was restored that night. But advocates accuse many immigration detention centers in Louisiana of continued mistreatment during and after Hurricane Laura, which hit the U.S. Gulf Coast on Thursday and killed at least 18 people in the region.\n\nThe two detainees who spoke to The Associated Press also said they were held in the same cramped dormitory as people with COVID-19 symptoms who later tested positive. They spoke on the condition of anonymity because they feared retaliation from immigration authorities.\n\nLouisiana has quietly become a hub for immigration detention during the Trump administration, holding thousands of asylum seekers who have been denied bond by immigration authorities as well as others seeking to remain in the United States or awaiting deportation. At least eight new jails have opened in recent years, including some former prisons converted into immigration detention.\n\nThe Jackson Parish Sheriff's Office confirmed on its Facebook page that there was a Saturday protest at the Jackson Parish Correctional Center, a 1,200-bed immigration jail in Jonesboro, Louisiana. The sheriff's office said detainees on Saturday \"were upset about having no electricity and running water\" and \"damaged their dormitory in protest.\"\n\n\"The protest was squashed and activity is back to normal,\" the sheriff's office said.\n\nU.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement spokesman Bryan Cox said authorities moved detainees from two facilities in southern Louisiana to the northern part of the state before the hurricane made landfall, though he did not identify the jails. Cox said the agency's \"planning and preparation\" prevented any \"extended absence of power or water\" at immigration jails.\n\nScott Sutterfield, an executive at LaSalle Corrections, which operates the Jackson Parish facility, did not respond to requests for comment. LaSalle has been accused of mishandling the coronavirus and not following ICE regulations elsewhere in Louisiana.\n\nThe power went out at the Jackson Parish jail Thursday night, according to the two detainees. A dorm of about 60 people had a single fan that recirculated hot, humid air, they said.\n\nThe next day, the toilets started to overflow and pushed waste-filled water across the dormitory, they said. One of the detainees, an asylum seeker from Cameroon, said he and others mopped the waste without gloves. The smell of waste persisted.\n\nOn Friday night, many of the men were allowed to sleep in the yard because the air inside the dormitory was so stifling. But they were confined to the housing unit again Saturday and began to protest when they felt guards were ignoring the conditions inside, he said.\n\nThe power came back that night, restoring air conditioning. Guards are bringing the detainees food and bottled water, the Cameroonian man said.\n\nBut they have new concerns about the coronavirus, which has spread rapidly through many immigration detention facilities, with more than 5,300 cases and six deaths nationwide.\n\nAccording to both detainees, about 10 men were tested last week for the virus after showing symptoms and brought back to their housing unit instead of being isolated. Then, on Saturday night, the people were pulled out of the unit when they tested positive.\n\nOn Monday, according to the second man who spoke to AP, detainees were starting to feel sick but were being denied tests altogether.\n\nLuz Lopez, an attorney at the Southern Poverty Law Center, said in a statement that ICE and private prison companies \"deny basic human dignity.\"\n\n\"They remain unaccountable to Congress and avert justice by any means necessary, even amid natural disasters,\" she said. \"We demand answers to the unspeakable conditions in the Louisiana ICE prisons.\"",

        "authors": [],
        "body": "As movie theaters come back to life across the country, the National Association of Theater Owners is helping to take the guess work out of safe operating practices in the era of COVID-19.\n\nThe trade organization is announcing a set of health and safety protocols Friday based on research and guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the World Health Organization and the Occupational Safety and Heath Administration. Over 300 companies representing more than 2,600 theater locations in the U.S. have already signed on to the CinemaSafe program.\n\n\"In this new pandemic world, moviegoers need to know that there is a consistent, science and experience-based set of health and safety protocols in place no matter what theater they visit,\" said John Fithian, the association's president and CEO, in a statement. \"This unprecedented industry-wide effort is a promise designed to meet that need.\"\n\nThe guidelines outline comprehensive mask policies, which are required for employees and patrons with a few exceptions for children under 2 years old and when consuming concessions -- but only when approved by state and local health authorities. The rules state that masks should also be provided to employees who don't have them.\n\nThey also sketch out recommendations for reduced capacity screenings, air filtration optimization, cashless concessions, mobile ticketing, enhanced cleaning policies and employee health training about hand hygiene and the signs and symptoms of COVID-19.\n\nThe association has been working for months to develop the rules in consultation with epidemiologists and industry experts. The organization's executive board includes the leaders of the major exhibition chains, like AMC Entertainment, Cinemark and Cineworld/Regal.\n\nMost indoor movie theaters shuttered in mid-March to help prevent the spread of coronavirus. This week, the major theater chains in the U.S. have started to slowly reopen locations. Although many have said they are complying with local mandates and generally accepted best practices, there was not until now a set of industry-wide guidelines. This lack of oversight led to situations like the mask backlash that resulted in all the major exhibitors reversing course to require face coverings.\n\nThe CinemaSafe protocols are voluntary. Companies complying with the guidelines can display a CinemaSafe badge on their websites and, eventually, at their locations so patrons are aware.\n\nDr. David F. Goldsmith, an occupational and environmental epidemiologist at George Washington University's Milken Institute School of Public Health, reviewed the CinemaSafe guidelines.\n\n\"These protocols, and the way they were developed, demonstrate a serious, comprehensive effort by movie theater owners to examine every aspect of their operations, identify potential risks, and reduce them,\" Goldsmith said.\n\nDr. Joyce Sanchez, an infectious disease specialist and director of the Travel Health Clinic at Froedtert & the Medical College of Wisconsin, said that the protocols address, \"Two of the three general concepts that factor into activity risk: distance, dose and duration.\"\n\nSanchez said that duration can't be controlled but noted that movie runtimes are similar to that of a domestic flight or time spent at a restaurant.\n\n\"While every activity outside the home carries risks, these additional measures can help to mitigate them,\" she added.",

        "authors": [],
        "body": "SEOUL, South Korea -- In a rare display of urgency, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un held his third high-level political conference in as many weeks, where he raised alarm about the nation's coronavirus response and a typhoon forecast to hit the country early Thursday.\n\nDuring an enlarged meeting of the Politburo of the ruling Workers' Party on Tuesday, Kim lamented unspecified \"defects\" and \"shortcomings\" in the country's' anti-virus campaign and urged that they be corrected swiftly, according to the North's official Korean Central News Agency said Wednesday.\n\nKim also called thorough preparations to minimize damage from Typhoon Bavi, which comes weeks after torrential rains caused flooding and massive damage to homes and crops, inflicting further pain to an economy ravaged by U.S.-led sanctions over its nuclear weapons and border closures amid the pandemic.\n\nKim set tasks for the party and public services at every level, \"saying that to thoroughly prevent the casualties by the typhoon and minimize the damage to crops is important work which can never be neglected even a moment,\" KCNA paraphrased the leader as saying.\n\nTyphoon Bavi as of Wednesday morning was near the South Korean island of Jeju and was on course to hit the northwest coast of the Korean Peninsula around daybreak Thursday morning. South Korea's weather agency said it had a maximum wind speed of 155 kilometers per hour (96 mph) and was forecast as one of the strongest to hit the peninsula this year.\n\nIn another ruling party meeting last week, Kim admitted the country's economy has not improved as he had hoped. The Workers' Party cited \"internal and external situations\" as hurting the country's economic development, likely referring to U.S.-led sanctions over North Korea's nuclear program, the recent flooding and the efforts of closing the country's borders and other steps taken during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nDuring the meeting last week, the ruling party scheduled a rare congress in January to set development goals for the next five years.\n\nExperts say the coronavirus derailed some of Kim's major economic goals after North Korea imposed a lockdown that significantly reduced trade with China -- its major ally and economic lifeline -- and likely hampered its ability to mobilize its workforce.\n\nThe North has yet to confirm a single-case of COVID-19, but outsiders have widely doubted its virus-free claim. In late July, Kim ordered a lockdown of Kaesong, a city near the border with South Korea after the North reported it found a person with COVID-19 symptoms. It later told the World Health Organization the person's test results were inconclusive.",

        "authors": [],
        "body": "CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- NASCAR has decided it will not grant COVID-19 relief during the playoffs, meaning a positive coronavirus test will end a driver's championship bid.\n\nThe playoffs begin Sunday at Darlington Raceway in South Carolina without a safety net for the 16 participants during the pandemic. It's up to each driver to protect themselves from COVID-19, understanding there is no cushion for missing a race.\n\n\"I'm probably not going to go to college and hit up a keg stand,\" Clint Bowyer said. \"If you have COVID, you can't race. It's not a judgment call.\"\n\nNASCAR at its discretion grants waivers during its regular season for illness, emergency or personal reasons. The waiver maintains playoff eligibility, if the driver qualifies, but no points are awarded while sidelined.\n\nJimmie Johnson and Austin Dillon both missed one race during the season following a positive COVID-19 test and earned zero points. Dillon won a race -- worth an automatic berth in the playoffs -- but the seven-time champion Johnson went winless and missed the cut by six points.\n\nNASCAR made no changes for the 10-race playoff series, so missing a race would would effectively end a driver's championship chances.\n\n\"If a driver tests positive, that driver needs to have two negative tests in a 24-hour period, or a 10-day period. We are not going to change those rules,\" said NASCAR President Steve Phelps.\n\nAs one of the first major sports to resume competition during the pandemic, NASCAR put in place guidelines designed to limit both exposure to the virus and its spread. Infield access has been closed to all but essential personnel and events have been held with both limited spectators and empty grandstands.\n\nNASCAR does not test for the coronavirus and is trusting its participants.\n\n\"If you look at the success that we've had to date, the protocols are working very well,\" Phelps said. \"Is everything perfect and foolproof? It's not. But for us, we've been pleased with how it's gone thus far.\"\n\nKevin Harvick won the regular-season title and is the top seed in the playoffs with seven victories. The pandemic has already led to radical changes in his lifestyle that have been bolstered now that the postseason is here. .\n\nHe kept his 8-year-old son home from school this semester and the Harvick family has eliminated all social events. They don't even go to the grocery store, he said.\n\n\"I travel by myself. I drive in the rental car by myself. I go to the motorhome by myself. I get back in the rental car and I go home,\" Harvick said. \"It's touched pretty much every portion of our life, trying to create an environment to be as safe as possible.\"\n\nNASCAR until 2004 crowned its champion on a season-long points system that penalized drivers for missing races. It forced competitors to drive injured -- Ricky Rudd once infamously taped his eyelids open to drive and Dale Earnhardt Jr. hid concussions -- and the waiver system was ultimately implemented.\n\nThe waiver helped reigning Cup Series champion Kyle Busch in his first title campaign when he missed 11 races during the 2015 regular season with a broken leg and broken ankle. He won four times to race his way into the playoffs and then claimed the title.\n\nA serious injury would obviously take a driver out of contention. But the coronavirus is not as clear cut and drivers could theoretically not be tested to protect their season. Johnson was not suffering symptoms but was tested after his wife received a positive test; Dillon was experiencing mild symptoms. Both were cleared to return in under a week.\n\n\"I've talked to both of them that had it and (they've) probably had worse hangovers,\" Bowyer said.\n\nJoey Logano dismissed the idea of deliberately not being tested out of fear of missing a race.\n\n\"Our safety needs to be the utmost concern, not just for ourselves, but in a selfless way we need to be smart about testing,\" Logano said. \"We also need to be smart about who we see and how we do things. As the world is starting to open up slowly, I think for these 10 weeks I probably still need to be smart about it because my season is on the line.\"",

This is the first documented reinfection among nearly 6 million COVID-19 cases to date.\n\nNevertheless, the first documented reinfection is notable in how quickly the patient seemed to be reinfected after his initial recovery.\n\n\"Having had it doesn't mean you can't get it again, that's what this shows,\" Dr. Mark Pandori, director of the Nevada State Public Health Laboratory and co-author of the study, said in an interview with ABC's \"World News Tonight.\" \"It tells us possibly things we still don't know about this virus ... or that there is a danger that even if you've had it that your immune system may not protect you from a significant illness next time.\"\n\nThe case report, which has not yet been peer-reviewed and is currently only available as a pre-print, tells the story of a 25-year-old man in Nevada. In late March, he developed some of the classic signs of COVID-19: sore throat, cough, diarrhea, headache and nausea. After testing positive on April 18, he began to gradually feel better, and the virus appeared to leave his system, seemingly verified with two consecutive negative tests in May.\n\nBut only a few weeks later, he started to feel ill again, testing positive for COVID-19 once again in June. This time, he was admitted to the hospital with serious symptoms.\n\nAt first, the researchers wondered if the virus had been hiding in his body the whole time -- mutating, changing and eventually developing into something that caused him to get sick with COVID-19 a second time. But they ultimately rejected this theory, saying that the two viruses were so different that it would have been nearly impossible for the virus to change that quickly inside his body. The only explanation was that he had been infected by a slightly different version of the coronavirus.\n\n\"There's no invulnerability here,\" Pandori told ABC News. \"Whether you've had this infection before or whether perhaps in the future vaccinated, there won't be such a thing as invulnerability.\"\n\nThe finding could affect how the world attempts to limit the spread of the coronavirus while eagerly awaiting an effective vaccine. Experts have long expected that humans would have some kind of immunity after getting infected with the coronavirus, but no one is sure just how long that immunity will last. These new reinfections provide important new data as experts rush to figure that out.\n\nDr. Akiko Iwasaki, Waldemar Von Zedtwitz professor in the Department of Immunobiology at Yale University, wrote on Twitter that this patient's case was different from the Hong Kong patient because his prior infection didn't seem to help him fight off the virus.\n\n\"This time, unlike the case in Hong Kong, the immune system did not protect this person from reinfection or disease,\" her tweet read.\n\nHowever, scientists interviewed by ABC News say these isolated case reports can't be applied to the average person. It's still unclear if this 25-year-old man had any underlying conditions that might have put him at risk for more severe illness.\n\nWhat remains to be seen is how common reinfection events like this are and whether they will continue in the months ahead.",

    "New COVID-19 mandates on health care facilities get pushback": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "WASHINGTON -- Threatening fines and funding cut-offs, the Trump administration on Tuesday issued new COVID-19 requirements for nursing homes and hospitals, prompting immediate pushback from beleaguered industries.\n\nTo check the spread of the coronavirus in nursing homes, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services announced it will require facilities to test staff regularly or face fines.\n\nThe move comes months after the White House first urged governors to test all nursing home residents and staff. With residents, nursing homes are being required to offer them coronavirus tests if there is an outbreak or if any show symptoms.\n\nOfficials also reinforced a reporting mandate for hospitals. It included a thinly veiled threat to cut off Medicare and Medicaid funds to facilities that fail to report certain COVID-19 data daily to the federal Health and Human Services department. Hospitals responded with a sharp rebuke, calling the move \"heavy-handed\" and raising the specter of loss of vital services for local communities in a pandemic, less than three months before Election Day.\n\nLong-term care facilities represent less than 1% of the U.S. population, but they account for 42% of the COVID-19 deaths, with more than 70,000 fatalities reported by the COVID Tracking Project.\n\nThe plight of frail elders in nursing homes is politically sensitive for President Donald Trump, who is trying to maintain support from older voters amid disapproval of the government's pandemic response. His administration is distributing fast-test machines to nursing homes, but there are continued reports that cases have been rising and facilities still face shortages of supplies like masks.\n\n\"Our recommendations for testing in nursing homes go back as far back as March and April,\" said Seema Verma, head of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS. \"What's different about today is that this is now a requirement ... we want to make sure every single nursing home is complying.\"\n\nIndependent research indicates that the coronavirus most likely gets into nursing homes via staffers who unwittingly bring it in from surrounding communities where it has started to spread. Staffers who have yet to develop symptoms may have no clue that they're infected.\n\nVerma said the testing requirement for staff will be keyed to the level of virus activity in local areas. If the positive rate is below 5%, nursing homes will have to test staff once a month. If the rate is 5% - 10%, testing will be required once a week. If the rate is above 10%, staff will have to be tested twice a week. Florida, Iowa and Nevada are examples of states where the COVID-19 positive rate is now above 10%.\n\nThe government will provide $2.5 billion to help nursing homes with testing costs, Verma also announced. The administration's campaign to distribute fast-test machines and an initial supply of tests is supposed to be done by the end of September.\n\nThe nursing home industry said it supports mandatory testing as long as facilities are given what they need to comply with requirements.\n\nMark Parkinson, head of the industry group American Health Care Association, said nursing homes in many parts of the country still can't get timely results on COVID-19 tests.\n\nCMS \"must factor in the delays that continue to be a reality,\" Parkinson said in a statement. \"Otherwise facilities could face fines for circumstances beyond their control and be conducting tests that are so delayed that they have little clinical value.\"\n\nThe hospital reporting requirement that was also announced Tuesday follows confusion and misgivings surrounding a Trump administration directive that facilities send critical COVID-19 data directly to HHS instead of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, as had been the case.\n\nThe information includes numbers of confirmed or suspected COVID-19 cases, how many intensive-care beds are occupied, and the availability of essential supplies and equipment such as ventilators and masks and gowns.\n\nThe regulation basically says if hospitals want to continue to participate in Medicare and Medicaid, they must report the information as requires. The American Hospital Association called for the requirement to be immediately rescinded.\n\n\"Hospitals and health systems consistently have put forward a good faith effort to report the data needed to battle COVID-19 under very trying circumstances, despite the ever-changing requests from the government on data reporting,\" Rick Pollack, president of the American Hospital Association, said in a statement. \"Since February, the government has made at least six changes to how they want hospitals to report data.\"\n\nFederal statistics show that 94% of hospitals are reporting the required data, said Pollack. He added his organization has done some investigation of its own and found that in some cases hospitals had sent in their reports, but the information had not gotten through the government system.\n\n\"It's beyond perplexing why CMS would use a regulatory sledgehammer -- threatening Medicare participation -- to the very organizations that are on the front lines in the fight against COVID-19.\"\n\nCMS chief Verma said the requirement is meant to correct deficiencies in reporting vital data needed to track and contain the pandemic.",

        "authors": [],
        "body": "WELLINGTON, New Zealand -- Health authorities in New Zealand were scrambling Wednesday to trace the source of a new outbreak of the coronavirus as the nation's largest city went back into lockdown.\n\nAuthorities have found four cases of the virus in one Auckland household from an unknown source, the first reported cases of local transmission in the country in 102 days. The news came as an unpleasant surprise to many and raised questions about whether the nation's general election would go ahead as planned next month.\n\nAuthorities said two of the people who had tested positive had traveled to the tourist city of Rotorua last weekend while suffering symptoms, and they were now trying to track their movements.\n\n\"We are working with urgency to find out what places the family may have visited while in Rotorua over the weekend,\" Director-General of Health Ashley Bloomfield said. \"But the important thing is here, people in Rotorua and indeed around the country should be vigilant about their health and seek advice if they have symptoms.\"\n\nAuckland was moved to Alert Level 3 at midday Wednesday, a designation initially set to continue through midnight Friday. That means that non-essential workers are required to stay home, while bars, restaurants and most businesses will be closed.\n\nThe rest of the country was moved to Alert Level 2, meaning that mass gatherings are limited to 100 attendees and people are required to socially distance themselves.\n\nBloomfield said they would use genome sequencing as part of their effort to find the source of the new outbreak.\n\nPrime Minister Jacinda Ardern said she had worked quickly to impose the Auckland lockdown measures after first learning about the cases Tuesday afternoon.\n\n\"We are taking a rapid response to break the chain of transmission through contact tracing, testing, and the gathering of information,\" she said.\n\nArdern said Aucklanders were also \"strongly encouraged\" but not mandated to wear masks, and that authorities were releasing 5 million masks from a central supply. New Zealanders have not widely worn masks before, although authorities have been urging people to buy them or fashion them from scarves or bandannas just in case.\n\nThe nation's parliament was due to be dissolved Wednesday ahead of a general election on Sept. 19 as lawmakers hit the campaign trail. But Ardern said she was delaying the dissolution until at least Monday in case lawmakers needed to meet at short notice. She said she was also seeking advice about options for the election.\n\nUnder New Zealand law, the government could delay the election for up to about two months. The main candidates have already cancelled most of their planned campaign events for the rest of the week.\n\nThe outbreak was found after a man in his 50s went to his doctor Monday with symptoms and was swabbed twice, testing positive both times. Six other people in the man's household were then tested, with three more testing positive.\n\nThe case has health authorities scratching their heads, as the man had not recently traveled overseas and had no immediately apparent connection with infections contained at the border.\n\nUntil Tuesday, the only known cases of the virus in New Zealand were 22 travelers held in quarantine after returning from abroad.\n\nNew Zealand has been praised globally for its virus response and had just celebrated reaching 100 days without any known community transmission.\n\nThe South Pacific nation of 5 million initially got rid of the virus by imposing a strict lockdown in late March when only about 100 people had tested positive for the disease, stopping its spread.\n\nLife had returned to normal for many people as they attended rugby games at packed stadiums and sat down in bars and restaurants without fear of getting infected. But some had warned that the country had become complacent.",

        "authors": [],
        "body": "COPENHAGEN, Denmark -- The number of passengers on a Norwegian cruise ship who have tested positive for the coronavirus has reached 43, authorities said Tuesday.\n\nThe outbreak on the MS Roald Amundsen raised new questions about safety on cruise ships during the pandemic even as the industry is pressing to resume sailings after shutting down in March.\n\nThe ship's owner on Monday halted all trips and Norway closed its ports to cruise ships for two weeks.\n\nThe city of Trondheim reported the two new cases -- a man in his 70s with light symptoms and a child under age 10 with no symptoms -- saying both had been passengers on the ship. They were not identified.\n\nA third passenger will be tested Tuesday, the city said. Trondheim sits about halfway to Tromsoe, north of the Arctic Circle, where the empty ship is docked.\n\nBut since the cruise line often acts like a local ferry, traveling from port to port along Norway's west coast, some passengers disembarked along the route and may have spread the virus to local communities.\n\nA total of 69 municipalities in Norway could have been affected, Norwegian news agency NTB reported on Monday.\n\nThe Hurtigruten cruise line was one of the first companies to resume sailing during the pandemic, starting cruises to Norway out of northern Germany in June with a single ship, then adding cruises in July to the Arctic archipelago of Svalbard that is part of the Scandinavian country.\n\nIn Tromsoe, 41 passengers who had tested positive have been admitted to a hospital. The cruise line said it suspended the ship and two others -- the MS Fridtjof Nansen and the MS Spitsbergen -- from operating for an indefinite period.\n\nIt's not clear how the MS Roald Amundsen outbreak began. NTB reported that 33 of the infected crew members came from the Philippines and the others were from Norway, France and Germany.

    "Officials change COVID testing advice, bewildering experts": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "NEW YORK -- U.S. health officials have sparked a wave of confusion after posting guidelines that coronavirus testing is not necessary for people who have been in close contact with infected people.\n\nThe new guidance was posted earlier this week on the website of a federal agency, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nThe CDC previously had advised local health departments to test people who have been within 6 feet of an infected person for more than 15 minutes. But on Monday a CDC testing overview page was changed to say that testing is no longer recommended for symptom-less people who were in close contact situations.\n\nThere was a caveat, however. Testing may be recommended for those with health problems that make them more likely to suffer severe illness from an infection, or if their doctor or local state officials advise they get tested.\n\nCDC officials referred all questions to the agency's parent organization, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services in Washington, D.C. That suggests that HHS ordered the change, not CDC, said Jennifer Nuzzo, a Johns Hopkins University public health researcher.\n\nHHS officials officials have offered little explanation, but scheduled a briefing for Wednesday afternoon to answer questions.\n\nAcross the country, public health experts called the change bizarre. They noted that testing contacts of infected people is a core element of public health efforts to keep outbreaks in check, and that a large percentage of infected people -- the CDC has said as many as 40% -- exhibit no symptoms.\n\n\"I was taken aback and didn't know that it was under consideration,\" said John Auerbach, president of Trust for America's Health, a nonprofit that works to improve U.S. preparedness against disease. \"The recommendation not to test asymptomatic people who likely have been exposed is not in accord with the science.\"\n\nUltimately, restricting testing could be self-defeating, because it could skew the numbers and create a perception that rates of infection are higher. Testing people who appear to be healthy would tend to lower the overall rate of positive results, while narrowing testing to people who are sick would raise the overall positive rate, Auerbach said.\n\nWhy HHS would order such a change quickly became a matter of speculation. Dr. Carlos del Rio, an infectious diseases specialist at Emory University, suggested in a tweet that there are two possible explanations.\n\nOne is that it may be driven by testing supply issues that in many parts of the country have caused delays in results of a week or more, he suggested.\n\nThe other is that President Donald Trump simply wants to see case counts drop, and discouraging more people from getting tested is one way to do it, he said.\n\nDr. Tom Frieden, who was head of the CDC during the Obama administration, said the move follows another recent change: to no longer recommend quarantine for travelers coming from areas where infections are more common.\n\n\"Both changes are highly problematic\" and need to be better explained, said Frieden, who now is president of Resolve to Save Lives, a nonprofit program that works to prevent epidemics.\n\nFrieden said he, too, believes HHS forced CDC to post the changes. He called it \"a sad day\" because \"CDC is being told what to write on their website.\"\n\nAssociated Press writer Ricardo Alonso-Zaldivar in Washington, D.C. contributed to this report.\n\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute's Department of Science Education.

    "Pandemic's toll among journalists in Peru is especially high": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "MEXICO CITY -- Dozens of journalists have died from COVID-19 in Peru since the pandemic began, in the highest reported death toll of media workers from the new coronavirus in Latin America, according to journalists' groups that are monitoring available data.\n\nAs in many countries, the new coronavirus has hit virtually all sectors of society and areas in Peru, killing and sickening medical workers, teachers, street vendors, the unemployed and others. But emerging data on fatalities among journalists in Peru is among the highest in the world, although it is extremely difficult to confirm in many cases whether they got sick after covering pandemic news or doing other work.\n\nOn Wednesday, a Catholic priest held a virtual Mass at a church for 22 journalists -- 19 men and three women -- that the College of Journalists of Lima said had died in the Lima area alone. Ricardo Burgos Rojas, the college dean, said many were freelancers and some worked for Panamericana Television, TV Peru, Agencia de Noticias Andina, Radio Exitosa and other outlets.\n\n\"What's happening with the journalists in Peru is somewhat a reflection of what's happening with the Peruvian population,\" said Zuliana Lainez, secretary general of the National Association of Journalists of Peru, a union based in Lima.\n\nAt least 82 reporters in Peru died from the disease between March 16, when Peru imposed a lockdown because of the health crisis, and Aug. 17, according to the association. Many were more than 65 years old, and several of those listed were retired.\n\n\"In May the (Amazon) jungle and the north of the country had the biggest number of victims, now it's the south of the country,\" Lainez said. In many cases, she said, reporters did not have adequate protective equipment while attending news conferences or traveling to assignments, and felt compelled to work because they needed the money.\n\nLainez said the data was based on information from nationwide affiliates, including coronavirus test results, medical reports and interviews with family members. The association estimates that more than half of those who died had not contracted the virus because of their work as journalists, based on their movements, illness within their families and other factors.\n\nLike other countries, Peru has struggled to obtain data and reconcile discrepancies over COVID-19. Doctors have sometimes attributed a death to the disease based on symptoms, rather than a test result. There are questions about the accuracy of death certificates. Especially in the early days of the pandemic, there was a stigma attached to a coronavirus-related death.\n\nThe Peruvian toll is more than double the reported 40 deaths of journalists in neighboring Ecuador, and a total of 171 journalists in Latin America are reported to have died from the disease, according to the regional office of the International Federation of Journalists. However, the non-profit Fundamedios group said Aug. 11 that the death toll in Ecuador was 20.\n\nOn Aug. 7, the Inter American Press Association paid tribute to more than 100 media workers in the Americas who had died from COVID-19 \"in the exercise of their profession,\" listing names of the deceased but not providing details about how they may have contracted the virus.\n\nThe Press Emblem Campaign, a Geneva-based group launched by journalists, said July 1 that Peru had lost the most journalists to COVID-19 of any country in the world.\n\nThe Committee to Protect Journalists does not have a database of journalists who have contracted COVID-19. The New York-based group said media workers \"are often potentially exposed to infection through travel, interviews, and the locations they find themselves working in,\" and recommends the use of protective equipment, as well as hygiene and social distancing measures, to reduce the chance of infection in the field.\n\nCPJ said it has documented several cases of journalists who died or were suspected to have died of COVID-19 after they were jailed because of their work, including in Egypt, Honduras and Kyrgyzstan.\n\nPeru, with a population of 33 million, has reported more than 26,800 COVID-19 deaths, though the real number is believed to be much higher because of difficulties in confirming the cause of many fatalities. It has logged 560,000 coronavirus cases, placing it in the top 10 countries -- half of them in Latin America -- with the most confirmed cases in the world.\n\nFreelancer Ricardo Guti\u00e9rrez Aparicio was among the first Peruvian journalists reported to have died of COVID-19. The College of Journalists of Lima announced his death on April 1.\n\nPeruvian journalist C\u00e9sar Campos tweeted two days later that, with the death of his friend, \"The virus and its tragic consequences are knocking on our door.\"",

    "Piscotty hits A's 2nd walkoff slam this year, beats Rangers": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "OAKLAND, Calif. -- Stephen Piscotty hit Oakland's second walkoff grand slam of the year and the Athletics beat the Texas Rangers 5-1 Tuesday night for their fourth straight win.\n\nThe late-game theatrics helped the A's win on a night when prized pitching prospect Jesus Luzardo pitched five scoreless innings in his first career start for Oakland and Texas starter Lance Lynn allowed first run of the season.\n\nEdinson Volquez (0-1) got into trouble quickly in the ninth inning when he walked two batters and gave up a hit to load the bases with nobody out.\n\nVolquez retired Robbie Grossman on a popup before Piscotty hit a first-pitch drive over the wall in center to match the opening night 10th-inning slam by Matt Olson against the Angels.\n\nLiam Hendriks (1-0) pitched a perfect ninth for the win.\n\nLynn had allowed just five hits in 18 scoreless innings to begin the season before finally faltering in the seventh against the A's. Matt Chapman led off the frame with a drive to right-center for his second homer of the season to tie the game at 1.\n\nThe Rangers had taken the lead an inning earlier on an RBI double by Todd Frazier.\n\nThat helped make it a celebratory night for Luzardo. The 22-year-old lefty was the youngest A's pitcher to start a game since Brett Anderson in 2010 and lived up to the hype.\n\nHe provided a late-season spark last year out of the bullpen but had his quest to start delayed this summer when he tested positive for the coronavirus before the start of camp last month despite dealing with no symptoms and not having any family members or friends who were sick.\n\nThe wait was worth it as he was dazzling in his debut. He overpowered the Rangers at times, striking out Joey Gallo on a 96 mph to end the first.\n\nHe also showed off his athleticism in the field with a nifty play on a high-hopper to retire Scott Heineman to end the second.\n\nLuzardo allowed just two hits and two walks with five strikeouts.\n\nTRAINER'S ROOM\n\nRangers: LHP Joely Rodriguez was activated off the injured list and 1B Greg Bird was placed on the IL with a strained right calf muscle. ... 2B Rougned Odor remains sidelined after leaving Saturday's game with tightness in the oblique area on his right side. Manager Chris Woodward said he hopes Odor is back later this week.\n\nAthletics: The A's placed RHP Jordan Weems on the 10-day injured list retroactive to Aug. 1 with a strained right lat muscle and recalled RHP James Kaprielian from the club's San Jose alternate site. Manager Bob Melvin said he hopes Weems will be back as soon as the 10 days are up.\n\nUNCONVENTIONAL STRATEGY\n\nThe Rangers opened the scoring in the sixth with a bit of an unconventional strategy. With two outs and nobody on, No. 3 hitter Gallo bunted away from the shift for a single off Yusmeiro Petit. The move paid off when Todd Frazier followed with an RBI double.\n\nSOUVENIR\n\nBird ended up making a nice play even after going on the injured list. He caught a foul pop in his hat while sitting in the stands during an at-bat by Frazier in the sixth inning.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nRangers RHP Kyle Gibson (0-1, 0.00 ERA) took a tough loss last Tuesday in his first start of the year as the Diamondbacks scored three unearned runs in a 4-1 victory. The A's oppose with lefty Sean Manaea (0-2, 7.00), who tries again for his first victory of the season.\n\nMore AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP -- Sports",

        "authors": [],
        "body": "Michigan defensive back Hunter Reynolds saw the tweets from Trevor Lawrence and other college football players, pushing for the opportunity to play this season, despite the pandemic.\n\nReynolds, one of the organizers behind a players' rights movement in the Big Ten, didn't like the way some on social media seemed to be pitting Lawrence's message against the efforts of #BigTenUnited and #WeAreUnited.\n\n\"There was a lot of division,\" Reynolds told AP early Monday morning.\n\nReynolds got on a call with Lawrence and the star quarterback's Clemson teammate, Darien Rencher, and within a matter of hours the summer of athlete empowerment found another gear.\n\nCollege football players from across the country united Sunday in an attempt to save their season and ensure they will no longer be left out of the sport's biggest decisions.\n\nLawrence, Ohio State quarterback Justin Fields, Oklahoma State All-America running back Chuba Hubbard, Alabama running back Najee Harris and numerous other players from Florida State to Oregon posted a graphic on social media with #WeWantToPlay and #WeAreUnited.\n\n\"We came to the conclusion, We Want to Play, their message might have been conveyed differently but at the end of the day the message wasn't too far off from what Big Ten United wanted to promote,\" Reynolds said. \"Which is we all want to play sports this fall. Every athlete, I'm pretty sure, wants to play their sports. They just want to do so safely.\"\n\nThe #WeAreUnited hashtag was used a week ago by a group of Pac-12 players in announcing a movement they say has the support of hundreds of peers within their conference. They have threatened mass opt-outs by players if concerns about COVID-19 protocols, racial injustice in college sports and economic rights for athletes are not addressed.\n\n#BigTenUnited arrived on the scene a couple days later, a movement that claimed the backing off 1,000 Big Ten football players. Their demands were more targeted, strictly related to health and safety in dealing with COVID-19.\n\nSunday night, the call with Reynolds, Rencher and Lawrence led to a Zoom meeting -- of course -- with some of the Pac-12 players involved in \"WeAreUnited.\"\n\nWashington State defensive lineman Dallas Hobbs got to work on a graphic and now the movement is officially nationwide.\n\n\"Just started bouncing ideas off each others' heads and kind of discussing where we go from here and we ended up coming up with that statement,\" said Reynolds, a senior from South Orange, New Jersey.\n\nUnder the logos of each Power Five conference -- ACC, Big Ten, Big 12, Pac-12 and SEC -- the players pronounced their platform:\n\n-- We all want to play football this season.\n\n-- Establish universal mandated health & safety procedures and protocols to protect college athletes against COVID-19 among all conferences throughout the NCAA.\n\n-- Give players the opportunity to opt out and respect their decision.\n\n-- Guarantee eligibility whether a player chooses to play the season or not.\n\n-- Use our voices to establish open communication and trust between players and officials: Ultimately create a College Football Players Association.\n\nAll of this capped a weekend during which the adults who run college sports seemed to be moving toward shutting it all down because of the pandemic.\n\nA day after the Mid-American Conference became the first of the major college football leagues to cancel the fall season, Power Five conference commissioners met Sunday. They discussed mounting concerns about whether a season can be safely conducted with the pandemic still not under control in the United States.\n\nBig 12 Commissioner Bob Bowlsby said no decisions on the season have been made, but conceded the outlook has not improved.\n\n\"Are we in a better place today than two weeks, ago? No, we're not,\" he said.\n\nBowlsby cited \"growing evidence and the growing pool of data around myocarditis.\"\n\nMyocarditis is inflammation of the heart and it has been found in some COVID-19 patients. There is concern it could be a long-term complication of contracting the virus even in young, healthy people, a group that has usually avoided severe cardiovascular symptoms.\n\nAlso Sunday night, the Big Ten's university presidents and chancellors held a previously unscheduled meeting, a person with knowledge of the meeting told The Associated Press. The person spoke on condition of anonymity because the meeting was not announced by the conference.\n\nAnother person with direct knowledge of the meeting, speaking on condition of anonymity, said no votes were taken or decisions made about the college football season.\n\nThe final call on whether major college football will played this season rests in the hands of the university presidents who oversee the largest conferences.\n\nWith doom and gloom hanging over college football, Lawrence, who has become the face of the sport in a summer of strife, tried to push back the tide with a series of tweets.\n\n\"People are at just as much, if not more risk, if we don't play,\" Lawrence posted. \"Players will all be sent home to their own communities where social distancing is highly unlikely and medical care and expenses will be placed on the families if they were to contract covid19.\"\n\nPenn State tight end Pat Freiermuth had a similar message, and the parents of Ohio State football players weighed in, too.\n\nReynolds wants athletes to have a say in the meetings that are deciding the fate of their sports -- starting now.\n\n\"All college athletes through unifying and not being afraid to speak our minds and having social media to kind of mobilize, I think that box on a Zoom call is something that is pretty attainable,\" he said. \"Especially, in the near future.\"\n\nFollow Ralph D.

        "body": "LISBON, Portugal -- Health authorities in Portugal are allowing the country's Communist Party to let 16,500 people into its annual open-air festival next weekend -- an unusually high number for a gathering in Europe amid the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nThe permit has caused an outcry because officials have for months slashed the number of people allowed into other public events, forcing many of them to cancel.\n\nThe announcement came as the center-left Socialist government is seeking political support from other parties, including the Communists, for its 2021 spending plan.\n\nThe festival, called Festa do Avante, features concerts and political speeches in a fenced-off area of countryside south of Lisbon. In past years it has drawn some 100,000 people, of a wide variety of ages, over its three days.\n\nThe event is a major source of income for the Communist Party, which has 10 seats in Portugal's 230-seat parliament.\n\nThe General Directorate for Health announced Monday that 16,563 people can be inside the festival at any one time, even though \"there is a real risk that, during the event, infected people with or without symptoms may be moving around.\" The Communist Party had wanted to sell 33,000 tickets per day this year.\n\nAuthorities say people at the festival must remain at least two meters apart, unless they share a household; concerts can take place only with distanced seating for the audience; no alcohol can be sold after 8 p.m.; and everyone over age 10 must wear a mask, among other measures.\n\nHealth Minister Marta Temido that \"the rules are well though-out.\"\n\n\"We hope the organizers are able to implement them and ensure people abide by them,\" she told a news conference.\n\nThe calculation of how many people can be at the festival was based on criteria used for how many can be on beaches, officials said.",

    "Russia's Navalny in coma, allegedly poisoned by toxic tea": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "MOSCOW -- Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny, one of Vladimir Putin's fiercest critics, lay in a coma Friday at a Siberian hospital, the victim of what his allies said appeared to be a poisoning engineered by the Kremlin.\n\nNavalny's organization was scrambling to make arrangements to transfer him to Germany for treatment; a German group said it was ready to send a plane for him and that a noted hospital in Berlin was ready to treat him.\n\nThe 44-year-old Navalny fell ill on a flight back to Moscow from the Siberian city of Tomsk on Thursday and was taken to a hospital after the plane made an emergency landing in Omsk, Navalny's spokeswoman, Kira Yarmysh, said on Twitter.\n\nShe told the Echo Moskvy radio station that he must have consumed poison in tea he drank at an airport cafe before boarding the plane early Thursday. During the flight, Navalny started sweating and asked her to talk to him so that he could \"focus on the sound of a voice.\" He then went to the bathroom and lost consciousness, and has been in a coma and on a ventilator in grave condition ever since.\n\nIn a video statement released early Friday in Omsk, Yarmysh said Navalny remained in critical condition and she called on the hospital's leadership \"not to obstruct us from providing all necessary documents for his transfer.\" It was not clear what the possible obstructions could be.\n\nOther opposition figures were quick to suggest Kremlin involvement.\n\n\"We are sure that the only people that have the capability to target Navalny or myself are Russian security services with definite clearance from Russia's political leadership,\" Pyotr Verzilov, a member of the protest group Pussy Riot who ended up in intensive care after suspected poisoning in 2018, told The Associated Press. \"We believe that Putin definitely is a person who gives that go-ahead in this situation.\"\n\nJaka Bizilj of the German organization Cinema For Peace, which arranged for Verzilov's treatment in Germany, said that at Verzilov's request \"we will send at midnight an air ambulance with medical equipment and specialists with which Navalny can be brought to Germany.\"\n\nOmsk is about 4,200 kilometers (2,500 miles) east of Berlin, roughly a six-hour flight.\n\nDoctors at Omsk Ambulance Hospital No. 1, where the politician was being treated, remained tight-lipped about his diagnosis saying only that they were considering a variety of theories, including poisoning. Local health officials said they found no indication that Navalny had suffered from a heart attack, stroke or the coronavirus.\n\nAuthorities initially refused to let Navalny's wife, Yulia, see her husband and have rejected requests for documentation that would allow him to be transferred to a European hospital for treatment, Yarmysh said.\n\nVerzilov, who was flown to Berlin for treatment in 2018, said hospitals in Omsk or Moscow would not be able to treat Navalny properly and expressed concern about possible pressure from security services that doctors could be under in Russia.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said it was necessary to wait for test results showing what caused Navalny's condition, adding the authorities would consider a request to allow Navalny to leave Russia, which has not fully opened its borders after a coronavirus lockdown, for treatment.\n\nState news agency Tass reported that police were not considering deliberate poisoning, a statement the politician's allies dismissed.\n\nReports about the alleged poisoning made waves in the West.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron said France was ready to offer Navalny and his family \"all necessary assistance ... in terms of health care, asylum, protection\" and insisted on the need to clarify what happened.\n\nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel, speaking at a joint news conference with Macron, echoed that sentiment. \"What is very important is that it will be clarified very urgently how it could come to the situation.\"\n\nBritish Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab and the United Nations also expressed concern over what happened to Navalny, and Amnesty International demanded a full and thorough investigation.\n\nThe widow of Alexander Litvinenko, the Russian agent who was killed in London by radioactive poisoning in 2006, voiced concern that Navalny's enemies within Russia may have decided that it's time to use a \"new tactic.\"\n\n\"Maybe they decided ... not to stop him just with an arrest but to stop him with poison. It looks like a new tactic against Navalny,\" Marina Litvinenko told The Associated Press from Sicily, Italy.\n\nLike many other opposition politicians in Russia, Navalny has been frequently detained by law enforcement and harassed by pro-Kremlin groups. In 2017, he was attacked by several men who threw antiseptic in his face, damaging an eye.\n\nLast year, Navalny was rushed to a hospital from prison, where he was serving a sentence following an administrative arrest, with what his team said was suspected poisoning. Doctors said he had a severe allergic attack and discharged him back to prison the following day.\n\nNavalny's Foundation for Fighting Corruption has been exposing graft among government officials, including some at the highest level. Last month, he had to shut the foundation after a financially devastating lawsuit from Yevgeny Prigozhin, a businessman with close ties to the Kremlin.\n\nBelarus' authoritarian President Alexander Lukashenko accused Navalny last week of organizing unprecedented mass protests against his re-election that have rocked Russia's ex-Soviet neighbor since Aug. 9. He did not, however, provide any evidence and that claim was one of many blaming foreign forces for the unrest.\n\nThe most prominent member of Russia's opposition, Navalny campaigned to challenge Putin in the 2018 presidential election, but was barred from running.\n\nHe set up campaign offices across Russia and has been promoting opposition candidates in regional elections, challenging members of Russia's ruling party, United Russia. One of his associates in Khabarovsk, a city in Russia's Far East that has been engulfed in mass protests against the arrest of the region's governor, was detained last week after calling for a strike at a rally.\n\nIn the interview with Echo Moskvy, Yarmysh said she believed the suspected poisoning was connected to this year's regional election campaign.\n\nCommentators say Navalny has become increasingly dangerous for the Kremlin as Putin's approval rating has plummeted to a record low of around 60% amid the coronavirus pandemic and growing public frustration with the declining economy.\n\nNavalny's ability to mobilize voters against pro-Kremlin candidates poses a particular challenge ahead of the 2021 parliamentary elections, said Abbas Gallyamov, a former Kremlin speechwriter-turned-political-analyst.\n\n\"The Duma elections are particularly important for the Kremlin,\" as the new Duma will be operating in 2024, when Putin's current presidential term expires and he may announce running for re-election, Gallyamov told the AP.\n\n\"That's why controlling the next State Duma is crucially important for the Kremlin. Navalny really makes it harder for the Kremlin to establish that control,\" Gallyamov added.\n\nAt the same time Navalny, who rose to prominence by exposing corruption all over Russia, could have other enemies, Gallyamov said, and may have been targeted by people featured in one of his investigations, if he was indeed deliberately poisoned.\n\nNavalny is not the first opposition figure to come down with a mysterious poisoning.\n\nVerzilov, who spent a month in a hospital recovering from his suspected 2018 poisoning, told the AP that Navalny's initial symptoms -- loss of coordination, pain, fainting -- were very similar to his.\n\nOpposition activist Vladimir Kara-Murza was hospitalized with poisoning symptoms twice -- in 2015 and 2017. Prominent journalist Anna Politkovskaya was also reportedly poisoned in 2004 -- two years before being murdered.\n\nOn Thursday evening, activists in several Russian cities held protests in support of Navalny. In St. Petersburg, a crowd of about 100 people gathered in the city center, and several supporters were detained.\n\n\"It was actually in the interests of the authorities to safeguard him,\" Yegor Batozhok, 34, a municipal deputy in St. Petersburg, told the AP. \"But for some reason a number of those who criticize the authorities get poisoned.\"\n\nAssociated Press writers Irina Titova in St. Petersburg, Angela Charlton in Paris, Pan Pylas in London, Alexander Roslyakov and Jim Heintz in Moscow and Kirsten Grieshaber in Berlin contributed.",

    "Scientists say Hong Kong man got coronavirus a second time": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "University of Hong Kong scientists claim to have the first evidence of someone being reinfected with the virus that causes COVID-19.\n\nGenetic tests revealed that a 33-year-old man returning to Hong Kong from a trip to Spain in mid-August had a different strain of the coronavirus than the one he'd previously been infected with in March, said Dr. Kelvin Kai-Wang To, the microbiologist who led the work.\n\nThe man had mild symptoms the first time and none the second time; his more recent infection was detected through screening and testing at the Hong Kong airport.\n\n\"It shows that some people do not have lifelong immunity\" to the virus if they've already had it, To said. \"We don't know how many people can get reinfected. There are probably more out there.\"\n\nThe paper has been accepted by the journal Clinical Infectious Diseases but not yet published, and some independent experts urged caution until full results are available.\n\nWhether people who have had COVID-19 are immune to new infections and for how long are key questions that have implications for vaccine development and decisions about returning to work, school and social activities.\n\nEven if someone can be infected a second time, it's not known if they have some protection against serious illness, because the immune system generally remembers how to make antibodies against a virus it's seen before.\n\nIt's not clear how different a virus needs to be to trigger illness, but the new work suggests that \"COVID patients should not be complacent about prevention measures\" and should continue social distancing, wearing masks and other ways to reduce infection, To said.\n\nTwo experts with with no role in the work agreed.\n\n\"We've always known reinfection was a possibility and I think this is highly suggestive\" that it occurred in this case, said Dr. Jesse Goodman, a former U.S. Food and Drug Administration chief scientist now at Georgetown University. \"If there is a reinfection, it suggests the possibility there was residual immunity ... that helped protect the patient\" from getting sick again, Goodman said.\n\nHowever, \"if immunity wanes from natural infection, it could be a challenge for vaccines\" and may mean booster shots are needed, he added.\n\nJulie Fischer, a microbiologist at CRDF Global, a nonprofit health group in Arlington, Virginia, said the study gives convincing evidence that reinfection can happen.\n\n\"The real question is what this means for severity of disease\" if that occurs, and whether such people can infect others, she said.\n\nOne expert saw the report as good news. Dr. Paul Offit, a vaccine expert at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, said it's encouraging the reported reinfection was without symptoms.\n\n\"That's a win as far as I'm concerned\" because it suggests a first infection may protect a person from moderate to severe disease the second time around, he said in an interview streamed by the Journal of the American Medical Association.\n\nA mid-May survey by the doctors' information-sharing site Sermo found that 13% of the 4,173 doctors responding believed that they had treated one or more patients who were reinfected. Among the respondents, 7% of those in the U.S. and 16% in other countries thought they'd seen such a case.\n\nHowever, health officials have also wondered whether people who tested positive long after their initial illness were simply showing signs of not completely clearing the virus rather than being infected anew.\n\nAP medical writers Linda A. Johnson and Carla K. Johnson contributed to this report.\n\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute's Department of Science Education.

    "Skepticism, fear helps fuel virus on Mexico City's outskirts": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "MEXICO CITY -- Only after a neighbor died of the coronavirus did Juan Jos\u00e9 and Esther Serralde begin to believe that the threat was real -- but it was too late. Soon, the older couple, their son and daughter-in-law, and two of their grandchildren were infected.\n\nEven if they had acted earlier, the family members might have struggled to protect themselves. Three generations share a home in a southern borough of Mexico City. The modest house opens onto a street market -- and the family sells clothes right outside their door. Bedrooms double as storerooms. Every space was a potential play area for four kids.\n\nThe family's story helps explain why five months into Mexico's COVID-19 epidemic, poor neighborhoods like San Gregorio Atlapulco persist as hot spots while other parts of the capital see a modest improvement.\n\nIn San Gregorio and many places like it, fear of hospitals, deep-rooted distrust of authorities, difficulties accessing medical care, and the pressure to make a living amid economic uncertainty are fueling the spread of the virus.\n\n\"A lot of what is happening is because of how families are handling it,\" said the Serraldes' son, Jos\u00e9 Juan, 47, who says his parents were skeptics and took few precautions, though he and his wife were more careful. Many people \"don't accept what is happening and don't want to accept that they are dying of COVID.\"\n\nIn the span of a month, Jos\u00e9 Juan Serralde buried his parents and an aunt, and fell ill himself and recovered, as did his wife and their daughters.\n\n\"The family crypt filled up in less than a month,\" he said.\n\nMexico has confirmed more than 443,000 infections and over 48,000 deaths -- putting it in third place for fatalities worldwide.\n\nDue to a lack of widespread testing, many deaths in Mexico remain uncounted. But a recently released report gives a sense of the scale of the outbreak: From April 19 to June 30, the capital city saw over 17,800 more deaths than usual.\n\nMexico recommended that people self-quarantine starting in mid-March. Serralde complied, and as a nonessential employee of the Xochimilco borough where he lives, stopped going to work. But his parents continued visiting markets to sell the plants they grew in a greenhouse, and they did not wear masks. The family continued to live in tight quarters.\n\nSuch living conditions are common in San Gregorio, an impoverished neighborhood of some 30,000 residents where it's common to see farmers in rubber boots pushing carts of produce from nearby fields. Large, multigenerational households and the fact that many people work in the informal economy mean it's hard for many residents to self-quarantine.\n\n\"You couldn't isolate at home, we all shared the place,\" said Serralde. \"It was a mistake on our part, but no one explained it to us until after what happened to my dad.\"\n\nMexican health officials have been holding daily televised news conferences about the pandemic for months. Still, they have given mixed messages on the necessity of wearing a mask, and President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador himself has worn one only occasionally.\n\nSerralde wasn't sure how to implement health officials' recommendations until a friend who is a doctor explained after his father died that the family should use disposable plates and plasticware, clean the bathroom with bleach after each person used it, and get everyone in the house, except his youngest daughter, tested.\n\nBy June, Mexico City Mayor Claudia Sheinbaum had paired a cautious reopening with expanding testing and contact tracing. In July, she added an information campaign that sent government workers door to door in the most affected areas. The city of about 10 million -- with another 10 million living in the surroundings -- is now testing about 4,000 people a day.\n\nBut these efforts came too late for the Serralde family. At the beginning of May, they learned their neighbor had died of the virus. Soon after, Serralde's 73-year-old father developed diarrhea and his 69-year-old mother complained of pain around her kidneys. Neither's symptoms made the family suspect COVID-19.\n\nBy the time they buried the older man, half the family had symptoms. Serralde's mother began to struggle to breathe.\n\nBut she was afraid to go to the hospital because of the common belief that those who go in never come out, her son explained.\n\nDr. Jorge Esteban Ballesteros, director of the San Gregorio Health Center, said such neighborhoods are often hotbeds of distrust and misinformation, creating the perfect conditions for the epidemic to grow.\n\n\"It's a difficult population of deeply rooted customs, resistant toward authority, who say the virus is something made up by the government,\" Ballesteros said. \"They've even said we're spreading the virus as we sanitize.\"\n\nSerralde still breaks down thinking about trying to navigate the health system while also suffering from the illness.\n\nWhen the family finally convinced the older woman to go to the hospital, they struggled to find one that would take her. A military hospital turned them away, and they ended up in a hard-hit neighboring borough.\n\nOnce she was hospitalized, the family had to secure an oxygen mask because the hospital did not have one -- and they even had to hunt down their own acetaminophen.\n\nBallesteros, the doctor, says authorities need to reinforce the measures they have taken, like providing more economic support to struggling families, expanding testing and continuing to knock on doors to give information in hard-hit neighborhoods.\n\nSerralde acknowledges that his family didn't take enough precautions and now tries to persuade everyone to take such measures -- his wife is even selling masks -- but he also believes authorities need to be more strict. For instance, he wishes they would enforce the virus-control measures that businesses are supposed to implement and make face masks mandatory.\n\n\"I feel like this is slipping out of the hands of the government, the mayor, the president, everyone,\" he said.",

    "Some have no COVID symptoms: Could the common cold be a reason?   ": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "Some infected with the novel coronavirus never develop symptoms. Others get very sick and die. Seven months into the pandemic, scientists are racing to find out why.\n\nThere are theories. One theory is that prior exposure to other viruses may help fight off the novel coronavirus. There are four other, far less deadly coronaviruses which cause the common cold.\n\nEarlier this summer, researchers from La Jolla Institute for Immunology published new findings in the journal Cell, offering insight into how human immune systems respond to COVID-19. When people who were previously infected with COVID-19 were exposed to the virus again, their immune system had a strong response because it already knew what the virus looked like.\n\nBut what researchers also found was that in around 40 to 60% of those who had never been exposed to COVID-19, their immune systems also had a strong reaction. The researchers said it's possible that human bodies may \"recognize\" the novel coronavirus because of prior exposure to its close cousins -- the coronavirus strains that cause the common cold.\n\n\"Immune reactivity may translate to different degrees of protection,\" said Dr. Alessandro Sette, professor at the La Jolla Institute for Immunology and a lead author on the study, in a press release.\n\nIt's possible, Sette said, that your prior infections with the common cold could give your immune system a boost, making it easier to fight off the coronavirus that causes COVID-19.\n\nMany viruses fall under the coronavirus category, including ones that cause the common cold, SARS and MERS.\n\nA study in Science published early August looked at blood samples obtained before the COVID-19 pandemic was discovered. Isolating immune system cells from those samples, scientists found that those cells reacted similarly to the COVID-19 virus as well as to four other coronaviruses known to cause the common cold.\n\n\"This could help explain why some people show milder symptoms of disease while others get severely sick,\" said Dr. Daniela Weiskopf, a research assistant professor at the La Jolla Institute for Immunology and one of the lead researchers, in a statement.\n\nAnd while almost everyone has had a cold at least once in their life, COVID-19 still affects some people more severely than others. That reason may have more to do with genetics, than previous exposure to the common cold, some experts say.\n\n\"People have this idea that we are all pretty much the same. But there is huge variation in our genes in the human population,\" said Dr. Vincent Racaniello, Higgins professor of Microbiology and Immunology at Columbia University. \"Everyone is genetically different. You can find kids who get respiratory infections 10 to 12 times a year, totally atypical. And when you look at their genome, you find that they have mutations that make them more susceptible.\"\n\nMeanwhile, some scientists say the differences in the way people fare once infected could be chalked up to ailing immune systems among the elderly.\n\n\"What we know is that as you age your immune system degrades. It's called 'immunosenescence.' You are not able to control infections like you were used to. So the infection goes a little bit crazy at the beginning. You overreact and you get very sick,\" said Racaniello.\n\nIn the meantime, researchers continue to look at the immune system for answers to fighting COVID-19.",

    "Spain's new wave of infections hits the young, middle-aged": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "SANT SADURN\u00cd D'ANOIA, Spain -- Like most Spaniards, Emma Gaya thought the worst of the pandemic was behind her.\n\nSpain's government had ended a three-month lockdown after an COVID-19 onslaught that claimed at least 28,400 lives in the European Union nation. To kickstart its stalled economy, Spaniards were encouraged to cautiously resume their lives under a \"new normality\" based on wearing face masks, washing hands and social distancing.\n\nThe respite didn't last long.\n\nOutbreaks among farm workers and young people desperate to resume socializing after being cooped up have spread across northern Spain, spawning what some health officials fear could be the start of a dreaded \"second wave\" of infections.\n\n\"It pains me to think that we could be right back where we were,\" Gaya said after getting tested for coronavirus at her local health clinic in Sant Sadurni D'Anoia, a village near Barcelona. She came in because she had a fever, one of the typical symptoms of COVID-19, along with a dry cough and the loss of a sense of smell.\n\n\"I think we had done things well. Now I don't know if we are doing it well at all. I'm not sure at what point we are safe,\" Gaya said.\n\nOn June 22, the day after Spain ended a national state of emergency and restored free movement around the country, the health ministry registered 125 new cases in 24 hours. Six weeks later, the daily count has jumped, hitting 1,525 on Friday.\n\nSpain is leading Western Europe's major countries with an average of 60 coronavirus cases per 100,000 inhabitants. While the country's south and the Canary and Balearic Islands remain in good shape, the regions of Navarra, Arag\u00f3n, and Catalonia have registered more than 120 cases per 100,000 inhabitants over a 14-day period, making Spain's northeast the biggest European hot spot along with parts of Romania, according to the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control.\n\nIn contrast to the darkest weeks of March and April, when the virus ripped through Spain's elderly in nursing homes and pushed the country's hospitals to the breaking point, the pressure is now on Spain's neighborhood health clinics. They are trying to screen and isolate the new infections, which are taking place mostly among the young, who in Spain and countries across the world are ignoring social distancing, and the middle-aged.\n\nThe average age of a virus patient in Spain has fallen from 63 in the spring to 45 now and \"the pressure on the health system is low,\" said Spanish Health Minister Salvador Illa. Since the virus takes a heavier toll on the elderly, younger coronavirus patients means more who have milder symptoms.\n\nSpain's improved testing capacity makes a comparison to the start of the pandemic difficult. In February, March and April, a shortage of tests meant that only the very sick who were admitted to hospitals were tested and that a significant number of coronavirus cases went undetected.\n\nNow, local clinics are discovering many more infections among those who don't show symptoms.\n\n\"We are in a different situation (than the spring) because right now we have tests available,\" said Dr. Miriam Ce\u00f1a, director of the health clinics in Sant Sadurni D'Anoia, which is seeing a jump in cases like the area around Barcelona, Catalonia's largest city.\n\n\"We are in a situation of risk and alert. We don't want to alarm the population, but we want the population to be responsible,\" Ce\u00f1a said. \"In March, there was the lockdown so the situation was under more control. Right now, there is free movement and socializing and those are a risk of contagion.\"\n\nThe surge in new infections is sure to add to the drastic contraction of Spain's economy by slamming hopes of reactivating the country's critical tourism sector. The economy has already dropped 18% in the second quarter -- its biggest dip since Spain's 1936-39 Civil War.\n\nBritain has placed a 14-day quarantine on travelers returning from Spain, while France, Germany, and Belgium have all issued travel warnings or discouraged trips to northeast Spain.\n\nAuthorities have for several weeks warned about the danger of new outbreaks, but experts predicted they would likely occur in the colder months. Instead, the surge has come in mid-summer, when Spaniards are eager to reconnect with family and friends, and hotels, restaurants and shops are counting on both domestic and foreign tourists to cushion the pandemic's blow to their balance sheets.\n\nSpain must now pull off the delicate balancing act of managing the health crisis while reactivating its economy. Officials desperately hope they can avoid another full lockdown that would be catastrophic to businesses and jobs despite the expected injection of massive aid from the European Union.\n\nCatalonia and many other regions have reintroduced restrictions, making masks obligatory at all times outside the home and reclosing nightclubs due to their links to outbreaks.\n\n\"We must be obsessive about complying with the protection measures,\" said Catalonia's public health director, Josep Argimon.\n\nCatalonia, however, is only now deploying 600 workers to its clinics to help nurses and doctors handle the demands of contact tracing, which has been insufficient so far. That lack of urgency has drawn strong criticism from health workers and mayors.\n\nSpain's government is rolling out a phone app to help contract tracers find and stamp out new infections, while making a renewed appeal for individuals to act responsibly.\n\n\"There are many citizens who feel anguish upon seeing the outbreaks that are happening in different parts of our country,\" Spanish Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez said Friday. \"Because we have all had to make an enormous effort to be disciplined, show resistance and muster the will to defeat the virus.\"\n\nFollow AP coverage of the virus outbreak at https://apnews.com/VirusOutbreak and https://apnews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak",

    "State spent millions on arena hospital that saw 9 patients": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- Doctors arrived at an arena-turned-medical center in Sacramento in mid-April and were told to prepare for 30 to 60 coronavirus patients to arrive within days. They spent the weekend working feverishly to get ready.\n\nState officials envisioned the cavernous Sleep Train Arena and an adjoining facility as a place where hundreds of patients could be treated, but in the first week just one arrived. The pace never increased, and the 250 assembled medical workers -- physicians, nurses, pharmacists and administrative staff -- found themselves wondering what to do.\n\n\"People began to question within themselves whether they were really needed or not,\" said Dr. Charles Moore, a retired internal medicine physician who worked there for about six weeks. \"There were no plans for what would happen if you gave a party and no one came.\"\n\nUltimately, just nine patients arrived over 10 weeks. The cost to care for them was a staggering $12 million.\n\nThe Sacramento site was one of 15 temporary medical facilities set up around California in anticipation of a surge of cases that never materialized. It shut down on July 1, as did most others.\n\nBut as virus cases started rising again around California in June, the state decided to keep some open and take lessons from Sleep Train to run them more efficiently.\n\nKim Brown Sims, the arena's chief nursing office, wrote a training manual the state could use across its facilities. She also recommended the state either create its own electronic record system to use at every site or partner with local hospitals to use their systems, rather than requiring facilities to create their own paper systems, something the doctors had been asked to do that first weekend at Sleep Train.\n\nDr. Amesh Adalja, a senior scholar at Johns Hopkins University Center for Health Security focused on pandemic preparedness, said California wasn't alone in preparing for a New York City-like flood of cases that would overwhelm hospitals.\n\n\"Many places just went very fast because they were scared and they had the ability to do it so they did it, not really thinking about how they were going to make all the pieces fit together and integrate with the existing health care system and deliver efficient care,\" he said.\n\nMoving forward, he said when deciding whether to open alternate care sites California officials should use regional infection rates and hospitalizations to set staffing so the sites don't have too many doctors and not enough patients.\n\nBrian Ferguson, a spokesman for the state Office of Emergency Services, acknowledged the state didn't use local data when fist setting up field sites.\n\n\"I think in hindsight we would certainly make sure that we would do some things similar again, but perhaps be more thoughtful about how fast we ramp up or have more off ramps,\" he said.\n\nHowever, Ferguson said the state benefits from having staff who have been trained to work at such facilities and established procedures for running the sites.\n\n\"Having those folks trained, having these sites available will continue to be a value,\" he said.\n\nSleep Train Arena was the site of an April 6 news conference by Gov. Gavin Newsom, who hailed the facility as a prime example of California's rapid preparedness. It and a nearby building, both owned by the NBA's Sacramento Kings, would house 400 beds and take people discharged from hospitals or be the first stop for people with mild to moderate virus symptoms, he said.\n\nNewsom didn't mention the state was paying the Kings to rent and provide services, a cost of $1 million over two months. The state spent another $7 million on mechanical, electrical, plumbing and other improvements, according to the Department of General Services.\n\nThe state also spent at least $2.8 million on staff, nearly $500,000 on personal protective equipment and about $1 million on other expenses.\n\nThe California Health Corps, a volunteer initiative started by Newsom, provided 199 workers at a cost of about $563,000. The state spent another $428,000 on just five pharmacists and five pharmacy technicians under a contract with Aya Healthcare, a San Diego-based travel nursing company.\n\nTheir payment included housing, benefits and per diem allowances, said Rodger Butler, a spokesman for the California Health and Human Services Agency.\n\nChief executive, nursing and medical officers were hired alongside dozens of other workers through a $1 million contract with Medefis, a vendor management company. A contract with Cardinal Health Pharmacy Solutions provided two more workers.\n\nAfter an opening week that saw one patient, five came from a nursing home that didn't want COVID-positive patients. While all of the patients were older, none was extremely sick or in need of round-the-clock care, said Moore, a Health Corps member.\n\nStill, that's what they got, with one doctor visiting each patient every shift, Moore said.\n\nAt one point, doctors brainstormed on whether they could be doing some type of public outreach to let people know the facility existed.\n\n\"It still wasn't clear what our service area was or what we were really doing. Were we decompressing hospitals? Were we decompressing nursing homes? Were we decompressing homeless shelters? There was never any formal mission statement at our level,\" he said.\n\nRandal Christensen, a doctor from Nevada who set up mobile health clinics during Hurricane Katrina, served as chief medical officer. He said he expected the mission of the facility would be fluid, given the circumstances.\n\n\"I believe that what we did, while not a huge number, was very much needed at that time and place,\" he said.\n\nSims, the chief nursing officer, took a similar view. She was charged with training workers, including nurses fresh out of school and EMTs who didn't work in hospital settings. Some of the EMTs she trained are now caring for patients at San Quentin State Prison, the site of a major outbreak, she said.\n\n\"In health care you plan for the worst-case scenario, and anything that happens better than that you say, 'Hallelujah,' \" Sims said.",

    "Teachers could stay in classroom if exposed to COVID-19": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "ATLANTA -- New guidance from President Donald Trump's administration that declares teachers to be \"critical infrastructure workers\" could give the green light to exempting teachers from quarantine requirements after being exposed to COVID-19 and instead send them back into the classroom.\n\nKeeping teachers without symptoms in the classroom, as a handful of school districts in Tennessee and Georgia have already said they may do, raises the risk that they will spread the respiratory illness to students and fellow employees. Multiple teachers can be required by public health agencies to quarantine for 14 days during an outbreak, which can stretch a district's ability to keep providing in-person instruction.\n\nSouth Carolina health officials also describe teachers as critical infrastructure workers, although it's unclear if any district there is asking teachers to return before 14 days.\n\nAmong the first districts to name teachers as critical infrastructure workers was eastern Tennessee's Greene County, where the school board gave the designation to teachers July 13.\n\n\"It essentially means if we are exposed and we know we might potentially be positive, we still have to come to school and we might at that point be carriers and spreaders,\" said Hillary Buckner, who teaches Spanish at Chuckey-Doak High School in Afton.\n\nBuckner, secretary of the county-level affiliate of the National Education Association, said it's unethical for teachers to risk infecting students. Only prekindergarten and kindergarten students are currently attending class face-to-face in 7,500-student Greene County, going two days a week for two-and-a-half hours a day. Teachers are instructing others online from their classrooms, Buckner said, but she said the local school board could soon mandate a broader in-person return.\n\nData kept by The Associated Press shows the coronavirus is spreading faster per-capita in Georgia than any other state, while Tennessee has the seventh-fastest spread. A few schools that reopened for in-person instruction in both states have already closed after cases were reported. Gordon Central High School in the northwest Georgia town of Calhoun switched to online instruction Wednesday citing a high number of teachers in quarantine.\n\nAt least five other school districts in Tennessee have given the designation to their teachers, seeking to exempt them from quarantine orders. Gov. Bill Lee on Tuesday blessed the move, with his administration saying it would accept the designation, citing the Department of Homeland Security's Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency.\n\nThat agency on Tuesday issued its fourth version of who counts as a critical infrastructure worker, for the first time saying teachers should be on the list alongside nurses, police officers and meat packers. Such workers can be permitted to keep working following COVID-19 exposure \"provided they remain asymptomatic and additional precautions are implemented to protect them and the community,\" the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention states.\n\n\"The decision is the district's,\" the Republican Lee said in a Tuesday news conference. \"If they make that decision, we have given them guidance that they must follow if they choose that critical infrastructure designation.\"\n\nIn Georgia, suburban Atlanta 's Forsyth County has also designated teachers as critical infrastructure workers. Spokesperson Jennifer Caracciolo said that means they could be told to return to classrooms, but said the 50,000-student district will decide on a case-by-case basis.\n\nA spokesperson for Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp said his administration is evaluating whether it wants to incorporate the federal guidance into Georgia's legal framework, which could spur more districts to act.\n\n\"We have had some superintendents reach out to ask where the administration is on this topic,\" said Candice Broce, a spokesperson for the Republican Kemp. \"We're in the soliciting-input mode.\"\n\nA lawyer for Kemp wrote an email Wednesday telling Georgia's Floyd County district that teachers remain subject to quarantine orders until Kemp or health officials decide whether to incorporate the federal guidance. Floyd County said Thursday it would reverse its designation of teachers as critical infrastructure workers.\n\nCritics in Georgia say the designation would ignore new health guidance issued to schools that says exposed teachers must quarantine for 14 days, even if they get a negative test.\n\nCraig Harper, director of the Professional Association of Georgia Educators, a non-union association, said it would be \"reckless and starkly contradicts the newest Georgia Department of Public Health guidance intended to protect student and educator health and curb spread of the virus.\"\n\nTeacher unions and national school administrator groups couldn't cite examples in other states Wednesday.\n\nNEA President Lily Eskelsen Garcia said in a statement that the designation \"has no legal merit and is more of a rhetorical gambit to give President Trump and those governors who are disregarding the advice and guidance from public health experts an excuse to force educators into unsafe schools.\"\n\nAmerican Federation of Teachers President Randi Weingarten expressed similar sentiments, saying \"the Trump administration will always try to change the rules to threaten, bully and coerce.\"\n\n\"If the president really saw us as essential, he'd act like it,\" Weingarten said in a statement. \"Teachers are and always have been essential workers -- but not essential enough, it seems, for the Trump administration to commit the resources necessary to keep them safe in the classroom.\"\n\nAssociated Press writer Kimberlee Kruesi in Nashville, Tennessee, contributed to this report.\n\nFollow AP coverage of the pandemic at https://apnews.com/VirusOutbreak and https://apnews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak.",

    "Tests: 2.5% of Italians had COVID-19, far more in the north": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "ROME -- Antibody testing in Italy indicates that nearly 1.5 million people, or about 2.5% of the population, have had the coronavirus. But officials said Monday that huge geographic variations in the results confirmed a nationwide lockdown was \"absolutely crucial\" to preventing the country's south from getting slammed as badly as its north.\n\nThe Health Ministry and the national statistics agency based their assessment on tests performed May 25-July 15 on a sample of nearly 65,000 Italians selected for their location, age and type of work. The government carried out the testing to understand how widely the virus circulated in the first country in the West to be overwhelmed by COVID-19, given that the bulk of confirmed cases and deaths occurred in northern Italy.\n\nThe sampling indicated that 1.482 million Italians nationwide had come into contact with the virus and developed an immunological response to it, six times more than Italy's reported number of confirmed cases, said Linda Laura Sabbadini, a director at the Italian National Institute of Statistics, or ISTAT.\n\nBut there were significant geographic disparities: An estimated 7.5% of the Lombardy region's residents had virus antibodies versus 1.9% in neighboring Veneto. Within Lombardy, sharp differences also emerged from province to province: Some 24% of Bergamo residents developed virus antibodies, but only 5.1% of residents did a few provinces over in Pavia.\n\nThe variations were even more stark when compared to southern Italy: Only 0.3% of residents in Sicily came into contact with the virus, and less than 1% of residents had virus antibodies in a half-dozen other southern regions.\n\nDr. Franco Locatelli, a key government adviser on the pandemic, said the geographic variability in the results showed that Italy's three-month nationwide lockdown was \"absolutely crucial to sparing central and southern Italy from the same epidemiological wave that hit the north.\"\n\nItaly's lockdown was among the strictest in Europe, with residents ordered to venture out only for unavoidable work, medical appointments or other necessities such as grocery shopping. The aim was to prevent the health care system in the less-developed south from being overwhelmed, as occurred in prosperous Lombardy. Police checkpoints, fines and cellphone data tracking were used to impress upon Italians the need to stay home.\n\nLocatelli said the results also indicated that 27.3% of the people with the virus experienced no symptoms, demonstrating the need for continued social distancing and mask requirements. He stressed that the tests were not looking at whether the antibodies provided protection against the virus going forward, just the tested individuals had come into contact with the virus.\n\nNumerous countries have also conducted tests to try to determine how many people may have been infected with the virus, including Austria, Germany, Spain, France, and the U.K. Most countries have found prevalence levels of about 5% to 15%.\n\nAfter starting out as the epicenter of the pandemic in Europe, Italy has largely contained the spread of the virus. For the past few weeks, it has registered some 200-300 new confirmed cases each day, many of them imported by returning workers or migrants. On Monday, it added 159 confirmed cases and another 12 deaths.\n\nThe antibody test results also suggest that Italy's COVID-19 death toll, which stood at 35,166 as of Monday, is in line with an estimated 2.3% mortality rate for the virus globally, Locatelli said.\n\nThe tests were originally supposed to be conducted on some 150,000 Italians in 2,000 cities and towns nationwide. However, the Red Cross ran into resistance from some Italians who declined to participate since a positive test for antibodies required an automatic quarantine and test to see if they still had the virus.",

        "body": "HOUSTON -- The Texas board that licenses doctors has warned physicians that it could take action against anyone who falsely advertises a cure for COVID-19.\n\nThe Texas Medical Board issued its warning after a Houston-area pastor and doctor, Dr. Stella Immanuel, very publicly touted hydroxychloroquine as a cure for the disease caused by the coronavirus, the Houston Chronicle reported. Multiple studies have found that hydroxychloroquine doesn't help against the virus and the Food and Drug Administration has cautioned against using it to treat patients with the disease because of reports linking it with heart problems and other injuries and disorders.\n\nIn a video that went viral last week and caught the attention of President Donald Trump, Immanuel said that if everyone took hydroxychloroquine, it would stop the virus in its tracks within 30 days. She said it was \"fake science\" to say that the drug doesn't work as a cure.\n\nTrump has has repeatedly asserted that hydroxychloroquine is a safe and effective treatment for COVID-19, only to be rebuffed by medical experts.\n\nThe video was later removed by Twitter for sharing false information. It was also removed from Facebook and YouTube.\n\nImmanuel said she has used the drug on more than 400 patients, including elderly, asthmatics and diabetics.\n\n\"Big Tech is censoring Experts and suppressing the CURE. I will not be silenced,\" she wrote on her Twitter page.\n\nDr. Robin Armstrong, a medical director of a Texas City nursing home and a state Republican Party officer, has said he has also provided hydroxychloroquine to 35 residents who tested positive for COVID-19 but had not shown any symptoms. And Dr. Joseph Varon, chief of staff at United Memorial Medical Center, has said the drug was part of a \"cocktail\" that the medical center is treating patients with and that it has been working \"like a charm.\"\n\nThe Chronicle said it was unclear if Armstrong and Varon were still treating COVID-19 patients with the drug.\n\nIn its statement, the Texas Medical Board said that although there are drugs and therapies to treat COVID-19, there is no definitive cure and the medical community is \"still learning, researching and gaining understanding of the virus.\"",

        "authors": [],
        "body": "BANGKOK -- A prison inmate in Thailand has tested positive for the coronavirus in the country's first confirmed locally transmitted case in 100 days, health officials said Thursday.\n\nThey identified the inmate as a 37-year-old man arrested for drug abuse who was brought to prison in Bangkok on Aug. 26 and tested positive Wednesday at the prison's health center.\n\nThai Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha on Wednesday had congratulated the nation for having achieved 100 days without any confirmed local cases of the coronavirus. The last person to test positive was on May 24.\n\nThailand has sustained relatively light health damage from the pandemic, even though in January it was the first country outside China to confirm a case. But its economy has been devastated by the absence of foreign tourists, who are banned from entry, and by a drop in exports.\n\nDr. Suwannachai Wattanayingcharoenchai, director-general of the Health Ministry's Disease Control Department, stressed that the infected man had been kept in a small group of quarantined inmates in a standard procedure to limit the possible spread of the virus. In another routine procedure, he was tested as part of a group of 34 new inmates. He had only a mild possible symptom, excessive mucous.\n\n\"This case confirms what we try to say all along. We can't keep the number of cases to zero but what we can do is to detect the cases quickly and limit transmission,\" Suwannachai said at a news conference. \"At this time, we are ready in terms of medical supplies, medical staff and hospital beds. We must be aware of the existing cases but we must not be scared.\"\n\nThe infected man lived in Bangkok and worked as a DJ in several bars. The authorities will test five close contacts in his family and 20 people including lawyers who were in court with him, and will retest the inmates who were quarantined with him.",

The Health Ministry also said there have been been a total of 3,012,412 confirmed infections.\n\nThe totals are second only to the United States.

But in 23 communities that the health ministry classified as outbreak epicenters, the reopening will be delayed.\n\nStudents from third grade and up are required to wear face masks in the classroom. Class sizes for most grades will be limited to 18 students. Middle and high school students will study in the classroom only twice per week, with the remainder of lessons being held online.\n\nIsrael has recorded over 116,000 cases of the virus since the start of the pandemic, including 939 deaths.

It said the distribution and sharing of pamphlets among demonstrators is prohibited, and food and other vendors aren't permitted at the protest site.\n\nOrganizers must appoint a liaison who will be charged with communicating with police and ensuring that demonstrators stick to the guidelines. Cypriot Justice Minister Emily Yiolitis said the point of the guidelines isn't to limit citizens' democratic rights, but to ensure that people are protected from the virus' spread.\n\nCHICAGO -- Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot has predicted a roughly $1.2 billion hole for the 2021 budget, blaming the coronavirus pandemic as the \"single largest driver\" of economic challenges.\n\nShe says tourism, transportation and the hospitality industry have been hit hardest. Lightfoot presented the city's budget forecast Monday, saying the current budget will have a roughly $800 million shortfall. She says federal help will be needed as cities nationwide struggle.\n\nUNITED NATIONS -- The United Nations chief says the COVID-19 pandemic has deepened the inequality between men and women and reversed \"decades of limited and fragile progress on gender equality and women's rights.\"\n\nSecretary-General Antonio Guterres warned young women from civil society organizations at a virtual town hall meeting on Monday that \"without a concerned response, we risk losing a generation or more of gains.\"\n\nDuring the pandemic, he said \"women have been on the front lines of the response, as health care workers, teachers, essential staff and as carers in their families and communities.\" A majority of health care workers are women, but less than a third are in decision-making roles, he said.\n\nGuterres said the pandemic has impacted physical and mental health, education, and labor force participation. He also noted reports in some places of increases in teenage pregnancies and gender-based violence.",

        "authors": [],
        "body": "PROVIDENCE, R.I. -- The confirmed number of coronavirus cases in the world has reached 20 million. That's according to the tally kept by Johns Hopkins University.\n\nHealth officials believe the actual number is much higher, given testing limitations and the fact that as many as 40% of all those who are infected have no symptoms.\n\nThe U.S., India and Brazil have together accounted for nearly two-thirds of all cases since the world hit 15 million on July 22.\n\nHERE'S WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT THE VIRUS OUTBREAK:\n\nFollow AP's pandemic coverage at http://apnews.com/VirusOutbreak and https://apnews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak\n\nBEIJING -- The number of new community infections reported in China fell to just 13 on Tuesday, while the semi-autonomous city of Hong Kong saw a further decline to 69 new cases.\n\nThe mainland also saw 31 new cases brought by Chinese travelers from abroad arriving at eight different provinces and cities. China requires testing and a two-week quarantine of all new arrivals and has barred most foreigners from entering the country.\n\nAll new locally transmitted cases were in the northwestern region of Xinjiang, whose main city, Urumqi, has been at the center of the country's latest major outbreak.\n\nChina has reported a total of 4,634 deaths from COVID-19 among 84,712 cases. Hong Kong has been bringing numbers of new cases down since its latest outbreak last month, partly by mandating mask wearing in public settings and stepping-up social distancing restrictions. The territory has reported 4,148 cases and 55 deaths.\n\nLONDON -- P&O Cruises, the U.K.'s largest cruise line, has pushed back the restart of its operations by a month until November.\n\nIt said this was due to the British government's decision to advise people to avoid cruises as a result of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nSailings, which had been due to resume on Oct. 15, have been canceled until Nov. 12.\n\nTwo trips with longer itineraries due to begin in January -- Aurora's Caribbean and South America Adventure and Arcadia's World Cruise -- have also been suspended.\n\nThe industry faces a particularly uncertain future after many passengers tested positive for the virus in the early days of the pandemic in February and March.\n\nCOPENHAGEN, Denmark -- Travelers from so-called risk countries will be tested upon arrival in Finland after a large group of people arriving on a plane from North Macedonia over the weekend tested positive for the coronavirus.\n\nKrista Kiuru, Finland's minister for Family Affairs and Social Services, said late Monday the Nordic country will introduce the mandatory testing as soon as possible.\n\nWhether they will carry out random sampling \"or test everyone who comes across borders, is still unclear\" she said.\n\nMika Salminen of Finland's National Institute for Health and Welfare said a large part of the world's countries are considered risk countries.\n\nTests will be made on anyone arriving from a country with more than 8 to 10 new COVID-19 cases per 100,000 inhabitants in the past 14 days.\n\nOn Saturday, a plane from Skopje, North Macedonia, with 157 passengers landed in Turku, western Finland, and 24 turned out positive during voluntary tests, authorities said.\n\nSalminen said that \"on the whole the situation is relatively calm in Finland.\" The Nordic country has seen a total of 7,601 cases and 333 deaths.\n\nISLAMABAD -- Pakistan's planning minister is warning his countrymen that their \"victory\" against the coronavirus could be reversed if they stop adhering to social distancing rules.\n\nAsad Umar praised people on Tuesday for cooperating with the government since March, when a nationwide lockdown was enforced amid increasing COVID-19 deaths and infections.\n\nHis warning comes a day after Pakistan eased almost all restrictions on businesses. Schools have still not been reopened.\n\nIt also comes a day after the incoming president of the United Nations General Assembly, Volkan Bozkir, during a visit to Islamabad praised Pakistan for quickly containing the coronavirus, saying the South Asian nation's handling of the pandemic is an example for others.\n\nPakistan reported its first confirmed case in February and witnessed a peak in deaths and infections in June. Since then, it has experienced a steady decline in fatalities.\n\nOn Tuesday it reported 15 fatalities from the coronavirus in the past 24 hours, raising its total COVID-19-related fatalities to 6,112.\n\nJAKARTA, Indonesia -- Indonesia has started the third phase of clinical trials for a COVID-19 vaccine in Bandung, West Java. State-owned company Bio Farma is running the trial in partnership with Chinese coronavirus vaccine developer Sinovac Biotech.\n\nTwenty volunteers were injected Tuesday at Padjadjaran University's Medical Faculty, with President Joko Widodo attending. The first and second clinical phases were conducted earlier in China.\n\n\"We hope that this third clinical trial will be completed in six months. Hopefully we can produce in January, and if production is ready, vaccinate all people in the country,\" Widodo said.\n\nA total of 120 volunteers will participate in the initial trial group. The next will be held in the third week and fourth week of this month and involve 144 volunteers. In early September, 408 more volunteers will receive vaccine tests. The injection and monitoring of the trial participants will be conducted until the third week of December.\n\nOn Tuesday, Indonesia announced 1,693 new COVID-19 cases, bringing its confirmed total to 128,776. The National Task Force for COVID-19 Mitigation reported that 59 people died in the last 24 hours, taking the death toll to 5,824.\n\nNEW DELHI, India -- India reported 53,601 new coronavirus cases on Tuesday as its total confirmed infections near 2.3 million.\n\nThe Health Ministry said fatalities reached 45,257 on Tuesday after 871 new deaths were recorded.\n\nIndia has been posting an average of around 50,000 new cases a day since mid-June.\n\nThe Indian Council of Medical Research, India's top medical research body, said about 25 million tests for the virus have been conducted in the country.\n\nHealth experts say the country needs to test more people given its high population. A country of 1.4 billion people, India has been conducting a little less than 18,000 tests per million population.\n\nIndia has the third-highest caseload in the world after the United States and Brazil. It has the fifth-most deaths but its fatality rate of about 2% is far lower than the top two hardest-hit countries.\n\nFRANKFORT, Ky. -- Saying \"we shouldn't want our kids to be the canaries in the coal mine,\" Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear urged schools in the state to delay reopening in-person classes until late September to provide more time to curb the spread of the coronavirus.\n\nThe Democratic governor said Monday that he wants to get children back in school safely during the pandemic, but acknowledged that the state doesn't have the virus under control.\n\n\"Getting them back (in school) at the height of the pandemic, I think, would be irresponsible,\" Beshear told reporters. \"So our goal is to ensure that we have our timing right. That we don't act like some of the states that reopened the fastest and reaped repercussions. And then we shouldn't want our kids to be the canaries in the coal mine.\"\n\nThe governor recommended that school districts wait until Sept. 28 to resume in-person classes. Beshear, the father of two children, called it a tough but necessary step as the state comes off an escalation of virus cases in July.\n\nBeshear has aggressively combated the virus with a series of executive actions, including a requirement that most Kentuckians wear masks in public.\n\n\"Masks are working but we do not have control over this virus,\" he said. \"And to send tens of thousands of our kids back into in-person classes when we don't have control on this virus isn't the right thing to do for our kids. It's not the right thing to do for their faculty.\"\n\nSchools across Kentucky shut down in-person learning in March as the coronavirus spread.\n\nHeading into the new academic year, at least 30 Kentucky districts had already announced they would start with virtual instruction only, the Lexington Herald-Leader reported. Other districts were planning to return later in August or early September.\n\n-- -- -- ALABAMA -- Gov. Kay Ivey is evaluating President Donald Trump's proposal to offer an additional $400 a week in unemployment payments and has not decided if the state will sign on to the plan, which requires states to pick up a fourth of the cost, a spokeswoman said Monday.\n\nThere are many unknowns about Trump's plan announced over the weekend, including if he has the power to extend benefits by executive order, leaving state officials seeking additional information about how it would work and the affordability of the proposal.\n\n\"As we continue working to get Alabamians safely back to work, we are exploring the options we have available to provide the necessary assistance. The governor along with the Department of Labor are closely evaluating the most recent directions now,\" Ivey spokeswoman Gina Maiola said in a statement.\n\nTara Hutchison, a spokeswoman for the the Alabama Department of Labor, said the department is \"expecting to receive guidance this week from national authorities to properly interpret the implementation and funding options that are available for states.\"",

        "authors": [],
        "body": "MIAMI -- Dorm-room parties are being blamed for a coronavirus outbreak at the University of Miami, where some students who tested positive have been relocated into isolation rooms and two entire floors of a residential tower are under quarantine.\n\nOther students have been kicked out of residence halls and suspended for not following public health directives, said Dr. Julio Frenk, the university's president.\n\nA new online dashboard by the university says 156 people have tested positive in the university system. Most are students; 69 of them have been placed in isolation and another 94 under quarantine in the past seven days. The positivity rate is slightly above 5%.\n\n\"It would have been unrealistic to assume that there would be no cases of COVID-19 in our campus,\" Frenk said in a video message.\n\nFrenk said a pattern of infection emerged at one of the residence halls. In response, everyone who tested positive was moved into isolation, and those who were potentially exposed to the virus have been ordered to stay in their rooms.\n\nSimilar challenges are being addressed at other colleges in Florida, where the Department of Public Health reported 4,545 COVID-19 hospitalizations Tuesday, along with about 2,600 new virus cases.\n\nThe University of Tampa begins classes Wednesday, but it has already temporarily suspended some students who participated in a large gathering at a residence hall as they were moving in. Florida A&M University is imposing curfews for residential students.\n\nHERE'S WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT THE VIRUS OUTBREAK\n\n-- Brazil president's son tests positive for virus, fourth in family\n\n-- Virtual learning sites are sprouting up to help working parents.\n\n-- With many schools still closed by the coronavirus pandemic, public and private alternatives are sprouting up across the nation to watch over children as they study.\n\n-- A new poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research finds 45% of Americans say they are setting aside more money than usual during the coronavirus pandemic.\n\n-- The World Health Organization is cautioning that using blood plasma from COVID-19 survivors to treat other patients is still considered an experimental therapy.\n\n-- Follow AP's pandemic coverage at http://apnews.com/VirusOutbreak and https://apnews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak\n\nHERE'S WHAT ELSE IS HAPPENING: OKLAHOMA CITY -- Patients at the The Children's Hospital in Oklahoma City will each be allowed two visitors starting Wednesday, while some adults at University of Oklahoma hospitals in Oklahoma City and Edmond will be allowed one visitor each.\n\nThe hospitals have been limiting visitor numbers in recent months in an effort to slow the spread of the coronavirus. The Oklahoma State Health Department on Tuesday reported 54,172 confirmed COVID-19 cases.\n\nMeanwhile, the Oklahoma County Jail Trust has approved $3 million to be paid as bonuses to county jail employees who continue working during the pandemic. This will amount to $1,000 per worker. Also Tuesday, The University of Oklahoma announced that tailgating will be banned on campus for the 2020 football season.\n\n\"In past years, a typical game day in Norman draws over 100,000 people to campus,\" said OU Vice President for University Operations Eric Conrad. \"While we realize these decisions will be disappointing to many, it is imperative that the university does its part to slow the spread of the virus on campus and in our community so we can protect each other.\"\n\nThe university also requires everyone on campus to wear masks, including at all athletic events.\n\nDES MOINES, Iowa -- The Des Moines school district has sued the state of Iowa, challenging a policy that forces districts to hold at least half of their educational programs in-person in classrooms unless their areas meet a high threshold of positive coronavirus cases.\n\nThe lawsuit filed Tuesday by Iowa's largest school district asks the court to reverse the state's rejection of its plan to begin the school year with students at home and to prevent the state from forcing it to reopen schools \"when it is unsafe to do so.\"\n\nThe lawsuit also seeks a court judgment that invalidates Gov. Kim Reynolds' July 17 proclamation requiring district to return unless they are in counties with especially high levels of coronavirus cases and meet other department of education guidelines.\n\nThe lawsuit names the governor, other state officials and the Board of Education, Education Department and Public Health Department.\n\nThe court filing comes as the Ames school district announced Tuesday it would take similar legal action. Last week, the Iowa State Education Association and the Iowa City school district sued, saying Reynolds' requirements are dangerous for students and staff.\n\nIn the Des Moines district, which has over 5,000 employees and 32,500 students, the lawsuit states that more than 31% of the staff have underlying health conditions, 47% are over age 50 and 10% is over age 60. Those factors put them at higher risk of a severe, potentially fatal, cases of COVID-19.\n\nA spokesman for Reynolds did not immediately respond to a message seeking comment about the lawsuit.\n\nJACKSON, MISS. - State Health Officer Thomas Dobbs says a Mississippi high school that announced it would shut down for two weeks because of a coronavirus outbreak was forced to close because of a large \"unnecessary\" social gathering where social distancing guidelines weren't followed.\n\nDobbs said officials at Biloxi High School made the \"exactly right decision\" when they announced Monday that kids would learn virtually until at least Sept. 8. Extracurricular were also temporarily suspended, including some of the first football games of the season, causing some negative reactions from athletes and parents.\n\n\"If we want to have football, if we want to have school, we can't have social events that violate the executive orders that are on the books,\" Dobbs said during a press briefing.\n\nGov. Tate Reeves said the school made the decision to close after between a third and a fifth of all students were exposed, a situation he described as a \"learning experience\" for Biloxi and other districts in the state. The school announced publicly Monday that 15 people in the community tested positive COVID-19 and 324 students were sent to quarantine.\n\nWhile Biloxi High School is closed, other schools in the district for younger students will remain open.\n\nThat's what Kentucky Fried Chicken signaled to customers as the company suspended its \"It's Finger Lickin' Good\" tagline after 64 years, deeming it \"the most inappropriate slogan for 2020\" amid the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nThe suspension will affect the slogan's use in global advertising \"for a little while,\" the company said in a statement.\n\n\"We find ourselves in a unique situation -- having an iconic slogan that doesn't quite fit in the current environment,\" said Catherine Tan-Gillespie, the company's global chief marketing officer.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's coronavirus safety measures calls for people to avoid touching their eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands to reduce exposure to the virus.\n\nFor now, the company, which is a subsidiary of Louisville, Kentucky-based Yum! Brands, is telling fans not to worry.\n\n\"The slogan will be back,\" the statement said. \"Just when the time is right.\"\n\nCHICAGO -- Illinois is expanding its rules requiring masks while dining indoors, saying customers have to wear face coverings during every single interaction with servers or other restaurant workers. That includes while servers are taking orders or bringing a bill.\n\nThe requirements go into effect Wednesday, the same day indoor dining will be barred in two counties because of a high COVID-19 rate.\n\nThe Illinois Department of Public Health on Tuesday announced 1,680 new confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 29 additional deaths.\n\nIn Chicago, city officials looking ahead to winter launched a challenge to propose outdoor dining solutions for when temperatures drop.\n\nPHOENIX -- A fight over whether Phoenix-area gyms, bars, movie theaters and water parks can reopen could be a moot point by Thursday if Maricopa County's downward trend in coronavirus cases holds, the state's top health officer said.\n\nDr. Cara Christ, director of the Department of Health Services, said she expects the state's most populous county will hit levels for \"moderate\" spread of the virus on that day. That means gyms that have been seeking waivers from the department can reopen even without one at reduced capacity under state guidelines.\n\nArizona was a national virus hotspot in late June and July but new cases, hospitalizations and transmissions have fallen dramatically since their peak.\n\nHARRISBURG, Pa. -- Gov. Tom Wolf says he doesn't have the legal authority to extend Pennsylvania's moratorium on evictions and foreclosures beyond Aug. 31.\n\nThat means renters will no longer be shielded from losing their homes for failing to pay rent during the pandemic. In a letter to both legislative chambers, released Tuesday, Wolf says the state's Emergency Services Code prevents him from acting.\n\nThe Democrat called on state lawmakers in the Republican-controlled General Assembly to pass legislation to extend the statewide moratorium, which has been in place for more than five months.\n\nSALEM, Ore. -- Oregon is joining the list of states applying for the federal government's new assistance for unemployed workers.\n\nState officials say, if approved, people would receive $300 per week, for an estimated three to five weeks. Since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, more than 500,000 people in Oregon have filed for unemployment.\n\nLast week, Oregon launched a $35 million relief check program created to issue a one-time payment of $500 to 70,000 Oregonians still waiting for unemployment benefits. Just three days later, the program ended after all the checks had been distributed.\n\nDANBURY, Conn. -- State and local officials are urging residents of Danbury to get tested for coronavirus and answer calls by contact tracers because of an increase in cases.\n\nMayor Mark Boughton, a Republican, says state and local officials are relying on contract tracing and stepped-up testing at nursing homes and throughout the community to stop further spread.\n\nThe city has also taken other steps, such as asking churches to hold remote rather than in-person religious services and delaying plans for in-person learning at the public schools until at least Oct. 1.\n\nThe city, which borders New York, has been seeing a rolling average of 22 new daily cases per 100,000 people. That represents a roughly 6-7% infection rate, officials say. Statewide, the infection rate is about 1%.\n\nBoughton says there is less than two weeks to slow the spread, otherwise it's a \"runaway freight train.\"\n\nBRASILIA, Brazil -- The eldest son of Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro says he's tested positive for coronavirus and is in isolation with no symptoms.\n\nSen. Fl\u00e1vio Bolsonaro is the fourth member of President Jair Bolsonaro's direct family infected by the coronavirus. The president, first lady Michelle Bolsonaro and Jair Renan Bolsonaro, another son, have tested positive for the coronavirus.\n\nThe Brazilian president has downplayed the severity of the virus, arguing against restrictions on economic activity he claims will prove far more damaging than the disease. His approach to the pandemic runs counter to most recommendations by health experts.\n\nFl\u00e1vio Bolsonaro says he's being treated with azithromycin and chloroquine, an anti-malarial drug touted both by Brazil's president and by U.S. President Donald Trump, despite clinical trials that found it ineffective or even dangerous.\n\nSeveral members of Bolsonaro's staff have tested positive, among them eight Cabinet members.\n\nBrazil has 3.6 million confirmed cases and more than 115,000 deaths, second in the world only to the United States.\n\nMADISON, WIS. -- Wisconsin's statewide mask mandate should end because Gov. Tony Evers doesn't have the legal authority to order it, three western Wisconsin residents represented by a conservative law firm argue in a lawsuit filed Tuesday.\n\nIt's the first legal challenge to the mask order Evers issued to help slow the spread of the coronavirus after cases began to spike again in mid-June. Evers issued the order on July 30, it took effect Aug. 1, and is set to run until Sept. 28. The order requires everyone age 5 and older to wear a mask while indoors, except at home. Violators could be fined $200.\n\nEvers' spokeswoman Britt Cudaback accused Republicans and their allies of trying to prevent the governor from keeping people healthy and safe.\n\nThe state reported 168 new cases per 100,000 people during the past two weeks, ranking 26th in the country. Wisconsin has nearly 71,000 confirmed cases of coronavirus and 1,081 deaths.\n\nFAIRFIELD, Conn. -- Fairfield University is retesting students and staff for the coronavirus after school officials discovered some previous test results might have been erroneous or sent to the wrong patients.\n\nFairfield officials say they'll stop using that lab and are advising anyone who has already taken a saliva test for the school to disregard their results.\n\nThe school says its brought in 35 rapid testing machines from Abbot Laboratory and will be retesting school community members on site with swab tests results in 15 minutes. The school says the machines can process up to 800 tests a day.\n\nStudents and staff are given the option of getting their own tests from another provider.\n\nClasses are set to start on Sept. 1. The school says anyone who receives a positive test result will be asked to return home if possible. Anyone who lives further than 300 miles from the school or can't go home will be quarantined on campus.\n\nMILAN -- The number of confirmed positives for coronavirus remained below 1,000 for the second straight day, even as the number of swab tests increased significantly.\n\nItaly registered 878 new infections on Tuesday, according to health ministry data, down from 953 on Monday. The number of tests performed in the last 24 hours hit 72,341, up from around 46,000 a day earlier.\n\nOfficials recently closed down discos, which have been a large source of contagion, including 60 cases linked to a disco in Porto Cervo, Sardinia, owned by former Formula One manager Flavio Briatore. Britatore was hospitalized in Milan for the virus on Tuesday.\n\nThe death toll in Italy rose by four, bringing the confirmed toll to 35,445.\n\nTUSCALOOSA, Ala. -- Tuscaloosa is closing bars for the next two weeks after what University of Alabama officials call an unacceptable rise in coronavirus cases on campus.\n\nThe University of Alabama has recorded 531 cases of coronavirus on campus since the fall semester began last week, according to the school on Tuesday.\n\nTuscaloosa Mayor Walt Maddox announced Monday the closures along with the end of bar service at restaurants during a news conference with campus officials.\n\nSchool officials say there's been a rapid rise in cases, particularly among fraternities and sororities. The university on Friday announced a moratorium on student gatherings both on and off campus.\n\nMaddox says an unchecked spread of the virus threatens to overwhelm the health care system and sink the local economy if students are sent home for the semester for remote learning.\n\nUniversity of Alabama President Stuart Bell says the rise in cases is unacceptable. Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey praised the mayor and university officials for acting swiftly.\n\nNASHVILLE, Tenn, -- Tennessee is facing a lawsuit over Republican Gov. Bill Lee's decision to let counties issue certain orders to curb the COVID-19 pandemic, with a focus on their authority to require people to wear masks.\n\nThe group Citizens for Limited Government and Constitutional Integrity, also known as Tennessee Stands, and two individuals filed the lawsuit Monday in Davidson County Chancery Court. Lee is the defendant in his role as governor.\n\nThe lawsuit claims a state law dealing with the governor's powers during an emergency violates sections of the Tennessee Constitution, including provisions about the separation of powers.\n\nA recent opinion by the state attorney general cites the law in describing the governor's ability to delegate duties during an emergency.\n\nMeanwhile, four University of Tennessee at Knoxville students are facing disciplinary proceedings for not abiding by safety restrictions.",

        "body": "NEW DELHI -- India has registered a record 1,007 fatalities in the past 24 hours as fresh coronavirus infections surged by another 62,064 cases.\n\nThe Health Ministry says the total fatalities touched 44,386 on Monday.\n\nThe number of positive cases reported so far are 2,215,074. At least 634,935 patients were still undergoing treatment.\n\nIndia has recorded more than 60,000 cases of the virus daily in the last four days and more infections than any other country in the world for six consecutive days. It has averaged around 50,000 new cases a day since mid-June.\n\nInfections in India remain concentrated in 10 states that contribute nearly 80% of the new cases.\n\nIndia has the third-highest caseload in the world after the United States and Brazil. It has the fifth-most deaths but its fatality rate of about 2% is far lower than the top two hardest-hit countries.\n\nHERE'S WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT THE VIRUS OUTBREAK:\n\nFollow AP's pandemic coverage at http://apnews.com/VirusOutbreak and https://apnews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak\n\nCOLOMBO, Sri Lanka -- Sri Lanka reopened schools Monday, nearly five months after shutting them to contain the spread of COVID-19.\n\nThe government decision says state-run schools and government-approved private schools were to reopen in stages.\n\nStudents in grades 5, 10, 11, 12 and 13 should attend daily to prepare for government exams. Students in grades 1, 2, 3, 6, 7 and 8 must attend once a week while students in grades 4 and 9 must come two days per week.\n\nThe arrangement will continue until Oct. 9 when the school holiday is expected to start.\n\nSchools were shut in mid-March when Sri Lanka detected its first COVID-19 patient, but health authorities say the outbreak has been under control in the Indian Ocean island nation.\n\nSri Lanka health officials say they have prevented community spread of the virus and current patients are tied to two known clusters.\n\nBEIJING -- New locally transmitted cases of coronavirus in China fell to just 14 over the past 24 hours, the National Health Commission reported Monday. The low figure was offset, however, by 35 cases brought into the country by Chinese travelers from overseas.\n\nAll the cases of local transmission were in the northwestern region of Xinjiang, whose main city Urumqi is the center of China's latest outbreak. Tightened restrictions on travel, widespread testing and a lockdown on some residential communities appear to have been effective in bringing down numbers of new infections in Urumqi, while a separate outbreak in the northeastern city of Dalian seems to have run its course.\n\nChinese hospitals are currently treating 802 people for COVID-19, 41 of them in serious condition, while another 290 people are under observation while being isolated for showing signs of having the virus or for testing positive without displaying symptoms. China has reported a total of 4,634 fatalities from the disease among 84,668 cases.\n\nHong Kong reported another 72 cases and five deaths as it continues to battle a new wave of infections with tightened rules on indoor dining and obligatory mask wearing in public settings. The semi-autonomous southern Chinese city has reported 52 deaths among 4,079 total cases.\n\nSYDNEY -- Australia has reported fewer new daily cases from its virus hotspot in the city of Melbourne than on any single day since last month. But it has also reported the nation's highest daily death total since the virus outbreak began.\n\nThe state of Victoria reported 322 new infections and 19 new deaths on Monday, with 14 of the deaths connected to outbreaks at aged care facilities. Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said he was more hopeful now that cases are stabilizing in Victoria than he has been at any time over the past week.\n\nBut state premier Daniel Andrews cautioned that not too much could be read into a single day's worth of data, and that some of the state's most stringent lockdown measures had only come into effect at midnight Sunday.\n\nThe number of new cases was the lowest recorded in Victoria since July 29. The figures did not include new infections and deaths from other Australian states, although Victoria has been accounting for the vast majority of both in recent weeks. Since the outbreak began, Australia has reported more than 21,000 infections and more than 300 deaths.",

New reported infections dropped to around 61,000 on Monday and Tuesday, but picked up again in the past 24 hours.\n\nThe ministry said India's recovery rate was now around 76% with a fatality rate of 1.84%.\n\nEven though the country of nearly 1.4 billion people has been slowly opening up to heal the economy, areas identified as most affected by the virus continue to remain under lockdown.\n\nHERE'S WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT THE VIRUS OUTBREAK\n\n-- Follow AP's pandemic coverage at http://apnews.com/VirusOutbreak and https://apnews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak\n\nSEOUL, South Korea -- Health officials in South Korea called on thousands of striking doctors to return to work as the country counted its 13th straight day of triple-digit jumps in coronavirus cases.\n\nHealth Minister Park Neung-hoo cited the growing virus crisis while issuing back-to-work orders for doctors in Seoul area who had joined physicians in other parts of the country for a three-day strike starting Wednesday to protest government plans to boost the number of medical students. Doctors' groups say such measures would worsen what's already a cut-throat market.\n\nSouth Korea's Centers for Diseases Control and Prevention reported 320 newly confirmed cases of COVID-19, including 237 from the densely populated Seoul region, which has been the center of a viral resurgence in recent weeks. Health workers have struggled to stem transmissions linked to various places and groups, including churches, schools, restaurants and door-to-door salespeople.\n\nPark's ministry said more than 2,000 medical facilities nationwide had reported their intentions to close for Wednesday after doctors' groups, including the Korean Medical Association and the Korean Intern Resident Association, expressed dissatisfaction over their negotiations with government officials.\n\nPark said doctors who refuse to return to work could possibly have their licenses suspended or revoked, or even face a prison term of less than three years.\n\nMEXICO CITY -- Mexican officials are expressing concern that the country may have entered a plateau of coronavirus infections after about three weeks of slight declines.\n\nThe Health Department said Tuesday there were 4,916 newly confirmed cases, bringing Mexico's total to 568,621. There were 650 newly confirmed deaths, bring the country's total to 61,450, the third highest in the world.\n\nThe Health Department's epidemiology director, Jos\u00e9 Luis Alom\u00eda, said \"the trend is moving toward what could be a plateau.\"\n\nThe numbers are considered to be a vast undercount, given Mexico's extremely low rate of testing. But what has been consistent is the relatively high number of health workers infected, possibly because they are exposed more and are tested at a higher rate.\n\nSince the pandemic began, 97,632 nurses, doctors and other hospital employess have tested positive, equivalent to about 17% of all the country's cases. A total of 1,320 health workers have died of COVID-19 in Mexico.\n\nBEIJING -- China has suspended a flight from Abu Dhabi to Shanghai for a week after passengers on board tested positive for coronavirus.\n\nEtihad flight EY862 was put on hold from Tuesday after five passengers aboard the Aug. 15 flight turned in a positive result in a nucleic acid test, the Civil Aviation Administration of China said on its microblog.\n\nFor the 10th consecutive day, China has reported only imported cases of the virus, with another 15 added on Wednesday. China currently has 347 people in treatment for COVID-19, while another 365 people are being monitored in isolation for having tested positive for the virus without showing symptoms.\n\nThe country has reported 4,634 deaths among 84,996 cases of COVID-19 since the virus was first detected in the central Chinese city of Wuhan late last year before spreading worldwide.\n\nSACRAMENTO, Calif. -- More California children with special needs will be allowed back in classrooms in small groups under new state guidance released Tuesday.\n\nIt applies to K-12 students including those with disabilities, students who are homeless and English language learners, among others. Those students would be allowed back in schools, at day camps and in other settings in groups of no more than 14 youth and two supervising adults.\n\nThe rules apply to schools in counties that still aren't allowed to open for in-person learning because of the coronavirus.\n\nHONOLULU -- Hawaii's most populous island is returning to a stay-at-home order while officials strive to conduct 70,000 COVID-19 tests in two weeks.\n\nOahu has seen a surge in daily positive cases. The federal government will help officials test 5,000 people daily for two weeks.\n\nDuring that time, Oahu will be under a stay-at-home order where gyms and dine-in restaurants will be closed. Religious services may continue.\n\nThe spike also has included an outbreak at the state's largest jail. State Sen. Clarence Nishihara is criticizing Gov. David Ige's administration for failing to widely test inmates swiftly enough.\n\nMELBOURNE, Australia -- Australia's hard-hit Victoria state on Wednesday recorded one of its deadliest days of the pandemic despite new COVID-19 infections continuing to trend down.\n\nThe 24 fatalities in the latest 24-hour period is the largest death toll apart from the all-time daily record of 25 set on Aug. 17.\n\nVictoria's Health Department reported 149 news cases on Wednesday following 148 infections on Tuesday.\n\nWednesday's count brought the weekly average to 175 new cases a day, down from 279 in the previous week.",

Hospitals are treating 288 people for COVID-19 and another 361 are being monitored in isolation for showing signs of the illness or having tested positive for the virus without displaying symptoms.\n\nChina has reported 85,013 cases since the virus was first detected in the central Chinese city of Wuhan late last year, with 4,634 dying from COVID-19.\n\nThe roughly 25% of students still out of school are due to return to classes on Monday.\n\nClasses are being held on a staggered schedule and mask wearing and social distancing are required. College undergraduates are also due to return to campus next week, with Beijing ordering tests for all 600,000 taking up places at the city's institutions.\n\nSEOUL, South Korea -- South Korean officials are considering reducing the working hours of restaurants and cafes as the country counted its 15th straight day of triple-digit jumps in coronavirus infections.\n\nThe 371 new cases reported by the South Korea's Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Friday brought the national caseload to 19,077, including 316 deaths. The country has seen more than 4,300 new cases over the past 15 days, prompting concerns about the potential for overwhelmed hospital systems.\n\nWhile the government has recently banned large gatherings and shut down nightspots and churches nationwide, there are calls for elevating social distancing measures to the highest \"Level 3,\" which would prohibit gatherings of more than 10 and advise private companies to have employees work from home.\n\nPrime Minister Chung Sye-kyun said during a virus meeting Friday that the government wasn't ready to do that yet, citing concerns about hurting an economy that policymakers will likely shrink for the first time in 22 years. Chung said officials will instead explore other ways to improve distancing, such as limiting the hours of restaurants and cafes.\n\nMELBOURNE, Australia -- Australia's hard-hit Victoria state has reported 113 new coronavirus cases for a second consecutive day, with authorities warning that the infection rate will have to fall substantially if a six-week lockdown is to be relaxed on schedule on Sept. 13.\n\nThe latest daily tallies are the lowest in more than eight weeks, with a peak of 725 in early August.\n\nThe latest death toll dropped to 12 from 23 on Thursday. Thursday's was the third-highest toll of the pandemic.\n\nAuthorities want daily infections to fall at least to low double-digits before they would consider relaxing restrictions.\n\nElsewhere in Australia, the federal health department said there were 18 new cases.

        "body": "SYDNEY -- A man in his 20s has become the youngest person to die of the coronavirus in Australia.\n\nHe was among 14 new deaths and 372 new infections reported by Victoria state health officials Friday in an outbreak centered in Melbourne, the second-largest city.\n\nAnd Prime Minister Scott Morrison said 188 elderly people had died over the past week as the virus ripped through aged-care homes in Melbourne. Officials say about 70% of Australia's 375 virus deaths have been at aged-care facilities.\n\nMorrison said that Australians had high expectations of the services and standards at nursing homes and other facilities like hospitals and schools.\n\nHe says, \"On the days that the system falls short, on the days that expectations are not met, I'm deeply sorry about that, of course I am.\"\n\nHe said the country was moving heaven and earth to defeat the virus and it would eventually win.\n\nHERE'S WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT THE VIRUS OUTBREAK:\n\n-- Spain is facing another surge in coronavirus infections not even two months after beating back the first wave.\n\n-- False claims and conspiracy theories, ranging from bogus cures to the idea that the coronavirus is a hoax, have dogged efforts to control the pandemic from the beginning. While bad information is a problem for everyone, it can pose a particular threat to communities of people of color who already face worse outcomes from the virus.\n\n-- Indonesia' s only vaccine production company has injected the first volunteers with Chinese firm Sinovac's vaccine candidate in so-called phase 3 clinical trials.\n\nFollow AP's pandemic coverage at http://apnews.com/VirusOutbreak and https://apnews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak\n\nNEW DELHI -- India's coronavirus death toll overtook Britain to become the fourth-highest in the world with another single-day record increase in cases Friday.\n\nAccording to the Health Ministry, India reported 1,007 deaths in the past 24 hours. Its total rose to 48,040 deaths, behind the United States, Brazil and Mexico.\n\nIndia's confirmed cases reached 2,461,190 with a single-day spike of 64,553 in the past 24 hours. More than 70% of people infected in India have recovered.\n\nThe daily increase in newly reported infections was around 15,000 in the first week of July but jumped to more than 50,000 in the first week of August. The ministry cited its testing efforts, with more than 800,000 tests in a single day, taking cumulative tests to more than 26 million.\n\nHealth experts say it needs to be higher, given India's population of 1.4 billion.\n\nIndia's two-month lockdown imposed nationwide in late March kept infections low. But it has eased and is now largely being enforced in high-risk areas. The new cases spiked after India reopened shops and manufacturing and allowed hundreds of thousands of migrant workers to return to their homes from coronavirus-hit regions.\n\nSubways, schools and movie theaters remain closed.\n\nSEOUL, South Korea -- South Korea is reporting 103 new coronavirus cases. It is one of the country's biggest daily jumps in months, and officials are expressing concern that infections are getting out of control in the capital of Seoul and other major cities as Koreans increasingly venture out in public.\n\nThe figures released by the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Friday brought the national caseload to 14,873 cases, including 305 deaths.\n\nEighty-three of the new cases were in the densely populated Seoul metropolitan area, where authorities have struggled to stem transmissions. Infections were also reported in other major cities such as Busan, Gwangju and Ulsan.\n\nFriday's jump was driven by local transmissions, which health authorities said could worsen because of the increase in travelers during the summer vacation season.\n\nFRESNO, Calif. -- A private school in California has been ordered to close after it reopened classrooms in violation of a state health order aimed at slowing the spread of the coronavirus.\n\nFresno County issued a health order Thursday against Immanuel Schools in Reedley. The K-12 school was told to close its classrooms until the county is removed from a state monitoring list for two weeks.\n\nThe school has about 600 students and it allowed students into classes Thursday without masks or social distancing. The school's trustees and superintendent say they believe students' development will suffer if they can't be taught on campus.\n\nBEIJING -- China has reported another eight cases of locally transmitted coronavirus infections, all in the northwestern region of Xinjiang where the country's last major outbreak has been largely contained.\n\nOfficials said Friday that 22 other new cases were brought from outside the country by Chinese travelers returning home. China has reported a total of 4,634 deaths from COVID-19 among 84,786 cases.\n\nHong Kong reported 69 new confirmed cases and three deaths over the past 24 hours. The semi-autonomous Chinese city has required masks be worn in all public settings, restricted indoor dining and enacted other social distancing measures to bring down transmissions that now total 4,312 with 66 deaths.\n\nMEXICO CITY -- Mexico has passed the half-million mark in confirmed coronavirus cases.\n\nThe Health Department reported 7,371 newly confirmed cases Thursday, bringing the country's total for the pandemic to 505,751. The department reported 627 more confirmed COVID-19 deaths, giving Mexico a total of 55,293.\n\nExperts agree that due to Mexico's extremely low testing rates, those numbers are undercounts and that the real figures may be two to three times higher. With only about 1.15 million tests conducted to date in a country of almost 130 million people, less than 1% of Mexicans have been tested.\n\nAUSTIN, Texas -- Texas is reporting fewer than 7,000 hospitalized coronavirus patients for the first time in six weeks.\n\nThat encouraging sign Thursday was clouded by questions over testing as students return to school and college football teams push ahead with playing this fall. Testing has dropped off in Texas, a trend seen across the U.S as health experts worry that patients without symptoms aren't bothering because of long lines and waiting days to get results.\n\nNumbers from Texas health officials this week offer a hazy picture of how much testing has fallen. At one point this week, the infection rate in Texas was as high as 24%, only to suddenly drop Thursday to 16%.\n\nOfficials have not offered explanations about the wild swing in infection rates.\n\nSACRAMENTO, Calif. -- California will resume eviction and foreclosure proceedings Sept. 2, stoking fears of a wave of evictions during the coronavirus pandemic unless the governor and state Legislature can agree on a proposal to extend protections.\n\nThe Judicial Council of California voted 19-1 Thursday to end the temporary rules blocking such proceedings that had been in place since April 6.\n\nSince the pandemic began in March, more than 9.7 million people have filed for unemployment benefits in California. A survey from the U.S. Census shows more than 1.7 million renters in the state could not pay their rent on time last month.\n\nCalifornia Chief Justice Tani G. Cantil-Sakauye has been reluctant to let the rules stay in place much longer, saying it is the job of the judicial branch to interpret the laws, not make them.\n\nLONDON -- Britain will require all people arriving from France to isolate for 14 days -- an announcement that throws the plans of tens of thousands of holidaymakers into chaos.\n\nThe government said late Thursday that France is being removed from the list of nations exempted from quarantine requirements because of a rising number of coronavirus infections, which have surged by 66% in the past week. The Netherlands, Malta, Monaco and the Caribbean islands of Aruba and Turks & Caicos also were added to the quarantine list.\n\nFrance is one of the top holiday destinations for British travelers, who now have until 4 a.m. Saturday to get home if they want to avoid two weeks in isolation.\n\nThe number of new infections in Britain is also rising.",

Unlike every other state with major outbreaks, New York only counts residents who died on nursing home property and not those who died in hospitals.\n\n-- Across Africa and around the world, the COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted the supply of antiretroviral drugs to many of the more than 24 million people who take them, endangering their lives.\n\nFollow AP's pandemic coverage at http://apnews.com/VirusOutbreak and https://apnews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak\n\nNEW DELHI -- India's coronavirus caseload has topped 2.3 million after adding 60,963 in the last 24 hours.\n\nIndia also reported 834 deaths on Wednesday for a total of 46,091. India has the third-highest caseload after the United States and Brazil, but only the fifth-highest death toll, and authorities say the fatality rate has dropped below 2% for the first time.\n\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi held a video conference Tuesday with the top elected officials of 10 states that together account for about 80% of India's total cases, urging them to rigorously apply the strategies of containment, surveillance and contact tracing to drive the fatality rate below 1%.\n\nModi also urged testing to be ramped up in several states as it has been in the capital region of Delhi.\n\nThe Indian Council of Medical Research, India's top medical research body, said that more than 733,000 samples were tested for COVID-19 on Tuesday, but didn't break down how many underwent the gold standard RT-PCR test compared to the antigen test, a cheaper and more efficient though less accurate blood test that looks for antibodies.\n\nBEIJING -- China's newly confirmed community transmitted cases of coronavirus fell into the single digits on Wednesday, while Hong Kong saw another 33 cases of infection.\n\nThe National Health Commission said all nine new cases were found in the northwestern region of Xinjiang, whose capital Urumqi has been at the center of China's latest major outbreak. Another 25 cases were brought by Chinese travelers arriving from abroad.\n\nChina has largely contained the local spread of the pandemic that is believed to have originated in the central Chinese city of Wuhan late last year before spreading worldwide.\n\nThe government has recorded 4,634 deaths from COVID-19 among 84,737 cases. Hong Kong, a densely populated semi-autonomous southern Chinese city, also recorded another six deaths to bring its total to 58 among 4,181 cases.\n\nAuthorities have ordered mask wearing in public settings, restrictions on indoor dining and other social distancing measures in a bid to stem its latest outbreak. Those measures appear to have been successful in bringing numbers down from the more than 100 new daily cases reported at the end of last month.\n\nSYDNEY, Australia -- The Australian state of Victoria on Wednesday reported a record 21 virus deaths and 410 new cases from an outbreak in the city of Melbourne which has prompted authorities to impose a strict lockdown.\n\nState Premier Daniel Andrews said 16 of the deaths were linked to aged-care facilities.\n\nThe number of new cases in Victoria is down from the peak, giving authorities some hope the outbreak is waning.\n\nMeanwhile, three Melbourne vloggers were each fined more than $1,000 after posting a video to Chinese social media showing them breaching nighttime curfew rules for a McDonald's run, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation reported.\n\nThe five-minute video, since deleted, showed the international students walking through alleys, dodging police officers and dancing inside a McDonald's restaurant at 2:30 a.m. Sunday, the ABC said. Victoria police confirmed each of the students was fined 1,652 Australian dollars ($1,178).\n\nSEOUL, South Korea -- South Korea has reported 54 newly confirmed cases of COVID-19 as health authorities scramble to stem transmissions amid increased social and leisure activities.\n\nThe figures announced by South Korea' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Wednesday brought the national caseload to 14,714 infections, including 305 deaths.\n\nThe KCDC says 35 of the new cases were local transmissions, all but three of them reported from the densely populated Seoul metropolitan area, which has been at the center of a virus resurgence since late May.\n\nThe other 19 cases were linked to international arrivals. Health authorities have said imported cases are less threatening as they mandate tests and enforce two-week quarantines on all people arriving from abroad.\n\nMEXICO CITY -- Mexico reported a near-record 926 newly confirmed COVID-19 deaths Tuesday, bringing the country's accumulated total to 53,929.\n\nThe Health Department reported 6,686 new coronavirus infections, bringing the country's total confirmed cases so far to 492,522.\n\nAt that rate Mexico will reach a half million confirmed cases soon, but given the extremely low rate of testing -- less than 1.1 million tests in a country of almost 130 million inhabitants -- the number would like be a vast undercount. For the most part, only people with considerable symptoms are tested in Mexico.\n\nRALEIGH, N.C. -- North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper has won another legal victory defending his COVID-19 executive orders, this time when a judge rejected Lt. Gov. Dan Forest's demand that they be blocked by declaring his lawsuit as unlikely to succeed.\n\nJudge Jim Gale rejected Forest's request for a preliminary injunction on Tuesday.\n\nThe Republican lieutenant governor sued Cooper last month, alleging the Democrat's orders limiting business activities and mass gatherings and mandating face coverings were unlawful because he failed to first get support from the Council of State. The 10-member council includes both of them, Attorney General Josh Stein and other statewide elected officials.\n\nCooper's state attorneys argued that the governor acted properly under portions of the Emergency Management Act that don't require the concurrence of the council.\n\nCooper and Forest are running for governor this fall.\n\nForest said in a news release that since the judge ruled \"Cooper has 100% of the power during a declared emergency,\" then the governor also \"has 100% of the responsibility\" for the results, including permanent business closings.\n\nCooper has said Forest's legal actions, if successful, could worsen case and hospitalization numbers that have recently stabilized or improved.\n\n\"Gov. Cooper has taken decisive action with health and safety measures to save lives,\" spokesperson Dory MacMillan wrote in an email.\n\nPHILADELPHIA -- Philadelphia Health Commissioner Dr. Thomas Farley said he plans to tell a visiting group from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services that long delays in getting coronavirus test results have been \"very problematic\" and to press them for a strategic approach to deploying a vaccine once it is available.\n\nLong waits across the country for the results of coronavirus tests renders them virtually useless in helping to contain the spread of the virus, public health officials say.\n\nThe group is doing a site visit in Philadelphia through Thursday, part of a tour of a handful of cities around the country, Farley said.\n\nFarley said he views the visit as a way to show what the city has been doing in terms of prevention, contact tracing and social distancing efforts.",

        "body": "WELLINGTON, New Zealand -- New Zealand's unemployment rate showed a surprising improvement to 4% during the midst of the nation's virus lockdown, although the headline number doesn't tell the full story and joblessness is likely to increase in the months ahead.\n\nStill, the figure was far better than most people expected and came as welcome news to the government led by Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern ahead of a general election next month.\n\nThe figures from Statistics New Zealand showed the unemployment rate in the quarter ending June fell from 4.2% in the previous quarter. But the number of hours worked also fell a record 10% and the number of people not in the labor force rose.\n\nBecause people who aren't actively seeking work are not counted as unemployed, the figures didn't reflect many job losses because most people couldn't search for jobs during the lockdown. And many workers have been protected by a government-funded wage subsidy scheme during the pandemic which is due to expire next month.\n\nHERE'S WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT THE VIRUS OUTBREAK:\n\n-- Chasm grows between Trump and government coronavirus experts\n\n-- 'We are no less American': Deaths pile up on Texas border\n\n-- 'Too many are selfish': US nears 5 million virus cases\n\n-- Progress slow as urgency grows on virus relief legislation\n\n-- California's often-forgotten Imperial County is an example of how the coronavirus has been especially damaging to lower-income and Latino households. The county is heavily Hispanic and poor, and has some of California's highest infection rates.\n\n-- Education officials in Alabama say more than 4,000 new laptop computers bound for a school district are being held by customs due to human rights concerns.\n\nFollow AP's pandemic coverage at http://apnews.com/VirusOutbreak and https://apnews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak\n\nTOKYO -- A governor in Japan is drawing skeptical criticism after he touted a gargling product as effective against the coronavirus, an assertion that, despite its dubiousness, emptied some store shelves of the medicine.\n\nShares of Shionogi & Co. and Meiji Holdings Co., which make Isojin, soared in Tokyo Tuesday trading after Osaka Gov. Hirofumi Yoshimura made the comments.\n\nYoshimura referred to a study carried out by the Osaka regional government on a sample of just 41 people. Experts said such a study is inconclusive.\n\nShionogi and Meiji shares were already coming down Wednesday, as subsequent Japanese media reports debunked Yoshimura's claim.\n\nDaily confirmed cases of the coronavirus have been shooting up in Japan, to more than 1,000 people.\n\nMELBOURNE, Australia -- Australia's hot spot Victoria state announced a new record 725 COVID-19 cases and 15 deaths on Wednesday, while businesses in Melbourne city prepared to draw down their shutters as new pandemic restrictions were enforced.\n\nThe new 24-hour record was marginally higher than 723 cases and 13 deaths reported on Thursday last week.\n\nFrom late Wednesday, many non-essential businesses including most detail retailers, hair-dressers and gyms in Australia's second-largest city will be closed for six weeks. People employed in essential jobs will have to carry passes under Australia's toughest-ever lockdown restrictions.\n\nLike Melbourne hospitals, Victoria Premier Daniel Andrews announced that non-emergency surgeries will be restricted in hospitals in regional Victoria, where infections rates are lower.\n\n\"It will be very challenging, but it is necessary to drive these numbers down,\" Andrews said of the new restrictions.\n\nMEXICO CITY -- Mexico posted a near-record one-day total of 857 newly confirmed COVID-19 deaths Tuesday, bringing the country's confirmed death toll to 48,869, the third-highest number in the world.\n\nThe Health Department reported that just over 1 million coronavirus tests have been performed, with almost 450,000 people testing positive to date.\n\nMexico's has had a positive rate of about 45% to 50% since the early weeks of the pandemic, largely because most people were tested only after exhibiting considerable symptoms.\n\nHONG KONG -- Hong Hong has reported 80 new cases of COVID-19 and four additional deaths, while new cases in mainland China fell to just 27.\n\nHong Kong saw cases spike in a new wave of infections, but new daily cases have now fallen back into the double digits.\n\nAuthorities in the semi-autonomous Chinese city have ordered masks be worn in all public places, slapped restrictions on indoor dining, banned many activities and increased testing for coronavirus. Hong Kong has recorded a total of 3,669 cases and 42 deaths from COVID-19.\n\nOf mainland China's cases, 22 were in the northwestern region of Xinjiang, whose capital and largest city Urumqi has been the center of China's latest outbreak. China has reported 4,634 deaths among 84,491 cases since the virus was first detected in the central Chinese city of Wuhan late last year.\n\nChina said Tuesday it was working with the World Health Organization on an investigation into the origins of the novel coronavirus, but gave no word on when that would get underway.\n\nLAS VEGAS -- Nevada health officials say 95% of the 980 new coronavirus cases reported statewide during the last day were in the Las Vegas area.\n\nState coronavirus response officials said Tuesday that Clark County residents accounted for 931 of the positive COVID-19 tests reported. Confirmed cases statewide topped 52,000, and 15 more deaths brought Nevada's total to at least 862.\n\nSeparately, the governor's office issued a report tallying $16.7 billion in federal coronavirus funding to Nevada since Congress approved a $2.2 trillion emergency aid bill in March.\n\nThe report says nearly $2.2 billion went toward $600-per-week payments to idled workers statewide.\n\nWASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump says more Americans will be lost to COVID-19.\n\nTrump was asked in a Fox Business Network interview Tuesday about prospects for relations with China going forward.\n\nTrump said the relationship has been \"very badly hurt\" by the spread of the coronavirus and he repeated his belief that China should have contained it.\n\nThe president noted the American death toll, saying somewhat prematurely that 160,000 had died from the disease caused by the virus. He told host Lou Dobbs: \"We're going to lose more.\"\n\nTrump added that millions would have been lost had he not intervened and \"just let it ride.'\n\nThe U.S. death told from COVID-19 stood at more than 156,000 on Tuesday evening.\n\nLOS ANGELES -- A technical problem has caused a lag in California's tally of coronavirus test results, casting doubt on the accuracy of recent data showing improvements in the infection rate and hindering efforts to track the spread.\n\nState Health and Human Services Secretary Dr. Mark Ghaly said Tuesday that in recent days California has not been receiving a full count through electronic lab reports because of the unresolved issue.\n\nThe state's data page now carries a disclaimer saying the numbers represent an underreporting of actual positive cases per day.\n\nThe latest daily tally posted Tuesday showed 4,526 new confirmed positives, the lowest in more than six weeks.",

All the infected passengers are registered as living in Norway.\n\nThe cruise liner often acts like a local ferry, traveling from port to port along Norway's west coast. Some passengers disembarked along the route and authorities fear they may have spread the virus to local communities.\n\nNorwegian broadcaster NRK said Friday that Bent Martini, the ship owner Hurtigruten's chief operating officer who was traveling on the infected ship when it docked in Tromsoe, had been temporarily discharged. It was not clear whether he tested positive.\n\nHERE'S WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT THE VIRUS OUTBREAK:\n\n-- India hits 2 million cases as health volunteers strike\n\n-- July US jobs report is expected to point to hiring slowdown\n\n-- Virus talks on brink of collapse, sides still 'far apart'\n\n-- Ohio Gov.

It is a drop greater than that recorded in the first half of 2009, at the height of the Great Recession. It's only partially offset by a decline in imports.\n\nForeign Trade Minister Franck Riester said that \"these figures are unfortunately not a surprise, as the scale of the crisis we are going through is exceptional.\"\n\nFrance also experienced a dramatic clump in its goods trade deficit to minus 34.0 billion euros (minus $40.2 billion) from minus 29.0 billion euros ($34.3 billion) in the first half of 2019.\n\nISLAMABAD -- -- Pakistan's daily infection rate has stayed under 1,000 for more than three weeks, occasionally dropping to 300 and prompting the government to further ease restrictions with restaurants, parks and even gyms opening next week.\n\nOn Friday, Pakistan recorded 782 new cases in the last 24 hours and just 17 deaths. In all, Pakistan has reported 282,642 confirmed cases and 6,052 deaths.\n\nThe government credits the consistently low numbers for the last few weeks to a strategy of smart lockdowns, where businesses and residential areas were shut and quarantined after recording spikes in cases.\n\nPrime Minister Imran Khan defied his critics to ease lockdowns early on saying he needed to open sectors like the construction industry to provide jobs to the country's poorest. Since the pandemic hit, Pakistan's poverty rate has increased from 30% to 40% of the country's 220 million people.\n\nUNITED NATIONS -- The United Nations' counterterrorism chief says a 350% increase in phishing websites was reported in the first quarter of the year and many of them targeted hospitals and health care systems, hindering their response to the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nVladimir Voronkov told the U.N. Security Council on Thursday that the upsurge in phishing sites was part of \"a significant rise in cybercrime in recent months.\" He said global experts don't yet fully understand \"the impact and consequences of the pandemic on global peace and security, and more specifically on organized crime and terrorism.\"\n\nVoronkov also warned that extremists are taking advantage of the disruption and economic hardship brought by the pandemic to spread fear and division while trying to recruit followers.\n\nMELBOURNE, Australia -- The chief health officer for Australia's Victoria state says the coronavirus infection rate in the hard-hit state has been \"relatively flat\" in the past week.\n\nVictoria registered 450 newly confirmed cases and 11 deaths Friday. The 24-hour case load was down from a record 725 infections reported a week earlier. Chief Health Officer Brett Sutton described the latest tally as \"reasonable,\" adding that \"we're kind of sitting at 400 to 500 cases a day\" over the past week.\n\nMelbourne University epidemiologist Tony Blakely says mandatory mask wearing has started curbing the coronavirus spread. He says the infection rate began to plateau at the end of July, a week after Melbourne residents risked fines if they left home without a mask.\n\nA six-week lockdown order took effect Thursday in the city.\n\nCOLUMBUS, Ohio -- Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine is tweeting that has tested negative for a coronavirus infection after testing positive earlier Thursday before he was to meet with President Donald Trump.\n\nThe governor's office says he took the first test as part of standard protocol before meeting Trump at an airport in Cleveland. He had planned to join the president on a visit to the Whirlpool Corp. plant in northwest Ohio.\n\nDeWine has no symptoms but returned to Columbus before Trump landed.\n\nThe governor then returned to his home in Cedarville to quarantine for 14 days, but he tweeted Thursday night that he and his wife, Fran, had tested negative.\n\nBEIJING -- China's capital is reporting its first new case of locally transmitted COVID-19 in a week. State media said Friday the case in Beijing is linked to a recent outbreak in the northern port city of Dalian. Beijing has registered only a few scattered new cases since containing a June outbreak linked to a wholesale food market.\n\nChina's northwestern region of Xinjiang has 26 new cases as authorities continue to fight to curb an outbreak through travel restrictions and the lockdown of some residential areas.\n\nThe semi-autonomous city of Hong Kong reports 95 new cases and three additional fatalities reported. The city of 7.5 million people has restricted indoor dining and require faces masks to be worn in all public places.\n\nMEXICO CITY -- Mexico has jumped above 50,000 dead from the coronavirus with the latest daily report of 819 newly confirmed deaths.\n\nThe report from the Health Department on Thursday brought the country's accumulated death toll to 50,517. That is the third-highest death toll in the world, behind only the United States and Brazil.\n\nThe department also reported 6,590 new confirmed coronavirus cases, putting the accumulated total at 462,690.\n\nAuthorities concede the death and case numbers are significant undercounts, in part due to Mexico's extremely low level of testing. Mexico has performed only about 1,050,000 tests to date, far less than one for every 100 residents.\n\nTOPEKA, Kan. -- A spokesman for Kansas Gov. Laura Kelly says the governor will get a coronavirus test because she met with the speaker of the state House of Representatives who tested positive for an infection last month.\n\nHouse Speaker Ron Ryckman Jr. is the highest-ranking Kansas official known to have been infected. He notified fellow House Republicans in a letter after Tuesday's primary, saying he had been hospitalized for a week in July but is \"on the road to recovery.\"\n\nGovernor's spokesman Sam Coleman says the governor had no idea Ryckman had tested positive until Thursday. He says the governor will be tested \"as soon as we can set it up.\"\n\nRyckman says he tested positive July 13 and he began experiencing symptoms that led to his short hospitalization. He says he no longer was contagious when he attended a public meeting with other legislative leaders and Kelly on July 29.\n\nSAN FRANCISCO -- A U.S. federal judge has ordered immigration officials to conduct weekly coronavirus testing for more than 100 men held at a California detention center.\n\nJudge Vince Chhabria in San Francisco issued the temporary restraining order Thursday.\n\nA lawyer tells the San Francisco Chronicle that nearly two dozen inmates and staff members have tested positive for COVID-19 at the Mesa Verde Detention Center in Bakersfield.\n\nThe judge says ICE has deliberately avoided universal testing out of concern that the agency would have to implement troublesome safety measures.\n\nThe Chronicle says ICE didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nJOHANNESBURG -- South Africa is reporting more than 8,300 new confirmed coronavirus cases as the country with the world's fifth largest caseload is approaching 10,000 deaths.\n\nThe new health ministry figures push the total cases on the African continent past the 1 million mark.\n\nSouth Africa has more than half the virus cases in Africa, with 529,877.\n\nHealth Minister Zweli Mkhize this week expressed cautious optimism as the rate of new cases has slowed. But he warned that vigilance must continue \"to prevent a renewed surge.\"\n\nSouth Africa's COVID-19 deaths are now at 9,298, with more than 400 new deaths reported.",

Mass public transport will be barred and only essential travel will be allowed.\n\nLeaders of nearly 100 medical organizations held a rare online news conference Saturday and warned that the health system has been overwhelmed by infection spikes and may collapse as health workers fall ill or resign from exhaustion and fear.\n\nThey asked Duterte to reimpose a tight lockdown in the capital to allow health workers \"a timeout\" and allow the government to recalibrate its response to the pandemic.\n\nHERE'S WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT THE VIRUS OUTBREAK:\n\n-- Parents struggle as schools reopen amid coronavirus surge\n\n-- COVID relief bill remains up in air as negotiations resume\n\n-- Debate begins for who's first in line for COVID-19 vaccine\n\n-- Follow AP's pandemic coverage at http://apnews.com/VirusOutbreak and https://apnews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak\n\nNEW DELHI -- Indian health authorities have given approval to the Serum Institute of India for conducting phase two and three trials of a COVID-19 vaccine candidate developed by the University of Oxford.\n\nThe approval came late Sunday from the Drugs Controller General of India. At least 1,600 adults will participate in the trials.\n\nSerum, the world's largest maker of vaccines by volume, is mass-producing the vaccine candidate developed by the University of Oxford. It's one of several candidates being developed.\n\nMeanwhile, India's coronavirus caseload Monday crossed 1.8 million with another spike of 52,972 new cases in the past 24 hours. The Health Ministry on Monday also reported 771 deaths in the past 24 hours, taking total fatalities up to 38,135.\n\nBEIJING -- An outbreak in China's far northwestern region of Xinjiang is continuing to subside, with 28 new cases reported Monday.\n\nThe outbreak of 590 cases so far has been concentrated in the capital, Urumqi, where authorities have conducted mass testing, cut public transport, isolated some communities and restricted travel.\n\nSeven other new cases were imported and eight were in the northeastern province of Liaoning. No new deaths were reported, leaving China's total at 4,634 among 84,428 reported cases of COVID-19.\n\nYet, while mainland China's latest outbreak appears to have peaked, authorities in the semi-autonomous Chinese city of Hong Kong are struggling to contain infections, with more than 200 added over the weekend.\n\nPRISTINA, Kosovo - Kosovar Prime Minister Avdullah Hoti said he had the coronavirus and was isolating at home.\n\nHoti posted on Facebook he had no symptoms other than a light cough. He didn't mention if any of his close staff had been infected or if they were self-quarantining.\n\nKosovo health authorities have reported significant increases in new virus cases and deaths in the last month, a trend which is continuing.\n\nNew lockdown measures like restrictions on public gatherings have been imposed, and authorities are trying to find more hospital beds.",

        "body": "FULLERTON, Calif. -- There's red tape running along the floor of the coronavirus unit at St. Jude's Medical Center in Fullerton, California.\n\nIt's a clear line of demarcation. On one side, the cold zone, where only a surgical mask, scrubs and shoe coverings are necessary. On the other, the warm zone, where the gloves come on. And the N95 mask. And the gown. And the hairnet. And the face shield.\n\nAnother step through glass doors and it's into the hot zone, where coughing patients in green-patterned gowns await.\n\nIt's outside this unit, in an area not marked by red tape or glass doors, that worries the nurses of \"4 North\" most.\n\nIt's home: Where their kids play and their spouses sleep. Where PPE are only letters of the alphabet for toddlers learning their ABCs. Where the coronavirus is called \"The Big Cough\" and the worldwide pandemic means you have to stay at home because there are \"little monsters\" everywhere.\n\nFor the nurses of \"4 North,\" like their colleagues before them from New York and across the globe, home is fraught with uncertainty. Are they bringing the virus there? Are they exposing their partners and children? Should they isolate or quarantine themselves? Should they quit their jobs to keep their families safe?\n\nAs the pandemic rages on and cases climb throughout California, once again one of the nation's hot spots, the answers remain unclear.\n\nIn the meantime, the nurses forge ahead. They care for their patients during 12-hour shifts, taking temperatures and holding their hands through gloves and wondering when -- if -- it will all end. And then they go home, to a new routine of changing clothes in the garage and rushing inside to shower before they can kiss their kids goodnight.\n\nThe Associated Press spent several days in the coronavirus unit at St. Jude's and followed four nurses and their families after their shifts were over.\n\nShe had just given birth to her youngest son, Arshan, prematurely and was supposed to return to work as a nurse on Valentine's Day.\n\nThe coronavirus pandemic was slowly making its way to the United States. Information was scarce. The effects of the virus on babies, especially ones born premature, was unknown.\n\nMichel took six weeks of unpaid maternity leave to buy time. She started a new job at St. Jude's in March, returning to a field very different from the one she had left before giving birth. Now, she doubles up on purple gloves and seals her cellphone and IDs in plastic.\n\n\"I cry almost every night,\" she said. \"If it was only about me, it would be a different story.\"\n\nHer older son, 2-year-old Leonidas, knows not to hug his mother when she first gets home. He'll sit outside as she showers after her shift, chattering about his day.\n\nBut there are things she can't tell him about hers, like the time she spent three hours alone with a patient as she died, holding her hand and brushing her forehead, telling the woman over and over again that her family loved her.\n\nLike when her own uncle died in Iran, succumbing to the virus within two days without access to a ventilator.\n\nInstead, she teaches her son how to give \"air hugs\" and reads to him from children's books with titles like \"My Mom is a Nurse.\"\n\nHer mother has never kissed Arshan, and Leonidas misses his hugging his aunt. The toddler won't be attending preschool with his new backpack anytime soon.\n\n\"I love them to death but did we make a mistake, having kids and bringing them into this world?\" Michel pauses. \"I never doubted before.\"\n\nFor the month of April, the Cushing family lived apart.\n\nSpencer Cushing spent his days -- and some of his nights -- at St. Jude's, as a nurse caring for \"step-down\" patients recovering from the most serious COVID-19 symptoms. When his shifts were over, though, he wouldn't go home to his wife, Eleanor, and young sons, 3-year-old James and baby Walter.\n\nThe reports from New York were frightening: Hospitals overwhelmed. Medical staff working without proper protective equipment. The death toll climbing.\n\nWas California next?\n\n\"We weren't sure what was safe,\" Cushing said. \"But we knew what we were doing was the safest.\"\n\nSo he rented his own apartment, returning there after his shifts as Eleanor put the boys to bed alone at their home.\n\nJames began sleepwalking. Walter grew four new teeth and learned to roll over. Eleanor gave up her own part-time night nursing shifts at St. Jude's so she could stay home with the kids.\n\nOn his days off, Cushing would come over with breakfast burritos and groceries and talk to his family from a distance. Sometimes he came back at night, when the boys were sleeping, to have a socially distanced date with Eleanor over a patio campfire.\n\nIn the meantime, life at the hospital remained a cycle of donning and doffing protective gear. Some patients recovered. Others didn't.\n\nAfter a month, the Cushings decided Dad could come home. They felt safe with St. Jude's preparations and plans, and the feared shortage of protective equipment hadn't hit Southern California.\n\n\"You couldn't stay away for six months,\" Eleanor said to her husband. \"We're going to be seeing these patients for a long time.\"\n\nCushing moved back in. Eleanor returned to working one night shift a week. James stopped sleepwalking and began preparing for his fourth birthday.\n\n\"I'm glad you're here, Dad,\" he would tell his father. \"I'm really glad you're here.\"\n\nThe 28-year-old nurse knew it was coming. Comfort care had been arranged. His family, covered in PPE, was there. The Ativan and morphine, medications to relax him, were ready.\n\nIt was time.\n\nShe took her 65-year-old patient off the machine that was helping him breathe. She held the man's wife close, their blue gowns and purple gloves matching. She shed tears that clung to her face shield.\n\n\"Times like these, you will remember this,\" Younkin's grandmother, a nurse during the polio epidemic, later told her. \"You don't forget them.\"\n\nA few days later, the young nurse's voice broke as she sat cross-legged on a blanket during a sunny day in the park with her husband and giggling infant son, Jackson.\n\nBecoming a nurse was her lifelong dream. She was an EMT at 18 years old. She wanted to follow her grandmother's path.\n\nNow her career has forced her to blur and blend her two lives. She agonizes over her every move in the hospital -- \"Did I put my gear on the right way, did I take it off the right way, did I touch something wrong accidentally?\" -- and leaves her shoes in the car after her shifts. She juggles decisions like breastfeeding during a pandemic and whether she should move out of her home to keep her son and husband safe.\n\n\"The thought of infecting either of them or my family,\" she said, her voice catching and her husband, Cody, rubbing her back. \"It's crazy.\"\n\nThe pandemic has forced conversations that no young mother should have with a young father, just months after the birth of their first child. They talk about what would happen if she were infected and hospitalized.\n\n\"If I were to die, don't come,\" Younkin told her husband emphatically. \"Don't risk yourselves.\"\n\nWhen Jackie Vargas is in the hospital, she feels safe. She's been a nurse for 11 years, and she knows what dangers lurk in the COVID-19 ward where she's been working long hours for months.\n\nShe wears her glasses instead of contacts so she doesn't have to touch her eyes. She swaps her sneakers out for glittery black clogs so she doesn't have to handle shoelaces. She seals her N95 mask in a Tupperware-like container between patients so it's stored away from germs in the air.\n\nIt's at home where the anxiety escapes, its symptoms infecting her whole family. Vargas' husband is a firefighter in Long Beach, and both are fighting to stay healthy so they can keep working.\n\nSo she doesn't hug her mother-in-law, who is taking care of Vargas' younger kids. Through a glass door, she visits her own mom and oldest daughter, Kaila, who has already had the virus and is staying with her grandma.\n\nThe ICU nurse who has cared for dozens of fevered, sick patients could do nothing more than monitor her 20-year-old' daughter's fever over FaceTime. The necessary PPE -- like face shields and gowns -- is only for the hospital.\n\nWatching her patients alone in the ICU, away from their families, can be emotionally draining.\n\nShe tries to soothe her mind and body with \"the longest baths\" filled with eucalyptus Epsom salt and lavender, as well as journaling and meditation. But sometimes it's hard to calm down.\n\n\"Some of the stuff gets to me, the sad stories,\" she said. \"It takes me time to let go, let go of what I've seen.\"\n\nHer mother, who begged her for years to become a nurse, now pleads for her only child to quit her job. They haven't touched in months, talking through that glass door as Vargas' youngest children splash in Grandma Rose's pool.\n\nHer husband sleeps in the living room if he was exposed at work or one of her patients is very ill. If either of them contract COVID-19, the plan is to quarantine in a tent in the backyard.\n\nVargas worries about her son, Kai, and her 10-year-old daughter, Ava, watching them as they munch poolside on roasted chicken that Grandma Rose ordered from El Pollo Loco. She avoids kissing their faces and lingering too long at bedtime, but she knows it might not be enough.\n\n\"I don't know where there's a safe place for them to go,\" she lamented.",

    "UK government ditches advice on masks at English schools": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "LONDON -- Following mounting pressure to change tack, the British government decided late Tuesday to ditch advice that high school students and staff in England don't need to wear face masks when schools reopen from next week.\n\nIn another abrupt change in coronavirus-related policy, the government said children in secondary schools -- those above 11 years of age -- in areas under local lockdown rules, such as Greater Manchester, will have to don face masks when moving around corridors and communal areas. Though high school children elsewhere won't have to, the government said schools in England will have the discretion to require them in communal areas.\n\nThe government said face masks will not need to be worn in classrooms, because other protective measures, such as socially distanced seating, will be in place. It also said that face masks in the classroom may have an impact on learning.\n\n\"I hope these steps will provide parents, pupils and teachers with further reassurance,\" Education Secretary Gavin Williamson said.\n\nThe change in guidance comes in the wake of new recommendations from the World Health Organization that children aged over 12 should wear masks if socially distancing rules can't easily be followed and where transmission rates of the virus are a cause for concern. It also comes just hours after the Scottish government changed its advice to require all secondary school students to wear face masks in communal areas.\n\nIt's the government's second sudden change in policy on the education front in as many weeks following last week's decision to drop a controversial system to award grades for key high school exams after they had been cancelled because of the pandemic.\n\nOpposition lawmakers criticized the Conservative government for only changing policy in the wake of pressure.\n\nKate Green, the education spokeswoman for the main opposition Labour Party, said the change was \"half-baked\" and criticized the government for not making face masks compulsory in communal areas.\n\n\"Parents and schools needed clarity and leadership, but instead the government have just passed the buck back to them,\" she said.\n\nThe government is trying to reassure nervous parents that their children will be safe when they return to school. Schools across the U.K. closed in March as part of the lockdown and bar the return of a minority of some younger children in June, most students have not seen the inside of a classroom for the best part of six months.\n\n\"I think that the schools, the teachers, they've all done a fantastic job of getting ready and the risk to children's health, the risk to children's well-being from not being in school, is far greater than the risk from COVID,\" Prime Minister Boris Johnson said earlier alongside an indication that he was willing to change the stance of face masks.\n\nThe evidence from around the world is that children face less severe virus symptoms than adults. However, they can be sources of transmission and governments around the world are grappling about how school reopenings will affect the virus' spread within families and in the wider community.\n\n\"In the absence of clarity, given the known detrimental impact of school closures, we must err on the side of caution in order to ensure that when schools reopen, they remain open,\" said Dr. David Strain, a clinical senior lecturer at the University of Exeter.\n\nEngland's nearly 25,000 schools are due to reopen over the coming couple of weeks, and Johnson's Conservative government is focused on making sure the return goes smoothly following the recent exam grades fiasco. That furor claimed its first casualty Tuesday with the resignation of Sally Collier, head of the exams regulator Ofqual.\n\nWithin the U.K., which has Europe's highest virus-related death toll at nearly 42,000, Scottish schools reopened first, followed by those in Northern Ireland. Schools in England and Wales are due to reopen in September.\n\nTwo weeks on from the reopening of schools in Scotland, one school in the city of Dundee has already had to close following an outbreak, a development that appears to have been at the heart of the change in face mask advice.\n\nFollowing on from the change in WHO guidelines, the Scottish government confirmed earlier it was giving \"obligatory guidance\" to high school students to wear face coverings when moving around schools from Monday.\n\n\"It is right we reflect that in our guidance,\" Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said.\n\nScotland has often led the way within the U.K. during the pandemic on the wider use of face coverings. It, for example, mandated their use in shops after they reopened a couple of weeks before England. The Welsh government also said that it was considering a change of policy for high schools in Wales.\n\nFollow AP coverage of the virus outbreak at https://apnews.com/VirusOutbreak and https://apnews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak",

        "body": "LONDON -- The British government came under renewed pressure Tuesday to recommend that high school students in England should wear face masks, at least in communal areas such as hallways, after the advice in Scotland was changed.\n\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson said his government is ready to follow suit and advise a change in certain situations if the medical evidence deems face masks to be necessary in containing the spread of the coronavirus.\n\n\"On the issue of whether or not to wear masks in some contexts, you know, we'll look at the changing medical evidence as we go on,\" he told reporters while on a visit to a shipyard in Devon in southwest England. \"If we need to change the advice, then of course we will.\"\n\nFor now, the advice of the British government, which oversees schools in England, is that face masks aren't necessary. It points to a recent report from Public Health England that showed very few virus infections during the partial reopening of schools for younger students in June.\n\nThe government's main focus at the moment is trying to reassure nervous parents that their children will be safe when they return to school.\n\n\"I think that the schools, the teachers, they've all done a fantastic job of getting ready and the risk to children's health, the risk to children's well-being from not being in school, is far greater than the risk from COVID,\" Johnson said.\n\nThe evidence from around the world is that children face less severe virus symptoms than do adults, with the elderly the most vulnerable to severe infection and death.

        "body": "In a comfy suburb just outside Nashville, a young family swabs their noses twice a month in a DIY study seeking answers to some of the most vexing questions about the coronavirus.\n\nHow many U.S. children and teens are infected? How many kids who are infected show no symptoms? How likely are they to spread it to other kids and adults?\n\n\"The bottom line is we just don't know yet the degree to which children can transmit the virus,\" said Dr. Tina Hartert of Vanderbilt University, who is leading the government-funded study.\n\nEvidence from the U.S., China and Europe shows children are less likely to become infected with the virus than adults and also less likely to become seriously ill when they do get sick. There is also data suggesting that young children don't spread the virus very often but that kids aged 10 and up may spread it just as easily as adults. The new study aims to find more solid proof.\n\n\"If we don't see significant transmission within households, that would be very reassuring,\" Hartert said.\n\nSome 2,000 families in 11 U.S. cities are enrolled in the DIY experiment, pulled from participants in previous government research. In all, that's 6,000 people. They have no in-person contact with researchers. Testing supplies are mailed to their homes.\n\nThey collect their own nasal swabs for COVID-19 tests, and less often blood and stool samples. The specimens are mailed to the study organizers. Participants get text messages asking about symptoms and reminding them to test and they fill out questionnaires.\n\nThe study could help determine the safety of in-class education during the pandemic. But results aren't expected before year's end.\n\nFor Mendy and Joe McNulty and their two youngest sons in Mt. Juliet, Tennessee, nasal swabbing at home is a family affair. Testing supplies are spread out on a carefully wiped down kitchen counter, where the four gather to perform what has become a ritual. Mendy McNulty helps the boys with their swabbing.\n\n\"We were excited to be able to feel like we could contribute somehow,\" she said, explaining why the family chose to participate. \"This virus is so unknown. Any little bit we can do felt like we were doing something to help.\"\n\nIt's hard to pin down the exact number of COVID-19 cases in kids. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says at least 175,000 cases have been confirmed in those aged 17 and under, accounting for less than 10% of all confirmed cases. But the true number is likely much higher because many kids have silent infections or only vague symptoms and don't get tested.\n\nData on kids and coronavirus spread is also murky. Hundreds of infections have been reported in children and staff members at U.S. day care centers, but whether kids or adults were the main spreaders isn't known.\n\nThe family study is also investigating whether children with asthma or allergies might have some protection against COVID-19. Anecdotal evidence suggests they might but \"we don't know what the mechanism of that might be,\" said Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. The institute is paying for the research.\n\nAs a mom, former school teacher and scientist, Hartert is anxious to help fill in the gaps. She acknowledges it's possible that none of the families will get infected, but given the number of COVID-19 cases around the country, she says that's highly unlikely.\n\nMendy McNulty says so far her family has remained healthy. She and her husband are both 39 and don't feel overly worried about getting infected.\n\nShe's interested in what happens when her kids return to school in mid-August -- two classroom days a week with masks and social distancing, three days online.\n\n\"Schools are like little petri dishes anyway,\" said McNulty, also a former teacher.\n\n\"I am prepared to bring everyone home\" if outbreaks occur, she said.\n\nThe boys -- 7-year-old Andrew and 9-year-old Hudson -- were excited to take part in the study, McNulty said. She helps them do the nose swabbing, and they both say it doesn't really hurt.\n\n\"Sometimes it tickles,\" Andrew said. Other times, \"it feels like she's sticking it up super far.\"\n\nDr. David Kimberlin says he and other infectious disease specialists have been waiting for the kind of data the study will provide.\n\n\"Generally speaking, the virus behaves differently in children than adults,\" said Kimberlin, a pediatrics professor at the University of Alabama at Birmingham. \"Why is that? We just need to know so much more.\"\n\nFollow AP Medical Writer Lindsey Tanner on Twitter: @LindseyTanner\n\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute's Department of Science Education.

    "US reports show racial disparities in kids with COVID-19": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "NEW YORK -- Racial disparities in the the U.S. coronavirus epidemic extend to children, according to two sobering government reports released Friday.\n\nOne of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports looked children with COVID-19 who needed hospitalization. Hispanic children were hospitalized at a rate eight times higher than white kids, and Black children were hospitalized at a rate five times higher, it found.\n\nThe second report examined cases of a rare virus-associated syndrome in kids. It found that nearly three-quarters of the children with the syndrome were either Hispanic or Black, well above their representation in the general population.\n\nThe coronavirus has exposed racial fractures in the U.S. health care system, as Black, Hispanic and Native Americans have been hospitalized and killed by COVID-19 at far higher rates than other groups.\n\nMeanwhile, the impact of the virus on children has become a political issue. President Donald Trump and some other administration officials have been pushing schools to re-open, a step that would allow more parents to return to work and the economy to pick up.\n\nOn Wednesday, Facebook deleted a post by Trump for violating its policy against spreading misinformation about the coronavirus. The post featured a link to a Fox News video in which Trump says children are \"virtually immune\" to the virus.\n\nThe vast majority of coronavirus cases and deaths have been in adults, and kids are considered less likely to have serious symptoms when they're infected. Of the nearly 5 million cases reported in the U.S. as of Wednesday, about 265,000 were in children 17 and under -- about 5%. Of the more than 156,000 deaths reported at that time, 77 were children -- about 0.05%.\n\nBut Friday's CDC reports are a \"gut punch\" reminder that some children are getting seriously ill and dying, said Carrie Henning-Smith, a University of Minnesota researcher who focuses on health disparities.\n\n\"It's clear from these studies, and from other emerging research, that kids are not immune,\" she said. \"Kids can pass along COVID, and they can also suffer the effects of it.\"\n\nShe said the studies should give community leaders pause about opening schools. \"We need to be really, really careful. We are potentially talking about putting children in unsafe situations,\" Henning-Smith said.\n\nThe first report is based on cases received from hospitals in 14 states. The researchers counted 576 hospitalizations of kids from March 1 through July 25 of this year. The report did not have detailed medical information on all of them, but at least 12 were sick enough to need a machine to help them breathe. One died.\n\nThe hospitalization rate for Hispanic children was about 16.4 per 100,000. The rate for Black children was 10.5 per 100,000, and for white kids it was 2.1 per 100,000.\n\nAs with adults, many of the hospitalized children had existing health problems, including obesity, chronic lung conditions and -- in the case of infants -- preterm birth. The reported death was a child with several underlying conditions, the report said.\n\nA number of possible factors could explain the disparities, said Dr. Cyrus Shahpar, who oversees epidemic prevention efforts for a not-for-profit data and advocacy organization called Resolve to Save Lives.\n\nLarger percentages of Hispanic and Black kids may go to hospital emergency rooms when they're sick, which could be driven by difficulty getting into -- or paying for -- doctor's office visits. That lack of access to regular health-care could lead to more severe illness, he suggested.\n\nThe second CDC report focused on 570 kids diagnosed with a rare coronavirus-linked inflammatory condition. Eight of them died.\n\nSome children with the syndrome have symptoms resembling Kawasaki disease, another rare childhood condition that can cause swelling and heart problems. Other symptoms include fever, abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, neck pain, rash, bloodshot eyes or feeling extra tired.\n\nIn the study, many of the patients with the condition had severe complications, including heart problems and kidney damage. Nearly two-thirds of the cases overall were admitted to intensive care units, and the average ICU stay was five days.\n\nThe CDC report covered illnesses that began from mid-February to mid-July. Forty states reported cases.\n\nThe report found that 13% of kids with the condition were white, while more than 40% were Hispanic and 33% were Black. Overall, about half of U.S. children are white, around 25% Hispanic and about 14% are Black, according to population estimates.\n\nScientists are still learning about the condition. Experts say genetics has nothing to do with why some racial and ethnic groups are more likely to be infected by the virus, get seriously sick from it or die from it. But it's not yet clear if genetics play a role in the childhood inflammation condition, Shahpar said.\n\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute's Department of Science Education.

    "US response to the virus is met with incredulity abroad": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "ROME -- The United States' failure to contain the spread of the coronavirus has been met with astonishment and alarm in Europe, as the world's most powerful country edges closer to a global record of 5 million confirmed infections.\n\nPerhaps nowhere outside the U.S. is America's bungled virus response viewed with more consternation than in Italy, which was ground zero of Europe's epidemic. Italians were unprepared when the outbreak exploded in February, and the country still has one of the world's highest official death tolls at 35,000.\n\nBut after a strict nationwide, 10-week lockdown, vigilant tracing of new clusters and general acceptance of mask mandates and social distancing, Italy has become a model of virus containment.\n\n\"Don't they care about their health?\" a mask-clad Patrizia Antonini asked about people in the United States as she walked with friends along the banks of Lake Bracciano, north of Rome. \"They need to take our precautions. ... They need a real lockdown.\"\n\nMuch of the incredulity in Europe stems from the fact that America had the benefit of time, European experience and medical know-how to treat the virus that the continent itself didn't have when the first COVID-19 patients started filling intensive care units.\n\nYet, more than four months into a sustained outbreak, the U.S. closed in on an astonishing milestone of 5 million confirmed infections, easily the highest in the world. Health officials believe the actual number is closer to 50 million, given testing limitations and the fact that as many as 40% of all those who are infected have no symptoms.\n\n\"We Italians always saw America as a model,\" said Massimo Franco, a columnist with daily Corriere della Sera. \"But with this virus we've discovered a country that is very fragile, with bad infrastructure and a public health system that is nonexistent.\"\n\nItalian Health Minister Roberto Speranza hasn't shied away from criticizing the U.S., officially condemning as \"wrong\" Washington's decision to withhold funding from the World Health Organization and expressing amazement at President Donald Trump's virus response.\n\nAfter Trump finally donned a mask last month, Speranza told La7 television: \"I'm not surprised by Trump's behavior now; I'm profoundly surprised by his behavior before.\"\n\nWith America's list-leading 160,000 dead, politicized resistance to masks and rising caseload, European nations have barred American tourists and visitors from other countries with growing cases from freely traveling to the bloc.\n\nFrance and Germany are now imposing tests on arrival for travelers from \"at risk\" countries, the U.S. included.\n\n\"I am very well aware that this impinges on individual freedoms, but I believe that this is a justifiable intervention,\" German Health Minister Jens Spahn said last week.\n\nMistakes were made in Europe, too, from delayed lockdowns to insufficient protections for nursing home elderly and critical shortages of tests and protective equipment for medical personnel.\n\nThe virus is still raging in some Balkan countries, and thousands of maskless protesters demanded an end to virus restrictions in Berlin earlier this month. Hard-hit Spain, France and Germany have seen infection rebounds with new cases topping 1,000 a day, and Italy's cases inched up over 500 on Friday. Britain is still seeing an estimated 3,700 new infections daily, and some scientists say the country's beloved pubs might have to close again if schools are to reopen in September without causing a new wave.\n\nIn the U.S., new cases are running at about 54,000 a day -- an immensely high number even when taking into account the country's larger population. And while that's down from a peak of well over 70,000 last month, cases are rising in nearly 20 states, and deaths are climbing in most.\n\nIn contrast, at least for now Europe appears to have the virus somewhat under control.\n\n\"Had the medical professionals been allowed to operate in the States, you would have belatedly gotten to a point of getting to grips with this back in March,\" said Scott Lucas, professor of international studies at the University of Birmingham, England. \"But of course, the medical and public health professionals were not allowed to proceed unchecked,\" he said, referring to Trump's frequent undercutting of his own experts.\n\nWhen the virus first appeared in the United States, Trump and his supporters quickly dismissed it as either a \"hoax\" or a virus that would quickly disappear once warmer weather arrived. At one point, Trump suggested that ultraviolet light or injecting disinfectants would eradicate the virus. (He later said he was being facetious).\n\nTrump's frequent complaints about Dr. Anthony Fauci have regularly made headlines in Europe, where the U.S. infectious-disease expert is a respected figure. Italy's leading COVID-19 hospital offered Fauci a job if Trump fired him.\n\nTrump has defended the U.S. response, blaming China, where the virus was first detected, for America's problems and saying the U.S. numbers are so high because there is so much testing. Trump supporters and Americans who have refused to wear masks against all medical advice back that line.\n\n\u202a\"There's no reason to fear any sickness that's out there,\" said Julia Ferjo, a mother of three in Alpine, Texas, who is \"vehemently\" against wearing a mask. \u202aFerjo, 35, teaches fitness classes in a large gym with open doors. She doesn't allow participants to wear masks.\n\n\u202a\"When you're breathing that hard, I would pass out,\" she said. \"I do not want people just dropping like flies.\"\n\nAnd health officials watched with alarm as thousands of bikers gathered Friday in the small South Dakota city of Sturgis for an annual 10-day motorcycle rally. The state has no mask mandates, and many bikers expressed defiance of measures meant to prevent the virus's spread.\n\nDr. David Ho, director of the Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center at Columbia University Irving Medical Center, who is leading a team seeking treatments for COVID-19, decried such behavior, as well as the country's handling of the virus.\n\n\"There's no national strategy, no national leadership, and there's no urging for the public to act in unison and carry out the measures together,\" he said. \"That's what it takes, and we have completely abandoned that as a nation.\"\n\nWhen he gets on Zoom calls with counterparts from around the globe, \"everyone cannot believe what they're seeing in the U.S. and they cannot believe the words coming out of the leadership,'' he said.\n\nEven the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, has taken the unusual step of criticizing the U.S. when she urged Washington to reconsider its decision to break ties with the WHO. She also issued veiled criticism of U.S. efforts to buy up stocks of any vaccine that might prove effective, vowing the EU will work to provide access to everyone \"irrespective of where they live.\"\n\nMany Europeans point proudly to their national health care systems that not only test but treat COVID-19 for free, unlike the American system, where the virus crisis has only exacerbated income and racial inequalities in obtaining health care.\n\n\"The coronavirus has brutally stripped bare the vulnerability of a country that has been sliding for years,\" wrote Italian author Massimo Gaggi in his new book \"Crack America\" (Broken America), about U.S. problems that long predated COVID-19.\n\nGaggi said he started writing the book last year and thought then that the title would be taken as a provocative wake-up call. Then the virus hit.\n\n\"By March the title wasn't a provocation any longer,\" he said. \"It was obvious.\"\n\nPane reported from Boise, Idaho. AP reporters from around Europe contributed.",

        "authors": [],
        "body": "POINT ROBERTS, Wash. -- The border closure between Canada and the United States has severely impacted Point Roberts, Washington, which is landlocked from the rest of the country.\n\nThe extended coronavirus-induced border closure shut down two border crossings for the town of about 1,300 people, who must commute 25 miles through Canada to get to the rest of Washington state.\n\n\"We really need that border open to survive,\" said Tamra Hansen, who owns the Saltwater Cafe in Point Roberts.\n\nThe economy still depends on the flow of people and resources to and from the border, which closed in March and will remain closed through at least Sept. 21, KING-TV reports.\n\n\"I rely on approximately 90% of my business from the Canadians, that come from the seasonal people,\" Hansen said. \"And we make our money in the summer to get through the winter.\"\n\nThere is no regular ferry or air service to Point Roberts. There have been no confirmed coronavirus cases reported in the town.\n\nIn 2019, 1.4 million people crossed the border into Point Roberts. So far this year, there have been just 217,000 visitors.\n\nGov. Jay Inslee penned a letter to Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau last Friday addressing these concerns. Inslee cited in his letter the need for a \"practical solution to this issue\" and emphasized \"unique hardships\" faced by Point Roberts residents.\n\nIt followed a similar letter to the U.S. Ambassador to Canada co-written by the state's Senators, Patty Murray and Maria Cantwell, and two other Washington state congresspeople.\n\nThe city was created because of a quirk in the Oregon Treaty of 1846 between the United Kingdom and the United States. The two countries agreed to settle their border dispute by dividing their territories in the Pacific Northwest along the 49th parallel. But, that left the small area of Point Roberts on the southern tip of the Tsawwassen peninsula in American control.\n\nDarryl Marquette, an employee at TSB Shipping in Point Roberts, says the shipping company has had boxes meant for Canada backlogged for months because of the border closures.\n\nResidents like Brian Calder, a longtime resident who worked as a city councilor in Vancouver, have advocated for relief, saying that citizens of Point Roberts should be given an exemption to cross the border.\n\n\"Businesses here are down 80% -- down 80%!\" said Calder. \"They can't survive through this winter. Like, it's not possible. I'm really pessimistic about the recovery here.\"\n\nCanada recently ironed out a plan to allow those in Alaska to cross the border at five specific ports using car placards to identify themselves.\n\nHansen worries, though, that the efforts of its citizens and lawmakers will be futile.\n\n\"All the other restaurants have closed down, the golf course is closed,\" Hansen said. \"Quite honestly, I probably should have just closed.\"\n\nThe number of coronavirus infections is thought to be far higher because many people have not been tested, and studies suggest people can be infected with the virus without feeling sick.\n\nFor most people, the new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks. For some -- especially older adults and people with existing health problems -- it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia, and death.",

    "Uncertainty shrouds Tour de France racing against COVID-19": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "PARIS -- Already delayed, the Tour de France sets off Saturday shrouded in uncertainty, flying in the face of the coronavirus pandemic and the imponderable question of how many of the 176 riders will avoid infection and endure three exceptionally tough weeks of racing to reach the finish in Paris.\n\nThat's if the rolling roadshow gets that far.\n\nStaging cycling's premier race when COVID-19 infections are rising again in France represents both a health risk and an embodiment of French President Emmanuel Macron's insistence that the country must learn to function as normally as possible with the virus.\n\nFailure to safely steer the Tour to the cobbles of Paris' Champs-Elys\u00e9es avenue on Sept. 20 could cast further doubt on the feasibility of holding other sporting mega-events, including the Tokyo Olympics postponed to next year, while the coronavirus remains untamed. A key question posed by pushing ahead with the race will be whether it would have been wiser and safer to simply cancel it.\n\n\"Is the Tour adding to the human community experience this year? Or hurting it? That's what needs answering,\" Jonathan Vaughters, boss of the EF Education First team, told The Associated Press. \"If we choose to take on the risk of living life, then I suppose we might have to take the risk of letting events go forward that make life worth living, like the Tour. Is that responsible for the community at large? I think there are many opinions. Many.\"\n\nAmid the pandemic, the usually boisterous celebration of cycling that for decades has drawn packed throngs of cheering roadside spectators promises to be a strange and more subdued affair, moved for the first time in its 117-year history out of its traditional July slot to a September month when many fans will be back at school or at work after summer vacations.\n\nRiders who in more carefree times were habitually besieged by admirers congregating outside their team buses and hotels are expected to be largely sealed off from the outside world, except while out on the roads. Organizers are beseeching spectators to wear face masks, but won't be able to prevent them from turning out to watch as riders speed through their towns and villages, starting in the Mediterranean city of Nice on Saturday. Masks will be obligatory for spectators at stage starts and finishes, and have become mandatory outdoors in a growing number of cities and towns as French infection rates have ticked upward over the summer.\n\n\"If you love the Tour, if you love the champions, wear a mask,\" race director Christian Prudhomme said. \"Not only will this not be the year to collect an autograph, but you shouldn't ask for autographs or ask for selfies. The riders will say 'Hello' from afar. That isn't to say that they're not nice. All in all, it will be like Wimbledon: You don't get (Roger) Federer's autograph in the morning.\"\n\nTo try to keep the coronavirus from infecting the peloton of riders as it negotiates the clockwise, 3,484-kilometer (2,165-mile) route, organizers aim to shield the 22 teams inside what they call a \"race bubble\" -- opened only to riders and staff who have twice tested negative in the race run-up, including this week at a mobile laboratory in Nice.\n\nThe Tour's COVID-19 protocol, detailed in a 17-page document distributed to teams and obtained by the AP, says teams will be expelled if two of their riders or staff test positive for the virus or show strong symptoms of infection. Race organizers say that scenario will be reserved only for two or more cases within a seven-day span. The threat of expulsion is making riders and managers even edgier than usual on the eve of the biggest event on cycling's calendar, anxious not only about infection but also about the reliability of virus testing.\n\nThe German team Bora-Hansgrohe is among those expressing concern, after one if its riders first tested positive and then tested negative Tuesday, prompting the withdrawal of its entire squad from the one-day Bretagne Classic race. Bora team manager Ralph Denk appealed for immediate changes to cycling's testing regimen to combat false positives.\n\n\"We are talking about athletes who have prepared for a race for weeks or months and then might not be allowed to start the event due to a false finding,\" he said.\n\nAs Tour teams arrived in Nice, some were surprised to discover that they were sharing their designated hotel with ordinary guests, raising doubts about how hermetically sealed the race bubble will be.\n\nOn top of COVID-19 concerns, riders will contend with one of the most unrelenting Tour routes in memory, with an usually high total of 29 tough climbs. They'll scale all five of France's mountain ranges: the Alps, the Massif Central, the Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es, the Jura and the Vosges. Uphill slogs come as soon as Stage 2 on Sunday, in a first for the race, with two ascents to 1,500 meters (4,920 feet) and higher.\n\nAn uphill time trial on the penultimate stage before Paris will decide the standings among contenders chasing podium places and the winner's prize of 500,000 euros ($590,000).\n\nDefending champion Egan Bernal from Colombia is the only previous winner in a field stripped of four-time champion Chris Froome and 2018 victor Geraint Thomas, both omitted by Bernal's Ineos team, leaving him as its sole leader. Principal among Bernal's rivals could be Primoz Roglic, a Slovenian who finished 4th in 2018, and Tom Dumoulin, the Dutch runner-up that year who is now Roglic's teammate at Jumbo-Visma.\n\nBut with the pandemic having forced riders to train indoors on stationary bikes and with scant racing in this year of tumult, the readiness of top contenders is one of many uncertainties in a Tour unlike any other.\n\nMore Tour de France coverage: https://apnews.com/TourdeFrance",

        "body": "HERRIMAN, Utah -- Fans wore masks and players drank from their own water bottles instead of sharing Thursday night at what was said to be the first high school football game in the United States since the start of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nThe stands were sold out at 25% capacity at Herriman High School in Utah as the Mustangs took on the Davis High School Darts, news outlets reported. The game was believed to be the first high school matchup on the gridiron as schools across the country debate whether to play this fall amid COVID-19 concerns.\n\nThe home team's marching band wasn't present, though both schools brought cheerleaders to the game. They wore masks before kickoff but, like the players, did not during the game.\n\nTickets were sold online and scanned as fans entered the stadium so the school can carry out contact tracing after the game if necessary, KUTV reported. Fans were asked to keep their masks on for the entire game.\n\nPlayers usually share from a few of the same water bottles, but each had their own as a precaution, the television station reported.\n\nFans were also instructed to leave as soon as the game ended, The Salt Lake Tribune reported. Davis beat Herriman 24-20.\n\nFor most people, the new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia and death.\n\nMore AP sports: https://apnews.com/apf-sports and https://twitter.com/AP -- Sports",

    "VIRUS DIARY: In Hawaii, pandemic, pregnancy and plumerias": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "HONOLULU -- I remember setting out for a late afternoon run and the overpowering perfume of plumerias from the tree outside my house. That's the moment I knew something was up.\n\nNormally, for me, getting a whiff of the bright pink flowers requires plucking one and holding it close. That afternoon, I could smell them from afar.\n\nI had temporarily developed a superhuman sense of smell when I was pregnant with my daughters, now 9 and 7. So as I breathed in the scent of plumerias, the thought crossed my mind: Could I be pregnant?\n\nI brushed it off as part of the longing I've had for years after the birth of my (until now) youngest. Almost daily, I'd daydream about having a third child. I had a miscarriage before my daughters were born, and it felt like our family was incomplete. But I always tell myself it's not practical: We live in one of the most expensive cities in the U.S.\n\nNow is an especially bad time. The pandemic has decimated Hawaii's economy. The state has been forced to pull the welcome mat from throngs of tourists who normally purchase the food my husband sells at farmer's markets.\n\nI'm not pregnant, I insisted as I set off on my usual 3-mile route.\n\nThen I found myself jogging effortlessly into Waikiki, then back up to my home near Honolulu's Punchbowl crater. My running app showed I ran 8.9 miles.\n\nI've read somewhere that thanks to a surge in red blood cells, early pregnancy gives athletes a performance boost. It proved true during my two pregnancies.\n\nThe next weekend: 10.25 miles -- my longest run in more than two years.\n\nSomewhere in between struggling through remote schooling for my daughters, working from a very hot spare bedroom and worrying about the future of my husband's business, the symptoms became harder to ignore -- including cravings for pineapple doused in vinegar and for limu, or seaweed.\n\nDuring low tide, I scrambled over craggy reef at a spot near Diamond Head where my mother took me as a child to gather a type of limu called \"pokpoklo\" in Ilocano, her Filipino language. I rinsed the sand off right there and ate it -- as if my body desperately needed the chewy, dark green, nutrient-rich seaweed.\n\nI knew I should take a test. But I really didn't want to be inside a store, and it seemed awkward to use Target's drive-up service for a home pregnancy test.\n\nOn Mother's Day, my husband couldn't take it anymore. He had to know. I wanted to wait. (Honestly, I just really wanted a mimosa that day.) He went to the store and returned with a test. I had a feeling there would be no mimosas for many months.\n\nI laughed when I saw \"PREGNANT\" in the plastic wand's tiny window. Then I braced myself for a flood of panic because of the pandemic.\n\nBut it never arrived.\n\nI do worry about not knowing what would happen to the baby if I catch the virus, and I fret about precautions to keep our family safe. But mostly, this pregnancy brings a calming hope.\n\nI've accepted that this one will be different. I have a new obstetrician. I may never know what she looks like without a mask, but she has kind eyes. My husband may not be allowed to witness any ultrasounds, but if you've seen one amorphous fetus image you've seen them all. And if a spike in cases forces hospitals to revert to restrictions on visitors, he may not be at my side when it comes time to deliver.\n\nUntil then, I'll keep running. On days when I'm not bowled over with nausea, I instantly feel better and stronger as soon as my feet hit the pavement under that plumeria tree.\n\nVirus Diary, an occasional feature, showcases the coronavirus pandemic through the eyes of Associated Press journalists around the world.

    "Venezuelans fight virus in secret to avoid isolation centers": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "CARACAS, Venezuela -- Velacio Vicu\u00f1a began to cough incessantly and felt feverish.\n\nBut the tire salesman avoided getting a test for the new coronavirus, fearing that if it was positive, soldiers would take him from his home and force him to stay at one of the mandatory isolation centers that the Venezuelan government has set up for people with COVID-19.\n\nThe notorious conditions at those centers, which include hospitals, repurposed gyms and abandoned hotels, have prompted many people who experience symptoms to avoid testing, analysts say. That's making it harder to contain the virus in a country where the health system has already been damaged by years of shortages and mismanagement.\n\nDr. Jose Manuel Olivares, a physician and opposition congressman, described the mandatory centers as a \"repressive measure\" copied from China -- though without China's resources -- that has failed to contain outbreaks in Venezuela. The number of officially reported COVID-19 infections has doubled over the past month to nearly 42,000, with 351 deaths. Independent experts say the real numbers are far higher.\n\nThose confined in the isolation centers complain of filthy conditions, sparse food and being trapped for weeks at a time.\n\nVenezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro acknowledged recently in a televised speech that they \"terrify\" people, but defended them.\n\nHe posted a government-produced video on his Twitter feed in which a woman said that she contracted the virus but got better at one of the isolation centers. \"If you present symptoms go quickly to your nearest health center\" Maduro tweeted. \"If you act early everything is possible.\"\n\nVicu\u00f1a, however, resisted.\n\nThe 63-year-old had felt sick for six days and was having difficulty breathing before he finally felt compelled to go a health center in late July.\n\nBut there was no way to treat him in his hometown of Cabimas -- a city of more than 250,000 people -- so he was taken by ambulance to a hospital in Maracaibo, an hour's drive away.\n\nVicu\u00f1a's relatives say that upon arriving at the University Hospital in Maracaibo, he had to wait for hours in a lobby where dozens of people infected with the virus slept on metallic chairs or on the floor.\n\nVicu\u00f1a was eventually given a hospital bed, though he had to share an oxygen tank with other patients because there were not enough for everyone.\n\nHis relatives said two people died in the room while he was there, and their bodies were not picked up for hours. Frightened, Vicu\u00f1a fled from the hospital, evading soldiers guarding its entrance.\n\nWithout money or a phone, Vicu\u00f1a walked for several blocks, despite his breathing problems, until he managed to hitch a ride back to Cabimas.\n\nRelatives decided not to send him back to the hospital. Instead, they gave him over-the-counter drugs and an oxygen tank and he was cared for by an aunt who is a nurse, said his nephew, Esteban Vicu\u00f1a.\n\n\"Going into a public hospital is like facing the guillotine, especially nowadays with the coronavirus\" the nephew said. \"And private hospitals are very expensive.\"\n\nAfter four days at home, Vicu\u00f1a died from pneumonia and respiratory failure on Aug. 2, according to his death certificate.\n\nDoctors didn't want to come to the home for fear of contagion, so relatives wrapped Vicu\u00f1a's body in sheets and plastic bags, loaded it on a cart pulled by a motorcycle and took it to a hospital so they could get that certificate and he could be buried.\n\nSome didn't have a choice of whether to get a test.\n\nA 20-year-old employee of an accounting firm said a person on his street fell ill and officials gave quick antibody tests to 24 neighbors. He was one of 16 whose results were positive. They were taken to a hotel guarded by soldiers and threatened with arrest if they didn't comply, according to the man, who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisals.\n\nAntibody tests are meant to detect prior infections. To check for active virus, they were then given swab tests. For the young man, that meant a 10-day wait. And because it was positive, he continued to be held despite showing no symptoms.\n\nSpeaking by phone from the room, he said he arrived to find trash on the floor. \"The sheets and pillows on my bed were so old and dirty they looked brown,\" he said, and complained of meager food. Even the lightbulbs didn't work.\n\nA hospital worker who fell ill in June said she asked a doctor to give her a coronavirus test, but he urged against it, noting that if it was positive, she would be taken from her home and separated from her 14-year-old daughter. The doctor told her to go home and call him if she had complications.\n\n\"God protected me\" she said. She stayed home, telling her bosses she had complications related to her pregnancy.\n\nFor more than week, she suffered headaches, a heavy cough and fever. Her daughter also fell ill, though her symptoms weren't as severe. Still, the woman, who asked that he name not be used for fear of losing her job, she said she was glad to have avoided the isolation centers.\n\nShe said that a friend in the military spent 14 days at one of the centers after testing positive. \"He was hungry most of the time because of terrible food,\" she said, and was also very cold, because he had to sleep in a hospital robe and was not allowed to use his clothes.\"",

        "body": "HANOI, Vietnam -- Vietnam has confirmed 21 more coronavirus cases linked to three hospitals in the central city of Da Nang, the health ministry said Monday. The country, which had lifted many restrictions after more than three months with no local infections, now has 196 cases in the new outbreak.\n\nFifteen of the new cases were in Da Nang, Vietnam's most popular beach destination, while six others were in neighboring Quang Nam province. All were patients or relatives of patients at the three hospitals in Da Nang, where the outbreak emerged, the ministry said.\n\nVietnam had been widely praised for its success in controlling its initial outbreak of the coronavirus, with no reported cases of local transmission for 99 days. But nine days ago, a case was confirmed at a Da Nang hospital.\n\nThe virus has now spread to six parts of the country, including three large cities, forcing authorities to reimpose virus restrictions. Officials have confirmed three deaths, the country's first from the virus.\n\nThe health ministry said 40% of the new cases show no symptoms.\n\n\"The asymptomatic cases are a danger for transmission in the community,\" acting health minister Nguyen Thanh Long said. \"Therefore, we must not overlook any suspected cases.\"\n\nOn Monday, the army deployed a mobile lab truck to Da Nang to increase testing capacity in the city.\n\nDuring a government meeting on Monday, Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc urged all provinces to control the outbreak in early August, calling it a \"crucial time.\"\n\n\"Each family must be a fortress and each citizen must be a warrior to keep the outbreak from spreading widely in the community,\" Phuc said.\n\nHe urged residents to be vigilant to help control the virus and ensure health security. But he said there shouldn't be a rush to close businesses because health should to be balanced with economic security.",

        "body": "HELENA, Mont. -- The Crow Tribe in Montana ordered its members to lock down for two weeks beginning Friday as tribal leaders moved to slow a sharp spike in coronavirus cases and deaths on yet another reservation in the country.\n\nCrow Tribe Chairman Alvin Not Afraid said the lockdown is necessary because a stay-at-home order in effect since mid-March has been ineffective.\n\n\"We cannot afford to risk our future and the risks are just too great for the Crow people,\" Not Afraid said.\n\nBig Horn County, where the reservation is located, is on pace to record more confirmed virus cases in August than the previous two months combined. The county reported 85 new cases during the first week of August, compared to 249 in July and 44 in June.\n\nSeven of its 12 confirmed virus deaths have been recorded in the past 10 days.\n\nThe figures include cases on the reservation but the tribe doesn't publicly release case counts.\n\nNative Americans have been disproportionately affected by COVID-19 across the country, with major outbreaks from Arizona to South Dakota triggering similar lockdowns. The Navajo Nation that covers parts of Arizona, New Mexico and Utah has tallied 468 confirmed deaths from the virus and has ordered another lockdown this weekend.\n\nIn Montana, Native Americans make up 7% of residents but have seen 15% of confirmed virus cases and 36% of deaths as of July 26, the state says.\n\nThe Crow Tribe lockdown includes a nightly curfew between 8 p.m. and 6 a.m. that will remain in effect until Aug. 21. Essential businesses and emergency medical facilities will be allowed to remain open, but all other public gatherings will be banned.\n\nThe tribe also said it would implement checkpoints to monitor non-resident traffic and inform non-residents that they must leave the reservation that covers more than 3,500 square miles (9,100 square kilometers) in southeastern Montana, most of it in Big Horn County.\n\nThe order requires all school students to remain at home until the administration determines it is safe for students to re-enter school. The school year in Montana is set to begin in three weeks.\n\nBig Horn County officials said 3% of the county's population has been infected with the virus, more than three times the rate in the second-most impacted county in Montana.\n\nOne-fifth of Native Americans who contract the virus in Montana require hospitalization, compared to only 10% of people who identify as white, according to the state.\n\nCounty officials said the reservation's single hospital has limited resources, which could mean some COVID-19 patients might need to seek care outside the reservation.\n\nMany Native American families live in multi-generational homes, putting older and more vulnerable people at a greater risk of developing serious symptoms, county spokeswoman Rhonda Johnson said.\n\nThe virus is also spreading rapidly in the county because many residents of the reservation go on long drives together and cannot maintain social distancing, Johnson said. She also said large gatherings, involving family reunions and sporting events, have been occurring despite the stay-at-home order.\n\nThe vast majority of people who are diagnosed with COVID-19 recover. For some people it causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough.\n\nIn northern Montana, Rocky Boy's Indian Reservation confirmed two COVID-19 related deaths on Thursday. On Friday, tribal leaders announced a 72-hour shutdown on the reservation after a case was identified that they said could result in a cluster outbreak.\n\nChippewa Cree Tribe Chairman Harlan Baker said the shutdown will allow tracers to identify close contacts of the person in the new case.\n\nIris Samuels is a corps member for the Associated Press/Report for America Statehouse News Initiative.

    "Virus testing in the US is dropping, even as deaths mount": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "MATTHEW PERRONE, NICKY FORSTER and MICHELLE LIU Associated Press\n\nU.S. testing for the coronavirus is dropping even as infections remain high and the death toll rises by more than 1,000 a day, a worrisome trend that officials attribute largely to Americans getting discouraged over having to wait hours to get a test and days or weeks to find out the results.\n\nAn Associated Press analysis found that the number of tests per day slid 3.6% over the past two weeks to 750,000, with the count falling in 22 states. That includes places like Alabama, Mississippi, Missouri and Iowa where the percentage of positive tests is high and continuing to climb, an indicator that the virus is still spreading uncontrolled.\n\nAmid the crisis, some health officials are calling for the introduction of a different type of test that would yield results in a matter of minutes and would be cheap and simple enough for millions of Americans to test themselves -- but would also be less accurate.\n\n\"There's a sense of desperation that we need to do something else,\" said Dr. Ashish Jha, director of Harvard's Global Health Institute.\n\nWidespread testing is considered essential to containing the outbreak as the U.S. approaches a mammoth 5 million confirmed infections and more than 156,000 deaths out of over 700,000 worldwide.\n\nTesting demand is expected to surge again this fall, when schools reopen and flu season hits, most likely outstripping supplies and leading to new delays and bottlenecks.\n\nSome of the decline in testing over the past few weeks was expected after backlogged commercial labs urged doctors to concentrate on their highest-risk patients. But some health and government officials are seeing growing public frustration and waning demand.\n\nIn Iowa, state officials are reporting less interest in testing, despite ample supplies. The state's daily testing rate peaked in mid-July but has declined 40% in the last two weeks.\n\n\"We have the capacity. Iowans just need to test,\" Gov. Kim Reynolds said last week.\n\nJessica Moore of rural Newberry, South Carolina, said that after a private lab lost her COVID-19 test results in mid-July, she had to get re-tested at a pop-up site organized by the state.\n\nMoore and her husband arrived early on a Saturday morning at the site, a community center, where they waited for two hours for her test. Moore watched in the rear-view mirror as people drove up, saw the long line of cars, and then turned around and left.\n\n\"If people have something to do on a Saturday and they want to get tested, they're not going to wait for two hours in the South Carolina heat for a test, especially if they're not symptomatic,\" Moore said.\n\nBefore traveling from Florida to Delaware last month, Laura DuBose Schumacher signed up to go to a drive-up testing site in Orlando with her husband. They were given a one-hour window in which to arrive.\n\nThey got there at the start of the window, but after 50 minutes it looked as if the wait would be another hour. Others who had gone through the line told them that they wouldn't get their results until five days later, a Monday, at the earliest. They were planning to travel the next day, so they gave up.\n\n\"Monday would have been pointless, so we left the line,\" Schumacher said.\n\nThe number of confirmed infections in the U.S. has topped 4.7 million, with new cases running at nearly 60,000 a day on average, down from more than 70,000 in the second half of July.\n\nU.S. testing is built on highly sensitive molecular tests that detect the genetic code of the coronavirus. Although the test is considered the gold standard for accuracy, experts increasingly say the country's overburdened lab system is incapable of keeping pace with the outbreak and producing results within two or three days, the time frame crucial to isolating patients and containing the virus.\n\n\"They're doing as good a job as they possibly can do, but the current system will not allow them to keep up with the demand,\" said Mara Aspinall of Arizona State University's College of Health Solutions.\n\nTesting delays have led researchers at Harvard and elsewhere to propose a new approach using so-called antigen tests -- rapid technology already used to screen for flu, strep throat and other common infections. Instead of detecting the virus itself, such tests look for viral proteins, or antigens, which are generally considered a less accurate measure of infection.\n\nA number of companies are studying COVID-19 antigen tests in which you spit on a specially coated strip of paper, and if you are infected, it changes color. Experts say the speed and widespread availability of such tests would more than make up for their lower precision.\n\nWhile no such tests for the coronavirus are on the U.S. market, experts say the technology is simple and the hurdles are more regulatory than technical. The Harvard researchers say production could quickly be scaled into the millions.\n\nA proposal from the Harvard researchers calls for the federal government to distribute $1 saliva-based antigen tests to all Americans so that they can test themselves regularly, perhaps even daily.\n\nEven with accuracy as low as 50%, researchers estimate the paper strip tests would uncover five times more COVID-19 cases than the current laboratory-based approach, which federal officials estimate catches just 1 in 10 infections.\n\nBut the approach faces resistance in Washington, where federal regulators have required at least 80% accuracy for new COVID-19 tests.\n\nTo date, the Food and Drug Administration has allowed only two COVID-19 antigen tests to enter the market. Those tests require a nasal swab supervised by a health professional and can only be run on specialized machines found at hospitals, doctor's offices and clinics.\n\nAlso, because of the risk of false negatives, doctors may need to confirm a negative result with a genetic test when patients have possible symptoms of COVID-19.\n\nOn Tuesday, the governors of Maryland, Virginia, Louisiana and three other states announced an agreement with the Rockefeller Foundation to purchase more than 3 million of the FDA-cleared antigen tests, underscoring the growing interest in the technology.\n\nWhen asked about introducing cheaper, paper-based tests, the government's \"testing czar,\" Adm. Brett Giroir, warned that their accuracy could fall as low as 20% to 30%.\n\n\"I don't think that would do a service to the American public of having something that is wrong seven out of 10 times,\" Giroir said last week. \"I think that could be catastrophic.\"\n\nAssociated Press writers Brian Witte in Annapolis, Md., David Pitt in Des Moines, Iowa, and Mike Schneider in Orlando, Fla., contributed to this story.

    "Virus-proofing NFL facilities is a tall, masked task": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "The captivation and celebration of the NFL have long stemmed from the speed, strategy, strength and teamwork that make the game go.\n\nFootball is just as much a sport of pattern and detail, too, never more than at training camps around the league in the time of COVID-19.\n\nLike the defense stiffening at the goal line late in the fourth quarter, the NFL has implemented a wide array of health protocols designed to keep the virus from wrecking the 2020 season for this cultural institution that was a $16 billion business before the pandemic.\n\n\"There are so many steps along the way. You've got to fill out your questionnaire on our app when you wake up in the morning,\" Minnesota Vikings tight end Kyle Rudolph said. \"Then when you come in, you sanitize your hands, do your temperature check, get your COVID tests, put on your lanyard, grab your tracker. So there's just a lot of things that have now been added to your routine.\"\n\nDaily testing, naturally, is the fulcrum of this aggressive virus-proofing around team facilities. NFL Network reported that, of 109,075 coronavirus tests conducted on players, coaches and team employees through Tuesday, the rate of positive tests has been 0.46% overall and 0.81% for players.\n\nSince training camps began three weeks ago, 108 players have been placed on COVID-19 reserve lists by their respective teams -- according to an Associated Press review of the league's daily transaction logs -- and 81 of those players were subsequently returned to active status on the roster. There are more than 2,600 players currently employed across the 32 clubs.\n\nLanding on the COVID-19 reserve list does not mean a player has the virus. The category was created for a player who either tests positive for COVID-19 or who has been quarantined after having been in close contact with an infected person or persons. By agreement between the NFL and the NFL Players Association, clubs are not permitted to disclose whether a player is positive for COVID-19 or simply in preventative quarantine.\n\nWearing masks, of course, is a vital part of the equation.\n\nAfter leaving the testing trailer and entering the building, players and staffers must pass the temperature check. The tablet-like device won't even perform the thermal scan if the person is not wearing a face covering.\n\n\"It's an adjustment. You used to check phone, key, wallet. Now it's phone, key, wallet, mask, proximity locator,\" Vikings linebacker Eric Kendricks said. \"But they explained to us the reason behind it. If someone is to get infected, heaven forbid, if we're close to those people for a certain amount of time, those devices will allow us to quarantine effectively if that's the case. So there's a reason behind the madness.\"\n\nPassing the symptom questionnaire and the temperature check, with the nasal swab performed in between, then takes the employee to another level of high-tech: the proximity tracker.\n\nThe device, which resembles a smart watch, produces audible and visual warnings to help maximize social distancing and keep employees not required to interact with players apart from those who must. The tracker can also provide instant reports for contact tracing in case of a positive test. The devices are worn during practice but turned in at the end of the work day before employees depart the building.\n\n\"It's weird when someone tells you you've been too close for too long,\" Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes said, \"but it's necessary. We're going to try to do our part for the community and make sure we can keep playing the game we love.\"\n\nThe bulk of the virus-proofing protocols are uniform across the league, with each team applying its own twists to fit the facility.\n\nThe Miami Dolphins installed new air purification devices throughout their facility. The Tennessee Titans had 4-feet-long dividers placed between each player's cubicle in the locker room, making the spaces look a little like voting booths. Vikings players can order meals via smart phone app to reduce time spent in the cafeteria.\n\nThe Carolina Panthers have made clever use of Bank of America Stadium to their virus-fighting advantage. All of the 80-plus players have their own temporary luxury suite at the 73,000-seat venue, expected to retreat there alone for lunch or during the down time between practices and meetings in the name of social distancing.\n\nThere's almost no end to the precautions that can be taken. Narrow hallways have become one-way paths. Couches have been removed. Even shower heads in the locker room have been taken out to increase spacing. Electric static sprayers are being used for surface disinfecting. Seating capacity in meeting rooms has been significantly reduced.\n\n\"We're so spaced out that it can feel like you're not all in the same room together, even more than a Zoom, even though you are sitting in the same room,\" Titans quarterback Ryan Tannehill said.\n\nIn an intense contact sport in which participants are bound to breathe on each other often, the work has to be done in the building during the day and at home at night.\n\n\"Everyone is going to do the absolute best they can do, knowing that it's impossible to totally eliminate the risk,\" said Vikings head athletic trainer and vice president of sports medicine Eric Sugarman, who is the team's infection control officer. He tested positive for COVID-19 last month.\n\nAs far as the tall task of making it through a full season, well, the fiercely competitive nature of its participants ought to work in pro football's favor.\n\n\"It's going to come down to whoever handles the situation the best. That's who's going to be at the top at the end, and I feel like we're taking all the right steps,\" Green Bay Packers defensive tackle Kenny Clark said. \"You walk in here, you get tested, there's sanitizers everywhere. You know, the masks, everything that we're doing, they're serious about getting us ready to be able to play and keeping us healthy.\"\n\nAP Pro Football Writers Teresa M.

        "authors": [],
        "body": "CINCINNATI -- Joey Votto hit a two-run, go-ahead homer, Nick Castellanos also connected and the Cincinnati Reds beat Cleveland 3-2 Monday night as the Indians played again without ill manager Terry Francona.\n\nSonny Gray shook off a tough start to the game to complete six strong innings, and Cincinnati ended a six-game home losing streak against their in-state rival.\n\nVotto snapped an 0-for-11 skid when he followed Shogo Akiyama's leadoff single in the sixth with a no-doubt shot off Zach Plesac (0-1). The 2010 NL MVP sat out a doubleheader Sunday after self-reporting coronavirus symptoms, but he was cleared to return to the lineup Monday and hit his third homer following a negative test.\n\nGrounds crew seated behind first base cheered and played instruments -- some provided by Votto -- as he rounded the bases, and Votto pointed to the fan section after touching home plate.\n\nFrancona missed his second straight game and the first of four straight Reds-Indians games while dealing in Cleveland with a gastrointestinal condition not believed to be connected to COVID-19. First base and catching coach Sandy Alomar managed in Francona's absence.\n\nThe series shifts on Wednesday to Cleveland for the final two games.\n\nThe Indians led 2-0 after two innings, scoring as many runs off Gray as they scored while losing three straight over the weekend in Minnesota.\n\nGray (3-0) gave up two hits in the first inning, including Francisco Lindor's third home run of the season, a two-out line drive into the right field seats for a 1-0 lead.\n\nGray's control problems led to Cleveland's second-inning run. Oscar Mercado singled softly to center field, advanced to second on Gray's errant pickoff throw and came around to score on two wild pitches.\n\nGray retired 12 straight batters before Lindor singled with one out in the fifth. He allowed four hits and two runs, one earned, with two walks and eight strikeouts.\n\nMichael Lorenzen pitched a 1-2-3 seventh, Nate Jones struck out Lindor with two outs and the tying run at third in the eighth, and Raisel Iglesias pitched the ninth for the Reds' first 2020 save.\n\nPlesac extended his shutout streak to 11 innings over two starts this season before Castellanos lined a shot into the left-center seats for his fifth homer leading off the fourth inning. Plesac allowed four hits and three runs with one walk and six strikeouts in seven innings.\n\nTRAINING ROOM\n\nIndians: C Roberto P\u00e9rez (right shoulder strain) will be re-examined Tuesday ... OF Delino Deshields (unavailable) and OF Tyler Naquin (hairline fracture of right big toe) had scheduled game activity at Cleveland's alternate training site rained out Monday. They'll try again Tuesday.\n\nReds: CF Nick Senzel was scratched from the original starting lineup with a sprained left ring finger. He was hurt sliding into second base on Sunday in Detroit.\n\nUP NEXT\n\nIndians: RHP Shane Bieber (2-0) has piled up a combined 14 scoreless innings over his first two 2020 starts, striking out 27.\n\nReds: RHP Tyler Mahle starts on Tuesday in place of LHP Wade Miley, who went on the 10-day injured list on Friday with a left groin injury.\n\n-- -- -- More AP MLB: https://apnews.com/MLB and https://twitter.com/AP -- Sports",

    "What virus? At GOP's convention, pandemic is largely ignored": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "WASHINGTON -- It was a scene from a bygone era: Vice President Mike Pence shaking hands with and fist-bumping audience members who rushed forward, shoulder to shoulder, to greet him and the president after Pence's speech at the Republican National Convention.\n\nNo one appeared concerned about social distancing at Wednesday night's gathering at Fort McHenry in Baltimore. Few wore masks. Some people told reporters they had not been tested for the coronavirus.\n\nExpect an even more striking scene Thursday night, when more than 1,000 people assemble on the South Lawn of the White House for President Donald Trump's renomination acceptance speech. That's an eye-popping crowd in a time of a a global pandemic that has forced the cancellation of large gatherings, from sports events and concerts to weddings and funerals.\n\nAs Trump has tried to push past a virus that has tanked the economy and threatened his reelection, GOP organizers have worked to stage a convention that puts the pandemic in the rear view mirror and highlights the nation's progress. But 42,000 new cases were reported on Wednesday and U.S. deaths have topped 2,700 since the week began.\n\nFew convention speakers have made reference to the virus; others have discussed it in the past tense.\n\n\"It was awful. Health and economic impacts were tragic,\" said White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow on the convention's second night. \"But presidential leadership came swiftly and effectively with an extraordinary rescue for health and safety to successfully fight the COVID virus.\"\n\nThe display stands in jarring contrast with the Democrats, who dispensed with audiences at live speeches. At their convention last week, presidential nominee Joe Biden and running mate Kamala Harris wore masks outside even as they stood apart from one another.\n\n\"Is coronavirus gone? Is COVID-19 gone?\" Biden campaign senior adviser Symone Sanders asked Thursday on a call with reporters. \"I didn't see any masks or social distancing happening during the vice president's speech last night. So, the reality is, there is a lack of leadership here.\"\n\nTo be sure, the Republicans' event looked very different from past conventions. Because of the virus, the GOP canceled what would have been mass gatherings drawing thousands to North Carolina or Florida, and they have been consulting with a coronavirus adviser. Indoor speeches were delivered without audiences. But outdoor events have featured guests.\n\nThat included a Rose Garden address Tuesday by first lady Melania Trump, who spoke about the toll of virus, and Pence's speech Wednesday, delivered in front of about 100 people, including Pence's family and wounded veterans.\n\nChairs were positioned at Fort McHenry with some space between them, but many in the crowd rushed to the front at the end to greet Pence, Trump and their wives. While the president and first lady appeared to keep their distance, Pence was seen shaking hands, exchanging fist bumps, and at one point accepting a small gift from an audience member. Few in the crowd were seen wearing masks.\n\nThe White House and campaign refused to say how many in attendance had been tested Wednesday or would be Thursday. White House spokesman Judd Deere said only that \"those in close proximity to the president and vice president are tested.\"\n\nGuidance sent to invited guests for Thursday's event from the Republican National Committee makes clear that masks will not be required on the South Lawn, but are required upon arrival and in security screening areas and encouraged in \"high traffic areas including restrooms and hospitality spaces.\"\n\nGuests have also been asked to \"practice social distancing whenever possible\" and stay home if they're displaying coronavirus symptoms, have recently tested positive for the virus or have been in recent close contact with someone who has.\n\nBut the refusal to abide by other widely accepted mitigation recommendations -- including those promoted by the president's own heath agencies -- confounded public health experts watching at home.\n\n\"The president and the entire RNC, they had an opportunity to show the seriousness of this pandemic, which is the worst public health crisis in our lifetimes, and it's extremely concerning that only did they not discuss precautions like wearing masks and social distancing, they are going against all of our public health guidance,\" said Dr. Leana Wen, an emergency physician and visiting professor of health policy at The George Washington University and the former health commissioner of Baltimore.\n\nWen noted that mass gatherings pose the highest risk for transmitting the disease, and expressed concern both that Baltimore could see an increase in cases and that the display might lead viewers to believe that, they, too, can gather in groups and not wear masks.\n\nRobert Blendon, a professor of health policy and political analysis at Harvard University, said the event was focused on a different goal: bolstering Trump's reelection chances.\n\n\"The president and the vice president are very aware that if people are going back to work and their kids are actually in school and they feel somewhat safe, the incumbent will have an advantage in the election,\" he said. \"They're trying to do things to say that the risk of COVID is much less than public health and other people are saying.\"\n\nEven if the convention tries to stress progress made against the virus, the threat remains very much on the minds of some White House officials. Aides have been warily watching the calendar, concerned that Labor Day weekend activities might trigger another spike in infections, just as they believe happened on Memorial Day, according to three White House and campaign officials who were not authorized to publicly discuss private conversations and spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\nThey are also monitoring the impact of large protests following the shooting of Jacob Blake in Wisconsin.\n\nAssociated Press writers Jonathan Lemire, Zeke Miller and Will Weissert contributed to this report.",
