Sign up here.\n\n\"Shark Tank\" star Daymond John was reportedly among the people who tried to sell N95 protective masks to the state of Florida at an inflated price during the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nFlorida, like many states, has been desperate for protective gear for health care workers battling the COVID-19 pandemic. Gov. Ron DeSantis previously called the hunt for N95 masks specifically \"shady as hell\" and took steps to ensure that the state's Division of Emergency Management was free to broker deals to get the equipment as soon as possible.\n\nAccording to the Miami Herald, John, the \"Shark Tank\" star and CEO of the Shark Group, approached the state in March, saying he could get Florida 1 million masks from China at a rate of $7 per mask, an increase from the less than $2 they usually sell for and one of the highest prices the state was willing to pay. With deals for masks falling through left-and-right, Jared Moskowitz, director of the Florida Department of Emergency Management, agreed to John's terms.\n\nTIPS ON TALKING CORONAVIRUS WITH YOUR KIDS\n\n\"This was not somebody off the street, this was Daymond John,'' Moskowitz told the outlet. \"He came to me and said, 'I've been in the clothing business. I have connections with factories in China.'\"\n\nUnfortunately, the deal fell through on April 13. It's unclear at this time why the deal fell through or where the $7 price point came from in the first place. However, it is reportedly now among the many deals being scrutinized by 3M, the company that makes the N95 masks, which has a team of lawyers investigating potentially fraudulent vendors and inflated price points throughout the U.S. and Canada.\n\nNeither representatives for the Shark Group nor 3M immediately responded to Fox News' request for comment.\n\nHOW CORONAVIRUS DIFFERS FROM FLU: SYMPTOMS TO WATCH FOR\n\nThe Miami Herald notes that Moskowitz and his staff spent much of March frantically trying to sign $600 million in no-bid purchase orders with dozens of vendors, some of whom weren't authorized by 3M to sell the masks, when it became clear the state's health care system was in desperate need amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Unfortunately, dealing with unconventional vendors led to many of these deals falling through, including John's.\n\nAll the money for deals like the one between the state and the Shark Group was not given directly to the vendors. Instead, the state protected itself by using the law firm Foley & Lardner to hold the money in an escrow account. The seller and buyer then agreed to hold these funds there until such time as the masks were delivered and confirmed to be of good quality before money was paid out. As a result, the state neither lost money nor paid anyone who didn't deliver the goods.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"The reason we decided to go through an escrow agent is more and more vendors wanted money upfront because we were identifying potential fraud in the marketplace,'' Moskowitz said. \"We used the legal escrow process to protect the state. It has worked in every case. If the vendor didn't deliver the product, the money was returned through the escrow agent.\"",

This presentation is known as \"silent hypoxia\" and it's causing some people to arrive at the hospital in worse health than they realize.\n\nIn a recent New York Times op-ed, Richard Levitan, an emergency room doctor who invented a procedure for teaching intubation -- the insertion of breathing tubes that many COVID-19 p patients require, explained that there might be a way around this issue.\n\nCHALLENGE OF TRACKING COVID-19'S 'STEALTHY SPREAD' REVEALED IN NEW STUDY\n\nSilent hypoxia progressing rapidly to respiratory failure explains cases of COVID-19 patients dying suddenly despite not feeling short of breath.\n\nAs Levitan notes in his op-ed, one reason COVID-19 is putting a strain on our public health system is the severity of lung injury patients have when they arrive in emergency rooms. Unfortunately, many patients aren't arriving in hospitals until their condition has already worsened, and then they often need to be put on ventilators.\n\nThat can lead to a shortage of those machines -- and doctors having to make untenable decisions about rationing of care.\n\n\"There is a way we could identify more patients who have Covid pneumonia sooner and treat them more effectively -- and it would not require waiting for a coronavirus test at a hospital or doctor's office,\" Levitan writes in the Times. \"It requires detecting silent hypoxia early through a common medical device that can be purchased without a prescription at most pharmacies: a pulse oximeter.\"\n\nPulse oximeters, which are carried by most EMTs, are small devices placed on a person's fingertip; with the press of a button, they display oxygen saturation and pulse rate.\n\nCORONAVIRUS HAS MUTATED INTO AT LEAST 30 DIFFERENT STRAINS, STUDY FINDS\n\nAccording to Levitan, the small devices saved the lives of two physicians he knows.\n\n\"Widespread pulse oximetry screening for Covid pneumonia -- whether people check themselves on home devices or go to clinics or doctors' offices -- could provide an early warning system for the kinds of breathing problems associated with Covid pneumonia,\" the doctor writes.",

        "authors": [],
        "body": "As doctors see more and more COVID-19 patients, they are noticing an odd trend: Patients whose blood oxygen saturation levels are exceedingly low but who are hardly gasping for breath.\n\nThese patients are quite sick, but their disease does not present like typical acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), a type of lung failure known from the 2003 outbreak of the SARS coronavirus and other respiratory diseases. Their lungs are clearly not effectively oxygenating the blood, but these patients are alert and feeling relatively well, even as doctors debate whether to intubate them by placing a breathing tube down the throat.\n\nThe concern with this presentation, called \"silent hypoxia,\" is that patients are showing up to the hospital in worse health than they realize. But there might be a way to prevent that, according to a New York Times Op-Ed by emergency department physician Richard Levitan. If sick patients were given oxygen-monitoring devices called pulse oximeters to monitor their symptoms at home, they might be able to seek medical treatment sooner, and ultimately avoid the most invasive treatments.\n\nRelated: Are ventilators being overused on COVID-19 patients?\n\n\"This is not a new phenomenon,\" said Dr. Marc Moss, the division head of Pulmonary Sciences and Critical Care Medicine at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus. There are other conditions in which patients are extremely low on oxygen but don't feel any sense of suffocation or lack of air, Moss told Live Science. For example, some congenital heart defects cause circulation to bypass the lungs, meaning the blood is poorly oxygenated.\n\nHowever, the increased understanding that people with COVID-19 may show up with these atypical coronavirus symptoms is changing the way doctors treat them.\n\nNormal blood-oxygen levels are around 97%, Moss said, and it becomes worrisome when the numbers drop below 90%. At levels below 90%, the brain may not get sufficient oxygen, and patients might start experiencing confusion, lethargy or other mental disruptions. As levels drop into the low 80s or below, the danger of damage to vital organs rises.\n\nHowever, patients may not feel in as dire straits as they are. A lot of coronavirus patients show up at the hospital with oxygen saturations in the low 80s but look fairly comfortable and alert, said Dr. Astha Chichra, a critical care physician at Yale School of Medicine. They might be slightly short of breath, but not in proportion to the lack of oxygen they're receiving.\n\nThere are three major reasons people feel a sense of dyspnea, or labored breathing, Moss said. One is something obstructing the airway, which is not an issue in COVID-19. Another is when carbon dioxide builds up in the blood. A good example of that phenomenon is during exercise: Increased metabolism means more carbon dioxide production, leading to heavy breathing to exhale all that CO2.\n\nRelated: Could genetics explain why some COVID-19 patients fare worse than others?\n\nA third phenomenon, particularly important in respiratory disease, is decreased lung compliance. Lung compliance refers to the ease with which the lungs move in and out with each breath. In pneumonia and in ARDS, fluids in the lungs fill microscopic air sacs called alveoli, where oxygen from the air diffuses into the blood. As the lungs fill with fluid, they become more taut and stiffer, and the person's chest and abdominal muscles must work harder to expand and contract the lungs in order to breathe.\n\nThis happens in severe COVID-19, too. But in some patients, the fluid buildup is not enough to make the lungs particularly stiff. Their oxygen levels may be low for an unknown reason that doesn't involve fluid buildup -- and one that doesn't trigger the body's need to gasp for breath.\n\nExactly what is going on is yet unknown.\n\nChichra said that some of these patients might simply have fairly healthy lungs, and thus have the lung compliance (or elasticity) -- so not much resistance in the lungs when a person inhales and exhales -- to feel like they are not short on air even as their lungs become less effective at diffusing oxygen into the blood. Others, especially geriatric patients, might have comorbidities that mean they live with low oxygen levels regularly, so they're used to feeling somewhat lethargic or easily winded, she said.\n\nRelated: 11 surprising facts about the respiratory system\n\nIn the New York Times Op-Ed on the phenomenon, Levitan wrote that the lack of gasping might be due to a particular phase of the lung failure caused by COVID-19. When the lung failure first starts, he wrote, the virus may attack the lung cells that make surfactant, a fatty substance in the alveoli, which reduces surface tension in the lungs, increasing their compliance. Without surfactant, the increased surface tension causes the alveoli to deflate, but if they are not filled with fluid,, they won't feel stiff, Levitan wrote. This could explain how the alveoli fail to oxygenate the blood without the patient noticing the need to gasp for more air.\n\nThe virus might also create hypoxia by damaging the blood vessels that lead to the lungs, Moss said. Normally, when a patient has pneumonia, the tiny blood vessels around the fluid-filled areas of the lungs constrict (called hypoxic vasoconstriction): Sensing a lack of oxygen in the damaged areas, the body shunts blood to other, healthier parts of the lungs. Because pneumonia fills the lungs with fluid, the person will feel starved for air and gasp for breath. But their vessels send the blood to the least-damaged parts of the lung, so their blood oxygenation stays relatively high, given the damage.\n\nIn COVID-19, that balance may be off. The lungs aren't very fluid-filled and stiff, but the blood vessels don't constrict and reroute blood to the least-damaged spots. People feel free to inhale and exhale without resistance, but the blood is still trying to pick up oxygen at alveoli that are damaged and inefficient.\n\n\"What is most likely happening here is that hypoxic vasoconstriction is lost for some reason, so that blood does flow to places where there is some damage to the lungs,\" Moss said. It could also be a combination of factors, he added.\n\n\"I'm not going to say the alveoli are normal and the surfactant is normal, but when someone has hypoxia out of proportion to what you would see in the lung, that makes lung specialists think there is a problem on the blood vessel side,\" he said.\n\nIn the New York Times, Levitan suggests that patients who are not sick enough to be admitted to the hospital be given pulse oximeters, devices that clamp to the finger to measure blood oxygenation. If their oxygenation numbers start to fall, it could be an early warning sign to seek medical treatment.\n\n\"It's an intriguing possibility,\" Moss said.\n\nEven without widespread at-home oxygen monitoring, doctors are now starting to differentiate between patients who have low oxygen levels and who are working hard to breathe, and those who have low oxygen levels but are breathing without distress, Chichra said. Early in the pandemic, knowing that COVID-19 patients can start to fail quickly, physicians tended to put people with hypoxia on ventilators quickly. Now, Chichra said, it's becoming clear that patients who aren't struggling for breath often recover without being intubated. They may do well with oxygen delivered via nasal tube or a non-rebreather mask, which fits over the face to deliver high concentrations of oxygen.\n\nHypoxic patients who are breathing quickly and laboriously, with elevated heart rates, tend to be the ones who need mechanical ventilation or non-invasive positive-pressure ventilation, Chichra said. The latter is a method that uses a face mask instead of a tube down the throat, but also uses pressure to push air into the lungs.\n\n\"The key difference we've found between these folks is that the people who are working hard to breathe are the folks who usually need to be intubated,\" Chichra said.",

Sign up here.\n\nA California plastic surgeon and co-host of the talk show \"The Doctors\" is opening up about his battle with the novel coronavirus.\n\nIn January, Dr. Andrew Ordon attended a conference in Seattle, shaking hands and greeting some colleagues with hugs. Upon his return from the convention, he fell ill.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR FULL CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE\n\nThough the convention preceded the U.S. coronavirus epidemic as we know it today, Ordon was skeptical of his flu-like symptoms, immediately isolating away from family and friends in the Californian desert area of Rancho Mirage, located near Palm Springs.\n\n\"I did a little self-diagnosing. I know my body. I felt that things were different,\" Ordon told Fox News.\n\nSevere night sweats, chills, and a \"deep, centralized\" cough that the doctor said he's \"never had before in [his] life\" consumed Ordon for a week to 10 days.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"I was scared. I wasn't sure what I had, and certain distinct symptoms presented themselves,\" Ordon recalled.\n\nAs he treated himself symptomatically in self-isolation, however, his condition began to improve.\n\nAntibody testing on April 27 revealed the presence of IgG antibodies, possibly granting the doctor a certain degree of immunity.\n\nWhen a virus attacks, the body first produces IgM antibodies which indicate active or recent infection, according to Fleur Women's Health in Rancho Mirage, where Ordon said he received his antibody test. IgG antibodies develop later, which often indicate a past infection, as in Ordon's case.\n\nFDA OKS EMERGENCY APPROVAL FOR CORONAVIRUS TEST KIT CREATED BY MASSACHUSETTS-BASED COMPANY\n\nThe California doctor is over the age of 65, which presents a higher risk for more severe illness with a COVID-19 infection. Fortunately, however, he has no underlying health conditions and was able to bounce back naturally at home. Ordon credited healthy eating habits, adequate sleep, exercise, self-isolation and good hygiene in making the difference in his recovery.\n\nDue to Ordon's diligent isolation practices, the doctor said he thinks he prevented the spread of infection to family, friends, patients and other colleagues at CBS's \"The Doctors.\"\n\n\"It's so clear why isolating is so important,\" he said, adding, \"I feel pretty good.\"\n\nMOST WHO RECOVER FROM CORONAVIRUS CARRY ANTIBODIES, STUDY FINDS\n\nIn time, Ordon will resume plastic and reconstructive surgeries in Beverly Hills and Rancho Mirage.\n\n\"The Doctors\" will premiere a segment on May 8 about Ordon's experience and recovery from coronavirus.

Initially sent home for self-quarantine, his condition worsened and within days, he had 104.9-degree fever. He was admitted to the hospital on March 18. Doctors at Hackensack University Medical Center in New Jersey intubated and ventilated the IT consultant on March 20.\n\nNumerous therapies, including antimalarials and antibiotics, failed, and Goldsmith's family and members of the medical community made a desperate plea for the experimental coronavirus treatment remdesivir. A \"Physician's Petition\" was also launched calling on President Trump to help Goldsmith get hold of remdesivir, which is developed by Gilead Sciences.\n\nThe family eventually stood down their fight for remdesivir. In a Facebook post on April 4, Goldsmith explained that, with Michael 25 days into his illness, it was not thought that remedesivir would make an impact on him. He had started treatment on Actemra, a drug used to rheumatoid arthritis, she explained.\n\nREMDESIVIR: WHAT TO KNOW ABOUT POTENTIAL CORONAVIRUS TREATMENT\n\nMichael left the ICU at Hackensack University Medical Center on April 12. In a Facebook post on April 16, Elana explained that her husband is \"slowly moving in the right direction.\" She also posted a heartfelt letter to the medical staff who had been caring for Michael.\n\n\"Michael is literally a walking miracle. That miracle happened because of each and everyone of you,\" she wrote. \"I cannot even begin to imagine what your shifts are like or even what an hour is like in the MICU but you are saving people who matter to others and for that there are no words to properly and appropriately say thank you.\"\n\n\"What I do want to say thank you for is thank you for not giving up on Michael,\" Elana added. \"Thank you for not just saying he's been out for too long. Thank you for keeping such a close eye on him and quickly reacting when new problems arose. Thank you for working together to come up with new options, therapies or ideas to help him come off the vent.\"\n\nAs of Monday morning, more than 2.42 million coronavirus cases have been diagnosed worldwide, at least 759,000 of which are in the U.S. The disease has accounted for at least 166,205 deaths around the world, including at least 40,683 people in the U.S.",

Qassem Soleimani. Troops at al-Asad were warned of an incoming attack, and most were in bunkers scattered around the base.\n\nNearly a month after the attack, the Pentagon began to report that a number of troops were suffering from TBI with symptoms mimicking that of a concussion. Initially, Trump dismissed the injuries as \"not very serious,\" passing them off as headaches and other things.\n\nHowever, several service members were hospitalized from their injuries or returned to the U.S. The majority of those injured were able to return to work.\n\nThe effects of TBI have gained more prevalence in the military in recent years as more and more troops in the Iraq and Afghanistan wars began suffering from head injuries from bombings and other explosions.\n\nNavy Capt. Bill Urban said 80 service members were considered for the awards but those selected were approved by Lt. Gen. Pat White, the top U.S. commander in Iraq, based on Army and Air Force regulations determined by a review board.\n\nUrban said that a TBI diagnosis doesn't automatically qualify a servicemember for a Purple Heart.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP",

The test is used daily at the White House to test President Trump and key members of his staff, including members of the coronavirus task force.\n\nThe warning came one day after researchers at NYU reported results suggesting Abbott's test can miss up to half the infections caught by a rival test made by Cepheid. The research has not been peer-reviewed or published in a medical journal and was based on about 100 patients.\n\nHackett said that the NYU study is fundamentally different from other published observations and the feedback that Abbott labs are receiving from the real world. Hackett described the \"real world\" as \"hundreds of hospitals, doctors offices, urgent care centers, mobile units and municipalities\" using the tests.\n\n\"Their feedback is 'the test is operating as it should be operating. It's performing effectively,'\" Hackett said.\n\nThe researchers found that Abbott's test, run on the company's portable ID NOW system, missed one-third of the infections caught by Cepheid's test when swabs were stored in liquid used to transport laboratory samples. When the samples were kept dry the test missed 48 percent of the cases flagged by Cepheid's test.\n\nThe NYU researchers called the test's performance \"unacceptable\" due to the risk of falsely clearing patients who could spread the infection to others. They acknowledged the shortcomings of the study, including the time needed to transport patient samples to the device for processing.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR FULL CORONAVIRUS MAP\n\nHackett said that Abbott staff discussed the study with the NYU researchers leading them to acknowledge that their study \"had limitations\" and \"was not a well-controlled clinical study.\"\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"[NYU] didn't answer some important questions about when patients were sampled relative to the symptoms. The analysis of their data appears to be highly skewed from a typical distribution than to be observed so that really raises concerns of this study,\" Hackett said.\n\nAnchor Sandra Smith pressed Hackett, asking whether he still recommends it for public use.\n\n\"Absolutely,\" Hackett said.",

Licensed acupuncturists performed three 20-minute sessions of acupuncture and sham acupuncture on participants each week for four weeks.\n\nThe study population included Chinese patients aged 18 to 65 years old, and the trial was conducted between April 2017 and January 2019.

    "After recovering from COVID-19, are you immune?": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "This undated electron microscope image made available by the U.S. National Institutes of Health in February 2020 shows the coronavirus that causes COVID-19. The sample was isolated from a patient in the U.S. (NIAID-RML via AP)\n\nAs coronavirus spreads across the globe, a crucial question has emerged: After recovering from an infection, are people immune?\n\nThis question is important for understanding who can safely go back to work, as well as for understanding how long the worst impacts of the pandemic are likely to last. Because the virus is so new, the answer isn't fully understood. But so far, scientists say, it looks like SARS-CoV-2 probably induces immunity like other coronaviruses. That means that the human body will probably retain a memory of the virus for at least a few years and should be protected from reinfection, at least in the short-term.\n\n\"We do not have any reason to assume that the immune response would be significantly different\" from what's seen with other coronaviruses, said Nicolas Vabret, an assistant professor of medicine at the Mount Sinai Icahn School of Medicine who specializes in virology and immunology.\n\nInvestigations of SARS-CoV-2 so far have suggested, however, that the immune response to the virus also contributes to the devastating effects of the disease in some people.\n\nRelated: 13 coronavirus myths busted by science\n\nWhen a virus attacks its first cell in the body, that cell has two jobs to do before it dies, said Benjamin tenOever, a professor of biology at the Mount Sinai Icahn School of Medicine. The infected cell needs to issue a call for reinforcements, sending out a cascade of chemical signals that will activate an army of immune cells to come battle the invading virus. And it needs to issue a warning to other cells around it to fortify themselves, something it does by releasing proteins called interferons. When interferons land on neighboring cells, they trigger those cells to enter defensive mode. The cells slow down their metabolism, stop the transport of proteins and other molecules around their interiors, and slow down transcription, the process by which genetic instructions become proteins and other molecules. (Transcription is the process that viruses hijack to make more of themselves.)\n\nIn a study accepted to the journal Cell, tenOever and his colleagues found that SARS-CoV-2 appears to block this interferon signal, meaning it messes with the cell's second job. So the first job -- the call for immune system reinforcement -- works just fine, but the cells in the lungs don't enter defensive mode and so remain vulnerable to viral infection.\n\n\"It just keeps replicating in your lungs, and replicating in your lungs and all the while you keep calling in for more reinforcements,\" tenOever told Live Science.\n\nn many people, even this crippled immune response is enough to beat back the virus. But for reasons not yet fully understood, some people enter a vicious cycle. As the virus keeps replicating, the immune army that arrives to battle it starts doing its job: attacking infected cells, digesting debris and chemicals spewed out by dying cells, even killing nearby cells in an attempt to staunch the damage. Unfortunately, if the virus continues to penetrate lung cells, this army may do more damage than good. The lung tissue becomes hopelessly inflamed; the blood vessels begin to leak fluids into the lung; and the patient begins to drown on dry land. This seems to be the reason that some people become severely ill a couple of weeks after their initial infections, tenOever said.\n\n\"At that point, it's not about what the virus has done,\" he said. \"At that point, it's about controlling the severe inflammation.\"\n\nThis cycle is very bad news. But there is a glimmer of hope in the findings. Because the system that calls in the army of immune cells works fine, it seems likely that survivors of COVID-19 will retain immunity to the virus. And indeed, studies have found high levels of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 in recently recovered patients. Antibodies are proteins made by immune system cells called B cells. They stick around in the blood post-infection and can bind to the virus, either neutralizing it directly or marking it for destruction by other immune cells.\n\nRelated: Can antibody tests tell if you're immune to COVID-19?\n\nFor example, a study led by researcher Chen Dong of the Institute for Immunology and the School of Medicine at Tsinghua University in Beijing analyzed the blood of 14 COVID-19 patients who had experienced relatively mild COVID-19 symptoms 14 days after discharge from the hospital. They found that 13 of them showed high levels of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2, indicating immune protection from immediate reinfection. The findings have been accepted for publication in the journal Immunity.\n\nThese findings coincide with results from other studies of recovered patients, and are the main reason that scientists aren't concerned by the occasional reports of people recovering from COVID-19, testing negative for the virus via a nasal swab PCR test that detects the viral genome, and then testing positive again within a few weeks. These people aren't reinfected, tenOever said. Their antibody levels are high and their immune system is armed against further attack. Instead, the PCR tests are simply picking up bits of inert viral genetic debris left over from the previous infection.\n\nThe coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has only been circulating in human hosts for five or six months, which means that there is simply no way to know whether immunity to the disease lasts longer than that. How long immunity lasts is a big question, Tsinghua's Dong told Live Science via email.\n\n\"Per our findings, we can only confirm that COVID-19 patients can maintain the adaptive immunity to SARS-CoV-2 for 2 weeks post-discharge,\" he wrote.\n\nEvidence from other coronaviruses suggests that immunity probably lasts longer than that, Vabret said. Along with Mount Sinai colleagues Robert Samstein and Miriam Merad, Vibrat led more than two dozen doctoral students and postdoctoral researchers in an effort to review the avalanche of immunology research coming out about the coronavirus in journals and on preprint servers that host scientific papers before peer review. Studies of SARS-CoV-2's proteins and genetics suggest that the virus seems likely to induce a long-term immune response similar to that of other coronaviruses, like 2002's SARS 1, or Middle Easter respiratory syndrome (MERS), which arose in 2012.\n\nResearch on SARS 1 and MERS suggests that some level of antibody immunity persists for at least two or three years, starting high and gradually waning as time goes by, Samstein told Live Science.\n\nThe immune system also produces a type of immune cell called virus-specific T cells in response to coronavirus infection. Less is known about T cells compared with antibodies, Vabret and Samstein said, because they are more difficult to find in the blood and study. But other coronaviruses seem to trigger their production, and these T cells seem to last for years in those cases. In one study of SARS 1 published in the journal Vaccine, researchers found these memory T cells last for up to 11 years after infection.\n\nUltimately, researchers are still uncertain about what level of long-term immune memory is sufficient to protect against future coronavirus infection, and how long it takes for the immune system to drop below that level. It's not even clear whether someone with immunity could spread the coronavirus to others while fighting off a second infection, Vabret and Samstein said. If the immune response were strong enough to crush the virus quickly, the person probably wouldn't transmit it further, they said. A weaker response that allowed some viral replication might not prevent transmission, though, particularly since people without symptoms are known to pass the coronavirus around.\n\n\"We're taking lessons from the older viruses, but we don't know how much for sure how much is similar,\" Samstein said.\n\nThis uncertainty does not reduce hopes for a vaccine, though. One benefit of vaccines is that researchers can mimic the viral proteins that trigger the most effective immune response. Thus, vaccination can often induce immunity that lasts longer than immunity from falling ill.\n\n\"You can aim at inducing protection that would be better than what you would get from an infection,\" Vabret said.",

Many healthy American adults have not left their homes or apartments since March, apparently terrified by unceasing media coverage even though hospitalization and death data suggest the coronavirus poses low risks to them.\n\nAs the gap between those people who are terrified and those with a more complete understanding of the risks of the coronavirus increases, even relationships within families are coming under increasing pressure.\n\nDAN CRENSHAW REACTS TO JAILING OF SALON OWNER, SAYS LEADERS 'DRUNK WITH POWER\n\nA college student in Colorado - who asked not to be identified - explained that when he returned home in March, he expected the worst. \"My brother and I moved home to our house in south Denver,\" he wrote in an email. \"We accepted the fact that things could get ugly pretty quick and it would be best if we were all at home together.\"\n\nHowever, over the next several weeks, as the student realized that his actual risk of death from the coronavirus was very low and that his parents were also at low risk, he became increasingly frustrated. \"My parents all this time had been disinfecting packages left by Amazon and ordering groceries greeting the delivery driver in an N95 mask,\" he wrote. \"My parents are both under 65 and have no underlying health conditions.\"\n\nAfter seeing results from a study of people in California that suggested death rates from the coronavirus were far lower than had been reported - the student decided to visit friends. \"My parents called me and I told them I was at my friend's house and they shouldn't be worried,\" he wrote. They told him to come home, but he had been drinking and didn't want to drive. \"What happened next shocked me, they called the police on me,\" he wrote. Police officers \"woke up my friend's Dad after shining a spotlight in their bedroom window,\" he wrote.\n\nThat night the student and his brother left their home; he didn't speak to his parents for several weeks.\n\nFor younger children, parental anxieties can be even more crushing.\n\nA New York City resident, who asked not to be identified, explained how his sister fled the city for a house in New Jersey and rejected his efforts to visit her. \"This past weekend we were able to get to NJ for an hour of outdoor time with them,\" he wrote. \"My sister, a normally fit, energetic, and smiling woman, was nothing more than a pensive, pale, thin, and scared shell.\" Her daughter and son, both elementary-school aged, are suffering from her fear, he wrote. \"As the social one who would normally walk around NYC saying HI to just about anyone he has become cautious and despondent.\"\n\nA woman in Texas wrote that a good friend \"is too frightened to leave the house... she won't go out herself or allow anyone in who might bring the infection. She had two boys, 6 and 10, that she allows to 'play' with the neighbors, but they must stay on opposite sides of the street.\"\n\nSome parents have gone further. Increasingly, physicians agree that the coronavirus poses few serious dangers to children or young adults. On Sunday, Australia's deputy chief medical officer said in a statement that \"far fewer children are affected by COVID-19\" than the flu. Countries including Israel, Denmark, and Germany are reopening some or all schools.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR COMPLETE CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE\n\nYet with American governors going the other way and extending school closures, some parents are confining their children to homes or apartments and refusing to allow them outside even for short stretches, family members, friends, and neighbors say.\n\nOne New York City resident - who asked to remain nameless - provided screenshots of texts between his wife and one of their neighbors in which the neighbor explains she, her husband, and their 11-year-old son have not left the apartment since March 12, nearly two months ago. \"[Our son] is busy with all his school and after school,\" the neighbor wrote. To survive, they rely on occasional grocery deliveries, she wrote in the screenshot.\n\nThe resident fears for the child's welfare, but he doesn't know what to do. \"This kind of fear is pervasive in Manhattan, or at least among the people left in Manhattan,\" he wrote.",

Sign up here.\n\nThe global coronavirus pandemic has drastically disrupted commercial air travel as we once knew it, with some flight prices plummeting amid an uncertain future -- so should you book now?\n\nDemand for future air travel in the U.S. has dramatically plunged in recent weeks, dropping 98.4 percent year-over-year in the second week of April, according to industry trade group Airlines for America, per the Associated Press.\n\nAirline officials said most of the few people still flying are health care personnel fighting the COVID-19 outbreak and individuals reuniting with family members.\n\nAMERICANS READY TO TRAVEL AFTER CORONAVIRUS LOCKDOWNS LIFT, SURVEY FINDS\n\nWith that being said, those suffering from wanderlust at home might be eager to pounce on cheap tickets - but Brian Kelly, CEO and founder of The Points Guy, explained why you should think twice before acting fast.\n\nIn conversation with Fox News, the travel expert revealed whether he thinks it's wise or a waste of money to book flights right now, as well as what the future of commercial air travel might ultimately look like after the pandemic.\n\nFOX NEWS: Is it worthwhile or too risky to book low-fare flights during the coronavirus pandemic? How about six months from now?\n\nBrian Kelly: We do not recommend traveling at this time but if you are interested in booking a flight three to six months from now, just make sure you are aware of the airlines' current policies on change and cancellation fees, as well as consider having travel insurance. There's still so much uncertainty that there's simply no way to know what a \"safe\" window of travel is.\n\nFOX: What do you think the future of commercial aviation travel might look like after COVID-19 is no longer considered a global threat?\n\nKelly: The future of travel will have to look different. The consumer is going to have different and higher expectations when they travel, whether it's the expectation of a deep clean of their hotel room to how cautious they will be boarding a flight so close to other people.\n\nPacking humans into small spaces like sardines and not checking people for even the most rudimentary symptoms like fever will become things of the past. I won't be surprised if face masks while flying, always sanitizing your seat, and boarding smaller groups of people at a time become our new normal.\n\nThe state of the travel industry has changed immensely over the past several weeks due to the impact of COVID-19. We are seeing massive drops in airline capacity, TSA screenings, and hotel bookings. That said, the travel industry is extremely resilient, and we are confident we will come out of this stronger than ever before.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR FOX NEWS' CONTINUING CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE\n\nFOX: Is there anything else you'd like to share with our audience?\n\nKelly: I am very hopeful and confident we will all emerge from this crisis with a better outlook on travel and humanity as a whole... while travel can't kill the virus, it will be a key part in reconnecting a healing world and reuniting the human race.",

These procedures have taken on a heightened risk for health workers due to the possible transmission of the new coronavirus.\n\n\"Every opportunity and detail to recalibrate our acute neurological workflow to protect our frontline health care workers, our families, our colleagues and our patients should be sought, implemented and adapted to a resource-constrained environment,\" corresponding author Thanh Nguyen, professor of neurology, neurosurgery and radiology at Boston University School of Medicine (BUSM) and director of the neuroendovascular service at Boston Medical Center, said in a statement.\n\nNIH MOBILIZES COVID-19 TESTING INNOVATION INITIATIVE WITH POTENTIAL $500M AWARD FUNDING\n\nOne of the recommendations asks doctors to consider conscious sedation as the first line to protect anesthesiologists from exposure and to protect patients from unnecessary intubation, as well as to conserve mechanical ventilator resources.\n\nIf patients exhibit pulmonary symptoms, doctors are advised to lower the threshold to intubate patients in a controlled manner in a negative pressure room.\n\nThe guidance also suggests using remote tele-stroke technology to obtain patient history and perform a neurological examination, post-reperfusion monitoring, if that's possible.\n\n'DEVASTATINGLY' EFFECTIVE CORONAVIRUS CAPTURED IN IMAGE OF CELL\n\nAs of Wednesday afternoon, there were at least 3,173,036 people infected with COVID-19 worldwide, and the disease has killed at least 225,927 others.\n\nThe guidance was developed by a team from the Society of Vascular & Interventional Neurology (SVIN) and led by a BUSM researcher.",

    "Are 'covid toes' a real symptom of the coronavirus?": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "A frostbite-like rash on a person's toes might be a symptom of the new coronavirus, according to anecdotal evidence from dermatologists around the world.\n\nHowever, research is needed to determine whether this peculiar rash is truly caused by COVID-19.\n\nThe pinkish-reddish rash can turn purple over time, and causes a burning sensation in some people, Dr. Esther Freeman, a dermatologist at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, told The Washington Post. But the inflammation tends to disappear without treatment in two to three weeks, Freeman said.\n\nRelated: 13 coronavirus myths busted by science\n\nSo far, data shows that most people with so-called \"covid toes\" are asymptomatic or have mild cases of the disease, Freeman told the Post. Moreover, this strange rash tends to affect the younger crowd, including children and adults in their 20s or 30s, she said.\n\n\"Most of the patients were young, healthy and had a benign clinical course,\" she told the Post. \"I don't want people to think if they are having purple spots on their toes that they are going to end up on a ventilator in the ICU. That is not what we are seeing in the data.\"\n\nA series of images of covid toes, photographed by Italian dermatologist Andrea Bassi and posted on Twitter show the range of appearances this rash can take.\n\nBut there is still much to learn, so Freeman and colleagues who are part of an American Academy of Dermatology task force created an online COVID-19 dermatology registry, where health care workers can report skin-related issues that seem to be linked to COVID-19, including the frostbite-like toe rashes.\n\nThe researchers hope that the database will help doctors \"understand the relationship between the virus and skin\" and determine whether any of these skin problems can help with early disease detection, the team wrote in a report in the Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology.\n\nSo far, roughly half of the more than 300 database entries include covid toes, USA Today reported on April 27.\n\nFreeman noted that these toe rashes include skin sores or bumps known as pernio or chilblains, which usually occur when a person's foot has been exposed to extremely cold temperatures. However, because these rashes are happening in spring and in COVID-19 patients, cold temperatures are unlikely to be the cause.\n\nInstead, dermatologists say it's possible that inflammation in the toes is causing the rash, Freeman told USA Today. Other ideas are that small blood clots in the toe's blood vessels may lead to the rash, or that the blood vessel walls are inflamed due to a condition known as vasculitis.\n\nOne of the first mentions of covid toes appeared in early April, when French doctors noted that the rash had an \"appearance of pseudo-frostbite\" and \"persistent, sometimes painful redness, and transient hive lesions.\" (Translated with Google Translate.)\n\nMention of the toes surfaced again on April 18 in a Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology case report. In the case report, the researchers described a 23-year-old student in Belgium who had \"COVID-19 infection-induced chilblains.\"\n\nIt's not uncommon for viruses to cause rashes. Measles, for instance, can cause itchy flat spots, while coxsackie can lead to painful sores in the hands, feet and mouth, the Post reported.",

Sign up here.\n\nThe Army Research Laboratory (ARL) is vigorously pursuing technical innovations aimed at \"discovering\" and engineering new antibodies able to attach to and destroy coronavirus, thereby helping those severely impacted with an infection, service scientists told Warrior.\n\nThe ARL work, done in tandem with the University of Texas in Austin, draws upon several elaborate emerging techniques intended to identify potentially \"neutralizing\" antibodies able to help, or even save, patients who are critically ill with COVID-19.\n\nWhile no officially \"neutralizing\" antibodies have been discovered yet, there are a number of possibilities with potential promise; the work has inspired the eye and attention of senior Army leaders who oversee the services' scientific research, including the Commander of Army Futures Command, Gen. John Murray.\n\nThe ongoing work, intended to lead to the eventual production of COVID-19 antibodies, \"has \"identified 18 potential therapeutic/neutralizing monoclonal antibodies,\" Murray said in an interview with Warrior.\n\nUSNS COMFORT COMMANDER DESCRIBES HOW NAVY DOCTORS SAVE LIVES ABOARD THE HOSPITAL SHIP\n\nDoctors and scientists draw blood from COVID-19-infected patients with the hope of \"engineering\" new antibody configurations able to destroy Coronavirus.\n\n\"We look to find sequences that are binding to COVID-19. Then we send them off to test their ability to neutralize. A neutralizing antibody keeps a pathogen from being able to proliferate. We assemble antibodies and select winners,\" Dr. Jimmy Gollihar, synthetic biology research scientist, U.S. Army Capabilities Development Command, Army Research Laboratory-South, told Warrior in an interview about the process.\n\nThe goal, Gollihar explained, is to regenerate therapeutic antibodies and give doses to people who are critically ill to help them recover faster. The work is not intended to produce a long-term solution or cure but rather provide a \"bridge to a vaccine,\" he said.\n\nThe antibodies are extracted from what Gollihar described as antibody-producing \"V Cells\" taken from the blood of infected patients.\n\nPENTAGON TAKES AIM AT CORONAVIRUS WITH 8,000 VENTILATORS\n\nGollihar, who is also Chief Technology Officer of the Bioindustrial Manufacturing Innovation Institute, said that \"antibody sequences are short-lived,\" and do not provide permanent immunity. Antibodies have \"varying degrees of half-life in a serum,\" he added. \"A serum is passed over a column with immobilized antigens from the virus. Antibodies were then fragmenting so we had a library of V-Cells and we could correlate which antibodies were binding.\"\n\n\"In partnership with UT in Austin we've been working on methods to id sequences of heavy and light chains of antibodies that are specific to Covid-19. The people that we drew blood from were recently infected. They range from one to two weeks post-onset of symptoms. Once we drew their blood we separated their V Cells,\" Gollihar said.\n\nAs for the process, Murray further explained that the ARL submitted a proposal to the National Institute for Innovation in Manufacturing Biopharmaceutical - Manufacturing Innovation Institute.\n\nSOLDIERS USE AI TO FIRE PRECISION GRENADES, GUIDE DRONE ATTACKS\n\n\"The blood draws happened under UT supervision. When we pull all of the V Cells, we are pulling their full repertoire, everything they have. The challenge is to find antibodies that are binding to COVID-19. Once we find them we produce them and send them off to the lab,\" Gollihar said.\n\nDescribed as blood proteins, antibodies are made up of amino acids that make up proteins. Gollihar described proteins as \"three-dimensional structures made up of a linear chain of amino acids, the building blocks of proteins. Amino acids are a composition of molecules or chemicals.\"\n\nARL and the University of Texas scientists plan to test the antibodies in a small group of infected individuals.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR COMPLETE CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE\n\n\"We are not sure if they are neutralizing. We are working diligently to get through neutralization data and are in the process of moving some of those antibodies into production strains so we can test them,\" Gollihar said.",

A source familiar with the situation said the cases are not related or linked to one another.\n\nA worker, speaking on condition of anonymity, told the news outlet they received a text message stating there had been \"additional confirmed cases of COVID-19.\"\n\nAMAZON WORKERS CALL FOR 'VIRTUAL WALKOUT' IN RESPONSE TO FIRINGS, WORK CONDITIONS DURING CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC\n\n\"Every other day it's the same text message,\" the employee said. \"Our building during one day shift has over 500 people in the building at once. There's no way to properly distance yourself when running at that capacity. And every day they're hiring more and more people.\n\n\"I used to feel safe here, but not anymore,\" the person added. \"They just care about putting out packages.\"\n\nAmazon spokesperson Rachael Lighty told Fox News the company is supporting the individuals who are recovering from the virus.\n\nShe added Amazon is looking into additional ways to keep its employees healthy and safe.\n\n\"In early April we began disinfectant fogging at our Carteret facility, a practice commonly used by hospitals and airlines, to supplement the enhanced cleaning measures that are already in place,\" Lighty told Fox News. \"This is in addition to mandatory social distancing, temperature checks, and masks for everyone to use from arrival through shift departure, as we remain committed to keeping our teams healthy and safe.\"\n\nLighty also refuted the idea that the company is ending its wage increase, as has previously been reported. Instead, Amazon is extending the increase in hourly pay through May 16. Double overtime pay in the U.S. is also extended, though Lighty did not give a specific time frame for that extension.\n\n\"In addition, we are providing flexibility with leave of absence options, including expanding the policy to cover COVID-19 circumstances, such as high-risk individuals or school closures,\" Lighty continued. \"We continue to see heavy demand during this difficult time and the team is doing incredible work for our customers and the community.\"\n\nThe company has been under intense scrutiny, from both its own employees, as well as lawmakers, over concerns for warehouse workers' safety and well-being.\n\nIn March, a group of four U.S. senators, including Sens.

Smalls was later fired, with Amazon telling Fox News it terminated him because he violated several terms of his employment.\n\nAMAZON FIRES MORE EMPLOYEES WHO CRITICIZED WAREHOUSE CONDITIONS DURING CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC\n\nAfter the news of Smalls' termination, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio ordered an investigation into the incident.

        "body": "Aerial view of the New York skyline on a sunny afternoon (iStock)\n\nMore than a dozen children in New York City have been hospitalized with an unusual inflammatory syndrome possibility related to COVID-19.\n\nThe syndrome, which doctors are still working to understand, has been previously reported in children in the United Kingdom and other European countries.\n\nOn Monday (May 4), the New York City Health Department alerted doctors in a bulletin that it had identified 15 patients ages 2 to 15 years old that had been hospitalized with an illness that appeared similar to the inflammatory syndrome described in the European reports.\n\nSymptoms of the syndrome can vary, but patients have been noted to have symptoms similar to those found in two rare conditions: toxic shock syndrome and Kawasaki disease, the alert said. Toxic shock syndrome is a life-threatening condition that's caused by toxins produced by certain types of bacteria; Kawasaki disease is a childhood illness that causes inflammation in blood vessel walls, and in serious cases can cause heart damage, Live Science previously reported.\n\nAll of the NYC cases had a fever, and more than half had a rash, abdominal pain, vomiting or diarrhea, the alert said. Many of the patients also had markers of inflammation in their blood.\n\nAmong the 15 cases, four tested positive for COVID-19 using a diagnostic test, and six tested positive using an antibody test (also called a serological test), which shows evidence of a past infection with the virus. This is similar to the U.K. cases, in which not all of the children tested positive for COVID-19.\n\nSome of the NYC cases have been admitted to the intensive care unit and required cardiac or respiratory support; however, no deaths have been reported.\n\nThe inflammatory syndrome appears rare -- in the U.K., only about a dozen children have been reported to have the syndrome, according to The Guardian.\n\n\"So far, from what we understand, this is a rare complication in the pediatric population that [doctors] believe is related to COVID-19,\" Dr. Howard Zucker, the New York state health commissioner, told the New York Times.\n\nThe alert urged doctors in the area to immediately report cases to the NYC Health Department if they suspect their patients have this inflammatory syndrome. Doctors should also refer these patients to a specialist in pediatric infectious disease, rheumatology or critical care, the alert said.\n\n\"Even though the relationship of this syndrome to COVID-19 is not yet defined, and not all of these cases have tested positive for COVID-19 by either DNA test or serology, the clinical nature of this virus is such that we are asking all providers to contact us immediately if they see patients who meet the criteria we've outlined,\" Dr. Oxiris Barbot, the commissioner of the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, said in a statement, the Times reported. \"And to parents ... if your child has symptoms like fever, rash, abdominal pain or vomiting, call your doctor right away.\n\nOverall, reports of serious COVID-19 complications remain rare in children.",

Sign up here.\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- Attorney General William Barr on Monday ordered federal prosecutors across the U.S. to identify coronavirus-related restrictions from state and local governments \"that could be violating the constitutional rights and civil liberties of individual citizens.\"\n\nThe memo to U.S. attorneys directs the head of the Justice Department's civil rights division and the U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Michigan to coordinate the department's efforts to monitor state and local policies and take action if needed.\n\n\"If a state or local ordinance crosses the line from an appropriate exercise of authority to stop the spread of COVID-19 into an overbearing infringement of constitutional and statutory protections, the Department of Justice may have an obligation to address that overreach in federal court.\"\n\nFEDERAL JUDGE SAYS MISSISSIPPI CHURCH CAN HOLD DRIVE-IN SERVICES\n\nBarr's memo comes about two weeks after the Justice Department filed a statement of interest in a civil case in Mississippi, siding with a Christian church where local officials had tried to stop Holy Week services broadcast to congregants sitting in their cars in the parking lot.\n\nThe directive also comes as many stay-at-home orders are set to expire and governors eager to rescue their economies are moving to ease restrictions meant to control the spread of the coronavirus, even as new hot spots emerge and experts warn that moving too fast could prove disastrous.\n\nAt the same time, protesters have staged demonstrations against stay-at-home orders, and in recent weeks, President Donald Trump has urged supporters to \"liberate\" three states led by Democratic governors.\n\nTrump was asked at Monday's coronavirus briefing about the strategy behind the decision by the Justice Department.\n\n\"Well, you'd have to ask Attorney General Barr, but I think he wants to see -- like everybody, he wants to see people get back and he wants to see people get back to work,\" Trump said. \"He doesn't want people to be held up when there's no reason for doing it. In some cases, perhaps it's too strict. He wants to make sure people have the rights and they maintain the rights, very importantly.\"\n\nDOJ INTERVENES IN MISSISSIPPI DRIVE-IN CHURCH CASE, SAYS CITY'S ACTIONS 'TARGET RELIGIOUS CONDUCT'\n\nThe Justice Department argued in the Mississippi filing that officials in Greenville appeared to be targeting religious conduct by singling churches out as the only essential service, as designated by the state of Mississippi, that may not operate despite following all Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and state recommendations regarding social distancing.\n\nIn an interview with radio host Hugh Hewitt last week, Barr said the Justice Department could support legal action against states that impose strict measures as the number of coronavirus cases begins to subside.\n\n\"The idea that you have to stay in your house is disturbingly close to house arrest,\" Barr said. \"I'm not saying it wasn't justified. I'm not saying in some places it might still be justified. But it's very onerous, as is shutting down your livelihood.\"\n\nANDREW MCCARTHY: STATE CORONAVIRUS RESTRICTIONS -- ATTORNEY GENERAL BARR PUSHES BACK\n\nBarr said he believes there is a sufficient basis for social distancing rules that have been put in place, but he has cautioned that there may be concern if the restrictive measures continue too long. He has said the U.S. must find a way to allow business to adapt and reopen.\n\n\"I think we have to allow people to figure out ways of getting back to work and keep their workers and customers safe,\" Barr said in an interview with Fox News earlier this month. \"I'm not suggesting we stop social distancing overnight. There may come a time where we have to worry less about that.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nFor most people, the coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough, that clear up in two to three weeks.

While the duo typically takes precautions, Affleck partially took off his mask so that he could smoke a cigarette while he walked around, effectively rendering it useless.\n\nAs the epidemic of the novel coronavirus, or COVID-19, continues to overwhelm America's health care workers who grapple to treat the worst patients, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) earlier this month changed its guidelines to urge citizens to do their part in stopping the spread, which now includes protecting your face with some type of cloth covering when you step out of the safety of your home to restock on essential goods.\n\nCORONAVIRUS PREVENTION TIPS: HOW TO STOP TOUCHING YOUR FACE\n\nExhaling smoke while in public specifically can be hazardous given that the masks are not meant to protect the person wearing it, but the people around them. The CDC only recently changed its recommendations \"in light of new evidence\" that shows \"a significant portion\" of those with the novel virus are either asymptomatic -- meaning they lack symptoms altogether -- or presymptomatic, meaning they can spread the virus to others without first showing signs of it themselves.\n\nWHY DO SOME COUNTRIES STILL HAVE NEXT TO NO RECORDED OUTBREAKS OF CORONAVIRUS?\n\nStill, the actor had his cigarette and blew smoke out without the protection of a mask. However, he did make sure to keep his mask over his nose, preventing some exhalation particles from getting out unfiltered.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nIt's unclear from the photos, however, if he remained six feet away from anyone while having the smoke, which experts say is the minimum safe distance to avoid infecting others.

        "body": "Tucker Carlson blasts Joe Biden, who once championed victim-centered Title IX rules, for hypocrisy amid his sexual assault allegations\n\nJoe Biden formed a Public Health Advisory Committee in March, saying that the Trump administration was \"unprepared\" for the coronavirus pandemic but that the former vice president's hand-picked panel of purported experts would offer more constructive ways to approach the crisis.\n\nThe panel, comprised of six doctors and former government officials, provides \"science-based, expert advice regarding steps the campaign should take to minimize health risks for the candidate, staff, and supporters,\" the Biden campaign has claimed. \"The campaign's top priority is and will continue to be the health and safety of the public.\"\n\nStatements reviewed by Fox News, however, show that several members of Biden's advisory committee haven't been consistent on the issue, and in many cases they downplayed the threat of the pandemic -- underscoring how fraught political attacks over the coronavirus can be.\n\n\"Joe Biden's hand selected experts downplayed the threat of the coronavirus, compared it to the flu, said it would go away with warm weather, praised China's transparency, and opposed President Trump's travel restrictions on China and Europe,\" Matt Wolking, the Trump campaign's deputy communications director, told Fox News after this article was published. \"There is no evidence Biden thought his own advisors were wrong, which explains why he continued to hold campaign rallies well into March. Now Biden pretends he sounded the alarm, which is just another lie in his decades-long record of dishonesty.\"\n\nEmanuel is a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress and vice provost for Global Initiatives at the University of Pennsylvania. After meeting with the World Health Organization (WHO) in February, he quickly downplayed the threat of coronavirus.\n\n\"People recognized that this is a serious public health problem requiring serious attention and that it could become a much more serious health issue,\" Emanuel said after his return. \"But, at the moment, most people are thinking that there may be a bit of an overreaction by many, maybe even our own country. If you look at the numbers dispassionately, there are just over 1,000 cases outside of China. Half of them are on that cruise ship in Japan. So, considering the world's population of more than 7 billion people, that's not a lot.\"\n\nHe continued: \"Even in China, you've got about 74,000 cases. We know that's an underestimate of the actual number of cases, but it's likely most of the other cases are mild. And that's in a country with a population of 1.4 billion people. So a sense at the meeting was that we need to be a little more mathematical and rational about this.\"\n\nFOX NEWS TIMELINE: EVERYONE'S CORONAVIRUS RHETORIC HAS SHIFTED -- ESPECIALLY EXPERTS AND MEDIA\n\nAlso in February, Emanuel remarked that the warm weather would help reduce coronavirus spread and talked of his planned international travels.\n\n\"Right now I have a trip planned to Taiwan in May, and I'm planning to go,\" he said. \"If there is some big change, like we suddenly see 15,000 cases outside of China, that will certainly change people's reactions. The other factor here is that many of the experts are saying, well the warm weather is going to come and, just like with the flu, the coronavirus is going to go down and may move into the Southern Hemisphere.\"\n\nEmanuel added that the coronavirus \"sort of behaves like the flu,\" in the sense that \"a lot of us get the flu, but serious cases that cause mortality tend to be focused on the elderly and those with other chronic diseases.\"\n\nIn January, Emanuel admonished Americans, saying in an interview with CNBC: \"Everyone in America should take a very big breath, slow down, and stop panicking and being hysterical. We are having a little too much histrionics on this.\"\n\nEmanuel also advised Americans against wearing protective masks, saying that \"wearing the mask is going to -- not prevent you from getting the virus. It -- the people who need to wear masks are the people who have the virus and since most people, you know, I don't know most people, but there are people who have the virus and don't know it and they're not going to be donning the mask. So, the public, running out and getting a mask is not going to help.\"\n\nIn April, Emanuel said Americans could be dealing with strict social distancing measures to combat the coronavirus for 18 months and that the U.S. \"will not be able to return to normalcy until we find a vaccine or effective medications.\"\n\nKatz, a professor and Director of the Center for Global Health Science and Security at Georgetown University Medical Center, warned in January that travel bans can \"cause public panic\" and \"impede individual rights.\"\n\n'We have learned through past precedent that non-pharmaceutical interventions like 'social distancing' -- including keeping people from gathering in confined spaces like a public bus or train -- can be useful in controlling a respiratory disease,\" Katz said. \"But, we know that broadly applied interventions such as travel bans can cause public panic, impede individual rights, lead to secondary effects like shortages of food, and may not be effective at containing a virus if it has already spread outside of the epicenter, as nCoV-2019 has done,'\" she added.\n\nAFTER ATTACKING TRUMP TRAVEL BAN, DEMS, MEDIA CHANGE TUNE\n\nIndeed, within hours of President Trump's decision to restrict travel from China on Jan. 31, other top Democrats and media figures immediately derided the move as unnecessary and xenophobic -- and they are now beating a hasty retreat from that position as the coronavirus continues to ravage the economy and cause scores of deaths.\n\nBiden himself led the way, quickly attacking what he called Trump's \"record of hysteria, xenophobia and fear-mongering\" after the travel restrictions were announced, and arguing that Trump \"is the worst possible person to lead our country through a global health emergency.\" Biden eventually praised Trump's travel ban months later.\n\nMonaco served as the former homeland security and counterterrorism adviser to President Obama. On Feb. 7, she wrote an op-ed downplaying the lethality of coronavirus.\n\n\"The good news thus far is that the coronavirus appears to be less lethal than its viral cousin SARS was in 2002 and far less lethal than Ebola was in 2014,\" Monaco wrote. \"The bad news is that today's virus, as a respiratory illness transmissible through coughing and sneezing, is more easily transmissible than Ebola. And because it may also be transmissible during the incubation period when no symptoms are apparent, the control measures pioneered for Ebola in 2014 -- funneling travelers to particular airports and then conducting temperature checks for signs of fever and other indicia of infection -- may not be as effective.\"\n\nOn March 12, speaking to CNN, Monaco also hit the travel restrictions imposed by the Trump administration on China.\n\n\"It's not the best thing they can do right now to contain this virus,\" she said. \"Look, travel restrictions may slow the pace of this spread here, but the reality is that the disease is here. It's already here, and it is expanding exponentially from what we have seen thus far, but we have only looked at the tip of the iceberg. Let's get some facts on the table. Two weeks ago, there were 15 cases in this country. One week ago, there was a little over 100 cases in this country. Today, you're reporting over 1,200 cases. So the exponential increase -- and that's based on just a small level of testing that we have done. So I don't think the travel restrictions are the panacea here, nor is labeling it a foreign virus.\"\n\nHOPKINS STUDY FOUND US MORE PREPARED THAN ANY COUNTRY TO HANDLE A PANDEMIC\n\nOn March, 12, Monaco told CNN's Chris Cuomo that Trump's later ban on travel from Europe wasn't the right move, saying, \"We've got to be focusing on what we're doing right now, here in this country, to protect Americans.\"\n\nRedlener, the director of the National Center for Disaster Preparedness at The Earth Institute at Columbia University, downplayed the virus in a February op-ed in The Hill.\n\n\"Yes, there is uncertainty, and the headlines are dramatic,\" he wrote. \"But right now, the chances of any of us or anyone we know ever getting a severe, potentially lethal form of the Wuhan virus is negligible.\" References to the \"Wuhan virus\" have since been called racist by many Democrats and media organizations.\n\n\"[T]here is every reason to believe that international collaboration, more sophisticated means of prevention and surveillance, and new, highly effective pharmaceuticals\" will avert catastrophe, Redlener wrote.\n\nRedlener's remark that the U.S. was \"unprepared\" would later be quoted by the Global Times, a Chinese propaganda outfit.\n\nThe Biden campaign, including its top coronavirus adviser Ron Klain, has separately praised China for being \"transparent\" and \"candid.\" Speaking to Axios on January 27, Klain asserted: \"I think what you'd have to say about China is, it's been more transparent and more candid than it has been during past outbreaks, though still there's problems with transparency and candor.\"\n\nEven as he said there were \"many\" areas in which China hasn't been transparent, Klain asserted that China had helpfully released a \"sequence of the virus.\" Klain went on to say there isn't \"any reason\" for anyone to postpone essential travel to anywhere except the Wuhan area. In fact, China reportedly destroyed virus samples rather than release them.\n\nOn January 28, just three days before Trump closed off most travel from China, Klain said he opposed that measure.\n\nThe evidence \"suggests\" the coronavirus won't be a \"serious pandemic,\" he said Feb. 11.\n\nA Fox News timeline shows that Biden's experts were not alone in their assessments. On Feb. 17, for example, top infectious diseases expert Dr. Anthony Fauci, who advises Trump's coronavirus task force, announced that the risk of coronavirus infection in the U.S. is \"miniscule.\"\n\nFauci also told USA Today that people shouldn't wear masks unless they are contagious.\n\nOn March 9, Fauci remarked that going to campaign rallies may not be a bad idea: \"You know, I can't comment on campaign rallies. It really depends. We are having as we all said -- this is something in motion. This is an evolving thing. So I'm not sure what we're going to be able to say at the time we're going to have a campaign rally. If you're talking about a campaign rally tomorrow, in a place where there is no community spread, I think the judgment to have it might be a good judgment. [But] if you want to talk about large gatherings in a place you have community spread, I think that's a judgment call, and if someone decides they want to cancel it, I wouldn't publicly criticize them.\"",

Sign up here.\n\nDr. Deborah Birx, member of President Trump's coronavirus task force, discussed some of the latest revelations learned from data that her team continues to collect, pointing to what they have been able to learn from those infected with the virus who have not shown symptoms.\n\nBirx said that especially within certain limited populations that have experienced outbreaks, examining those who never knew they had it can be vital to advancing the White House's strategy for monitoring COVID-19.\n\nTOP PUBLIC HEALTH EXPERT SAYS U.S. 'NOT OUT OF THE WOODS' IN CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC\n\n\"I think we're getting a lot of information out of these isolated outbreaks that are occurring, whether they're occurring in prisons or among essential workers in packing plants, or specifically gatherings that came together -- whether it was a wedding or event -- and when you look at those epidemics it isn't until you start seeing symptomatic groups, so when you go in there and test you find a lot of people have the virus and may not ever develop symptoms,\" Birx told Fox News' \"Sunday Morning Futures,\" noting that she thinks \"we're really starting to look at this in a very careful way to understand how we do surveillance.\"\n\nBirx said that the administration's plan for monitoring the pandemic is to conduct both diagnoses and surveillance of at-risk populations. By finding asymptomatic cases early in places like inner cities and long-term care facilities, she said, the government can better determine where the virus has spread before a large number of people get sick.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR COMPLETE CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE\n\nAntibody tests can also help achieve this by determining whether asymptomatic people have already been infected. Birx said that the government is working on a method for people to have two antibody tests to increase \"the specificity and sensitivity of the test to make it more accurate,\" with details potentially coming later this week.\n\nBirx further discussed antibody testing on CNN's \"State of the Union,\" particularly the World Health Organization's warning that people who have recovered and have antibodies may not actually be immune to COVID-19.\n\n\"WHO is being very cautious,\" Birx said, explaining that there are different types of antibodies that have different impacts when it comes to fighting off illness.\n\n\"I think what WHO was saying, we don't know how long that effective antibody lasts,\" Birx said, recognizing that \"that is a question that we have to explore over the next few months and over the next few years.\"\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nBirx also appeared on NBC's \"Meet the Press,\" addressing how states and individuals should handle the coming reopening of certain parts of the country. While Vice President Pence predicted that the worst of the pandemic will be \"behind us\" by Memorial Day in late May, Birx told NBC's Chuck Todd that \"social distancing will be with us through the summer to really ensure that we protect one another as we move through these phases.\"\n\nBirx specifically cautioned at-risk individuals such as the elderly and those with pre-existing conditions should still shelter in place, even if their states are following the White House's guidelines for gradually reopening in phases.",

Sign up here.\n\nA group of researchers in England found a group of blood compounds that may predispose some children to more severe cases of Kawasaki-like inflammatory disease, reports say.\n\nDoctors think the rare inflammatory condition is linked to coronavirus. Kawasaki disease causes swelling in medium-sized arteries throughout the body, causing a high, persistent fever, swollen lips and tongue, a rash, and swollen hands and feet, among other signs.\n\nSome pediatric patients experience additional symptoms like shock, may develop heart abnormalities (like coronary aneurysms) and undergo heart failure, Michael Bell, the chief of critical care medicine at Children's National, told The Washington Post. A 5-year-old girl from the U.K. is stabilizing after she developed heart problems from the illness.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR FULL CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE\n\nResearchers at Imperial College London analyzed blood from some of the sickest children, according to a report by The Guardian, and found they had high levels of five compounds that can be measured in routine tests. Two of the compounds, ferritin and C-reactive protein or CRP, are common blood markers for inflammation. The others are linked to heart damage and blood clotting, namely troponin, BNP and so-called \"D-dimers\".\n\n\"We know that these markers are present in the very sick patients and at lower levels in some patients with normal Kawasaki disease,\" Michael Levin, a professor of pediatrics and international child health at Imperial, told The Guardian.\n\nCHARLESTON ENGINEER TEAMS UP WITH BOAT BUILDER TO DEVELOP NEW SAFETY DEVICE TO PROTECT CORONAVIRUS WORKERS\n\nThe researchers believe the blood markers can help doctors decide which children are at risk of progressing to heart failure, moving these patients from district hospitals to specialist centers and, later, intensive care units if necessary, Levin said. Though more research is necessary, if the markers are reliable then a simple blood test could help doctors identify children at-risk for the disease.\n\nProf. Chris Whitty, England's chief medical officer, granted the researchers permission to investigate further by recruiting children into a European-funded trial called Diamonds, which was already studying inflammatory disorders, the outlet reported. Doctors in Europe are reportedly collecting blood samples for the study to learn which markers may reveal the severity of the disease.\n\nNY GOV. CUOMO SAYS HIS CORONAVIRUS TEST WAS NEGATIVE\n\n\"This is a rapidly changing situation and we desperately need to learn how to manage it because we are now seeing quite significant numbers of children being admitted to district hospitals all over the place,\" Levin told The Guardian.\n\nFox News' Madeline Farber contributed to this report.",

    "Brit Hume's interview with ex-NYT reporter Alex Berenson: Read the transcript": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "Reaction and analysis from Fox News media analyst Howard Kurtz.\n\nFox News' Brit Hume interviewed former New York Times reporter Alex Berenson about the coronavirus crisis lockdowns across the country for the FOX News Rundown podcast.\n\nRead the full conversation here:\n\nBrit Hume: Alex Berenson is with me. He's a prominent skeptic of the coronavirus lockdown and his Twitter feed has become a repository of unconventional wisdom about this. And to those who may not know him, he's a former New York Times reporter, a successful thriller writer and a man who wrote a book fighting the conventional wisdom that marijuana is safe and should be legalized. And until about a month ago or a little more, if you looked at his Twitter feed, it was about that issue. And then somewhere along the way, in early March, he began to tweet about the coronavirus. And at first say, Alex, your early tweets about this tended to reflect the alarm. Am I right about that?\n\nAlex Berenson: In fact, actually, I was pretty interested in this even, you know, even as early as early February, you know, maybe even late January. And you can see some tweets back then, too. You know, I certainly was. You know, in China, things seem to be very worrisome. And you can find early papers suggesting that, you know, this is going to spread to Beijing and Shanghai and the other Chinese megacities. It's going to be uncontrollable. It doesn't matter what happens. And, you know, I certainly, you know, in February, as it was spreading in Wuhan or as the deaths were rising and Hong was very concerned, I would say the first thing that I noticed was that it didn't seem to spread elsewhere in China. And that wasn't it wasn't entirely clear why. But I was still quite concerned in early March. And, you know, people that you know, people who don't like me, it's that, oh, look, you were panicking back then and like, well, yes, I was definitely worried about this. I would say a couple things happened. One was the first thing that happened was I realized what the actual mortality rates looked like by age. So in other words, no one is saying that that source code, too, isn't real, that's not a real virus, that it doesn't kill lots of people. But the question is, why is it that nearly all the people it affects the most seem to be over 70 and many, many of those seem to be over 80 and 90. And so that raises the question whether some people are dying with rather than of this. And secondly, if there are things that we could do that might protect those people rather than, you know, shutting down all society and causing massive economic harm, massive societal harm.\n\nBrit Hume: By the time but by the time you began to express skepticism about this, we had no full lockdown. [What] we're now experiencing really hadn't begun.\n\nAlex Berenson: That's right.\n\nBrit Hume: So what was it? I mean, you've partly answered this. What was it that prompted your skepticism that this threat was being overstated? Was it simply the fact that it was distributed within the population to certain segments? Well, apparently not much elsewhere.\n\nAlex Berenson: I would say that was the first question [was] this doesn't really look like the Spanish flu. The Spanish flu. Flu killed, you know, tons of children, tons of young adults. It was very, very dangerous across the board. This didn't look like that to me. But I would say the first thing when my radar really went off as a journalist was on March 25th. Neil Ferguson, who is the author of, the lead author, of the seminal paper, the Imperial College Paper, that said two million Americans might die if we did nothing about this, gave testimony in Britain where he reduced his estimate for the number of people who would die from 500,000 to 20,000 now. Now, the 500,000 number assumed no mitigation efforts at all in Britain. OK. But the paper came out on March 16th. And in that paper, it says that even with reasonable mitigation efforts, a quarter of a million people will die. And a week later, nine days later, he testified to the British government that the most likely number was 200,00. And I thought to myself, how on earth did we get from 250000 to 20000 in a matter of days? And I pointed this out and it was the first thing that really grabbed people's attention. Elon Musk retweeted it. Other major people retweeted it. And all the sudden I was in the middle of this and I have been ever since. And since then it has been clear over and over again that the models, the especially the now in the United States and University of Washington model are just completely wrong. And they've completely overstated the hospitalizations and the ICU needs of this.\n\nBrit Hume: What do you say to those who say, well, you know, models are models? Dr. Fauci said that he's always skeptical of models and that, you know, they do the best they can with the available data. And as data becomes more plentiful, they revise and that's a normal process and that's really just what happened here.\n\nAlex Berenson: That's fine....I think we can all agree about that. But what I don't like is when people say all the models didn't account for lockdowns. That's not true. University of Washington model explicitly accounted for that. So here's the question, Brit. If we want to say, OK, the models were wrong back in mid-March, back in late March when we did all this incredibly draconian stuff. OK, well, now we have more data. We have better data. This doesn't look as dangerous as it was. It looks significantly less dangerous. It's clear that the hospitals in the United States are not being overrun with this, that if anything, hospitals are emptier than they were a month ago and under severe financial strain. So if the models were wrong, these guys did the best they could. We can all agree about that. Let's update our policies. Let's not do what we were doing a month ago. And that to me is you can't have it both ways. If you want to say, OK, the models were wrong. Why are we doing stuff that's even more draconian than we were a month ago?\n\nBrit Hume: Dr. Fauci would say that, well, yes, the models overstated things, but when we made the decision to recommend a 30-day additional mitigation effort, we were relying on more than the models...\n\nWe were relying on other information.\n\nAlex Berenson: What is that other information? I mean, so so you have to remember, there's been sort of four justifications for the lockdowns. First was flatten the curve, which doesn't actually mean that you're going to reduce the total number of infections. It just means you're going to reduce the burden on the hospital system. OK. There's been no burden on the hospital system.\n\nBrit Hume: I wouldn't say there's been no burden.\n\nAlex Berenson: Well, outside the outside New York City, no burden. And I will stick to that. I mean, maybe Detroit hospitals in the United States are literally closing down because they're empty right now. OK, so. So, yes, New York City, things got very dicey for a few days, a couple of weeks. But even in New York now, the hospitals are beginning to empty out a little bit. So that's reason one reason to wait two weeks. This is going to happen. The surge is going to happen. Well, we've waited two weeks and we waited two weeks more. And it's clear that there is going to be no surge right now. Reason three. Second wave. Well, second wave is sort of this amorphous concept that, you know, how long are we going to wait for a second wave? We're going to wait... next summer. Are we going to wait till next fall? How long do we have to wait before there is before we reopen the country? How much economic and societal devastation does there have to be? And then the fourth one, the new one is we need everybody to be able to be tested. Well, why is that? What difference does it make if people have this infection or not? If they're not winding up sick and in the hospital, the hospital utilization is what matters more than anything else.\n\nBrit Hume: Why do you say that?\n\nAlex Berenson: Well, for two reasons. First of all, we know that a certain number of people who are hospitalized are going to wind up on ventilators and on, you know, and ultimately some unfortunate percentage of people are going to die. So hospitalizations are a leading indicator. They tell us what's going to happen going forward. But the second reason is, again, to go back to the ultimate justification or the original justification for the lockdowns was we don't want our health care system to collapse. We don't want doctors to be so busy only treating Covid patients that they can't treat anybody else. We need to mitigate that. And nurses, too, and medical staff, too. And so if that is the focus of the lockdowns, the reason for the lockdowns initially, then that's what we should be caring about.\n\nBrit Hume: The argument is made...that the reason why these model numbers and projections of mortality, caseload and so on have come down so sharply is that the American people have responded so willingly to the mitigation efforts. And it is their having done so that accounts for this...Do you agree with that?\n\nAlex Berenson: No, I don't... We need to sort of distinguish between social distancing, voluntary moderate social distancing and hard lockdowns...Just last week, a very, very good paper came out of Germany. And this was published by the official German Public Health Institute. And let me just let me digress for one second. It's funny to me, when people call me a skeptic or a contrarian or say I'm presenting, you know, alternative views. I present, wherever I can, published research findings, government findings or, you know, or newspaper articles. This is not, you know, some anonymous fourth-hand source. The information I get and present is as good, you know, as what The New York Times is presenting in terms of the sourcing, because I think this is way too important to be talking about rumor and speculation. OK. I try to I try always to go with the government documents when they're available. So to go back to this German government paper. Germany has had a pretty aggressive testing program and they've had a relatively contained epidemic. What they found was that the infection rate...seemed to peak in late January. I'm sorry, late February, early March. And then Germany had a couple of moderate social distancing measures imposed. In the end, the infection rate went way down. And by the time they imposed the hard lockdown, which was March 23rd, the infection rate was already at about 1, meaning every person was only giving it to one other person, meaning it wasn't really spreading very fast. And it's basically stayed in that range in the in the two weeks before it had been in the 3 range. So here's there's..a good, coherent case.\n\nBrit Hume: There was a study that came out, I guess, yesterday from Stanford based on several thousand patient blood tests, 7000 people blood tests in Santa Clara County, Calif., and it concluded with just what you suggested. And the argument is made about that, that that that test was not really a random sample, even though it was fairly large, because people signed up for it on Facebook. And therefore, it was sort of self-selecting, a certain category of people, many of whom probably were just curious to see if they had had had or had the virus. What's your take on that?\n\nAlex Berenson: I mean, I think that study is not perfect all by itself. It's you know, it's a piece of evidence. By my count, there had been seven or eight pieces of evidence that point in that direction in the last week. There was a paper that was published in the New England Journal that looked at pregnant women in New York City. How many of them had antibodies versus how many showed signs of the virus? And I believe 15 percent of the women had had antibodies, meaning they had already been infected and only a tiny fraction of those had any symptoms. There's a there is a study that came out. This to me was an absolutely amazing one in Boston, looking at people in a homeless shelter. They looked at 400 people in a homeless shelter and 35 per cent of them had had antibodies, meaning they had been infected. And I believe two of those people had had symptoms. So two out of 150 had any symptoms. There's aircraft carrier data, which is actually, you know, aircraft carriers, a big enclosed environment. There were there was an infection wave on a French aircraft carrier. A thousand people tested positive. About 2 percent of those were ever hospitalized. And one of the thousand wound up in the ICU. And I believe he was over 50. So so we're getting more and more data from more and more places. None of it by itself is definitive. But when you have seven or eight studies and that is how many I've counted just in the last week, that all point the same way. There's one. Germany, one from Johnson County, Kansas. You really have to ask yourself, is this nearly as dangerous as we were told it was? Not that. Again, not that it isn't real. Not that it can't hurt people, especially, you know, elderly people and people with co-morbidities. But is it dangerous in a way that justifies what we have done to our society?\n\nBrit Hume: Well, the answer from all the data points that you cite, there would appear to be obviously no. But you have been kind of a lonely voice on this. What accounts for that?\n\nAlex Berenson: I don't know. I think, look, I understand politically the given the pain that some of these steps have caused. Why it is that once you get move forward, it's hard to to sort of climb down from a lockdown... But why the media has behaved the way it has. Isn't it is less clear to me. I mean, I sort of have two thoughts on that. One is that obviously the media is very, very New York-centric. And what happened in New York is exceptional... New York doesn't look like anywhere else in the United States. You know, both in terms of its population density, its reliance on mass transit, and clearly what happened in the city in late March..was bad. You know, a lot of people did die. We don't quite know how many yet. But.. a lot of people died and and that scared a lot of people. And then and in New York, people are locked up in their apartments. Still, they don't want to come out and they end there and they're communicating that fear to the rest of the country where things might look quite different. But the other reason is, and unfortunately, I think this has become a bigger part of it in the last couple of weeks is a lot of people hate Donald Trump.\n\nA lot of people in the media hate Donald Trump. Look, I don't want to talk about my politics, but I will say this. I'm a registered independent, OK? ...I am a registered independent. And it is clear that many people in the media who don't like Donald Trump on some level blame him for everything that's happened and that that seems to have shaded almost into \"we're not going to recognize that maybe this isn't as terrible as we thought it was a month ago.\" And in the Times, The New York Times, where I worked for 10 years and I loved working, could have written everything they wrote about New York City and how terrible things were in New York and still presented a much more balanced picture of what was going on in the rest, the United States. And they didn't do it. And I don't know why.\n\nBrit Hume: So let me ask you about the death rate, which is a pretty good number to use, because it can be compared with other countries. It can be compared with other disease outbreaks and so on. I posted on Twitter some time back [that] it looked like the death rate in New York has been overstated. And the response to that was exactly wrong, that it has not been overstated. Its almost certainly being understated because lots of people have died from this that we didn't know had it or they didn't know had it. And therefore the real death rate must be larger than the official death rate we have now. Do you buy that?\n\nAlex Berenson: So. So this is a really complicated argument and it complicated for three reasons. Two to I would say are real and one is political. The first reason is that, again, because of who's dying with this, who isn't, you know, who's dying with slash of it, that's a hard distinction to make. If you're a hospice patient and you get the flu or you get the coronavirus and you die, did your underlying disease kill you or did it did the infection kill you? I mean, I would say most people would say that the underlying disease kills you. But there's a legitimate point to this point.\n\nBrit Hume: It seems that they're coding the death of anyone who had the disease as having died from it.\n\nAlex Berenson: That's right. And you can argue that either way. ....Some states have decided that you don't even have to have a positive test, that basically it looks like almost anybody who is aged and has any sort of flu-like or pneumonia-like symptoms and dies. You know, in the last month. It's gonna be coded as a Covid death without a positive test. And it's hard to know why. Why the states would do that except to try to get the death counts up....\n\nAlex Berenson: So because there are these problems around coding, unfortunately, the only thing we're gonna be able to look at going forward is all cause mortality. Now, there's how many people died in the United States and Europe. And, you know, we're pretty good at counting deaths. If you die in, you know, anywhere in the world, especially, death isn't usually asymptomatic. That's right. That's right. Somebody is going to notice and you're gonna get your case is gonna be written down. So what's very interesting is if you look at the US, it looks like all cause mortality, all deaths in the US are down this year. And that is certainly true beyond the last couple of weeks. In other words, January, February, March, deaths are down. It was actually a pretty mild winter for whatever reason. And in in Europe, that that also seems to be true, although in just the last couple of weeks, you can see a spike in all cause. Mortality, by the way. It's not it's not a million deaths or you know, or even a hundred thousand. It is. It is in the tens of thousands. It is comparable to a bad flu year. So so in the end, that may be the only number that we can rely on is how many people in the United States died this year compared to a typical year.\n\nBrit Hume: Yeah, I think that's probably what we're gonna end up having to use...because it's the best one and one where we have data. Yep. You know, the data are all comparable. So if you were making policy here for going forward, what would you recommend?\n\nAlex Berenson: So a couple of things. First of all, I'd reopen the schools as quickly as possible. One thing that is maddening to me is that children are in very, very low risk from this and other low risk of infection or simply a low risk for getting really sick. It's interesting. It looks like they may actually be at low risk of infection, too. They're certainly at low risk of getting very sick, much less dying. If you look at all the data worldwide and it's not just children, it's young adults, too. It looks to me like more people over the age of 100 have died from COVA than under the age of 30.\n\nBrit Hume: What measures would you recommend if you reopen the schools for protecting adults, teachers and staff.\n\nAlex Berenson: So you don't really have to worry that much about protecting adults from children? There's evidence that children's viral loads are so low. This is not the flu. In this case, children actually get it from adults rather than the other way around. So look, if there are teachers who have severe co-morbidities who don't want to come in for a while, you know, maybe you have more limited schooling until we figure some of that out. But the idea that we are denying children in education and in some cases we're sticking children at home with abusive or drug using parents, and they can't be seen by any other adults right now. That that is disgusting to me because children are not at risk here. They are effectively not at risk. And [to] anybody who wants to tell me I'm wrong, let's look at the numbers together. OK, so so so the first thing I would do is try to figure out how to reopen schools even in a limited way as quickly as possible. Secondly, I do it. I'd look at in states where hospitals are not under pressure and that's basically every state now except New York. I would very quickly try to move to a phased reopening. So you say you first thing is retail or I'm sorry, first things offices, because there's again, there's very, very little evidence of transmission outside the home, outside public transportation. And to those are those are the two main vectors. And then there are these sort of super spreading events where you might get a lot of people together at a, you know, at a concert or at a sporting event. And there's some spreading there. But in it, there's basically there's no oh, here's the second thing I do right now, as I'd reopen all the parks and all the beaches and everything else, there's essentially no evidence of significant transmission through outdoor activities. And it's really unfair to people to do that to them. So so, OK, so open the schools as quick as you can. Open the beaches and the parks right now and the playgrounds. And then in states where there's where there's not pressure very, very quickly, if not immediately open offices, people need to be able to get back to work. You know, you maybe wait a couple of days if that open stores and... then the next thing is hospitality. Right. Bars and restaurants. And maybe you want to see if there's any evidence of pressure on hospitals. You open those in, you know, in a week or two and then mass events are going to be the last thing that that that happened.\n\nBrit Hume: Would you recommend continued social distancing?\n\nAlex Berenson: I think people are gonna do that on their own. And I think, look, if people want to wear masks, they can wear masks. Certainly, if you're in a crowded subway or something like that, that makes sense. I don't think there's super strong evidence that masks make a big difference. But if it makes you feel more comfortable, it's it's a good thing to do. Oh, and the other thing I do immediately and it looks like we are trying to do this and it should have happened three weeks ago is antibody testing. Let's figure out how many people have been infected with this thing so that we can figure out what the fatality rate really is. ...\n\nBrit Hume: How much testing do you think has to be done before we can get back to [norma]l?\n\nAlex Berenson: So I think so. I think the antibody testing matters. I think the infectious testing is an excuse to delay this. And I so I don't I think it's a I think I think putting this on widespread testing...of people who are actually infected right now is meaningless. If people get sick, they can get tested. I mean, I'm not saying we shouldn't test people. But... saying we need to be able to do a million tests a day before we can reopen is just an excuse not to reopen the country.\n\nBrit Hume: What do you think is behind this? Look what you've touched on this. But I'm really curious because I can't imagine the answer. You got doctors Fauci and Birx... who I find to be serious, qualified, articulate, able. And they're on board with this. They don't seem to yet be having made any kind of a turn in recognition of the data you cite. What's up with that in your view?\n\nAlex Berenson: I don't know why that is. There are very good epidemiologists now speaking out. On the other side, most notably a Swedish epidemiologist who ran Sweden's public health department for a number of years and thinks the lockdowns are a huge mistake. He actually gave a very good interview a couple of days ago where he...talked about this in detail.....When people take a public position that causes massive, massive, massive economic and societal disruption, it's going to be hard to get them to acknowledge that position was wrong or even that even that it can be changed right now in the light of new data.\n\nBrit Hume:...I have one last question. What has your life been like since you waded into this fray?\n\nAlex Berenson: My life has been insane. It's been it's been all this all the time.... Obviously, this has become pretty intense for me. You know, I get a lot of e-mails from people. I try to read them all. I try to respond to as many as I can. You know, other people in the media who don't like me, I don't particularly care about that. But it's just sort of an added complexity to this. So. So but you know what? I don't care. All I want is for the right policy measures to be undertaken. And if I can kind of get information to people who who are getting a totally, you know, or largely incorrect picture from places like The Times and CNN, and I can do that with data then then then I'll do it.\n\n......\n\nBrit Hume: Have you been asked to do a book or have you been asked to write for media outlets?\n\n.....\n\nAlex Berenson: So, yes, I have a couple of publishers have approached me about a book. I've told them I don't even have time to think about it right now, which is true. Interestingly, a couple of media outlets have asked me to write for them, not places like The Times or The Atlantic or places, you know, or anybody like that. ...But places [like] independent investigative outlets are asking me. And I just haven't had time. But you know, it's very disturbing to me to have seen the media group think on this, given the stakes.",

Sign up here.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued an advisory on Thursday regarding a severe inflammatory condition found in children believed to be associated with the coronavirus.\n\nDoctors describe the inflammatory condition (MIS-C) as similar to Kawasaki disease, a rare illness that causes swelling in medium-sized arteries throughout the body. MIS-C can cause persistent fever and symptoms that include hypotension, rashes, gastrointestinal symptoms such as vomiting and diarrhea, as well as elevated inflammatory markers, the CDC said.\n\n\"Healthcare providers who have cared or are caring for patients younger than 21 years of age meeting MIS-C criteria should report suspected cases to their local, state, or territorial health department,\" the CDC advisory said.\n\nMYSTERIOUS CORONAVIRUS-LINKED INFLAMMATORY CONDITION REPORTED IN CONNECTICUT CHILDREN FOR FIRST TIME\n\nThe condition has been reported in recent weeks in pediatric coronavirus cases in a handful of U.S. states and elsewhere. It's raised concern for doctors in New York and California as well as those abroad in the United Kingdom.\n\nIt can reportedly affect children and young adults up to 21 years of age.\n\nHealth officials in New York first warned the public of the mysterious disease in May, after 15 patients between the ages of two to 15, were hospitalized. Many required admission to the intensive care unit.\n\nThe New York State Department of Health also identified 102 patients suspected to have the condition. Many of them tested positive for the coronavirus.\n\nAt least three young children in New York since died after being hospitalized with the rare Kawasaki disease-like illness, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced on Saturday.\n\nMeanwhile, at least three children in Connecticut were being treated for MIS-C, according to a hospital in the state on Monday.\n\n\"Unfortunately, this disease carries features of toxic shock syndrome and elements of Kawasaki disease and strikes school-aged children. While these cases are exceptionally rare, given our proximity to New York where there has been a significant number reported, we have been watching their experience closely,\" said Clifford Bogue, physician-in-chief of Yale-New Haven Children's Hospital, in a statement.\n\nAdditional reports of children having MIS-C have been reported by authorities in other countries -- including at least three patients at a California children's hospital. They all had antibodies against the novel coronavirus.\n\nOn April 26, eight previously healthy children in the United Kingdom who tested positive for the coronavirus were also reported to have the disease -- including one patient who died\n\nDR. SIEGEL ON MYSTERY COVID-RELATED AILMENT IN CHILDREN, SAYS PROBLEM RELATED TO 'INFLAMMATION'\n\nDr. Marc Siegel told Fox News on Monday the danger isn't the virus itself, but the inflammation it causes.\n\n\"That's what we've been dealing with in COVID-19 all along. Not the virus, but the damage it does from inflammation,\" Siegel said. \"Tragically, we're seeing the involvement of the heart muscle. We're seeing inflammation of the arteries of the heart. That's the biggest concern here.\"\n\nKawasaki disease, which is similar to MIS-C, primarily affects children and has less than 6,000 diagnosed cases in the U.S. each year, according to the Mayo Clinic.\n\nThe CDC emphasized on Thursday there is still little known about MIS-C at this time. They said it's unknown whether it's specific to children or if it also occurs in adults.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE\n\n\"There is limited information currently available about risk factors, pathogenesis, clinical course, and treatment for MIS-C. CDC is requesting healthcare providers report suspected cases to public health authorities to better characterize this newly recognized condition in the pediatric population,\" according to the advisory.\n\nFox News' Madeline Farber and Joshua Nelson contributed to this report",

Sign up here.\n\nThe choice before us seems to be no choice at all: stay inside and have no human contact with another soul, keep businesses closed, denying a livelihood to millions, or step outside and risk death.\n\nThough I believe the risk is small when comparing the number of people who have been diagnosed with COVID-19 and have recovered with the number who have died, fear may be the greater threat.\n\nSome of a certain age may recall the fears promoted during the Cold War. There were newspaper stories and TV documentaries about how long survivors of a nuclear war would have to stay inside reinforced shelters until the fallout dissipated to a point it was safe to go out. Then, it was Geiger counters that would determine the level of radioactivity.\n\nCAL THOMAS: AMID CORONAVIRUS, GREATEST GENERATION STILL HAS LESSONS TO TEACH US\n\nToday's Geiger counters are temperature gauges held to our foreheads. Symptoms, such as coughing, sneezing and fever, as well as high-risk factors, such as age and underlying health conditions, are also part of the diagnostic equation.\n\nWe are told to frequently wash our hands, not touch our faces, don't shake hands with anyone, practice social distancing -- we can recite these from memory -- but then we are also told to stay inside and only go out for \"necessities,\" such as food and prescriptions.\n\nGrocery stores where I shop require masks when entering and one-way traffic aisles. A hard plastic \"wall\" separates me from the cashier, who is also wearing a mask. Hand sanitizers and wipes are available at the entrance and exit where cart handles are wiped down after each use.\n\nIf these practices are almost as good as staying home, why can't businesses employing these practices, including restaurants and bars, be opened so people can make a living and not rely on government, whose debt now exceeds levels that will never be reduced without spending cuts (and likely tax increases if Democrats win the November election)? Restaurants can place tables six feet apart. Those operating in warmer climates could add outside tables, benches and chairs. For the fearful, takeout orders could be ramped up.\n\nAs experts have noted, it could be months and possibly longer before a vaccine is created. And there probably is more than one strain, as with influenza, so a single vaccine is unlikely to protect everyone from every strain.\n\nLast Sunday, my wife and I went to a local restaurant. Tables had been removed. We wore masks as did staff behind the counter. We purchased our food, left the place and ate outside without masks where tables and benches were available. There were others there, not all of whom were six feet apart. People engaged in social interaction, which is what humans do and need to do. No one seemed fearful.\n\nAs experts have noted, it could be months and possibly longer before a vaccine is created. Dr. Anthony Fauci, head of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told a Senate committee Tuesday there is no guarantee a vaccine will work. And there probably is more than one strain, as with influenza, so a single vaccine is unlikely to protect everyone from every strain.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nDoes that mean staying at home until perfect safety can be guaranteed? The public won't stand for it. Demonstrators are already petitioning state governments to open up to redress their grievances.\n\nWriting on his Facebook page, rock musician Ted Nugent expresses the growing frustration of many:\n\n\"Why do I have to stay home just because \ud835\ude06\ud835\uddfc\ud835\ude02 are scared?

        "authors": [],
        "body": "Reaction and analysis from RNC committeewoman for California Harmeet Dhillon.\n\nGet all the latest news on coronavirus and more delivered daily to your inbox. Sign up here.\n\nCalifornia classrooms could reopen with modifications as soon as late July, California Gov. Gavin Newsom said Tuesday, bringing a new wave of anxiety for parents, teachers and students.\n\nNewsom laid out the possible change, the earliest proposed start date yet, as part of a reopening plan that would allow retailers and manufacturers to restart likely within weeks. Child care and summer schools along with parks, trails and other outdoor spaces may also be allowed to reopen.\n\nNo decisions have been made about an early school start, Newsom said, noting that the \"learning loss is very real.\" Almost all schools are closed under California's statewide stay-at-home order, and educators and students have been struggling to adapt to at-home learning.\n\nThe state also doesn't have the power to order districts to reopen; changes will need to be worked out between local districts and teachers unions. Tuesday's announcement appeared to catch California's top schools official by surprise, who said in a statement that \"we all heard for the first time today the idea of schools reopening as early as July or August.\"\n\nSuperintendent of Public Instruction Tony Thurmond said \"some major questions\" still need to be answered. \"First and foremost: Can this be done in a way that protects the health and safety of our students, teachers, and school staff?\n\nAt the same time California educators grapple with how to reopen, the state's more than 1,000 school districts are expected to face budget cuts as tax revenue tumbles due to job losses and business closures.\n\nState Board of Education President Linda Darling-Hammond told lawmakers Tuesday that schools need $100 million to purchase 400,000 computers and 290,000 internet hotspots to help \"close the divide and maintain access for students.\" She said most of California's 6.2 million students do have access to technology.\n\nA lot of questions remain about the timeline and structure for schools that reopen, decisions that will be made district-by-district. Many districts already start the school year in August.\n\nWhatever the timeline, school will likely look radically different, officials say.\n\nAmong the scenarios Newsom has previously raised: staggered start times to limit the number of students in a school at one time; changes to recess, lunch and other group gatherings; and a hybrid of classroom and online learning.\n\nOne idea would be to keep students with their previous year's teachers, even temporarily, said Darling-Hammond.\n\n\"Teachers can teach more effectively when they know their students well and students learn more effectively in an environment of trust and belonging,\" she said. She said some experts have said it could last for a quarter \"before passing students on to the next grade level teacher.\"\n\nIt also isn't clear if an earlier start will mean a longer school year or a school year that ends sooner than usual. California Federation of Teachers President Jeff Freitas said it's possible the time could be made up if schools need to close again for a break in fall or winter because of a second surge of coronavirus.\n\nThe schools announcement was part of a four-phase plan Newsom discussed Tuesday to gradually reopen the state when hospitalization rates due to coronavirus begin to stabilize. California remains focused for now on obtaining more protective gear for essential workers and increasing testing and tracing of the virus.\n\nCORONAVIRUS: WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW\n\nUnlike some other states that are already allowing hair and nail salons to operate, those would have to wait until a later phase of California's reopening plan, said Sonia Angell, the state public health director. And concerts and sporting events are even further away, possibly not until there's a virus treatment.\n\nIt wasn't clear when restaurants may be able to reopen for dine-in services. Many have begun offering takeout and delivery since Newsom issued his statewide stay-at-home order March 19, but thousands of restaurant workers have lost their jobs.\n\nAs the state considers reopening, Newsom is juggling a state with a split personality. Officials in some rural counties say they're ready to reopen while urban centers are wary.\n\nOfficials from six rural Northern California counties -- Sutter, Yuba, Butte, Colusa, Tehama and Glenn -- wrote to Newsom Monday asking to implement \"a careful and phased reopening of our local economies.\" The counties, with a population of about 500,000, have seen fewer than 100 confirmed COVID-19 cases and only a handful of deaths. Rural areas elsewhere in the U.S. are similarly reopening.\n\nFor now, Newsom said local governments can only adopt stricter, not looser, measures than the state's plan. Without addressing those six counties directly, he pushed back on a quick reopening, saying it can't be done without better tracking and tracing capabilities.\n\nSutter County Supervisor Mike Ziegenmeyer, who is vice president of a specialized equipment manufacturer, is among those clamoring for shops and restaurants to reopen sooner.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"Our tolerance levels are going down, they're not going up,\" said Ziegenmeyer, who attended a news conference outside the Capitol Tuesday urging greater flexibility.\n\nFor most people, the virus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness and death.",

Sign up here.\n\nVice President Mike Pence is being criticized by many celebrities for not adhering to the Mayo Clinic's guidelines about wearing a mask to help prevent the spread of the coronavirus during a recent visit.\n\nOn April 13, the world-renowned medical center in Minnesota announced a policy requiring patients and visitors alike to wear a face mask at all times. The move helps the clinic comply with guidelines set out by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which previously changed its recommendations \"in light of new evidence\" that shows \"a significant portion\" of those with the novel virus are either asymptomatic -- meaning they lack symptoms altogether -- or presymptomatic, meaning they can spread the virus to others without first showing signs of it themselves.\n\nPence explained his actions to reporters, stating: \"When the CDC issued those guidelines, it was their recognition that people that may have it may prevent transmitting by wearing a mask. Since I don't have it, I thought it would be a good opportunity to be here, speak to these guys and look them in the eye.\"\n\nARE PACKAGES FROM CORONAVIRUS-HIT CHINA SAFE TO HANDLE?\n\nAlthough Pence explained that his decision to not wear a mask had to do with the fact that he's tested for COVID-19 regularly and is not believed to have it, many of his detractors in Hollywood still seized the opportunity to take to social media to criticize the vice president for flaunting the rules.\n\n\"#MikePence didn't wear a mask at a visit to the #MayoClinic because he wanted to look people 'in the eye.' Does he not know the difference between surgical masks & sleep masks? And does Mother make him wear a sleep mask so he can't see other women in his dreams?\" tweeted Bette Midler.\n\n\"World renowned 156-year-old academic medical center. One public visit from the Trump Cartel. Reputation? DING!,\" wrote \"Westworld\" star Jeffrey Wright, later adding: \"'@VP' basically telling Trumplodytes to disregard these doctors and their sciency ideas. Akin to Boris Johnson bragging about shaking hands with everybody in the hospital...'cause that worked out cool.\"\n\n\"What person sees this and isn't disgusted? If they do not lose in a landslide our country has lost its mind. It's not just about him getting sick, it's about him getting other people sick. If he isn't following guidelines he has a higher chance of catching the virus,\" filmmaker Judd Apatow wrote.\n\n\"I've honestly never thought of Pence as a very mask kind of dude,\" George Takei said sarcastically.\n\n\"Pence was warned to wear a mask during a tour of the Mayo Clinic and refused. Do he and Trump think they're invincible or is Pence afraid of Trump? What terrible role models for our nation,\" wrote Barbra Streisand.\n\n\"I hate these people. Hate. HATE!!!!!!!!!\" tweeted comedian Billy Eichner.\n\n\"On #NationalSuperheroDay, @VP Mike Pence reminds us: only heroes wear masks,\" wrote \"Supernatural\" star Misha Collins.\n\n\"Jesus is his vaccine,\" mocked Kristen Johnston.\n\nMia Farrow noted that the Mayo Clinic previously deleted a tweet saying that it informed Pence about the mask policy before he arrived.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"After all the outrage, I guess VP Pence made the Mayo delete their tweet saying that the 'Mayo Clinic had informed @VP of their masking policy prior to his arrival,'\" she wrote.",

Sign up here.\n\nAs most of the United States remains under some type of stay-at-home order, public health officials warn that the\"stealthy spread\" of the novel coronavirus will make reopening society a very complex and difficult task.\n\nOne of the hardest aspects is determining which tests to deploy in what circumstances to prevent new outbreaks from occuring as states or cities attempt to reopen.\n\nPeople who are infected wtih COVID-19 but have no symptoms can still transmit the virus; along with their close contacts, they would need to be quarantined quickly to prevent the spread of the virus, according to the National Institutes of Health.\n\nCORONAVIRUS HAS MUTATED INTO AT LEAST 30 DIFFERENT STRAINS, STUDY FINDS\n\nA second way testing is useful is to find individuals who have been infected, did not get seriously ill and can no longer trasmit the virus. These types of tests would use blood samples to detect antibodies of the virus.\n\nHowever, a new study published in Nature Medicine lays bare the challenges for public health officials as they confront a complicated virus that's still in the process of being understood.\n\nResearchers from China and Hong Kong analyzed throat swabs collected from 94 people who were moderately ill and hospitalized with COVID-19, according to the study's abstract. Frequent in-hospital swabbing provided an objective, chronological record of each patient's viral loads and infectiousness.\n\nAccording to Dr. Francis Collins, director of the NIH, the study's findings indicate the following:\n\nPatients became infectious 2.3 days before the onset of symptoms, on average; their highest level of potential viral spreading likely peaked hours before their symptoms appeared; they became rapidly less infectious within a week, but the virus likely remains in the body for some time.\n\nCORONAVIRUS LINGERED IN WOMAN'S EYES LONG AFTER IT CLEARED FROM HER NOSE, STUDY REVEALS\n\nScientists looked at data from a different study that documented the timing of 77 person-to-person transmissions of COVID-19. Comparing the two data sets, the researchers estimated that 44 percent of SARS-CoV-2 transmissions occur before people get sick.\n\n\"Based on this two-part model, the researchers warned that traditional containment strategies (testing only of people with symptoms, contact tracing, quarantine) will face a stiff challenge keeping up with COVID-19,\" wrote Collins, who was appointed to lead the NIH in 2009.\n\nNIH TREATMENT GUIDELINES FOR COVID-19 DEVELOPED BY EXPERT PANEL\n\nThis type of transmission poses a huge challenge -- in terms of resoures, logistics and sheer manpower -- for public health officials looking to stem the tide of COVID-19 with testing widespread enough to safely bring people back into work and open up portions of daily life.\n\n\"[Researchers] estimated that if more than 30 percent of new infections come from people who are asymptomatic, and they aren't tested and found positive until 2 or 3 days later, public health officials will need to track down more than 90 percent of their close contacts and get them quarantined quickly to contain the virus,\" Collins explained.\n\nThe NIH notes that the private sector has been exploring ways to deploy contact tracing at scale in a way that protects privacy and security, including the recently announced effort from Google and Apple.\n\nAs of Thursday afternoon, more than 2.6 million people were infected with COVID-19 worldwide, including over 854,000 in the United States.",

Pritzker's statewide stay-at-home order, with the Chicago Police Department telling Fox News that three churches will be hit with penalties for services held on Sunday, May 17.\n\nBecause religious services are considered nonessential under Illinois' current order, they are limited to fewer than 10 people. Philadelphia Romanian Church of God limited its congregation to 75 people on Sunday -- less than 10 percent of its capacity -- and was among the houses of worship fined by Chicago for its weekend services.\n\nPhiladelphia Romanian had congregants meet 13 requirements to attend -- including having no coronavirus symptoms and being younger than 65 years old -- and will have to pay a $500 citation, according to the Chicago Police.\n\nElim Romanian Pentecostal Church and Metro Praise International were also fined for their Sunday services.\n\nCLICK FOR THE LATEST ON CORONAVIRUS\n\nILLINOIS CHURCHES DEFY GOV. PRITZKER'S 'ABSURD' RESTRICTIONS ON IN-PERSON SERVICES\n\nPritzker, who has been one of the most aggressive governors in ordering shutdowns to stem the spread of the coronavirus, previously defended his orders keeping people away from where they normally practice their religions.\n\n\"I know how hard it is to break from traditional celebrations of togetherness. But I believe passionately that adapting our expressions of faith in these times is one of the most faithful acts of all,\" Pritzker said in a tweet in mid-April.\n\nHe added: \"The virus doesn't take a day off, and it's important for all of you to have the facts, so I'll continue to deliver them.\"\n\nFEDERAL JUDGE HALTS KENTUCKY GOVERNOR'S BAN ON IN-PERSON CHURCH SERVICES AFTER LAWSUIT\n\nPritzker earlier this month gave a dire warning on the spread of the virus during the briefing on his state's reopening plan, according to the Chicago Sun-Times.\n\n\"I know that we all have a passionate desire to return to the sense of normalcy that we felt before the world knew of COVID-19. Here's the truth. And I don't like it any more than you do,\" he said. \"Until we have a vaccine, or an effective treatment, or enough widespread immunity that new cases fail to materialize, the option of returning to normalcy doesn't exist.\"\n\nA number of other churches in Illinois have filed lawsuits arguing that the limits Pritzker places on houses or worship are unconstitutional.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nElim Romanian Pentecostal Church and Logos Baptist Ministries, both represented by Liberty Counsel, filed a federal lawsuit arguing that limiting churches' attendance is unconstitutional, and pointing out that liquor stores, marijuana dispensaries and supercenters are allowed to accommodate large crowds.\n\n\"Governor Pritzker clearly does not seem to know that churches have the First Amendment right to exist, but businesses do not,\" Mat Staver, Liberty Counsel founder and chairman, said in a statement to Fox News.",

However, young children have been impacted less than adults and a new study indicates children largely do not pass the disease to adults.\n\n\"The role of children in transmission is unclear, but it seems likely they do not play a significant role,\" the research, which comes from the Don't Forget the Bubbles pediatric blog, concludes. \"Changes in laboratory or radiographic parameters are slightly different to adults, and changes usually mild. There is no direct evidence of vertical transmission, and early evidence suggests both infected mothers and infants are no more severely affected than other groups.\"\n\nThe research specifically cited a \"China/WHO joint commission,\" that was unable to find episodes during contact tracing where \"transmission occurred from a child to an adult.\"\n\nPOSITIVE RESULTS OF REMDESIVIR TRIAL 'OFFERS HOPE AT A TIME WHEN IT IS BADLY NEEDED,' GILEAD CEO SAYS\n\n\"Studies of multiple family clusters have revealed children were unlikely to be the index case, in Guanzhou, China, and internationally,\" the researchers also pointed out. \"A SARS-CoV2 positive child in a cluster in the French alps did not transmit to anyone else, despite exposure to over 100 people.\"\n\nHowever, the researchers acknowledged there are \"large numbers\" of asymptomatic cases, which could influence the role of children in passing the disease to others.\n\nThe report also found that SARS-CoV-2 \"appears to affect children less often,\" with \"less severity,\" backing up the findings of other studies.\n\nBloomberg first reported the findings of the study.\n\nIF YOU THINK YOU HAD CORONAVIRUS, NEW ANTIBODY TEST AVAILABLE WITHOUT TRIP TO DOCTOR'S OFFICE\n\nEarlier this month, researchers in Italy concluded that most children who contract the novel coronavirus will recover within two weeks and display only mild symptoms while ill.\n\nIt's presently unclear why COVID-19 seems to affect adults more than children, but there are several theories. One of these theories notes that since children have younger immune systems than adults, they do not develop the aggressive immune response known as a \"cytokine storm\" that adults do, which fosters lung damage and often harms adults.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR COMPLETE CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE\n\nAs of Thursday afternoon, more than 3.2 million coronavirus cases have been diagnosed worldwide, more than 1 million of which are in the U.S., the most impacted country on the planet.",

The condition has also been reported in recent weeks in pediatric coronavirus cases in New York and the United Kingdom.\n\nAt least three patients at Children's Hospital Los Angeles displayed signs of the pediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome, or PIMS, which doctors have said is similar to Kawasaki disease, or a condition that causes swelling in medium-sized arteries throughout the body. Kawasaki disease, which primarily affects children and has less than 6,000 diagnosed cases in the U.S. each year, often leads to inflammation in the coronary arteries, according to the Mayo Clinic.\n\nCORONAVIRUS: WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW\n\nTesting later revealed that the patients who displayed symptoms of PIMS -- said to include high fever, swollen hands and feet, red, cracked lips, and a red tongue and eyes, not unlike signs of Kawasaki disease -- had antibodies against the novel coronavirus, hinting at a possible link between the two, Dr. Jacqueline Szmuszkovicz, a pediatric cardiologist at Children's Hospital Los Angeles, told The Los Angeles Times.\n\n\"The fact their antibodies came back positive means this inflammation may be a response to a COVID-19 infection in the past,\" Szmuszkovicz told the news outlet.\n\nDoctors at Children's Hospital Los Angeles are now reconnecting with patients who were diagnosed with Kawasaki disease at the start of the pandemic to test them for antibodies against the novel virus, Szmuszkovicz added.\n\nThe news comes after British health authorities in a warning to health care professionals in late April said that some severely ill pediatric patients in the country -- including some who were positive for the coronavirus -- presented an \"unusual clinical picture\" that included inflammatory symptoms possibly linked to COVID-19.\n\nThe U.K. Pediatric Intensive Care Society (PICS), citing an email alert from the National Health Service (NHS) in England, said in a news release that health officials had reported \"a small rise in the number of cases of critically ill children presenting with an unusual clinical picture\" at the time. More specifically, it is a \"multi-system inflammatory state\" that may be connected to the novel virus.\n\n\"The cases have in common overlapping features of toxic shock syndrome and atypical Kawasaki disease with blood parameters consistent with severe COVID-19 in children. Abdominal pain and gastrointestinal symptoms have been a common feature as has cardiac inflammation,\" the NHS notice reads, per PICS.\n\nA similar condition also affected at least three children in New York who tested positive for the novel virus, as well as at least one child in Louisiana.\n\nA 6-month-old who was hospitalized in California with Kawasaki disease last month also tested positive for COVID-19, Reuters reported at the time.\n\nHOW THE CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC IS AFFECTING CHILDREN WITH AUTISM: 'WE ARE TRYING OUR BEST'\n\nSzmuszkovicz told The Los Angeles Times that children who have a fever that lasts for four or more days should seek medical attention.\n\n\"Certainly, if they see any of the other signs -- the rash, the red tongue, red eyes -- we encourage them to seek care,\" she added.",

In New York, for instance, at least three children died after being hospitalized with the syndrome.\n\nDetails on the Colorado children's conditions were not immediately clear.\n\n\"Because this is a new and emerging syndrome, there is still a lot we don't know about MIS-C,\" Gov. Jared Polis said Wednesday when announcing the cases, according to the station.\n\nDr. Sam Dominguez, an infectious disease expert at Children's Hospital Colorado, urged parents not to panic -- but encouraged them to be on the lookout for signs of MIS-C, especially if their child has been diagnosed with COVID-19 in recent weeks. The syndrome has been said to affect children who test positive for a current or recent infection of SARS-CoV-2, the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19.\n\n\"This suggests that what we're seeing in these children is a post-infectious or inflammatory response to the virus, as opposed to direct ongoing damage from the virus itself,\" Dominguez said, according to Fox 31.\n\nEarlier this week, officials in Virginia announced what is thought to be the state's first case of the mysterious inflammatory condition, following similar news out of Oregon and Mississippi.\n\nPreviously, Yale-New Haven Children's Hospital (YNHCH) in Connecticut announced three cases of the condition in pediatric coronavirus patients there. The cases are said to be the state's first and have since been reported to the Connecticut Department of Public health, the hospital said in a news release.\n\nThe condition has also affected several patients at Children's Hospital Los Angeles in California, as well as at least one child in Louisiana.\n\nA 6-month-old who was hospitalized in California with Kawasaki disease last month also tested positive for COVID-19, Reuters reported at the time. Meanwhile, physicians in Washington, D.C., have also recently reported cases of the mysterious condition.\n\nThe increasing number of cases prompted the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) last week to issue an advisory regarding MIS-C.\n\nMIS-C can also cause persistent fever, rashes, vomiting, and diarrhea, among other symptoms such as a red tongue and eyes.\n\nCLICK FOR COMPLETE COVERAGE OF THE CORONAVIRUS OUTBREAK\n\nDr. Jacqueline Szmuszkovicz, a pediatric cardiologist at Children's Hospital Los Angeles, recently said that children who have a fever that lasts for four or more days should seek medical attention.\n\n\"Certainly, if they see any of the other signs -- the rash, the red tongue, red eyes -- we encourage them to seek care,\" she told The Los Angeles Times.",

Jared Polis said Monday the state is now offering free coronavirus testing to any residents who need it, with or without symptoms.\n\n\"Cost is not a barrier,\" Polis said. \"There is no copay. There is no out of pocket.\"\n\nHe encouraged those who do have symptoms specifically to seek out testing. \"You really should get tested if you have fever, dry cough, shortness of breath,\" he said. \"Remember the flu is mostly gone, so if you have symptoms, there's a higher chance it's Covid-19.\"\n\nHe also encouraged essential workers, especially those who work with vulnerable populations and who aren't symptomatic, to get tested.\n\nThe Democratic governor said there are 32 testing sites across the state and he hopes Colorado can test at least 8,500 people per day by the end of May. He said the state has the capability to process as many as 10,000 tests per day.\n\nCOLORADO GOV.

Sign up here.\n\nWhen the coronavirus crisis escalated in March, an early concern was the tremendous demand it would place on health care workers.\n\nDoctors and nurses joined the frontlines, while schools pulled medical students from rotations in hospitals to protect their safety.\n\nBut those students were needed and they knew it. At New York's Columbia Univeristy, students have stepped up to do what they can in the epicenter of the pandemic -- from checking patients' vital signs remotely to manning a public hotline.\n\nMedical students David Edleman and Sarah Soo-Woo, along with a handful of faculty members from Columbia's health science schools, created the COVID-19 Student Service Corps, which launched March 18.\n\nThe program is made up of a diverse group of students and licensed health professionals who volunteer to support a health care system that has been bombarded by a deadly contagion.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR COMPLETE CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE\n\nIt began with about 10 volunteers from schools at Columbia's Irving Medical Center.\n\n\"We started to draft together the idea of building a task force to bring students together from all of the clinics and take this anxious energy that people had about being taken away from patient care and put it to good use,\" said Edelman, the CSSC's student co-chair.\n\nCANADA TO GIVE ESSENTIAL WORKERS A PAY RAISE\n\nToday, the program has over 1,600 student volunteers from a range of Columbia schools, specializing in degrees related to health or medical care.\n\nOne of the CSSC's larger projects is to staff informational phone hotlines, which provide the public with up-to date COVID-19 information.\n\nThe group is also running Remote Patient Monitoring, in which students remotely check in with and monitor the vital signs of suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients who are staying at home.\n\nIf the symptoms escalate, an attending physician intervenes to make the call whether a patient should go to the hospital or receive at-home help.\n\nMatt Green, a first-year master's epidemiology student at Columbia's Mailman School, volunteers in that program between classes and during his free time on weekends. He also helps with another initiative that helps patients with non-COVID-19 illnesses book virtual doctor visits.\n\n\"My perspective changed on how much is involved in the health care system since I started volunteering in the CSSR,\" Green said. \"It goes way beyond the doctors and nurses and patients. If certain departments aren't functioning properly, then the health care system is going to be overloaded.\"\n\nDr. Marina Catallozzi, one of CSSC's faculty leaders and an associate professor of pediatrics, said her work for the CSSC has helped to keep her on the task at hand.\n\nWARM WEATHER WON'T KILL OFF CORONAVIRUS, STUDY FINDS\n\n\"At the beginning of the pandemic, the thing that was getting me through and giving me joy was how quickly hundreds of students responded to a survey we put out asking them what skills they can provide,\" she said.\n\n\"Things are shifting on an hour-to-hour basis. Our students and faculty are remarkably agile -- silver linings are important to see during this difficult time.\"\n\nWhen dozens of health care worker were transferred to hospitals with adult COVID-19 patients, Edelman says a team of faculty and students from CSSC created a redeployment guide within 48 hours. The guide provides health care workers from different clinical backgrounds basic information that helped familiarize them with aspects of treating people with the virus.\n\nWhen the COVID-19 hotline started, callers had to wait up to two hours. With the help of more student volunteers, the wait time is less than a minute today.\n\nFor patients hospitalized long-term due to non-related coronavirus illnesses, CSSR implemented companionship programs to check in and build an emotional-support system for these in isolation. Friendly Calls to Seniors, which the group launched last week, connects students with seniors via iPads.\n\nChristian Treat, a medical student at NewYork-Presbyterian Morgan Stanley Children's Hospital, a Columbia affiliate, said it was \"jarring\" when he was abruptly removed from the hospitalwhen the pandemic struck.\n\n\"We want to be able to help out with patient care in any way we can,\" he said.\n\nTreat and others found a way to help with newborns and their mothers.\n\nBecause people are at high risk for contracting coronavirus or spreading it when they enter a hospital, women who had given birth in hospitals were discharged sooner than usual.\n\nIn order to help ease the fears of women as they enter motherhood during the pandemic, students like Treat are remotely checking in on the new mothers postpartum, assisting with lactation complications, providing information for social work and other resources, scheduling telemedicine appointments and reporting symptoms like fever or bleeding.\n\nThey also assist families who need to leave their child at the hospital. If a baby is born premature or with critical conditions, the newborn must be admitted to the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit. Since visitor policies have changed due to COVID-19, NYP only allows for one parent to visit.\n\n\"When I was in the NICU, before any kind of hospital policy change due to coronavirus, an average mom would travel up to 40 minutes to see their baby who can be hooked up to wires, in an isolated or small crib,\" Treat said. \"Now visitor restrictions added another burden, especially if family wants to visit.\"\n\nMedical Students who choose to help the NICU during the pandemic can remotely connect the newborn with loved ones with whatever technology device is accessible to the family: whether it's setting up a video chat with family members to see the newborn or share a voice recording of the baby's voice or a sweet message from the mom or dad.\n\n\"Even if you're just a voice on the phone helping out a patient or connecting a family on a joint video to see their newborn baby, it's really rewarding that I can still help,\" he said.",

As the debate intensifies on whether or not it works, 25 percent of physicians around the world believe health care workers should take the drug to prevent COVID-19 infections, according to a new survey.\n\nThe survey, conducted by Sermo, a health care data collection company, found that one-quarter (5,158) of more than 20,000 physicians around the world believe the anti-malarial drug should be used to prevent infections. Separately, 50 percent of the physicians surveyed have used the anti-malarial drug in professional settings since March 25.\n\n\"Despite the superstorm of controversy surrounding hydroxychloroquine, it still remains the leading treatment option for severe patients and is even being used in milder cases and patients who are simply suspected of COVID,\" an anonymous emergency medicine physician on Sermo said in the release obtained by Fox News. \"At this stage with so little evidence, doctors have very limited options.\"\n\nHYDROXYCHLOROQUINE DOES NOT CLEAR CORONAVIRUS, BUT CAN ALLEVIATE SYMPTOMS, STUDY SAYS\n\nThe survey also found that hydroxychloroquine, which has been used to treat malaria since the 1950s, was used by 22 percent (1,443 instances) of physicians prophylactically by the first week of April.\n\nSome 277 uses were in high-risk patients, including first-responders, and 100 uses were used in low-risk patients.\n\nThe findings from the study found that the drug was also used in undiagnosed cases.\n\nCurrently, there is no known scientific cure for the disease known as COVID-19 and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has cited concerns about hydroxychloroquine as a treatment, including cardiotoxicity, especially with patients who have underlying health issues.\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration recently announced an emergency use authorization to try several drugs, including hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine, despite a lack of clear evidence of their effectiveness.\n\nHydroxychloroquine and chloroquine are antimalarial drugs. No drug should be taken without a doctor's prescription.\n\nThere are at least 24 trials of hydroxychloroquine, a drug President Trump has previously hailed as a \"game-changer,\" happening around the U.S. and many others around the world.\n\nLast week, a study of 150 COVID-19 patients in China who received the drug showed it did not clear the patients of the virus, but it did alleviate some symptoms.\n\nA study recently performed in Brazil had to be stopped early after one group of patients who were taking a high dose of the drug developed heart rhythm problems.\n\nSouth Dakota announced a statewide clinical trial of the drug, Fox News exclusively reported earlier this month.\n\nCORONAVIRUS PATIENT SAYS HYDROXYCHLOROQUINE SAVED HIS LIFE\n\nIn March, the University of Washington and New York University announced an eight-week study that aims to determine whether hydroxychloroquine can prevent COVID-19.\n\nA study published in March by French researchers suggested that COVID-19 patients could be treated with antimalarial medication and antibiotics in the battle against the novel coronavirus.\n\nNew York state recently started coronavirus drug trials in an attempt to control the pandemic's impact on the state, according to Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who announced the state had acquired 70,000 doses of hydroxychloroquine, 10,000 doses of zithromax and 750,000 doses of chloroquine.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR COMPLETE CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE\n\nAs of Tuesday morning, more than 2.49 million coronavirus cases have been diagnosed worldwide, more than 787,000 of which are in the U.S., the most impacted country on the planet.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nFox News' Brooke Singman and James Rogers contributed to this story.",

Sign up here.**\n\nOn the roster: Corona populism - Testing woes deepen - Deal pending on next half trillion - Bernie backers far from sold - The horse was in the barn all along\n\nCORONA POPULISM\n\nOn Sunday, Brazil's populist leader, Jair Bolsonaro, joined anti-quarantine protests against... his own government.\n\nNow, it's obviously more complicated in the sense that aspiring strongman Bolsonaro is directing his ire at parts of the government outside of his direct control or agencies like his health department that have resisted his push for eliminating restrictions.\n\nBut the truth of the contradictory demands for populist leaders in these times is evident. What do you do when you made your bones attacking leaders in difficult moments like these when you're the man and this is your moment?\n\nThere's no reliable information about how bad the coronavirus is in Brazil, especially with Bolsonaro's efforts to discourage official notice of the pandemic. But in a large, poor country with limited infrastructure and lots of people living in very close quarters, the concerns are real.\n\nBolsonaro's core constituency, though, is older, working-class Brazilians who deeply resent the country's cultural shift in the past 40 years. He was swept into power on a social media-fueled wave as a backlash against the corrupt, secularizing, globalist political establishment that has formed since the end of the country's military dictatorship in the late 1980s.\n\nHe was part of the old dictatorship and launched his political career following a clash with the new civilian-controlled military that made him a major media figure 30 years ago. The massive corruption in the ruling Worker's Party in the mid-2010s opened the door for the military and nationalists like Bolsonaro. He formed a new unity party of right-wing blocs, a party that appears to be something of a family business, packed with his relatives.\n\nWhile other nationalistic populists quickly used coronavirus as an excuse to consolidate power, Bolsonaro has been a skeptic from the start. It was Bolsonaro whose delegation to President Trump's winter White House in Palm Beach, Fla. turned the Mar-a-Lago Club into something of a corona hotspot in early March. At a point when many were pulling back from travel, he brought two aides who turned out to be carriers to hang with America's president.\n\nAs Trump and the rest of the developed world last month moved to emergency footing for the virus, Bolsonaro has remained defiant. He has fired two top public health officials for contradicting his claims and continues to demand an end to restrictions on the state and local level. He wants international travel restored, a full resumption of economic activity and strongly hints that the pandemic is fake.\n\nThe protesters who gathered outside Brazil's army headquarters were asking for the military to intervene. There's plenty of junta nostalgia among older Brazilians, so maybe that's not so surprising. But what is definitely a twist is that the head of the government would cheer on those seeking a coup.\n\nBut maybe it's actually quite simple.\n\nIf Bolsanaro was doing what Americans have traditionally sought from politicians - working with his team and apolitically cooperating with his political rivals to produce good government in a time of crisis - he might become the object of the mob, not its leader.\n\nHe could be blamed for both the results of the plague and the consequences of the efforts to remediate it.\n\nIn a country where reliable information is hard to come by and political misinformation spreads rapidly via social media, Bolsonaro and his family could quickly be recast as the enemies of the yearned-for return to authoritarianism. He doesn't (yet) have the power to do be the kind of dictator they want, so why not join them in their calls for dictatorship?\n\nWhen Bolsonaro shouts to the mob, \"We don't want to negotiate anything. We want action for Brazil!\" we know what he means. He's like Willie Stark in \"All the Kings' Men\" exhorting the mob that had marched on the capitol by torchlight to save him from impeachment to give him even more power: \"Gimme that meat ax!\"\n\nSo in his own way, Bolsonaro is using the crisis to try to consolidate power. He's just playing an outside game.\n\nTHE RULEBOOK: JOHNNY B GOODS\n\n\"The standard of good behavior for the continuance in office of the judicial magistracy, is certainly one of the most valuable of the modern improvements in the practice of government.\" - Alexander Hamilton, Federalist No. 78\n\nTIME OUT: TALK ABOUT AN INNOVATOR\n\nThe Writer's Almanac: \"It's the birthday of one of the founders of psychiatry, Philippe Pinel, born in Saint-Andr\u00e9, France (1745). He studied mathematics, theology, and internal medicine before becoming the chief physician at a Paris insane asylum in 1792. Before Pinel arrived, conditions at the asylum were horrible: among other things, patients were chained to the walls, and people could pay a fee to come in and watch them. Pinel put a stop to these practices, as well as misguided treatments like bleeding, purging, and blistering. People generally believed that the insane were possessed by demons, but Pinel argued that they were just under a lot of stress. He started treating patients by talking to them about their problems in intense conversations on a regular basis, which paved the way for modern counseling practices.\"\n\nFlag on the play? - Email us at HALFTIMEREPORT@FOXNEWS.COM with your tips, comments or questions.\n\nSCOREBOARD\n\nTRUMP JOB PERFORMANCE\n\nAverage approval: 46 percent\n\nAverage disapproval: 49.2 percent\n\nNet Score: -3.2 points\n\nChange from one week ago: \u2193 0.2 points\n\n[Average includes: NBC News/WSJ: 46% approve - 51% disapprove; Gallup: 43% approve - 54% disapprove; Fox News: 49% approve - 49% disapprove; Monmouth University: 46% approve - 49% disapprove; CNBC: 46% approve - 43% disapprove.]\n\nWANT MORE HALFTIME REPORT?\n\nYou can join Chris and Brianna every day on Fox Nation.

Public health experts say fast, widespread testing is a key requirement for safely reopening businesses and returning to something close to normal life, because it would allow officials to detect new cases quickly and stem outbreaks. As President Trump and many of his advisers focus more attention on the nation's economic reopening, lower ranking officials are trying to sort out the testing puzzle and individual labs are vying for supplies in a fractured and exhausted marketplace.\"\n\nTrump says he will force private firm to make tests - NYT: \"President Trump on Sunday said the administration was preparing to use the Defense Production Act to compel an unspecified U.S. facility to increase production of test swabs by over 20 million per month. The announcement came during his Sunday evening news conference, after he defended his response to the pandemic amid criticism from governors across the country claiming that there has been an insufficient amount of testing to justify reopening the economy any time soon. 'We are calling in the Defense Production Act,' Mr. Trump said. He added, 'You'll have so many swabs you won't know what to do with them.' He provided no details about what company he was referring to, or when the administration would invoke the act. And his aides did not immediately respond when asked to provide more details.\"\n\nFDA remains under fire - WaPo: \"The Food and Drug Administration, criticized for slowness in authorizing tests to detect coronavirus infections, has taken a strikingly different approach to antibody tests, allowing more than 90 on the market without prior review, including some marketed fraudulently and of dubious quality, according to testing experts and the agency itself. Antibody, or serological, tests are designed to identify people who may have overcome covid-19, including those who had no symptoms, and developed an immune response. They are not designed to detect active infections.\"\n\nPopular support for quarantine high, but partisan divide sharp - NBC News: \"Nearly 60 percent of American voters say they are more concerned that relaxing stay-at-home restrictions would lead to more COVID-19 deaths than they are that the restrictions will hurt the U.S. economy, according to a new national NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll. But while strong majorities of Democrats and independents are more worried about the coronavirus than the economy, Republicans are divided on the question, with almost half of them more concerned about how the restrictions could affect the economy. The poll also finds a significant change in attitudes about the coronavirus. The percentage of voters saying they're worried that a family member might catch it has increased by 20 points since last month's survey. And those saying the coronavirus has changed their families' day-to-day lives in a major way has jumped by more than 50 points from the March NBC News/WSJ poll.\"\n\nQuarantine protests present opportunity for radicals - WaPo: \"A trio of far-right, pro-gun provocateurs is behind some of the largest Facebook groups calling for anti-quarantine protests around the country, offering the latest illustration that some seemingly organic demonstrations are being engineered by a network of conservative activists. The Facebook groups target Wisconsin, Ohio, Pennsylvania and New York, and they appear to be the work of Ben Dorr, the political director of a group called 'Minnesota Gun Rights,' and his siblings, Christopher and Aaron. By Sunday, the groups had roughly 200,000 members combined, and they continued to expand quickly, days after President Trump endorsed such protests by suggesting citizens should 'liberate' their states. The Dorr brothers manage a slew of pro-gun groups across a wide range of states, from Iowa to Minnesota to New York, and seek primarily to discredit organizations like the National Rifle Association as being too compromising on gun safety.\"\n\nDEAL PENDING ON NEXT HALF TRILLION\n\nAP: \"The Trump administration and Congress expect an agreement Monday on an aid package of up to $450 billion to boost a small-business loan program that has run out of money and add funds for hospitals and COVID-19 testing. As talks continued, President Donald Trump said there's a 'good chance' of reaching a bipartisan agreement with Democrats. 'We are very close to a deal,' Trump said Sunday at the White House. Along with the small business boost, Trump said the negotiators were looking at 'helping our hospitals,' particularly hard-hit rural health care providers. The Senate is scheduled for a pro forma session Monday, but no vote has been set. The House announced it could meet as soon as Wednesday for a vote on the pending package, according to a schedule update from Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md.\"\n\nBipartisan House moderates tout 'back to work' plan - Fox News: \"'The bottom line is people I think are eager for a checklist. They want to understand what we think it takes to get everything moving again,' Rep. Josh Gottheimer, D-N.J., co-chair of the Problem Solvers Caucus, told Fox News. The Problem Solvers Caucus on Monday will unveil publicly its 'Back to Work' checklist that is poised to be an influential framework in Washington in future rounds of coronavirus relief packages. The plan got the green light from the group of pragmatic lawmakers determined to deliver Americans some relief. 'What this checklist does is it shows that if you're sincere and you want to put partisan politics aside ... you can actually roll up your sleeves and you can find some common ground that makes a lot of good common sense,' Rep. Tom Reed, R-N.Y., co-chair of the Problem Solvers Caucus, told Fox News.\"\n\nBERNIE BACKERS FAR FROM SOLD\n\nNYT: \"Mary Shippee voted for Senator Bernie Sanders in Wisconsin's Democratic primary this month... Now that Mr. Sanders has dropped out and endorsed former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., Ms. Shippee is torn over whether to once again cast a vote for a moderate Democrat in November, after grudgingly supporting Hillary Clinton in 2016 and President Barack Obama in 2012. ... 'For the third election in a row, to have a candidate you're not excited about makes me a little more interested in voting third party.' ... In interviews with two dozen Sanders primary voters across the country this week, there was a nearly universal lack of enthusiasm for Mr. Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee. Some called him a less formidable candidate than Hillary Clinton was in 2016. Many were skeptical of his ability to beat Mr. Trump. Others were quick to critique Mr. Biden's sometimes incoherent speech.\"\n\nBrian Arbour: Biden's struggles with young voters needn't be forever - Fox News: \"The root of the concern for these figures to Biden's left is that he will not generate sufficient turnout among young voters in November to propel him past Donald Trump. Based on results in the Democratic primary, this concern is justified. ... But like they say in ads for financial products: past performance does not necessarily predict future results. A review of recent elections shows that just because a candidate has a weakness with a particular group of primary voters does not mean he will be weak with that same group in the general election. The warnings that Democrats have offered Biden in 2020 echo those that Obama received in 2008 from Hispanic Democrats that 'he risks losing the Latino vote in the general election if he does not reach out to Hispanic voters.' These warnings were overstated; in November, Obama won Hispanics in a landslide 67-32, a 15-point improvement over John Kerry's performance in 2004 with this group.\"\n\nTrump's economic agenda at odds with GOP anti-China stance - NYT: \"With the death toll from the pandemic already surpassing 34,000 Americans and unemployment soaring to levels not seen since the Great Depression, Republicans increasingly believe that elevating China as an archenemy culpable for the spread of the virus, and harnessing America's growing animosity toward Beijing, may be the best way to salvage a difficult election. ... Eager to continue trade talks, uneasy about further rattling the markets and hungry to protect his relationship with President Xi Jinping at a moment when the United States is relying on China's manufacturers for lifesaving medical supplies, Mr. Trump has repeatedly muddied Republican efforts to fault China. [He] has repeatedly called Mr. Xi a friend and said 'we are dealing in good faith' with the repressive government. He also dropped his periodic references to the disease as 'the China virus' after a telephone call with Mr. Xi.\"\n\nTrump's fights with Democratic governors hint at fall contests - AP: \"The inconsistencies in President Donald Trump's coronavirus response are evident as Democrats show new signs of unifying behind presumptive presidential nominee Joe Biden. Heading into the weekend, the Republican president actively encouraged people to protest stay-at-home orders in a handful of battleground states led by Democratic governors. It could well exacerbate a political divide across America in the coming days. Democrats, meanwhile, are showing new signs of unifying behind Biden following the sudden endorsements of Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren and former President Barack Obama. Biden still has glaring political liabilities, but as the coronavirus continues to define the political landscape, Democrats and Republicans seem to be moving in opposite directions.\"\n\nSMALL-DOLLAR DONORS KEEP TRUMP MACHINE CHUGGING\n\nPolitico: \"The Republican National Committee raised a record $24 million last month, an early indication that President Donald Trump's fundraising machine could be able to withstand the economic collapse brought on by the coronavirus. Despite a global pandemic that has shuttered much of the U.S. economy, the RNC's total represented its best March fundraising performance in history. The figures will be part of a federal campaign finance filing due Monday. ... The committee's March totals are slightly less than the $26 million it raised in February. But the new figures illustrate the potency of Trump's small-dollar machine. The president has monetized the enthusiasm of his base, turning it into a cash spigot that has funded a sprawling political apparatus.\"\n\nDems too - Politico: \"Democrats' digital money machine had its biggest quarter ever to start this year, as online donors poured cash into the presidential primary and helped congressional Democrats build a financial advantage in many of their biggest House and Senate races. More than 4.3 million donors gave $533 million through ActBlue, the online donor platform used by thousands of Democratic candidates and organizations, in the first three months of 2020. The group announced Monday that the quarter set records across numerous other metrics, too, including sign-ups for ActBlue Express -- the feature that saves users' credit card information, allowing one-click donations to campaigns using the platform.\"\n\nBig money, good recruits help Dems in bid to retake Senate - Politico: \"Republicans started this election cycle as heavy favorites to keep their Senate majority, with a lineup of elections mostly in red-tinted states and GOP incumbents favored over a slate of relatively unknown and untested challengers. Now, nearly six months out from the election, Democrats are making them sweat. Republicans are still more likely than not to maintain control, but Democrats strengthened their hand with a slate of challengers raising massive sums of money in races that represent the heart of the battle for the majority, putting control of the Senate within reach. ... Steven Law, president of the super PAC Senate Leadership Fund and a top ally to Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, said in a recent interview there is a sense among donors and allies that it could be a 'challenging election from top to bottom.'\n\nPLAY-BY-PLAY\n\nKevin Williamson: The Age of Hog and Hominy - National Review\n\nPhil Klein: The Coronavirus Generation - WashEx\n\nPergram: Could Trump 'adjourn' Congress? - Fox News\n\nAUDIBLE: HEY NOW\n\n\"It was hard to get it aroused, and it is hard to get it aroused, but we got it aroused.\" - President Trump during his Sunday coronavirus announcements extemporizing while reading an article praising himself for extolling the \"reluctantly aroused\" American way in action.\n\nFROM THE BLEACHERS\n\n\"It's beginning to look like the OPEC deal was just frosting on the cake. The fracking industry will have a major resurgence on its own due to the need to fuel all the gaslighting going on in DC.\" - George Fuller, St. Louis\n\n[Ed. note: I'm not quite sure who you think is gaslighting whom, Mr. Fuller. The term, as I know you know, comes from the 1944 melodrama with Charles Boyer as the villainous husband and Ingrid Bergman as his innocent wife and victim. I don't know if \"Victorian noir\" is a thing, but if it is, this would have been it. Based on a successful play called \"Angel Street,\" the movie tells the story of how a husband tries to drive his wife mad, in part, by fiddling with the gaslights and making her question her grip on reality. I wish I could spoil the ending to spare anyone who hasn't seen this overwrought, overacted, over draperied period piece the hour and a half they will spend in creepy discomfort before the matter is resolved in the final minutes. Anyway, Hitchcock it ain't... But the movie lives on in the term you used which is supposed to mean trying to make people question reality by denying obvious truths. If I eat the toasted raviolis off your plate and then profess confusion as to why you're accusing me of this heinous act or, even better, say that maybe you ate them and are just shifting blame for your own gluttony, then I would be gaslighting you. (For the record, while I might steal your toasted ravs - especially if they're Charlie Gitto's or Kemoll's - I would certainly own up to it.) But I think what I'm mostly seeing in Washington now is just plain hypocrisy and its cousin, willful ignorance. Both sides want the same result but are pretending very much like they are deeply opposed. I guess maybe the gaslighting you're talking about is aimed at voters.]\n\n\"I absolutely agree with your comments regarding the televising of Congress. Yuval Levin makes the point in his most recent book about how democracy and openness are good things, but too much transparency and openness wreaks the ability of the insiders of the institution to compromise and make deals. The new obsession with 'authenticity' and becoming 'your real self' over true character is turning our political institutions, as Mr. Levin points out, into little more than platforms for performative displays. I am a high school student and love your daily political note! I also subscribe to your and Ms. Perino's wonderful podcast, I'll Tell You What. I actually was fortunate enough to meet Ms. Perino two years ago at an event here in Colorado. She was incredibly kind and encouraging and has inspired me to continue learning about and following my passion for politics, history, and economics. You mentioned on the podcast a few weeks back the importance of having something to look forward to each day in quarantine, and The Halftime Report and the podcast are quickly becoming my daily highlights. Thank you (and Ms. Perino) for your good work!\" - Kaitlin Johnson, Conifer, Colo.\n\n[Ed. note: Well that's just about as fine a thing as anyone could ever say! Thank you very much, Ms. Johnson. I will make sure to flag your note for Dana. Please continue to abide well in these straitened circumstances and keep us posted on where your road leads.]\n\n\"Politicians would act a lot faster if their pay was suspended like many Americans. They do little enough for what we pay them so now is the time for them pay us back. I know it won't happen as they only care about themselves.\" - Michael Johnson, Fairfield Glade, Tenn.\n\n[Ed. note: Some more than others, I suspect. There are a lot of really rich humans in Congress, especially the Senate. Interrupting congressional pay would create imbalanced incentives. What if the guy or gal holding things up was protecting your interests? What if they were broke and couldn't miss a paycheck and faced extra pressure to abandon their position? Don't worry, though, nobody is going to listen to my ideas for congressional reform, either. Aside from increasing the number of representatives by about 50 percent and dramatically shrinking congressional staffs, I strongly favor a congressional dormitory. We do away with housing allowances for members but provide a clean, safe, relatively comfortable place for them to bunk when they are in town. Many rich members would surely absent themselves from dorm life, but I think I would be thrifty, encourage humility and develop fellow feeling among members.]\n\nShare your color commentary: Email us at HALFTIMEREPORT@FOXNEWS.COM and please make sure to include your name and hometown.\n\nTHE HORSE WAS IN THE BARN ALL ALONG\n\nHot Rod: \"John Grafelman bleeds Ford blue. He says he is 'always looking for old Fords.' He remembers reading as far back as the early '80s about the long-lost 1969 Ford Mustang Boss 302 prototype once owned by car designer Larry Shinoda. Now, wouldn't that be a Mustang to find? Incredibly, this hardworking farmer from Peoria, Illinois, already owned that very Mustang. Unbeknownst to him, the '69 Cobra Jet fastback he bought through an ad in the local newspaper was that very car. ... The seller made no mention of the car's prototype background. The Cobra Jet fastback's unique features could have easily been lost in the hands of either a restorer or a modifier. However, John proved to be very observant. ... Shinoda always wondered what happened to his old Boss prototype. He sold the hot car to his tailor in Brighton, Michigan, sometime around 1970-1972. That's the last he knew.\"\n\nAND NOW A WORD FROM CHARLES...\n\n\"Those of us wont in private to wax poetic about the beauty and symmetry of [baseball] are wont to wax silent about it in public.

Andrew Cuomo, who has emphasized the importance of antibody testing and contact tracing in order to determine who can safely return to work, said that early results suggested 14.9 percent of residents had contracted COVID-19 at some point.\n\nWhen broken down by region, Cuomo said in New York City -- the state's hotbed for COVID-19 infections -- the rate was about 24.7 percent.\n\nIF YOU THINK YOU HAD CORONAVIRUS, NEW ANTIBODY TEST AVAILABLE WITHOUT TRIP TO DOCTOR'S OFFICE\n\nHe earlier said preliminary results suggested a statewide infection rate of 13.9 percent, which would mean roughly 2.7 million residents contracted the illness at some point, which is about 10 times more than what's been confirmed by COVID-19 testing. As of Tuesday, the number of coronavirus cases reported worldwide had reached just over 3 million.\n\nThe state had expanded antibody testing to 7,500 people, nearly double the total number tested five days earlier. As of Tuesday, 844,994 persons had been tested for COVID-19 statewide, resulting in 295,106 positive cases. New York, a state with over 8.9 million people, also has the highest number of coronavirus-related fatalities in the U.S., with at least 22,668.\n\nBut the state has largely reserved COVID-19 testing for symptomatic people, or those considered to be at-risk who had known exposure, before it began prioritizing antibody testing for health care and frontline workers, presenting a potential gap in the number reported versus the number of infections contracted.\n\nNEARLY 3 MILLION NEW YORKERS HAVE HAD CORONAVIRUS, ANTIBODY STUDY SUGGESTS\n\nAn antibody test seeks to detect IgM and IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, in serum, plasma or venipuncture whole blood from individuals who are suspected to have had it. IgG and IgM are antibodies that the body's immune system produces in response to a virus, and are detectable as soon as several days after the initial infection. While officials have championed the test as a way to determine who is immune to the virus, others, including Dr. Anthony Fauci, have urged caution as it's not yet clear what immunity means for this virus.\n\nStill, the antibody results highlighted by Cuomo are the latest preliminary findings that suggest the true number of coronavirus cases is far greater than those reported by health department officials and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Two other studies involving Santa Clara County in California and another in LA County have suggested the same.\n\nIn Santa Clara County, Stanford University-led researchers found the number of cases may actually be up to 85 times higher than what health officials have tallied, while LA County results suggested the number of infected persons there may be between 28 to 55 times higher than currently confirmed COVID-19 cases.\n\n\"We haven't known the true extent of COVID-19 infections in our community because we have only tested people with symptoms, and the availability of tests has been limited,\" said Neeraj Sood, lead investigator of the LA County study and professor of public policy at the USC Price School for Public Policy. \"The estimates also suggest that we might have to recalibrate disease prediction models and rethink public health strategies.\"\n\nCLICK HERE FOR COMPLETE CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE\n\nIn addition to the risk that \"silent carriers,\" or asymptomatic patients, can pose to others, the new data may also help researchers better estimate the virus' true fatality rate.\n\n\"Many estimates of fatality rate use a ratio of deaths to lagged cases (because of duration from case confirmation to death), with an infections-to-cases ratio in the 1-5 fold range as an estimate of under-ascertainment,\" wrote the Stanford University researchers. \"Our study suggests that adjustments for under-ascertainment may need to be much higher.\"",

She was admitted to a hospital there on Jan. 29, a day after she first experienced symptoms of the novel virus, which in her case included cough, sore throat, coryza and conjunctivitis, or pink eye.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR COMPLETE CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE\n\nShe later developed a fever, which was accompanied by nausea and vomiting, according to the report published in the April 17 journal Annals of Internal Medicine.\n\nOn the third day of the woman's hospitalization, doctors took a swab of her eyes, which detected the virus' RNA, or its genetic material. Her eyes were continually swabbed throughout the duration of her hospital stay.\n\nBy day 20, the woman's conjunctivitis had cleared, but the virus' genetic material was still found in her eyes up to day 21, \"suggesting sustained replication in conjunctiva.\" In other words, the virus was replicating in her eyes, indicating they may be contagious, the researchers said.\n\nAfter initially clearing in both her eyes and nose, the virus' genetic material was detected once more on day 27.\n\n\"SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in ocular swabs days after it was undetectable in nasal swabs,\" they wrote in the report.\n\nThe researchers concluded that the woman's case serves as a good example of how the eyes could be a possible source of infection.\n\nEARLY SYMPTOM OF CORONAVIRUS MIGHT BE DIGESTIVE ISSUES: STUDY\n\n\"We found that ocular fluids from SARS-CoV-2-infected patients may contain infectious virus, and hence may be a potential source of infection. These findings highlight the importance of control measures, such as avoiding touching the nose, mouth, and eyes and frequent hand washing,\" they wrote, noting the case is a reminder of the importance of \"appropriate use of personal protective equipment for ophthalmologists during clinical examination, because ocular mucosa may be not only a site of virus entry but also a source of contagion.\"\n\n\"Furthermore, we observed that ocular involvement of SARS-CoV-2 may occur early in the COVID-19 course, suggesting that measures to prevent transmission via this route must be implemented as early as possible,\" they added.",

Sign up here.\n\nNo one has felt the stress from the coronavirus pandemic more than the nation's health care workers and first responders who are trying to save lives.\n\nWith more than half a million cases and 42,000 deaths, the coronavirus will continue taking its toll on those serving on the front line and mental health experts worry about the long-term impact.\n\n\"Fear and anxiety are as contagious as the virus,\" New York-based psychiatrist and Yale faculty member Dr. Anna Yusim told Fox News. \"With every patient, you have to get them through this trauma and then we have to find a silver lining.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR FULL CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE\n\nA Kaiser Family Foundation (KFF) health tracking poll taken at the end of March found that 45 percent of respondents feel \"that worry and stress related to coronavirus has had a negative effect on their mental health\" and 19 percent said it has \"a major impact.\"\n\n\"We as a nation, are in a situation unlike anything that we've ever faced before,\" Yusim said. \"Death has become this ever-present reality and there is so much uncertainty that everybody is feeling.\"\n\nYusim has been in private practice for a decade and has treated some 1,200 patients throughout her career. In 2017 she authored the book \"Fulfilled: How Science of Spirituality Can Help You Lead a Happier, More Meaningful Life.\" At Yale University, she is in the process of starting a spirituality mental health center within the psychiatry department.\n\nShe is in a unique position to help patients worried about the coronavirus because she contracted the virus, along with her husband.\n\nThe couple attended a Purim party on March 9 and started getting symptoms a day or two later. They also learned others who were at the party came down with it too. Her case was mild, but her husband was hospitalized for several days. Both have recovered.\n\nSince the coronavirus pandemic, her practice has been busier than ever. She's currently treating around 150 patients, including more than a dozen frontline healthcare workers and first responders.\n\n\"A lot of new patients have been reaching out. And I'm trying to accommodate as many people as I can because there is just such a need for that. People need help.\"\n\n\"When I entered nursing, I never signed up for a suicide mission,\" one of Yusim's patients, a New York City ICU nurse who declined to provide their name, said. \"We don't have proper PPE [personal protective equipment] and have had to re-wear single-use PPE several days in a row.\"\n\n\"So we are all really scared of contracting the virus ourselves, especially because now we see that younger, healthy people can end up on a ventilator and die as well. And we don't feel like we're being protected by the hospital or by our government,\" she added. \"It's a relief to have a mental health provider outside of my hospital system who is unbiased in that way, and with whom I have a long-term relationship.\"\n\nA recent report published in the New England Journal of Medicine on \"Mental Health and the COVID -19 Pandemic\" found that \"after disasters, most people are resilient and do not succumb to psychopathology. Indeed, some people find new strengths.\"\n\nSome of Yusim's patients have echoed the report's findings.\n\n\"I do have patients who are also thriving right now,\" Yusim said, adding, \"There's always a silver lining. And even in a case like this, the human spirit is very strong and powerful. People are finding new ways to cope. They're finding ways to center themselves, finding ways to go within and find that still quiet place. And finding capacities and strengths within themselves that they didn't even know they had.\"\n\nSeveral of Yusim's patients working on the front line considered \"dropping out\" and leaving their jobs.\n\n\"Nobody ended up leaving their jobs,\" she said. \"They chose to live with some of the fear, but also with the knowledge that they're caring, they love their jobs, they love taking care of patients, and they're really, really good at it.\"\n\nInstead of seeing patients in her Upper East Side office, Yusim now holds sessions from her home on the telephone or by using Doxy.me, a telemedicine platform that complies with HIPPA federal privacy regulations.\n\n\"What I've started doing, especially for my frontline workers, is in addition to their once-a-week session, I offer them 15-minute sessions or whatever they need throughout the week because it's so overwhelming,\" she said.\n\nAn FDNY paramedic who is another patient of Yusim's explained the most challenging part of their job was going on call after call and not being able to save people's lives. They, like the rest of the patients interviewed for this story, chose not to be named to protect their privacy.\n\n\"When somebody goes into cardiac arrest, you can intubate, breathe for them, do chest compressions, start IVs, monitor oxygen and try to restart their heart,\" they said. \"But the people dying of this virus, they were in asystole [flat-lining] when we got to them and they died immediately.\"\n\n\"On top of that, the shock was how fast this was happening because most of the people had called 911 on their own, and by the time we got there, they were dead or about to die,\" they contimied. \"We had never seen anything like this before, in terms of magnitude and severity.\"\n\nThe first responder has been seeing Yusim for 12 years.\n\n\"When I talk to my family, I can't really tell them anything because what I see day to day freaks them out,\" they said. \"This is my time every week to talk about what I'm going through and really get things off my chest. It's the only place I can really talk and reflect about how I'm feeling without having to take care of the other person. I always feel better after therapy.\"\n\nOne of the greatest mental challenges for people living through a pandemic is the fear of the unknown and Yusim has found incorporating spirituality into her practice helpful.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"For a lot of people, coping involves faith and spirituality and reaching out to something greater than themselves as a way of finding solace in the unknown,\" Yusim said. \"I have plenty of patients that aren't interested and just want psychology and the medical part. And that's completely fine.\"\n\n\"You meet the patient where they're at, but if they are open, I feel that having spirituality enables people to heal even faster and more thoroughly than just a psychological treatment or a medical treatment alone.\"\n\nProject Parachute provides free mental healthcare to frontline workers around across the U.S. To connect go to https://www.eleos.health/parachute",

One of Biden's events was a rally at Detroit Renaissance High School attended by Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and Sens. Cory Booker, D-N.J., and Kamala Harris, D-Calif.\n\nSimilarly, President Trump held a campaign rally in Charlotte, N.C., on March 2.\n\nContact tracers were unable to confirm if any of the people infected with COVID-19 had been at the campaign events in Michigan.\n\nBut political rallies may not be the only culprit that had a hand in spreading the virus. On March 7, 16,000 fans gathered at the Little Caesars Arena to watch the Utah Jazz play the Detroit Pistons.\n\nThe pandemic escalated quickly, and Whitmer banned gatherings larger than 250 people on March 13, then confirmed the state's first case of the virus the very next day.\n\nMichigan has suffered 4,891 deaths from the coronavirus since March and 51,142 people have been infected.\n\nWhitmer has said that little good can come if we \"relitigate every event that occurred in the month or two leading up to our first cases.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"I just acknowledge that we now know that any public gathering is a bad idea,\" Whitmer told The Detroit News in April.\n\nThe Democratic governor has faced intense pressure from her state as violent protestors flocked to the street demanding she reopen the economy after she extended lockdown restrictions until May 28.",

The animals were identified on farms in Gemert-Bakel and Laarbeek and showed \"various symptoms including respiratory problems.\"\n\nCLICK HERE FOR COMPLETE CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE\n\nThe towns in which the farms are located lie within the Noord Brabant region, which has seen the worst outbreak in the country. Some employees at both farms appeared to have symptoms.\n\nThe minister announced measures to prevent further spread, such as a \"reporting obligation\" for farmers, veterinarians and research institutions. The ministry further advises against \"cycling or walking within a radius of approximately 400 meters around the infected mink farm\" while the results of further tests are pending.\n\nThe statement noted that some of the livestock does not appear to be susceptible, so the requirements only apply to mink. As such, the ministry is isolating the animals and manure on the farm.\n\nCAN PETS COME DOWN WITH CORONAVIRUS?\n\nThese mink are the first reported cases of coronavirus in animals in the Netherlands, but other countries have reported cases of infection in animals.\n\nThe first animals to test positive were two dogs in Hong Kong in February, one of which died after leaving quarantine. The dogs had tested \"weak positive\" after exposure to ill owners, leading experts to warn that animals should be placed in quarantine as well.\n\n\"The cat had diarrhea, kept vomiting, and had breathing difficulties. The researchers found the virus in the cat's feces,\" Professor Steven Van Gucht said at the time.",

Sign up here.\n\nCoronavirus infection in children may not start with a cough, researchers warn in a new study.\n\nThe small study, which is published in the journal Frontiers in Pediatrics, says that gastrointestinal symptoms, as well as a fever and exposure to coronavirus, could indicate COVID-19 infection in children.\n\n\"Children suffering from sickness and diarrhea, coupled with a fever or history of exposure to coronavirus, should be suspected of being infected with COVID-19,\" the researchers said in a statement.\n\nCHILLING VIDEO REVEALS HOW CORONAVIRUS SPREADS FROM A SINGLE COUGH IN A SUPERMARKET\n\nThe research is based on five children with non-respiratory symptoms who were hospitalized at the Wuhan Children's Hospital in China between Jan. 23 and Feb. 20, 2020. All of the children, whose ages ranged from 2 months to 5.6 years, were later confirmed to have pneumonia and COVID-19.\n\n\"These children were seeking medical advice in the emergency department for unrelated problems, for example, one had a kidney stone, another a head trauma,\" said the study's author Dr. Wenbin Li, who works at the Tongji Hospital in Wuhan, in the statement. \"All had pneumonia confirmed by chest CT scan before or soon after admission and then confirmed to have COVID-19. While their initial symptoms may have been unrelated, or their COVID-19 symptoms were initially mild or relatively hidden before their admission to hospital, importantly, 4 of the 5 cases had digestive tract symptoms as the first manifestation of this disease.\"\n\nSCIENTISTS TRACK 'ALARMING' CORONAVIRUS SPREAD IN SOUTH KOREAN CALL CENTER\n\n\"The virus infects people via the ACE2 receptor, which can be found in certain cells in the lungs as well as the intestines,\" Li explained. \"This suggests that COVID-19 might infect patients not only through the respiratory tract in the form of air droplets, but also through the digestive tract by contact or fecal-oral transmission.\"\n\nLi says that more research is needed to confirm the findings.\n\n\"We report five cases of COVID-19 in children showing non-respiratory symptoms as the first manifestation after admission to hospital,\" he said, in the statement. \"The incidence and clinical features of similar cases needs further study in more patients.\"\n\nThe coronavirus is widely believed to have first emerged in December in the Chinese city of Wuhan. While scientists have not yet worked out how exactly how the novel coronavirus first infected people, there is evidence that it originated in bats, which spread to another animal, possibly a pangolin, at a \"wet market\" in Wuhan.\n\nPANGOLINS CAN CARRY CORONAVIRUS-RELATED STRAINS, SCIENTISTS SAY\n\nAs of Wednesday morning, more than 4.27 million coronavirus cases have been diagnosed worldwide, at least 1,370,016 of which are in the U.S., according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University. The disease has accounted for at least 292,316 deaths around the world, including at least 82,389 people in the U.S.\n\nFox News' Greg Norman and the Associated Press contributed to this article.

Sign up here.\n\nA new study is aiming to look at the rate of coronavirus infections in U.S. children and the number of those who go on to develop symptoms to better determine how the virus impacts the nation's youth. The study, led by the National Institutes of Health (NIH), is seeking to enroll 6,000 people from families already involved in NIH-led pediatric studies, and will also examine the impact the virus has on children with asthma and other allergy conditions compared to those who do not.\n\nInitially, experts believed that children were largely spared by COVID-19, and while the majority of patients who require hospitalization are adults there have been fatalities and confirmed cases involving youth.\n\nSCIENTISTS CALL ON WHO TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE ON INDOOR HUMIDITY IN CORONAVIRUS BATTLE\n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), approximately 2 percent of confirmed COVID-19 cases involve persons under age 18. In China, 2.2 percent of cases involved persons younger than 19, and in Italy, 1.2 percent of confirmed cases were among children under 18.\n\nThe incubation period for pediatric patients is believed to be similar to adult patients, and patients may exhibit fever, cough, nasal congestion, sore throat, shortness of breath, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, headache, myalgia and poor feeding or appetite. According to the CDC, other studies have determined that up to 13 percent of pediatric SARS-CoV-2 infections were asymptomatic, although the duration of infection involving this population is not well understood.\n\nThe study, dubbed Human Epidemiology and Response to SARS-CoV-2 (HEROS), will follow the children and their families for six months to determine who is infected and whether the virus is transmitted to other family members.\n\nCHICAGO NURSE ON WHAT TREATING CORONAVIRUS PATIENTS IS LIKE: 'IT'S A REALLY HARD TIME RIGHT NOW'\n\n\"One interesting feature of this novel coronavirus pandemic is that very few children have become sick with COVID-19 compared to adults,\" Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), which is part of the NIH, said in a news release. \"Is this because children are resistant to infection with SARS-CoV-2, or because they are infected but do not develop symptoms? The HEROS study will help us begin to answer these and other key questions.\"\n\nThe study, which will be conducted remotely, will require a caregiver to collect nasal swabs from the child who is enrolled in the study, as well as other family members who are participating. The samples will then be mailed to a lab for analysis, and the caregiver will answer an online questionnaire pertaining to symptoms, social distancing, activities outside the home and recent exposure, according to a news release. Additional blood samples will need to be collected at two weeks, 18 weeks and 24 weeks into the study period, which will eventually be analyzed for the presence of antibodies.\n\nShould another member of the family become ill, a separate questionnaire pertaining to whether the infection is COVID-19 will be filled out, and additional nasal swabs plus a stool sample from the symptomatic person will need to be sent to the lab.\n\nThe researchers will also analyze whether reduced expression of a certain gene, ACE2, in airway cells of children with allergic diseases correlates with a lower infection rate.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR COMPLETE CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE\n\n\"So far, data on the extent of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the U.S. population have been limited to people who physically interact with the health care system: those who are tested - especially those who test positive - and those with severe disease,\" Dr. Tina Hartert, lead study author, said in the news release. \"These data provide real-time guidance in a setting of limited test availability, but they don't enable us to understand the full extent of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the entire population. The HEROS study will help fill this knowledge gap and inform public health interventions.\"",

Italy, Spain and France are the countries with the highest death tolls.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR FULL CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE\n\nHowever, as the rate of daily infections starts to fall, governments are mulling plans to reopen schools and shops while delicately balancing the possibility of a second wave of infections.\n\nHere are the European countries that have started to lift their coronavirus lockdowns:\n\nAustria was among the first European nations to restrict the movement of its nearly 9 million citizens. On March 16, the government mandated strict restrictions across the country. Restaurants, bars and sporting events were shutdown with only supermarkets and food delivery services available.\n\nNearly a month later, on April 14, the country began relaxing the lockdown measures. Non-essential stores under 4,300 square feet were allowed to open their doors along with hardware stores and garden centers. Shopping malls and hairdressers will follow suit on May 1. People will be required to wear masks in stores and on public transportation.\n\nHowever, restaurants and hotels will remain closed until at least mid-May, while no public events can be held until at least late June.\n\nBOSNIANS START HUNGER STRIKE TO PROTEST CORONAVIRUS QUARANTINE\n\nBelgium has been in lockdown since March 18, with the country's more than 11.5 million residents ordered to stay home and to avoid being outside as much as possible. With police patrolling the streets, the lockdown measures prevent people from leaving their homes unless for essential trips like a doctor's visit, buying food or assisting others in need. Anyone ignoring the order faced fines.\n\nOn April 22, an expert panel tasked with drawing up the country's plan to ease the lockdown restrictions recommended reopening shops and business on May 4. The panel also recommended a partial return to school on May 18, according to reports.\n\nThe proposals include keeping social distancing measures, masks worn in busy places and 40,000 tests carried out per day on people with suspected symptoms. Also, parks and playgrounds should reopen as well as sports facilities; however, no doubles matches in tennis or five-a-side pick-up soccer.\n\nThe panel also recommended to allow gatherings of up to 10 people on weekends - among close friends and relatives - but always with the same people each week. Cafes and restaurants would remain closed.\n\nThe Czech Republic has taken it first steps toward easing its coronavirus restrictions with a five-stage plan that began April 20.\n\nThe country's tough approach - which included a near lockdown of the country's more than 10 million residents on March 12 - has prevented the uncontrolled spread of the virus.\n\nUnder its plan, Czech authorities reopened farmers' markets, car dealerships, and other small businesses before slowly allowing residents to return to some form of normalcy.\n\nIn the final stage of the plan, tentatively scheduled for June 8, all businesses would be allowed to reopen, including bars, cafes, restaurants and hotels. However, officials have cautioned that restrictions could be re-imposed if there was a sudden surge in cases.\n\nCORONAVIRUS IN ITALY: SAVING CHEESE TO SAVE LIVELIHOODS\n\nDemark was one of the first European nations to announce a lockdown and is now among the first slowly relaxing it. On March 11, the government closed schools, restaurants and non-essential businesses and banned gatherings of more than 10 people. The borders were shut to most foreigners.\n\nJust over a month later, on April 15, the country's children returned to the classroom - the first step in the country's gradual easing of the lockdown. Days later, some businesses were allowed to reopen, including hairdressers, which saw a rush of appointments and visits. Other places allowed to open include tattoo parlors, physiotherapists and dentists.\n\nThe opened businesses must follow new health guidelines. Zoological gardens and animal parks will reopen May 1, while other restrictions remain in place.\n\n\"In this situation, it is very important that there is increased awareness to avoid infection in the population,\" the Danish Health Authority said. \"The spread of infection has been greatly reduced, and we have therefore started to open up the society gradually.\"\n\nDANES RUSH FOR HAIRCUTS AFTER GOVERNMENT TAKES NEW STEPS IN EASING CORONAVIRUS RESTRICTIONS\n\nUnlike other European countries, Germany stopped short of mandating a stay-at-home order for the country's more than 83 million residents. Instead, it issued strict social distancing measures on March 22.\n\nPublic gatherings of more than two people were banned, except for families and those who live together. Restaurants not offering food delivery or pick-up were ordered closed, along with other non-essential shops. Exercising alone outside was allowed and schools were closed. Meanwhile, the states of Bavaria and Saarland put their residents on lockdown.\n\nOn April 20, Germany took its first step to gradually restart public life by allowing retailers with a surface area of up to 8,600 square feet, along with car and bicycle dealers, and bookstores to reopen. Social distancing and new health rules remained in effect.\n\nIn a deal agreed upon with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, state governments are responsible for imposing and loosening shutdown measures. However, restrictions nationwide will remain in place until May 3 with schools planned to reopen a day later.\n\nGERMANY REOPENS SOME SHOPS IN FIRST STEP TO RESTART PUBLIC LIFE AMID CORONAVIRUS\n\nItaly, once considered the epicenter of the coronavirus pandemic in Europe, has grappled with easing restrictions on its more than 60 million residents as the number of daily infections continues to slowly drop.\n\nSince implementing sweeping measures in March and telling Italians to stay home and shutting schools, businesses and industries nationwide, the prime minister said on April 21 that any long-awaited rollback will be cautious and calculated.\n\nWhile the full lockdown is set to end May 4, bookshops, laundries, children's clothing stores reopened in some regions, while forestry workers and IT manufacturers were back to work.\n\n\"I wish I could say: let's reopen everything. Immediately. We start tomorrow morning...But such a decision would be irresponsible,\" Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte wrote in a Facebook post.\n\nHe didn't give any specific details about which businesses would be allowed to reopen first or what limits might be maintained on movement around the country.\n\nITALIAN MAFIA CEMENTS POWER THROUGH CHARITY AMID CORONAVIRUS CRISIS WHILE TRAFFICKING DRUGS DESPITE LOCKDOWN MEASURES\n\nNorway implemented a strict two-week lockdown on public life on March 12, and it was quickly extended through Easter. The government closed schools, restaurants, cultural events, gyms and tourist attractions. It also closed its borders to outside travelers.\n\nOn April 20, Norway began to lift restrictions \"little by little\" by opening kindergartens before moving on to higher grades \"before summer.\" Universities and hair and beauty salons are expected to reopen in late April.\n\nHowever, citizens are will required to work from home and the ban on sports and festivals remained in place until at least June 15.\n\nSince the measures to mitigate the spread of the virus, Norway's economy ground to a halt, with unemployment rising to more than 15 percent.\n\nThe relative success lowering the daily number of new cases prompted Prime Minister Erna Solberg to announce on April 7 that \"Norway has managed to get the virus under control.\"\n\nSpain, arguably the hardest-hit country in Europe and second-worst hit after the United States, has seen a sign of hope after the daily number of infections continues to fall.\n\nPrime Minister Pedro Sanchez declared a state of emergency on March 14, effectively shutting down the country after the virus spread at a furious pace.\n\nWhile the lockdown is expected to stay in place until at least May 3, the government began easing its restrictions on residents on April 13 by allowing some non-essential workers to return to their jobs. A week later, Sanchez announced he would allow children to venture outdoors for the first time since the lockdown began.\n\nSPANISH TAXI DRIVERS, CHAUFFEURS GO THE EXTRA DISTANCE TO HELP AMID CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC\n\nWith more than 28,000 cases and more than 1,400 deaths, Switzerland finds itself among the European countries affected by the pandemic.\n\nHowever, the country took extreme measures to curb the spread, by effectively locking down the country on March 16. Nearly a month later - as the number of daily cases continues in a downward direction - the government has announced a three-phase lifting of the lockdown starting April 27.\n\nThe first phase will include reopening some non-essential businesses such as hairdressers, physiotherapists, medical and dental offices, while grocery stores and supermarkets also will be able to sell non-essential products again. Precautionary measures will remain in place and wearing masks will become obligatory.\n\nThe second phase of the plan, which is set to begin on May 11, will see schools for children of compulsory school age reopen. All stores and markets will also reopen on that date.\n\nThe final phase, set for June 8, will see the reopening of upper secondary schools, universities as well as the possible lift of restrictions on entertainment and cultural events.",

However, it may also cause strokes in patients under 50.\n\nIn an interview with CNN, Mount Sinai Health System neurosurgeon Dr. Thomas Oxley said the virus is causing clots in arteries, resulting in \"severe strokes.\"\n\n\"Our report shows a seven-fold increase in incidence of sudden stroke in young patients during the past two weeks,\" Dr. Oxley added. \"Most of these patients have no past medical history and were at home with either mild symptoms (or in two cases, no symptoms) of COVID.\"\n\nRESEARCHERS DISCOVER NEW CORONAVIRUS SYMPTOMS: FEET LESIONS\n\nFox News has reached out to Mount Sinai with a request for comment.\n\nIt's possible the patients, who are in their 30s and 40s and have mild symptoms associated with the disease, are less likely to seek urgent medical care and call 911 because of the influx of COVID-19 patients.\n\nDr. Oxley and colleagues tested five patients at the hospital, all with mild symptoms, and noted that they all tested positive for the virus, with two delaying in calling an ambulance.\n\nStrokes are caused by a loss of blood to the brain and can result in severe damage, even death, if not treated right away, either by surgery or medication. Dr. Oxley said urgency is of the utmost importance if a stroke is suspected.\n\n\"The most effective treatment for large vessel stroke is clot retrieval, but this must be performed within six hours, and sometimes within 24 hours,\" Dr. Oxley told the news outlet.\n\nThe results of their findings are set to be published in the New England Journal of Medicine.\n\nNew York state is the most affected state in the U.S., accounting for 263,754 out of a total 842,754 cases in the country. New York City comprises 147,297 of those cases.\n\nNeurological impairments in COVID-19 patients have been spotted elsewhere.\n\nIn an April 15 letter to the New England Journal of Medicine, researchers in France spotted a small acute ischemic stroke in two asymptomatic patients. One other patient was diagnosed with a subacute ischemic stroke.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR COMPLETE CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE\n\nAs of Thursday morning, more than 2.64 million coronavirus cases have been diagnosed worldwide, resulting in more than 184,000 deaths, including 46,785 in the U.S., the most impacted country on the planet.",

Sign up here.\n\nA newly published research letter suggests that three healthy families in China may have contracted the coronavirus virus after it traveled via air conditioning at a restaurant that also served infected people.\n\nThe early-release research letter, which will be published in the Emerging Infectious Diseases journal in July, notes that 10 people from 3 different families were affected during the period of Jan. 26-Feb. 10, 2020, at a restaurant in Guangzhou, China.\n\n\"We conclude that in this outbreak, droplet transmission was prompted by air-conditioned ventilation,\" the researchers wrote. \"The key factor for infection was the direction of the airflow. Of note, patient B3 was afebrile and 1 [percent] of the patients in this outbreak were asymptomatic, providing a potential source of outbreaks among the public.\"\n\nCORONAVIRUS MAY BE RESISTANT TO HIGH TEMPERATURES, STUDY WARNS\n\nThe scientists noted that \"aerosolized droplets can remain in the air and travel long distances\" of more than one meter, but acknowledged that in this instance, the transmission of the virus can't be explained by droplet transmission.\n\n\"Larger respiratory droplets (>5 \u03bcm) remain in the air for only a short time and travel only short distances, generally <1 [meter] (2,3),\" the researchers added. \"The distances between patient A1 and persons at other tables, especially those at table C, were all >1 [meter]. However, strong airflow from the air conditioner could have propagated droplets from table C to table A, then to table B, and then back to table C.\"\n\nA recent study from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggested the coronavirus can travel as far as 13 feet in the air.\n\nDespite the obvious implications for restaurants, many of which are struggling during the pandemic, the researchers found that the other 73 patrons were not affected. They were quarantined for 14 days and did not show symptoms.\n\nCOVID-19 LASTS ON AVERAGE OF 18 DAYS IN REALLY SICK PATIENTS, NEW STUDY SAYS\n\nAs a result, the researchers recommended that social distancing practices that have been put in place remain when restaurants begin to open their dining rooms.\n\n\"To prevent spread of COVID-19 in restaurants, we recommend strengthening temperature-monitoring surveillance, increasing the distance between tables, and improving ventilation,\" they wrote.\n\nCurrently, there is no known scientific cure for the disease known as COVID-19. However, there are several trials, including repurposed drugs such as hydroxychloroquine and plasma from recovered COVID-19 patients, currently underway.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR COMPLETE CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE\n\nAs of Wednesday morning, more than 2.58 million coronavirus cases have been diagnosed worldwide, more than 825,000 of which are in the U.S., the most impacted country on the planet.",

Josh Gottheimer.\n\nGet all the latest news on coronavirus and more delivered daily to your inbox. Sign up here.\n\nAt least 72 residents at a New Jersey veterans home have been killed by the coronavirus as of Sunday afternoon, according to state officials.\n\nNew Jersey Veterans Home at Paramus provides military veterans and their family members long-term care. The virus has decimated the home and 113 of the 211 still living there have tested positive for the virus. The surge in cases prompted two state representatives to demand a federal inquiry last month.\n\nNATIONAL GUARD DEPLOYED TO NJ VETERANS HOME AS CORONAVIRUS OUTBREAK LEAVES 37 DEAD IN TWO WEEKS\n\n\"The whole place is sick now,\" said Mitchell Haber, whose Army veteran father, 91, died at the home last month, according to the New York Times.\n\n\"What they should really do is raze it and put a park there,\" he added. \"It's like a mass shooting.\"\n\nMore than half of New Jersey's COVID-19 deaths are reportedly linked to long term care facilities.\n\nThe Paramus facility had 336 beds, and 285 occupants as of last month, according to NorthJersey.com. It stopped admissions of new residents in March to ensure it had enough space to isolate coronavirus patients, said Kryn Westhoven, a spokesman for the New Jersey Department of Military and Veterans Affairs -- which runs the home and two others in the state.\n\nRelatives said their loved ones were routinely brought in to sit in the common areas at the facility, the paper reported. Little or no information about the virus was shared until deaths were eventually reported, which prompted National Guard medics to be deployed to the home.\n\n\"They really kind of held the truth from everyone,\" said Stephen Mastropietro, whose 91-year-old father, Thomas, died from coronavirus complications last month.\n\nWesthoven said much of the population was old, with respiratory conditions, including pulmonary disease -- making them vulnerable to severe illness when infected with the virus.\n\nIn addition to residents, the virus has also infected nearly 1/4 of staff at the home. At least 86 of the Paramus's 361 facility staff are confirmed to have the coronavirus, while 30 test results are pending.\n\nSCORES OF VETERANS KILLED IN 'HORRIFIC' CORONAVIRUS OUTBREAK AT MASSACHUSETTS ELDER CARE FACILITY\n\nThe state didn't require nursing home staff members to wear masks until March 30.\n\nRobert Little, a regional director for the American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees told the website that management at Paramus failed to adequately provide proper protective equipment for its workers.\n\n\"It's a disgrace in this day and age that a facility like Paramus ... [is] not prepared and could not have had everything we needed to protect the employees,\" Little said. \"It wasn't that we didn't fight for those protections. They weren't there.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Westhoven said, \"We are doing everything within our ability to protect the staff and residents alike.\" All staff members are subject to temperature checks and are asked questions to screen for COVID-19 symptoms.\"\n\n\"We are immensely proud of all of our staffers fighting to save lives and protect residents from this virus,\" he added, according to NorthJersey.com.\n\nThe virus has also severely impacted other veterans homes in the state. Of the remaining 190 residents at New Jersey's Menlo Park Veterans Memorial Home, 90 are currently infected with the virus. At least 55 people at the home have died from coronavirus complications, while 77 of its 445 staff members have tested positive, according to nj.gov.\n\nIn response to the virus, more than 150 Citizen-Soldiers and Airmen had been assigned to the Paramus and Menlo Park to assist with the care and security of their residents.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE CORNAVIRUS COVERAGE\n\nNew Jersey has seen more than 138,754 confirmed coronavirus cases and at least 9,256 deaths from the virus as of early Monday, according to data from Johns Hopkins.",

The Paris study found that few who had contracted the virus were regular smokers compared to the general population.\n\nResearchers emphasized that the study was not intended to encourage people to take up smoking, which carries other fatal health risks and kills as much as 50 percent of those who take it up.\n\nWhile nicotine may prevent smokers from contracting the virus, those who do catch it could face more serious symptoms due to the harsh effect of tobacco smoke on the lungs.\n\nFRANCE'S MACRON LOOKS TO LIFT CORONAVIRUS LOCKDOWN ON CERTAIN BUSINESSES ON MAY 11\n\nThe team theorized that nicotine could prevent the virus from infecting cells or that nicotine was preventing the immune system from overreacting to the virus, according to The Guardian.\n\nFor the original study, performed at Piti\u00e9 Salp\u00eatri\u00e8re, part of the H\u00f4pitaux de Paris, the team examined 480 patients who tested positive for coronavirus. Of those, 350 were hospitalized and the remainder recovered at home.\n\nResults showed that of the patients hospitalized, who had a median age of 65, only 4.4 percent were regular smokers. Among those recovering at home, whose median age was 44, 5.3 percent smoked.\n\nCompared to the general population, 40 percent of those between the ages of 44 and 53 smoke and 11 percent of those aged 65 to 75 smoke.\n\nThese findings will be verified in the new clinical study where health workers and coronavirus patients will be given nicotine patches.\n\nRenowned French neurobiologist Jean-Pierre Changeux, who reviewed the study, told The Guardian that nicotine may be hindering the virus from entering the body's cells and preventing its spread.\n\nThe results fall in line with a Chinese study published at the end of March in the New England Journal of Medicine which suggested 12.6 percent of 1,000 people infected with the virus were smokers while in China, 28 percent of the general population smoke regularly.\n\nIn France, figures from Paris hospitals showed that of 11,000 patients admitted to the hospital with coronavirus, 8.5 percent were smokers. The total number of smokers in France is estimated to be 25.4 percent.\n\n\"Our cross-sectional study strongly suggests that those who smoke every day are much less likely to develop a symptomatic or severe infection with Sars-CoV-2 compared with the general population,\" the Piti\u00e9-Salp\u00eatri\u00e8re report authors wrote.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"The effect is significant. It divides the risk by five for ambulatory patients and by four for those admitted to hospital. We rarely see this in medicine,\" it added.",

Sign up here.\n\nFor veteran Megan Kingston, the coronavirus presented extra danger due to her exposure to the smoke that emanated day and night from the burn pits near her barracks at Camp Liberty in Iraq.\n\n\"The odds were not in my favor,\" Kingston, of Northern Virginia, says to Fox News regarding her recent exposure to COVID-19. \"We were all kind of like going, how did I even pull this one off? It's a miracle for sure.\"\n\nKingston served as an Army medic from 2005 to 2009 when she was stationed in Baghdad and then joined the federal government as a counterterrorism officer and served another eight years there until she developed constrictive bronchiolitis in 2018 and was forced to retire. Like scores of other veterans who served in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, she draws a direct connection from burn pits to her illness. Burn pits are a crude method of incineration in which virtually every piece of waste was burned, including plastics, batteries, appliances, medicine, dead animals and even human waste.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR FULL CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE\n\nThe items often were set ablaze with jet fuel as the accelerant, and the pits burned more than 1,000 different chemical compounds day and night. Most service members breathed in toxic fumes with no protection. Kingston says the pit near her barracks at Camp Liberty was the largest in the country.\n\n\"I figured something was going to happen to us eventually,\" she says. \"As a medic, looking at all that [smoke], I knew it was toxic. A firefighter knows that you put on a breathing apparatus when you see smoke like that and you don't even go into the building unless you're on air. And we were next to that, breathing it in all the time.\"\n\nMany veterans like Kingston have developed a myriad of respiratory issues and other serious ailments believed to be a result of burn pit exposure. Many are immuno-compromised and face an increased vulnerability to COVID-19.\n\nCORONAVIRUS CAUSE FOR CONCERN AMONG BURN PIT VETERANS\n\n\"If you had burn pit-exposed lungs and you have more respiratory inflammation on a normal day, you have more vulnerability to the virus once it hits your lungs. So it's a very good time to avoid, avoid, avoid getting infected,\" Dr. Nancy Klimas, director of Institute for Neuro-Immune Medicine at Florida's Nova Southeastern University, said to Fox News in a March 25 report on the dangers burn pits veterans face with the coronavirus. \"Once infected, they have a greater risk of having a more serious form of the illness.\"\n\nIt was just three weeks ago when Kingston, who already wears an oxygen tube to assist with her breathing, developed COVID-19 symptoms.\n\n\"It was one day a couple of weeks ago. I started shivering. So, I checked, and my temperature was normal,\" she says. \"I go to bed early and the next morning, I woke up with a 102-degree fever. I went to my respiratory clinic and was swabbed for COVID and had a chest X-ray, which showed I had double pneumonia. They started me on antibiotics and sent me home. They called me back two days later for the swab results. I had tested positive for COVID. I ended up in the hospital that night.\"\n\nKingston says she spent a total of six days in treatment placed on multiple antibiotics and IV medications along with breathing treatments every few hours.\n\n\"It was quite a fight,\" she says. \"Double pneumonia. The fever for multiple days. The body aches. The bloody noses. Even my eyeballs were in pain.\"\n\nShe was released after making a full recovery.\n\n\"Even my doctors are completely shocked at how well I recovered,\" she said. \"It could have been an attribution of a multitude of things. Maybe it was the combination of antibiotics I was on or the fact that we started intervention early at the hospital instead of waiting at home. It could have even been due to the shots I got during my military service. The shots everyone gets when going overseas for malaria or stuff like that.\"\n\nThe vet says that one of her doctors believes that her blood work should be sent for further testing to see what kind of antibodies she may possess.\n\n\"He wants me to donate my plasma,\" she said. \"So, they can study it and may use it to help other people since one of the treatments is using the plasma from people who have survived.\"\n\nOn May 5, the Department of Veterans Affairs warned veterans who had been exposed to burn pits that they could face additional respiratory risks if they contract COVID-19.\n\n\"We do know that veterans who are over the age of 65 or who have underlying health conditions such as asthma, chronic lung problems or other underlying medical issues may be more susceptible and experience more severe symptoms if infected with the coronavirus as is seen in the general population,\" VA officials said in a press release.\n\nVA HOSPITALS LACK ADEQUATE CORONAVIRUS TESTING, PROTOCOL ACCORDING TO NEW REPORT\n\nSen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., a longtime advocate for providing assistance to veterans who were exposed to burn pits, recently called upon VA Secretary Robert Wilkie to take additional measures to make certain that our at-risk veterans - including those exposed to burns pits and other toxic substances - receive the care they need during the coronavirus pandemic.\n\n\"Many of our veterans are particularly vulnerable to the coronavirus pandemic, especially those who were stationed near burn pits,\" Klobuchar said in a statement provided to Fox News. \"Many of our service members suffer significant respiratory illnesses as a result of being exposed to toxic substances from burn pits during the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, and now they may face heightened health risks during the pandemic due to the toxic exposure. I have called on the VA to take further measures to ensure that our veterans receive the care they need.\"\n\nThe VA's announcement came as its health system saw coronavirus-related deaths rise more than 80 percent over one week and yts registry for veterans who believe they were made sick from burn pit exposure reached a record 200,000 signatories.\n\nOfficials for the VA tell Fox News that it has implemented several communication methods since March to keep veterans informed, including text messaging, emails and continually updating its coronavirus-focused websites and blogs.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"As America deals with COVID-19, VA has proactively implemented appropriate measures to ensure the safest health care environment for each Veteran, visitor, and employee,\" VA Press Secretary Christina Noel said in a statement provided to Fox News. \"These measures include multi-channel outreach to Veterans and staff, clinical screening at VA health care facilities, as well as protective procedures for patients admitted to community living centers and spinal cord injury units.\"",

Sign up here.\n\nDr. Manny Alvarez, Fox News's senior managing editor for health news, appeared on \"Special Report with Bret Baier\" where he answered questions regarding coronavirus testing.\n\nCORONAVIRUS: WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW\n\nQuestion: Unless you take all of the precautions, wearing a mask properly, washing your hands properly, knowing how to take gloves off properly, there is the potential for infection. So I think that all this screaming about testing is setting up a straw man just for criticism. What are your thoughts?\n\n\"That's why a lot of the focusing has been to test people who have symptoms and people that are very vulnerable,\" Alvarez said. \"I get calls every day, you know, 'Can I get tested? Can I get tested?' And then I'd say, well, for what? You know, because you, you're negative today and 72 hours later, you can turn out to be positive. So we have to be careful with this concept of testing.\"\n\n\"I think that vulnerable people, people in high-risk places and definitely folks that are having symptoms should be tested for the coronavirus,\" Alvarez added.\n\nQuestion: How long can you be asymptomatic and still be a carrier of COVID-19? Does it run its course like a normal virus might after 15 days or even six weeks?\n\n\"Asymptomatic folks, just like the word says, they have no symptoms and they can carry the virus. Well, we still don't know. But I would argue it would be a set number of days, perhaps 14, 15, 16 days that those people can be infectious. And that's the big trick that we have. Because you have asymptomatic people, let's say they're outside. They don't take precautions and they can inadvertently infect somebody,\" Alvarez explained. \"So I think as we get more information, you're going to see that more readily available and better decisions will be made in the future. But yeah, I would say 14, 15 days, if you test positive.\"\n\n\"You still have to be very, very careful about, you know, infecting others,\" Alvarez added.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nQuestion: If you test positive in the antibodies test, can you still carry, transmit the virus?\n\n\"The antibody test is still a work in progress as far as I'm concerned. You know, we don't know if the antibody test is also going to show positive antibodies for other coronaviruses. Remember that the common cold is a coronavirus-type of a virus,\" Alvarez said. \"So you can argue that if you test positive, let's say, without having symptoms, if you randomly left the house and you have your antibody testing and they came back positive that those antibodies may not reflect something that happened within, not with another coronavirus.\"",

Sign up here.\n\nWhile expectant mothers may be weighing the option of home births to avoid the risk of contracting coronavirus while in the hospital, one experienced obstetrician is advising against it.\n\nHome births typically do not have access to emergency interventions and monitoring, and the risk of newborn death is double compared to delivering at a hospital or birth center, while the risk of brain injury to the child is tripled, according to Dr. Adam Wolfberg, obstetrician and chief medical officer with Ovia Health.\n\n\"As an obstetrician, I never recommend home births,\" Wolfberg told Fox News. \"As much as somebody might want it, I just don't think it's safe for mom or for baby.\"\n\nCLICK HERE FOR FULL CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE\n\nWolfberg worries for pregnant moms considering home births considering \"how thinly stretched the EMS system is,\" and the full measures being taken by hospitals to reduce the risk of coronavirus infection cannot be replicated in a home setting. Though Wolfberg is an advocate for midwifery and said midwife-attended deliveries are just as good as those attended by an obstetrician, he mainly worries about the lack of access to emergency interventions and monitoring.\n\nEarly in the coronavirus outbreak, Ovia Health sent weekly anonymous surveys to app users, asking women about prenatal care experience and labor and delivery, including whether the woman was planning on a home birth. The surveys are intended to help the obstetric community understand the shifting landscape amid the pandemic.\n\nCORONAVIRUS: WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW\n\nWolfberg said, prior to the coronavirus, about .9 percent of users reported plans for a home birth, which directly tracks with the national obstetric experience. Since the coronavirus outbreak, the weekly surveys report back 2.5 percent of users contemplating home births.\n\n\"If their plan holds true, we're seeing potentially a tripling of home births compared to normal times and I find that really concerning,\" the obstetrician said.\n\nApp users also report their concerns, the most frequent of which were for their personal health and approaching delivery experience.\n\nOvia Health also arranged a COVID-19 symptom tracker based on CDC guidance, which as of Friday had been used by nearly 174,000 women. Wolfberg said some symptoms are specific to pregnancy, such as gastrointestinal upset. The tracker was the first widely available COVID-19 symptom tracker for pregnant women, with others following later on, he added.\n\nWolfberg delivers babies twice per week at a Cambridge Hospital in Massachusetts and described the labor and delivery environment there.\n\n\"There's loads of fear. Patients have to put a mask on when coming into a facility. They are surrounded by people like me who are wearing N95s and face shields, dressed head-to-toe in protective garb that we never would've used,\" Wolfberg said. \"Fortunately, amidst the fear, there's joy and happiness and there's new life and that hasn't changed.\"\n\nCORONAVIRUS IS CHANGING PREGNANCY FOR MANY, BUT FINDING NEW WAYS TO CELEBRATE CAN BRING COMFORT, EXPERT SAYS\n\nOn a positive note, Wolfberg mentioned about a 50 percent reduction in length of hospital stay for his patients. Typically, new mothers who deliver babies vaginally stayed in the hospital for two days, with a four-day stay after cesarean sections. Amid COVID-19, those hospital stays now last 24 and 48 hours, respectively.\n\n\"It's a restricted experience. ... It's not less safe, we're able to practice obstetrics as safely as we always have,\" Wolfberg said.\n\nIn March, some private New York hospitals moved to ban spouses, partners and other support persons accompanying women during labor and delivery, but after an immediate outcry, the state reversed the policy. Where Wolfberg practices, he said only one support person can accompany the laboring mother, and if the support person leaves the hospital, they cannot come back.\n\nDespite modifications to births in hospital settings during the pandemic, Wolfberg assures expecting mothers of their safety.\n\n\"Women should remain confident that their health care provider is going to make sure that they have a safe pregnancy and a safe delivery,\" he told Fox News. \"It's going to look a little bit different but at the end of it, they and their baby will be fine. I have enormous confidence in that.\"",

Sign up here.\n\nAs the debate builds over when and how to reverse the economic shutdowns and stay-at-home orders meant to slow the spread of the coronavirus, government statistics show the disease poses a significant danger to older generations yet largely spares those in their middle age or younger.\n\nWhile this disparity was previously known, statistics released as the pandemic goes on starkly illustrate its real-life effects. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) statistics show more than 80 percent of those dying of the virus are over 65 years old.\n\nThe CDC on its website reports 68,998 total deaths in the U.S. as of May 16, with 55,651 of those deaths, or 80.6 percent, covering people over 65 years old.\n\nThe CDC's official count is lower than the actual number of American coronavirus deaths, which is now upward of 90,000, \"because of the lag in time between when the death occurred and when the death certificate is completed, submitted to NCHS and processed for reporting purposes.\" But the agency's reporting underscores prior warnings that the coronavirus generally hits the elderly the hardest.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR FULL CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE\n\nILLINOIS HOUSE VOTES TO REMOVE REPUBLICAN REP FROM SESSION FOR REFUSING TO REMOVE MASK\n\nThe numbers in individual states, which are reported more quickly and often in more detail, can be even starker, some observers have pointed out. In Pennsylvania as of May 17, for example, 87.4 percent of reported deaths are in people 65 years old or older, and 44 percent of deaths have been in people over 84 years old. Just over half of Pennsylvania's deaths have occurred in hospitals, but a whopping 43.4 percent have happened at long-term care facilities.\n\nIn Massachusetts, 21,177 of 87,925 confirmed coronavirus cases, or 24 percent, are in people 70 years old and above. Of those who have died, 5,058 of 5,938 are aged 70 and above -- or 85 percent. Those numbers also represent a striking rate of mortality among people over 70 years old of nearly 24 percent, at least in Massachusetts' official numbers.\n\nJust 1.5 percent of reported deaths in Massachusetts are among people aged 50-59.\n\nCounts at both the national and state level are complicated by factors including different methods of reporting, deaths erroneously reported as other illnesses, incomplete testing that leaves many who have come down with the virus but have no or only minor symptoms uncounted and time lag as information trickles up between different agencies and governments. But the numbers still illustrate that older Americans who catch the disease are in significant danger while their younger counterparts are at much less risk.\n\nNY, NJ LAWMAKERS WANT PROBES INTO HOW STATES HANDLED COVID-19 IN NURSING HOMES\n\nThis was a point made by Dr. Simone Gold, an emergency medicine specialist based in Los Angeles, in a conversation with Fox News on Wednesday. Gold is the co-founder of \"A Doctor a Day,\" a group of doctors who oppose state-imposed shutdowns over the potential health harms of the measures.\n\n\"When you look at the data of the deaths and the critically ill, they are patients who were very sick to begin with,\" she said, \"There's always exceptions. ... But when you look at the pure numbers, it's overwhelmingly patients who are in nursing homes and patients with serious underlying conditions. Meaning, that that's where our resources should be spent. I think it's terribly unethical... part of the reason why we let [the virus] fly through the nursing homes is because we're diverting resources across society at large. We have limited resources, we should put them where it's killed people.\"\n\nPeople of all ages, of course, have been shown to catch the coronavirus. And there have been reported health complications even in children that could potentially be linked to the disease. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Director Dr. Anthony Fauci in a Senate hearing last week warned that it is still unclear if there could be long-term harm to children associated with the coronavirus.\n\nFAUCI, IN SENATE TESTIMONY, WARNS OF NEW CORONAVIRUS 'OUTBREAKS' IF STATES JUMP 'CHECKPOINTS' TO REOPEN\n\n\"We don't know everything about this virus ... especially when it comes to children,\" Fauci said in the Senate hearing. \"We ought to be careful and not cavalier.\"\n\nBut with nearly 39 million Americans out of work due to the economic shutdowns, hospitals deftly managing their coronavirus caseloads without being overwhelmed and some doctors who oppose the shutdowns warning that the health effects of forcing people to stay at home are becoming a \"mass casualty incident,\" some are aggressively angling to lift the restrictions soon.\n\nFauci, on the other hand, has touted reopening guidelines released by the White House which require states to have two uninterrupted weeks of declining case numbers before proceeding to the first, limited reopening phase. States would then have to continue to meet certain benchmarks before opening further.\n\n\"As I have said many times publicly, what we have worked out is a guideline framework for how to open America again,\" Fauci said at the hearing last week. \"If some areas - cities, states or what have you - jump over those barriers, checkpoints and prematurely open up without having the capability of being able to respond effectively, and efficiently, my concern is that we will start to see little spikes that might turn into outbreaks.\"\n\nFauci, the face of the White House coronavirus task force, added that places that reopen early could bring about preventable \"suffering and death\" and \"turn the clock back instead of going forward.\"\n\nHUNKER DOWN: SOME STATES SAY NO FULL-SCALE REOPENING UNTIL CORONAVIRUS VACCINE, TREATMENT IS READY\n\nThe battle over sending children back to school, adults back to their offices and letting people engage in activities like eating out or attending sporting events has led to passionate differences in opinion among government officials, medical experts and the general population.\n\nPresident Trump has repeatedly said he wants to \"reopen our country\" while some governors have vowed not to fully reopen until there is a vaccine or a treatment for the coronavirus.\n\n\"Until either a proven vaccine is in our midst or proven therapeutics are widely available, we cannot firmly enter the new normal, which eventually awaits us when life will once again return to all of our workplaces, downtowns and main streets,\" New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy said in a press conference earlier this week. \"Most importantly, we will continue to be guided by the principle that public health creates economic health. And if we begin to see a backslide in public health, we will have to also pull back on the reins of our restart.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nMost medical experts, including Fauci, have urged caution as states move to reopen, but some are becoming more concerned about the health effects of continuing the lockdowns.\n\nProtests against the coronavirus restrictions have swept through many state capitals, but an Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll released Tuesday found 83 percent of Americans are at least somewhat concerned that lifting restrictions in their area will lead to additional infections, with 54 percent saying they are very or extremely concerned that such steps will result in a spike of COVID-19 cases.\n\nFox Business' Megan Henney and The Associated Press contributed to this report.",

        "body": "Dr. David Weiner, of the Wistar Institute, weighs in on 'America's Newsroom.'\n\nGet all the latest news on coronavirus and more delivered daily to your inbox. Sign up here.\n\nIOWA CITY, Iowa (AP) -- His mother first fell sick a month ago with an illness she believes she caught at the Iowa egg factory where she works.\n\nHis younger sister, 22, was next -- a new mother who was soon on a ventilator fighting for her life. Then the coronavirus came for his father, Jose Gabriel Martinez, 58, who died Tuesday in the same hospital where he lived his final days near his unknowing daughter.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR COMPLETE CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE\n\nAfter a month of caring for his virus-stricken family, firefighter Omar Martinez is now planning a funeral for his father, who was a factory worker known for giving his all to provide for his family. He's hoping for the recovery of his sister Evelyn, who is alert after being taken off a ventilator Thursday. He's dreading having to tell her the news about their dad.\n\nOmar, 29, said he's grateful that his mother has recovered and that he, two siblings and his 2-year-old niece have stayed healthy. He's also touched by the support they've received from neighbors in West Liberty, a heavily Hispanic city of 3,800 where his family settled after immigrating from Mexico in the 1990s.\n\nHe wants people to know how easily the virus can spread if they infect others and how quickly that can devastate a family.\n\n\"All it takes is one person to be irresponsible to affect a family that doesn't deserve it,\" Omar Martinez said in an interview. \"I don't wish this upon anybody. I get asked every day how do I do it? I have no answers.\"\n\nThe Martinez family's situation is illustrative of the startling racial and ethnic disparities among those getting infected and dying from the coronavirus.\n\nWhile Latinos make up 6% of Iowa's population, they have accounted for more than 22% of its confirmed COVID-19 cases, according to the state Department of Public Health. The disparity widened as more testing was conducted on plant workers, who are disproportionately Latino and account for more than a quarter of Iowa's confirmed cases. State officials say more dense housing environments also play a role.\n\nThe virus has spread faster in Iowa, which now has more than 5,000 confirmed cases, than almost any other state in recent days. In West Liberty, a turkey processing factory that has long attracted immigrants to the area reported that 52 workers had tested positive.\n\nOmar's parents met in their Mexican home town before moving to Dallas and then to West Liberty in the 1990s, when Omar was a child. His father, who went by his middle name Gabriel, became a U.S. citizen.\n\nThe family added two daughters and another son and became a staple of the community, taking part in school activities and attending the Catholic church. Omar worked with his father at a distribution warehouse before he joined the West Liberty Fire Department. Two years ago, Evelyn gave birth to a baby, Maia. Gabriel became a doting grandfather.\n\nThe family still lives together in the one-story home that Omar's parents purchased in the early 2000s for $45,000.\n\nAurelia Martinez, 52, had been a stay-at-home mother as the children grew up. She got a job after Hy-Line North America opened a large egg production plant in nearby Wilton in 2015.\n\nIn late March, Aurelia began feeling tired and sick and isolated herself in one of the bedrooms, Omar said. She tested positive for COVID-19 on April 3, suspecting that a sick coworker passed her the virus. A Hy-Line spokesman confirmed that's the date that the last of six Wilton factory workers tested positive.\n\nEvelyn, a waitress, got the chills, body aches and a fever two days later. Soon, she started suffering from coughing spasms and was unable to sleep or eat. Omar gave her Tylenol and fluids.\n\nThe family persuaded Evelyn to go to Mercy Hospital in Iowa City on April 10 after her coughing got so bad that her face turned purple. That night, she was intubated and put on a ventilator.\n\n\"Her oxygen levels were low. If we would have waited a day she might not have made it,\" Omar said.\n\nThe family patriarch, Gabriel, started showing symptoms two days later. By then, the Procter and Gamble factory where he worked had started making hand sanitizer because demand was surging.\n\nOmar recalled sleeping on the floor of his father's bedroom and giving him Tylenol in the middle of the night. He took Gabriel to the hospital on April 15 when his cough worsened, holding his hand on the way and telling him everything would be okay.\n\nThat night would be his last conversation with his father, who had been healthy just days earlier. On a FaceTime call, Gabriel said the hospital was transferring him to the intensive care unit that was already housing Evelyn. His oldest son and wife told him they loved him. Soon, he was also on a ventilator.\n\nDoctors said Gabriel made steady progress over the next few days and they began turning down the settings on his ventilator. But on Monday night, he started showing irregular heart rhythms. The family stayed up praying, but early Tuesday morning, they were told he had died.\n\nRemarkably, that's when Evelyn's condition started to dramatically improve.\n\n\"She had been very unstable while my dad was doing well. But when he passed, in those next 24 hours she was making big improvements,\" Omar said.\n\nOn Thursday, doctors removed her from the ventilator and reported that she was awake and alert and asking to see her parents and daughter. They are cautiously optimistic that she may soon begin rehabilitation if her breathing keeps improving.\n\nNeighbors have inundated the family with groceries and other offers of help. A local grocery store held a fundraiser for the family. Donors have given more than $23,000 to a GoFundMe account to cover funeral and health expenses.\n\nVITAMIN D AND THE CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC: SHOULD YOU TAKE IT?\n\nOmar, choking up, said his father had been touched by the outpouring before his death.\n\n\"Seeing all the groceries, his face would light up with a smile,\" he said. \"The little things like that brightened up his world.\"",

Among them is the theory that those not showing symptoms may be most infectious.\n\nCLICK FOR THE LATEST ON THE CORONAVIRUS\n\nIt has been widely reported that without a proven treatment, vaccine or cure, governments will have to limit social interaction. The coronavirus is considered highly contagious and most dangerous for the elderly population and those with comorbidities. Health officials in the U.S. believe that shelter-in-place orders contributed to a lower-than-expected infection rate.\n\nBut, like many other countries, the U.S. is working on its reopening. About 30 million Americans have filed for unemployment since the beginning of statewide lockdowns and some business owners are eager to open their doors.\n\nDr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told a coronavirus press briefing earlier last month that the world may never return to the \"normal\" that was known before the outbreak.\n\n\"When we get back to normal, we will go back to the point where we can function as a society,\" he said. He continued, \"If you want to get back to pre-coronavirus, that might not ever happen in the sense that the threat is there.\"\n\nFauci said people must be prepared for a resurgence next year, which is why officials fighting the pandemic are pushing for a vaccine and clinical trials for therapeutic interventions so \"we will have interventions that we did not have\" when this started.\n\nThe authors of the study said the pandemic could continue in waves that reach further than 2022.\n\nGET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"Risk communication messaging from government officials should incorporate the concept that this pandemic will not be over soon and that people need to be prepared for possible periodic resurgences of disease over the next two year,\" they wrote, according to Bloomberg.",

        "body": "An autopsy of the remains from the first known COVID-19 death in the U.S. has revealed that the person died from a ruptured heart triggered by the virus's attack, according to news reports.\n\nThe 57-year-old woman, Patricia Dowd of San Jose, California, died at home on Feb. 6 after experiencing flu-like symptoms, according to The Mercury News. Recently, an investigation into her death found that Dowd was actually infected with the new coronavirus, meaning that U.S. COVID-19 deaths had occurred weeks earlier than thought.\n\nDowd's death was initially thought to be the result of a heart attack. But now, an autopsy report shows that the virus had spread to Dowd's heart muscle, and the viral infection caused a valve in her heart to rupture, The Mercury News reported.\n\n\"The immune system was attacking the virus and in attacking the virus, it damaged the heart and then the heart basically burst,\" Dr. Judy Melinek, a forensic pathologist who was not involved with Dowd's case, told The Mercury News.\n\nThis type of heart rupture occurs more typically in people with high cholesterol levels or abnormalities in the heart muscle, Melinek said. But Dowd's case was very unusual because her heart was a normal size and weight, she said.\n\n\"There's something abnormal about the fact that a perfectly normal heart has burst open,\" Melinek told The San Francisco Chronicle. \"Normal hearts don't rupture.\"\n\nDowd was reportedly in good health and exercised regularly before she fell sick.\n\nPrevious studies have noted a connection between COVID-19 and the heart, with one small study in China finding that more than 1 in 5 COVID-19 patients develop heart damage as a result of the infection, Live Science previously reported.",

    "Coronavirus was circulating in France in December, case report suggests": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "The coronavirus was circulating in France as early as December, new evidence suggests.\n\nDoctors in France discovered that a patient who went to the hospital in late December with respiratory symptoms was positive for COVID-19, according to The Guardian. The man contracted the virus nearly a month before France confirmed its first cases. But it's still not clear how the man was infected, as he wasn't traveling. Doctors also can't say whether or not the man was France's \"patient zero.\"\n\nThe doctors discovered the patient while testing samples taken in December and January from 24 patients who had all tested negative for the flu. One of the samples, taken from a patient on Dec. 27, tested positive for COVID-19.\n\nRelated: 13 coronavirus myths busted by science\n\nThe doctors had originally collected the samples to test for the flu using a polymerase chain reaction test -- the same test used to detect the new coronavirus -- which searches for bits of viral genetic material.\n\nThe patient, a 43-year-old man from Bobigny, likely became infected sometime between Dec. 14 and Dec. 22, according to the BBC. He presented to the hospital with a dry cough, a fever and trouble breathing on Dec. 27.\n\nHe was sick for 15 days and had infected his two children, but not his wife, Dr. Yves Cohen, the head of resuscitation at the Avicenne and Jean Verdier hospitals in Paris told France's BFM TV on May 3. It's too early to know whether or not this patient was France's \"patient zero,\" he added.\n\nThe patient's wife worked at a supermarket near Charles de Gaulle airport and could have come in contact with those arriving from China, according to the BBC. It's possible that the patient's wife had been infected first, perhaps asymptomatically, Cohen said. \"All the negative PCRs for pneumonia must be tested again,\" Cohen said. \"The virus was probably circulating.\"\n\nThe French government is now working to confirm this case and will investigate further if necessary, the French health ministry told the BBC.\n\nSuch early missed cases could have occurred elsewhere around the world. In the U.S., a medical examiner-coroner recently found that two people who died in Santa Clara County in California on Feb. 6 and Feb. 17 had been infected with the coronavirus, weeks before the first known deaths from the coronavirus in the U.S.\n\nThe very first known case of the coronavirus in the world could have occurred in November, in a 55-year-old person in the Hubei province of China, according to a previous Live Science report. That's more than a month before doctors first noted a cluster of odd pneumonia cases in the area. Though the timeline of the pandemic remains muddy, it's becoming apparent that the virus was spreading long before health care workers detected it.",

Sign up here.\n\nCould you have been infected with the novel coronavirus but not have known it, having reported no symptoms?\n\nIt's possible, as new reports suggest that many people have experienced the virus in this way, meaning COVID-19 may be less deadly than initially believed but ultimately complicating efforts to \"re-open\" the nation.\n\nThe news comes after reports of asymptomatic cases throughout the country, ranging from a homeless shelter in Boston to pregnant women in a New York hospital. Similar stories have emerged in Europe and in California, and even on a U.S. Navy aircraft carrier, the Associated Press reported.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR COMPLETE CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) says some 25 percent of cases are asymptomatic. But the vice-chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. John Hyten, estimated that these types of cases among military personnel alone could be as high as 70 percent.\n\nTo date, more than 2 million people around the world have been infected with the virus. But with asymptomatic cases possibly being higher than first thought, \"we have just been off the mark by huge, huge numbers\" for estimating total infections, Dr. Michael Mina of Harvard's School of Public Health told the Associated Press.\n\nBased on known cases, health officials have said the virus usually causes mild or moderate flu-like illness. Now evidence is growing that a substantial number of people may have no symptoms at all.\n\nScientists in Iceland screened 6 percent of its population to see how many had previously undetected infections and found that about 0.7 percent tested positive. So did 13 percent of a group at higher risk because of recent travel or exposure to someone sick.\n\nAboard the aircraft carrier USS Theodore Roosevelt, where one crew member died from the virus, \"the rough numbers are that 40 percent are symptomatic,\" said Vice Adm. Phillip Sawyer, deputy commander of naval operations. The ratio may change if more develop symptoms later, he warned.\n\nIn New York, a hospital tested all pregnant women coming in to deliver over a two-week period. Nearly 14 percent of those who arrived with no symptoms of coronavirus turned out to have it. Of the 33 positive cases, 29 had no symptoms when tested, although some developed them later.\n\nPreviously, tests on passengers and crew from the Diamond Princess cruise ship found nearly half who tested positive had no symptoms at the time. Researchers estimate that 18 percent of infected people never developed any.\n\nWhat's more, there are concerns over the accuracy of the nasal swab and antibody testing. Throat and nose swabs can miss the virus if there isn't enough of it at the time a person is being tested, meaning they can test positive later even if they don't initially. For instance, one Japanese study found more than half of those who had no symptoms when they tested positive later felt sick.\n\nOn Friday, researchers reported results from antibody tests on 3,300 people in California's Santa Clara county: Between 1.5 percent and 2.8 percent have been infected, they claimed. That would mean 48,000 to 81,000 cases in the county -- more than 50 times the number that has been confirmed.\n\nThe work has not been formally published or peer-reviewed, but some scientists were quick to question it. Participants were recruited through Facebook ads, which would attract many people likely to be positive who have had symptoms and want to know if the coronavirus was the reason. Some neighborhoods also had way more participants than others, and \"hot spots\" within the county might have made infections seem more common than they are elsewhere.\n\nHowever, If infections are more widespread than previously understood, it's possible that more people have developed some level of immunity to the virus. That could stifle the spread through what's called herd immunity, but scientists caution that there is still much to learn about whether mild illnesses confer immunity and how long it might last.\n\nIt will probably be months before enough reliable testing has been done to answer those questions and others, including how widespread infections have been and the virus's true mortality rate, which has only been estimated so far.\n\nCORONAVIRUS: WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW\n\n\"If they've all seen the virus before, then maybe you can relax in that neighborhood\" and ease social distancing, Mina told the Associated Press.\n\nThat said, \"we're not anywhere close where we need to be\" on antibody testing to do that yet, he noted.",

Sign up here.\n\nWhile New York has weathered the brunt of coronavirus infections and deaths, the state's apparent hoarding of medical supplies, and the millions spent on equipment that never arrived, as well as unused hospitals and beds, have some questioning what went wrong.\n\nEarly to mid-March projections of the spread of COVID-19 had the state scrambling to bolster its hospital bed capacity to more than double its 53,000 maximum status-quo. Subsequently, hospitals statewide were ordered to discharge patients to free up beds, and forced to add new ones as non-emergency procedures were canceled.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR COMPLETE CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE\n\nCORONAVIRUS LOCKDOWN: NEW YORK, NEW JERSEY RESIDENTS LOSING PATIENCE WITH GOVERNORS' RELUCTANCE TO GIVE FIRM DATES FOR REOPENING\n\nIn addition to a bevy of state orders, Gov. Andrew Cuomo made desperate overtures to the federal government to step in. In response, and in record time, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers scrambled to erect at least four field hospitals, and the Navy deployed its USNS Comfort hospital ship to Manhattan.\n\nHowever, those efforts - and the many millions of dollars spent on them - have largely been deemed a waste, even as New York has battled a soaring a death toll and is maintaining stay-at-home orders. So what happened?\n\n\"[The models] have been extremely inaccurate,\" Dr. David Samadi, a New York-based surgeon, told Fox News. \"These models gave a horrifying prediction that suggested COVID-19 could kill anywhere from 200,000 to 1.7 million Americans. Currently, it looks to be more like 60,000 to 65,000 deaths. While any American life lost to this virus is a shame, the death and infection rate is looking not quite so bleak as it was in the beginning.\"\n\nUN WARNS CORONAVIRUS FALLOUT WILL LEAD TO THE NEXT PANDEMIC - GLOBAL STARVATION\n\nThe Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) is in the process of shuttering the much-touted, 2,500-bed Javits Center - having treated only around 1,000 patients over the course of more than a month - The Associated Press reported.\n\nOn Thursday, the heralded Navy ship - which was equipped with 1,000 beds and intended to take the burden off other hospitals and treat non-coronavirus patients before finally taking on a handful of those with the infection - sailed away, barely used.\n\nThe three additional field hospitals Albany spent many millions on erecting in late March are yet to close, despite treating few, and are standing idle in case there is a second wave of the disease.\n\nThe process has led to frustration for hospital officials tasked with hurriedly boosting bed counts and equipping these new facilities, yet have watched as city hospitals endured overcrowding of coronavirus patients while their own ready-to-go medical centers have sat mostly empty, at the taxpayer's expense.\n\nFor one, construction firms earned $136 million to quickly erect the Stony Brook field hospital - paid for from the Army Corps of Engineers budget. The original contract with Manhattan-based Turner Construction Co., as noted by Newsday, was initially for an amount not to exceed $101 million - yet \"the number was increased on April 8 to an amount not to exceed $136 million once it became clear that more money was needed,\" even with the lack of patients. Still, it has hardly been used, officials said.\n\nAnother $116.5 million was spent to spring to life a field facility on the Old Westbury campus, complete with top-notch features including hospital-grade welded linoleum floors, multiple layers of insulation, electricity, telephone infrastructure, plumbing, Wi-Fi, showers, bathrooms, and staff common areas.\n\nMeanwhile, nursing home managers have been left bewildered as to why the empty facilities were not made available for ill and suspect coronavirus patients, who were not able to be aptly isolated from others deemed vulnerable to severe infection or death.\n\nIn April, coronavirus patients at a Brooklyn nursing home were denied admission to both of the medical facilities established in New York to handle victims of the pandemic even though beds were mostly empty. The snub, as highlighted by the New York Post, came weeks after New York health officials were warned by the nursing home operator - where 55 people have died - that there was a grave concern, and requesting patients be transferred to the temporary facilities.\n\nNew York nursing homes have accounted for 13 percent of the state's coronavirus death toll, according to the state's health department figures.\n\nCritics have also underscored that much of the mismanagement and failure to properly utilize the field hospitals came down to poor logistics, with mandates making it challenging and time-consuming for burdened hospitals to transfer patients. In the case of the Javits Center, a stringent 25-point checklist meant even that few coronavirus patients could be sent there, as not every box could be marked.\n\nA further $100 million, as per federal monitoring figures, was allocated for additional field hospitals. But those plans have now been scrapped. Yet hundreds of millions of dollars later, and the doomsday predictions have fallen short, and hospitalizations statewide have started dropping.\n\n\"I believe the main reason for numerous hospitals having far lower hospitalized patient counts with the virus was due to the fact the majority of people who contracted the infection, did not require hospitalization,\" Samadi said. \"Either they were asymptomatic, or their symptoms were not life-threatening and could be carefully managed quarantined at home.\"\n\nBut ironically, the state's health care industry is fearing a financial collapse as a result of the pandemic. Despite all the efforts and finances directed to the medical sector, thousands of health care workers have been rendered jobless, and facilities are fearing financial ruin. Red tape and heavy-handed restrictions, analysts note, have led to a crisis within a crisis -- the inability to perform other medical procedures that would have at least in the short term avoided budget deficiencies and kept many health care professionals employed.\n\n\"Even before the COVID-19 pandemic, American's health care system was already coded blue. What was driving it into the ground was price failures, administrative waste, and in some cases, inappropriate care,\" Samadi surmised. \"While there were many nurses, doctors, and other supportive medical personnel who have been able to work taking care of patients with coronavirus, many other health care workers were furloughed depending on their positions.\"\n\nRICK SCOTT HITS BACK AT ANDREW CUOMO FOR SAYING NY BAILS OUT FLORIDA\n\nFurthermore, the desperate call for ventilators in March - amid projections that New York was about to run out and tens of thousands would die - sparked a flurry of donations from far and wide. President Trump additionally ordered car manufacturing companies like General Motors and Ford to start manufacturing parts to fill the feared void, and Cuomo set about purchasing as many as possible.\n\nBut from the lens of New York Assemblyman Mike LiPetri, a Republican, this only adds to the existing \"$6 billion deficit Cuomo administration,\" given that much of the ventilator stockpile has, at least to date, not been needed.\n\n\"Money is always wasted. We went to Albany and voted on a state budget in the middle of the night that was filled with political pet projects and misguided priorities,\" LiPetri continued. \"Nowhere did it include hazard pay for those on the front lines or small business relief for those on the verge of closing their doors forever.\"\n\nHe also highlighted it was an excess expenditure that could have been avoided.\n\nA New York-tailored pandemic plan was issued in 2006, cautioning that the city would be short some 9,500 ventilators in the case of a public health crisis. The city only had a few hundred in its arsenal. In the face of the apprehension, only 500 more ventilators were collected, plans to bolster a larger stockpile fell victim to budget cuts. That reserve also was scrapped or sold some five years ago, ProPublica pointed out, as they had broken down and were not adequately maintained for use.\n\nNow, with a bulging ventilator stack, Cuomo has directed the National Guard to remove the unused, life-saving machines from medical facilities and reallocate or return them to other states.\n\nNew York also spent $69 million on ventilators that never arrived, according to reports this week. Albany is said to have heeded a Twitter message from a Silicon Valley electrical engineer and purchased 1,450 ventilators -- at three times the retail price. Only the devices are yet to arrive, and Cuomo stated Friday that they are attempting to get their money back.\n\nAccording to Alexandra Abrams, communications director at Citizens Against Government Waste (CAGW) as part of the Dynamic Ventilator Reserve initiative, states with a surplus can send ventilators to other parts of the country that need them, helping to ensure everyone who needs a ventilator can get one. At the national level, she stressed, the U.S. now has enough ventilators to help supply other countries.\n\n\"I said from the beginning that no American who needs a ventilator would be denied a ventilator, and we have kept that promise all over the United States,\" Trump said on April 21, a statement that has apparently turned out to be accurate, as highlighted by PolitiFact.\n\nAbrams concurred that New York has not lacked the resources Cuomo feared it would.\n\n\"The system bent but didn't break. While there remains a need for more testing, it does not appear that New York lacked the resources it needed,\" she explained. \"While the initial request for ventilators was tens of thousands, that amount was never needed.\"\n\nNonetheless, New York overall has been incredibly hard hit by the virus -- clocking in some 305,000 confirmed cases and claiming the lives of more than 23,500 people. The state's infection numbers account for almost 30 percent of the national total and 38 percent of all U.S. deaths.\n\nBut the overblow and waste has many analysts and public officials scratching their heads.\n\n\"The leadership in NYC has moved slowly, offering inconsistent messages and didn't let the scientists' voices emerge as leaders,\" conjectured Dr. Attila Hertelendy, a professor in emergency and disaster management at Georgetown University. \"Politicians' voices dominated.\"\n\nOn the flip side, others contend that unused resources are a good problem to have - irrespective of the billions that could have been directed elsewhere.\n\n\"Predicting the future in any field of endeavor is a difficult enterprise. This is certainly true in forecasting a pandemic involving a novel -or new - virus about which not a lot is known,\" said Peter Brookes, a senior research fellow at The Heritage Foundation. \"While models may be imperfect in predicting exact outcomes, they can be useful to decision-makers in trying to see into the future to develop plans and policies for dealing with challenging public policy problems.\"\n\nYet the divergence between the state's worst-case scenario wants and the realistic needs have not gone unnoticed by the president either.\n\n\"We built you thousands of hospital beds that you didn't need or use,\" Trump tweeted to Cuomo on April 17.\n\nGET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nLast week, at one of his daily press briefings, Gov. Cuomo appeared to acknowledge some of the mess up and not taking earlier action that would have simmered the March frenzy. But the following day, he turned his attention to pointing fingers at the likes of the World Health Organization (WHO) and federal bodies such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) for not raising the red flags earlier, insisting that \"governors don't do global pandemics.\"\n\nThe governor's office did not immediately respond to a request for further comment.",

But for some, it can cause severe illness, requiring them to be placed on ventilators to help them breathe.\n\nMany medications used to sedate and immobilize people put on ventilators and to treat their pain are the same drugs that states use to put inmates to death. Demand for such drugs surged 73 percent in March.\n\nTwenty-five states have the death penalty, while three have moratoriums on capital punishment.\n\nWhile some states contacted by The Associated Press, including Alabama and Florida, didn't respond to inquiries about the letter, others, including Arkansas, Texas and Utah, limited their comment to mainly saying they don't have the medications in question. Tennessee wouldn't confirm whether it has the drugs and indicated it has no plans to give any medications to a hospital. Oklahoma said it hadn't received any requests for such medications from state hospitals.\n\nStates may be hesitant to turn over their drugs because they have had problems securing them as many pharmaceutical companies oppose their use in executions, said Robert Dunham, executive director of the Death Penalty Information Center.\n\nSince 2011, 13 states have enacted new statutes that conceal information about the execution process, according to the Death Penalty Information Center, which takes no position on capital punishment but has criticized the way states carry out executions.\n\nDrugs being requested include the sedative midazolam, the paralytic vecuronium bromide and the opioid fentanyl. They're needed because putting a patient on a ventilator \"with no drugs ... would be torture,\" said Zivot, an associate professor of anesthesiology and surgery at Emory University in Atlanta who has studied medicine's role in capital punishment.\n\nThe tense debate over the supply of execution drugs was highlighted in a 2018 lawsuit that several pharmaceutical companies filed against Nevada over accusations that it illegally obtained its inventory.\n\nIn a court brief, 15 states, including Florida, Oklahoma and Texas, called the lawsuit part of the \"guerrilla warfare being waged by antideath-penalty activists and criminal defense attorneys to stop lawful executions.\"\n\nThe lawsuit was dismissed this month after Nevada agreed to return its supplies to the companies, leaving the state without any drugs to carry out executions.\n\nCORONAVIRUS: WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW\n\nPharmaceutical companies have long warned that states' use of these medications for executions could result in shortages, Dunham said.\n\n\"Some of the responses over the past several years had been, 'That's chicken little saying the sky is falling,'\" Dunham said. \"But with COVID-19, the sky has fallen.\"",

Other individuals who suspected they may have been infected but were only experiencing mild symptoms were refused the tests and told to self-isolate at home for 14 days. The mayor said the slowing of new coronavirus cases requiring hospitalization has opened up the possibility for more people to be tested for the virus.\n\nDe Blasio called the testing milestone \"progress\" but urged the federal government to expand lab capacity so the virus can eventually be contained through comprehensive testing and tracing programs.\n\n\"When we get the real support we need from the federal government and that additional lab capacity, we'll be able to go much further,\" he said.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nNew York City has reported more than 186,000 confirmed COVID-19 cases.\n\nThe number of children in New York City diagnosed with a rare inflammatory syndrome possibly linked to the coronavirus has grown to 100, de Blasio said.

The disease has caused inflammation of the heart and blood vessels. Typical symptoms included fever, rash, swelling of the hands and feet, irritation and redness in the whites of the eyes, swollen lymph glands in the neck and irritation and inflammation of the mouth, lips and throat, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC].\n\nCHILDREN WITH CORONAVIRUS AT LA HOSPITAL DEVELOP RARE INFLAMMATORY CONDITION POSSIBLY LINKED TO COVID-19\n\nStill, there's been no official criteria for diagnosing the deadly disease and health officials have been scrambling to identify children who may be affected by it.\n\n\"Of the cases that have been verified, 47 percent of the kids involved tested positive for the coronavirus at that point; of those who tested negative, 81 percent had the antibodies,\" de Blasio said. \"Suffice it to say that, for the past 10 weeks, all day, every day, we've all been talking about the coronavirus nonstop and looking at so many different elements around it, and this particular challenge around kids came up literally days ago.\"\n\nGov. Andrew Cuomo's administration has been investigating the disease, which has infected an estimated 85 people in the state and killed three children overall.\n\nDe Blasio added that testing for the coronavirus could be helpful in identifying children with Kawasaki disease.\n\n\"I think, probably, the most important thing that the federal government can do in this situation is, really help us maximize the number of people who are getting tested,\" City Health Commissioner Oxiris Barbot reportedly said. \"This response has been hampered by universal lack of access to testing. I think that is one additional way in which that is being manifested.\"\n\nDe Blasio, a Democrat, also has lamented the limited number of available doses of remdesivir, a trial drug to fight COVID-19. The federal government has procured some 500,000 doses of the drug to dole out to states, and New York City has received about 4,000 doses of remdesivir.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe mayor said he's pleaded with the Trump administration to get more.\n\n\"We need that number greatly intensified.

Ron DeSantis announced Wednesday that beginning Monday, restaurants and stores will be allowed to reopen at 25 percent capacity -- kicking off phase one of the state's reopening plan.\n\nDuring an afternoon press conference -- as the state's stay-at-home order expires Thursday -- DeSantis said the order would exclude Miami-Dade, Broward and Palm Beach counties. But the Republican governor said those counties will be able to enter phase one of the reopening plan \"soon.\"\n\nREP. MATT GAETZ UNVEILS LEGISLATION TO DEPORT ALL ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS DURING A PANDEMIC\n\nAll parts of Florida would be allowed to resume elective surgeries, he said.\n\nBoth restaurants and retail -- which DeSantis said have always been allowed to operate curbside pickup and delivery -- will be allowed to bring in customers at a 25 percent capacity, and outdoor dining will be opened so long as tables are spaced six feet apart. Still, the governor called for masks to be used in \"face-to-face business.\"\n\nDeSantis said the White House coronavirus task force recommended in phase one of the reopening plan restaurants and retail open at a 50 percent capacity, but Florida would err on the side of caution.\n\nDeSantis said that the media had an \"unfortunate habit to conflate shelter-in-place with social distancing,\" and said that his state could rebuild Florida's foundations while protecting the most vulnerable.\n\nStill, the governor said movie theaters and gyms would remain closed, and he would \"look to see what happens in other states\" before providing a timeline for their reopening. Bars and personal care services would also stay shut under phase one.\n\nSchools would remain closed for the time being as would nursing home visits, but DeSantis said he would reconsider visits once more widespread testing was available.\n\nThe governor said that when deciding to reopen, a state could look at the new case trend or the positivity rate trend, meaning the number of positive coronavirus tests compared to the number of tests overall. He said his state's testing rate was now similar to California and the positivity rate had been on the decline for a while.\n\nDeSantis called on Floridians to focus on \"facts not fear.\"\n\nDeSantis pointed to a significant drop in patients seeking medical care for stroke or heart attack symptoms as they fear exposing themselves to coronavirus, which could result in \"huge health consequences.\"\n\n\"There is a lot that's been done to try to promote fear, to promote worst-case scenarios and to drive hysteria,\" DeSantis said. \"That worst-case thinking has not proven to be true.\"\n\n\"We have been told over and over again that Florida was going to be like New York,\" he continued, noting that his state's coronavirus 1,218 deaths so far are barely a fraction of New York's 22,897. Despite reports that Florida would run out of ventilators, DeSantis said 379 patients were on ventilators in the state and over 6,300 ventilators were sitting unused.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe governor said that across the country he had seen \"wide-ranging punitive orders\" which infringed on civil liberties. He said that the main reason the country had gone on lockdown-- to \"flatten the curve\" so as not to overwhelm hospital systems-- had been satisfied in Florida, where 36.5 percent of ICU beds were empty.",

        "body": "Good morning and welcome to Fox News First. Here's what you need to know as you start your day ...\n\nLeading Democrats renew calls for Fauci, Birx testimony on US coronavirus response\n\nDemocrats are renewing their calls for Sr. Anthony Fauci and Deborah Birx, two leading members of the White House Coronavirus Task Force, to answer questions before the Senate about the U.S. response to the coronavirus outbreak.\n\n\"Senate needs to hear from Dr. Fauci, Dr. Brix, Sec. Mnuchin. We need to know why so many small businesses have had trouble getting loans. We need to know why unemployment insurance checks are failing to get to workers. We need to know we still don't have enough tests!\" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., tweeted.\n\nSchumer said in an interview on \"The Rachel Maddow Show\" Monday that there is a chance the nation's top disease doctor will appear before the Senate next week despite the White House's decision last week to prevent him from testifying before a House subcommittee. However, the Senate Minority leader said, Fauci's testimony is far from a sure thing, the Hill reported.\n\n\"By not telling the truth, by not hearing the truth, by not listening to the scientists, they [the Trump administration] are prolonging this crisis, they are prolonging how bad the economy will be,\" Schumer said. \"Does it surprise me? No. Does it upset me? A lot.\"\n\nLast week, the White House prevented Fauci from testifying and called such a testimony \"counterproductive\" with the coronavirus outbreak not under control.\n\n\"While the Trump Administration continues its whole-of-government response to COVID-19, including safely opening up America again and expediting vaccine development, it is counter-productive to have the very individuals involved in those efforts appearing at Congressional hearings,\" said White House spokesman Judd Deere. \"We are committed to working with Congress to offer testimony at the appropriate time.

District Court Judge Emmet G. Sullivan's standing order in the Flynn case to produce all evidence in the government's possession \"that is favorable to defendant and material either to defendant's guilt or punishment.\" The order also requires the government to submit favorable defense evidence to the court, including possible \"impeachment evidence\" that could undermine witnesses, even if the government believes the evidence \"not to be material.\"\n\nVan Grack has long informed Sullivan that the government's so-called \"Brady\" obligations, referring to prosecutors' duty to turn over exculpatory materials to defendants, have been met.

    "Did you already have coronavirus in January or February?": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "With the recent news that two Californians died of COVID-19 in February, three weeks earlier than the United States' first known death from the disease, it has become clear that the coronavirus was spreading in the United States long before it was detected by testing.\n\nThis fact might have you wondering if that weird cough or recurrent fever you had in late January or February was actually COVID-19. It's not impossible, experts say, but it's not necessarily likely, either. The virus was certainly circulating during that time. However, what is unknown is how prevalent it was, especially compared with the other respiratory viruses of winter.\n\n\"The initial introduction of the virus in the U.S. coincided with the peak of the flu season, so the symptoms you had, it would be difficult to untangle with flu,\" said Matteo Chinazzi, an associate research scientist at Northeastern University in Boston, who is on a team that has been modeling the virus' spread around the world.\n\nRelated: Coronavirus outbreak: Live updates\n\nThe coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 was first detected by testing in the United States in January. That case occurred in a 35-year-old man who was tested on Jan. 19, four days after returning from Wuhan to his home in Snohomish County, Washington.\n\nBut it wasn't until a month later, on Feb. 26, that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) confirmed the first known case of community spread of coronavirus in the United States, in a California resident who had no known contact with a traveler from China. Just a few days later, a group of researchers studying flu test samples in Washington state discovered a sample that contained the genetic sequence for that coronavirus, which causes COVID-19. It belonged to a teenager who had contracted the virus in the community.\n\nIt is now clear that the first cases of community spread in the United States weren't in late February, but instead were in January, when only travel-related cases were being caught and reported.\n\nThis is evident in a few different ways. First, the small genetic differences between the coronavirus in the Washington state teenager and in samples from Wuhan suggested that the virus had come over from Wuhan and had been circulating, and gradually mutating, over the course of about five weeks, infectious disease researcher Trevor Bedford of the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center wrote in a blog post in early March.\n\nSecond, the newest death data also points to community spread of coronavirus in January. The first reported coronavirus death in the United States was thought to be a man in his 50s who died on Feb. 28 in King County, Washington. Autopsy results from two deaths in Kirkland, Washington, subsequently pushed the first known deaths in the U.S. back to Feb. 26.\n\nOn April 22, though, the CDC confirmed, based on autopsy results, that two people in Santa Clara County had died at home of COVID-19 on Feb. 6 and Feb. 17. Neither had a travel history and are thought to have caught the disease from community spread. Because COVID-19 typically has an incubation period of 5 to 6 days (and up to 14 days) between when people are infected and when they show symptoms, and because it usually takes several weeks after that for fatally ill patients to die, the early February deaths suggest that the individuals caught COVID-19 in mid- to late January.\n\nFinally, modeling work based on travel patterns shows the virus arriving in New York in early January and in California by mid-January, Chinazzi told Live Science. Other states followed.\n\n\"What our model seems to indicate is that the first introduction of the virus in New York was around early January and more generally, what we see is that by the end of February, most of the states have been seeded and have local transmission,\" Chinazzi said.\n\nThe first confirmed community spread of the coronavirus in New York was in a lawyer from Westchester County who first went to the hospital for his symptoms on Feb. 27, New York 4 reported. Genetic studies of viral samples in New York now suggest that community spread began by late January, mostly from introductions of the virus from Europe. Researchers at both NYU Langone and Mount Sinai conducted those studies.\n\nEpidemiologists in Colorado believe that the coronavirus landed in the Rocky Mountains somewhere between Jan. 20 and Jan. 30. The estimate comes from two different methods, Elizabeth Carlton, an epidemiologist at the University of Colorado School of Public Health, told Live Science. First, simple back-of-the-envelope calculations based on when the first detected cases in Colorado's outbreak reported symptoms suggest that those people got sick in that time frame. Second, the models that Carlton and her colleagues are using to track and forecast Colorado's cases fit the idea that the first cases in the state emerged between Jan. 20 and Jan. 30. (Colorado didn't report its first cases of the virus until March 4, according to Colorado Public Radio.)\n\n\"It's ski season in Colorado in January, so it's not hard to imagine that someone from one of the West Coast states came to Colorado to go skiing and brought an infection,\" Carlton said. \"That's just one of many possible routes.\"\n\nData on excess deaths compared to previous years can also help reveal when coronavirus landed in a particular state. In Florida, for example, The Sun-Sentinel reported that a spike in pneumonia-related deaths in mid-March could point to a nascent coronavirus outbreak starting by at least late February.\n\nGiven differences in the timing of the virus's arrival and the severity of outbreaks so far, the chance that any given respiratory illness in January or February could have been COVID-19 depends on where you live: It's far more likely that a resident of Manhattan in New York City has already had the virus compared with a resident of Manhattan, Kansas.\n\nFlu season clouds the issue. There's no national clearinghouse of influenza case statistics, and many people with flu are not given a flu swab to confirm the diagnosis, so no one knows exactly how many cases of influenza occurred in January or February either. But the CDC estimates that there were between 39 million and 56 million cases of flu in the U.S. between October 2019 and April 2020. That means that at the peak of flu season in January and February, the number of cases of influenza virus likely far outnumbered the coronavirus cases in the United States.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt's also hard to extrapolate back today's infection numbers to estimate the prevalence of coronavirus in January and February. That's because many cases of COVID-19 are still going undiagnosed by testing, and researchers still don't know how many people infected with coronavirus experience only mild symptoms or no symptoms at all, Carlton and Chinazzi said.\n\nAntibody studies, which look for immune-system proteins made when the body fights off a virus, can reveal approximately how many people in a population have been exposed. A research study that recruited people at grocery stores and tested their blood for antibodies to the coronavirus found that 1 in 7 people in New York state, and nearly 1 in 4 in New York City, has been exposed to the coronavirus. It's unclear whether those results will generalize to the population at large -- people staying home to avoid even grocery stories might have lower infection rates, for example -- but they do suggest that the chances of someone in New York having been infected already are not negligible. However, given that the virus spreads exponentially through the population, extrapolating back to January or February shrinks the number of active cases significantly, meaning that likely only a tiny fraction of people in the city were sick with COVID-19 at that time.\n\nThat means if you had respiratory symptoms in New York in January or February, chances are probably still better that it was the flu or a seasonally circulating coronavirus.\n\nElsewhere, the chances of having had coronavirus in January or February are even less clear. Two controversial studies in California put the percent of people who had already been exposed at between 2.5% and 4.2% in Santa Clara county and at up to 5.6% in Los Angeles, but those data have been criticized as likely overestimating the exposure. Both may have inadvertently recruited participants who thought they might have been exposed, biasing the sample; in addition, the antibody tests they used had a high rate of false positives, making results unreliable when low levels of the population have been exposed to the disease.\n\nIn Colorado, epidemiologists are estimating that 1% of the population has already had COVID-19. A cough or fever in February would be more likely than one in January to be a symptom of COVID-19, Carlton said, simply because there would have been more circulating cases as time went on. But there's a lot of uncertainty in the 1% estimate given limitations in testing and the wide range of severity of symptoms, Carlton said.\n\n\"This is the question that everyone is interested in answering,\" she said. \"How many people really have had it?\"",

Sign up here.\n\nThe global lockdown from the coronavirus pandemic has affected the mental health of many, especially children and teenagers, new research has found.\n\nAccording to data from athenahealth, children and teenagers that were diagnosed with ADHD for the first time rose 66 percent during March and April, while 41 percent of patient visits among children and teenagers also involved discussion of depression.\n\n\"COVID-19 has caused Americans unprecedented levels of stress, and it's evident that our new reality is causing people of all ages and genders to reach out to their physicians for guidance and support,\" said Jessica Sweeney-Platt, Executive Director, Research and Insights for athenahealth, in a statement. \"The trends we're seeing from our data are even more striking when we consider that fewer patients are seeing their doctors in person right now.\"\n\nCORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC COULD BE BEATEN WITH ROLLING 50-DAY ON, 30-DAY OFF LOCKDOWN PLAN: STUDY\n\nSweeney-Platt continued: \"We hope that by shining a light on this data, we can encourage patients to leverage tools like telehealth to stay in close communication with their providers and get the help they need, especially during this emotionally difficult time.\"\n\nDigging further into the data, athenahealth noted that 27 percent of primary care visits from kids and teens involved a discussion about depression during the week of March 9, but that number jumped to 41 percent during the week of April 13.\n\n\"During the same time period, antidepressant prescription renewals for this group followed a similar trend, and there was a more gradual increase in share of visits involving first-time antidepressant prescriptions among teenagers,\" the health and tech company noted.\n\nThe same trend occurred with ADHD diagnoses, rising by two-thirds from the week of March 9 to the week of March 30, as the lockdown and pandemic worsened. The health tech company, which was acquired by private equity firm Veritas Capital in 2019, noted this may be attributed to parents spending more time with their children and noticing more symptoms related to the disorder, as well as the increase in telehealth appointments.\n\nIn early April, the Dept. of Health and Human Services made the extraordinary announcement to allow video chat apps such as Apple's FaceTime and Zoom for medical consultations.\n\n\"During the COVID-19 national emergency, which also constitutes a nationwide public health emergency, covered health care providers subject to the HIPAA Rules may seek to communicate with patients, and provide telehealth services, through remote communications technologies,\" the HHS wrote in an announcement on its website at the time.\n\nAlso included on the list are Facebook Messenger video chat, Google Hangouts and Microsoft's Skype.\n\n'PARTICULARLY POTENT' ANTIBODY FOUND IN SARS PATIENT FROM 17 YEARS AGO INHIBITS COVID-19, STUDY SAYS\n\nThough the data linking the lockdown and the pandemic to an increase in depression and ADHD in children and teens is concerning, the mental well-being of adults is also being negatively impacted.\n\nThere was a 44-percent increase in first-time anxiety diagnoses in women during March, athenahealth noted, particularly in women between the ages of 30 and 64. There was also a 25 percent increase observed in men of the same age group, the company added.\n\nFox News has reached out to athenahealth with a request for comment.\n\nCurrently, there is no known scientific cure for the disease known as COVID-19, however, a number of drugs are being tested to see if they can treat it.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR COMPLETE CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE\n\nAs of Thursday morning, more than 5 million coronavirus cases have been diagnosed worldwide, more than 1.55 million of which are in the U.S., the most impacted country on the planet.",

Sign up here.\n\nWASHINGTON -- Three members of the White House coronavirus task force, including Dr. Anthony Fauci, placed themselves in quarantine after contact with someone who tested positive for COVID-19, another stark reminder that not even one of the nation's most secure buildings is immune from the virus.\n\nFauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and a leading member of the task force, has become nationally known for his simple and direct explanations to the public about the coronavirus and COVID-19, the disease it causes. Also quarantining are Dr. Robert Redfield, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, Stephen Hahn.\n\nDR. FAUCI PLANS TO ATTEND SENATE HEARING TUESDAY AMID 'MODIFIED' CORONAVIRUS QUARANTINE'\n\nFauci's institute said that he has tested negative for COVID-19 and will continue to be tested regularly. It added that he is considered at \"relatively low risk\" based on the degree of his exposure, and that he would be \"taking appropriate precautions\" to mitigate the risk to personal contacts while still carrying out his duties. While he will stay at home and telework, Fauci will go to the White House if called and take every precaution, the institute said.\n\nRedfield will be \"teleworking for the next two weeks\" after it was determined he had a \"low risk exposure\" to a person at the White House, the CDC said in a statement Saturday evening. The statement said he felt fine and has no symptoms.\n\nJust a few hours earlier, the Food and Drug Administration confirmed that Hahn had come in contact with someone who tested positive and was in self-quarantine for the next two weeks. He tested negative for the virus.\n\nWHO IS DR. ANTHONY FAUCI?\n\nAll three men are scheduled to testify before a Senate committee on Tuesday. Sen. Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn., the chairman of the panel, said the White House will allow Redfield and Hahn to testify by videoconference, a one-time exception to the administration's policies on hearing testimony. The statement was issued before Fauci's quarantine was announced.\n\nVice President Mike Pence's press secretary tested positive for the coronavirus on Friday, making her the second person who works at the White House complex known to test positive for the virus this week. White House officials had confirmed Thursday that a member of the military serving as one of Trump's valets had tested positive for COVID-19 on Wednesday.\n\nPresident Donald Trump, who publicly identified the affected Pence aide as spokeswoman Katie Miller, said he was \"not worried\" about the virus spreading in the White House. Nonetheless, officials said they were stepping up safety protocols for the complex.\n\nMiller had been in recent contact with Pence but not with the president and had tested negative a day earlier. She is married to Stephen Miller, a top Trump adviser. The White House had no immediate comment on whether Stephen Miller had been tested or if he was still working in the White House.\n\nWHO IS STEPHEN HAHN, FDA COMMISSIONER?\n\nThe CDC and FDA would not disclose the identity of the person who had tested positive and with whom the agency leaders had come in contact.\n\nRedfield sought to use the exposure as a teachable moment. The CDC statement said if he must go to the White House to fulfill any responsibilities as part of the coronavirus task force, he will follow CDC practices for critical infrastructure workers. Those guidelines call for Redfield and anyone working on the task force to have their temperature taken and screened for symptoms each day, wear a face covering, and distance themselves from others.\n\nTrump has resisted wearing a mask, and in a meeting with the nation's top military leaders Saturday evening, he did not wear a mask during the brief portion that reporters were allowed to view. The generals around Trump also did not wear a mask, but participants did sit a few feet away from each other.\n\nFDA spokeswoman Stephanie Caccomo said Hahn tested negative for the virus after he learned of the contact. He wrote a note to staff on Friday to alert them.\n\nSix people who had been in contact with Miller were scheduled to fly with Pence on Friday to Des Moines, Iowa, on Air Force Two. They were removed from the flight just before it took off, according to a senior administration official.\n\nWHO IS DR. ROBERT REDFIELD?\n\nNone of those people was exhibiting symptoms, but all were asked to deplane so they could be tested \"out of an abundance of caution,\" a senior administration official told reporters traveling with Pence. All six later tested negative, the White House said.\n\nThe official said staff in the West Wing are tested regularly but much of Pence's staff -- which works next door in the Executive Office Building -- are tested less frequently. Katie Miller was not on the plane and had not been scheduled to be on the trip.\n\nPence, who is tested on a regular basis, was tested Friday. Miller tweeted she was \"doing well\" and looked forward to getting back to work.\n\nWhite House chief of staff Mark Meadows said the administration was stepping up mitigation efforts already recommended by public health experts and taking other unspecified precautions to ensure the safety of the president. He said the White House was \"probably the safest place that you can come,\" but the he was reviewing further steps to keep Trump and Pence safe.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR COMPLETE CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE\n\nThe White House requires daily temperature checks of anyone who enters the White House complex and has encouraged social distancing among those working in the building. The administration has also directed regular deep cleaning of all work spaces. Anyone who comes in close proximity to the president and vice president is tested daily for COVID-19.\n\nTrump's valet's case marked the first known instance where a person who has come in close proximity to the president has tested positive since several people present at his private Florida club were diagnosed with COVID-19 in early March.\n\nAssociated Press writers Zeke Miller, Darlene Superville and Lauran Neergaard in Washington and Aamer Madhani in Chicago contributed to this report.",

        "body": "Study finds nearly all NY coronavirus patients suffered underlying health issue\n\nGet all the latest news on coronavirus and more delivered daily to your inbox. Sign up here.\n\nAs we learn more about COVID 19, we have come to realize that certain groups of patients tend to develop more severe forms of the disease and have a much higher likelihood of death once infected.\n\nThose with chronic diseases such as diabetes, lung disease, cancer and heart disease -- just to name a few -- have been found to be at much higher risk for complications from COVID-19, including ICU stays, need for mechanical ventilation and even death.\n\nSpecifically, the presence of heart disease has been shown to be highly correlated with death in COVID patients. In one study from China, it was found that nearly 10 percent of COVID patients who have preexisting heart disease died (as compared with 1 percent in the general population without underlying heart disease).\n\nGOLDFEDER AND BEDZOW: CORONAVIRUS NURSING HOME CRISIS - 4 THINGS THEY NEED RIGHT NOW\n\nThere also have been reports from all over the world showing an association between COVID-19 and cardiovascular symptoms and dangerous heart-related conditions, including heart attacks, strokes and myocarditis (an inflammation of the heart muscle that can lead to congestive heart failure). In addition, COVID 19 infection has been associated with an increased prediction for our blood to form clots -- these clots can cause heart attacks and strokes as well as other serious medical conditions.\n\nCoronary artery disease -- the cause of heart attacks -- is an inflammatory process and the most severe COVID-19 cases are associated with a hyper-inflammatory response from our own bodies as we attempt to fight off the infection. For example, when the lining of our blood vessels that supply our heart and brain become inflamed, the damage that occurs can promote the formation of blood clots that lead to strokes and heart attacks.\n\nIt stands to reason that the inflammation created by COVID-19 can exacerbate underlying heart disease and unmask previously undiagnosed cardiac conditions.\n\nIt is vital that you understand what your risk for heart disease may be. Risk factors include diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, family history of heart disease and male gender.\n\nSome of these risk factors you can control and modify. Others, like gender and family history, you can't. You are born with your own genetic code and that is part of what makes you who you are.\n\nDeveloping a relationship NOW with your primary care physician can allow you to improve your health and impact your ability to fight off a potential COVID infection in the future.\n\nHowever, it is important that you assess YOUR own risk for heart disease and work with your doctor to lower your risk by lowering your body weight through diet and exercise and treating any underlying conditions such as high blood pressure and cholesterol.\n\nIf you have diabetes, it is imperative that you control your blood sugar and, if you have type 2 diabetes, weight loss may reverse the course of the disease altogether.\n\nDeveloping a relationship NOW with your primary care physician can allow you to improve your health and impact your ability to fight off a potential COVID infection in the future.\n\nExercise Daily\n\nThe impact of exercise on cardiovascular health cannot be understated. During the pandemic, many Americans have turned to homemade workouts while gyms are closed. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that we all get at least 150 minutes of aerobic exercise every single week. Exercise improves your cardiovascular capacity and your mood. In addition, exercise can boost your immune system -- which is incredibly important in fighting off a COVID-19 infection.\n\nSleep Well\n\nSleep has been shown to stimulate our immune system. Numerous studies have found that people who do not get adequate sleep are much more likely to become infected with a virus after exposure.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nWhile these studies were NOT done with COVID 19 in mind, they do lend credence to the idea that sleep is important for our overall health.\n\nSleep helps you produce antibodies and also provides time for your cells to repair themselves -- all of which make you more prepared to fight infection. In addition, sleep is important for maintaining cardiovascular health.\n\nStudies show that sleep deprivation increases inflammation and the likelihood of developing obesity, diabetes and high blood pressure -- all of which are risk factors for heart attack and stroke.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic will pass in time. Let's all use this time in lockdown wisely to improve our health and reduce our risk of cardiovascular disease. When and if the pandemic returns, we can then face it with healthier bodies and reduce our risk of contracting the disease in the first place.\n\nAt the very least, by improving our baseline cardiovascular health, we can significantly reduce our risk of experiencing severe life-threatening complications of COVID-19 infection.",

Insight from Dr. Manny Alvarez, Fox News Channel's senior managing editor for health news.\n\nGet all the latest news on coronavirus and more delivered daily to your inbox. Sign up here.\n\nFor several weeks, hospitals and medical practices around the nation have been out of reach for many patients for elective surgery, certain diagnostic tests and regular medical visits. This was necessary to minimize their exposure to the coronavirus that causes the disease COVID-19, as well as to utilize all the resources available in hospitals to treat COVID-19 patients.\n\nMany portions of hospitals were converted to COVID-19 units as well as intensive care units. Unfortunately, medicine is a continuum that never stops. As America begins opening up again, a significant priority should be to focus on the opening of hospitals for general admissions and individual solo medical practices.\n\nLooking at the current landscape, solo practices are hurting. Some 42 percent have laid-off workers and we may lose 20 percent of small private medical practices. There is a genuine concern that the general medical population is inadvertently being hurt by the lack of general health services.\n\nLESLIE MARSHALL: CORONAVIRUS RESTRICTIONS SAVE LIVES - PROTESTERS BLOCKING HOSPITAL ENTRANCES ENDANGER LIVES\n\nWhat should you do if your surgery was canceled or postponed? The most important thing is to keep communicating with your surgeons. They are usually monitoring the conditions of all their patients and providing information through telemedicine or phone calls. If the condition goes from elective to needing urgent or emergency surgery, they will facilitate the operation in a timely manner.\n\nCan you go to your doctor's office? The answer is yes. Many practices are still open. However, you should contact them since their routine schedule probably has changed.\n\nMany practices will continue with safety measures to make sure that patients don't have any COVID-19 symptoms before coming to the office. Facial masks need to be worn and there should be proper spacing between you and your physician during your visit.\n\nIt is important, however, that you should see your regular physician if your visit is necessary due to some medical problem.\n\nMany medical societies are creating a roadmap for hospitals to resume elective surgery. Some of these guidelines include:\n\nA sustained reduction in the rate of COVID-19 cases for at least 14 days before assuming elective surgical procedures.\n\nThe ability to provide hospitalization services in a normal capacity.\n\nHaving the appropriate number of intensive-care beds available in case of emergencies, along with appropriate medical and surgical supplies.\n\nAn appropriate staff ratio of physicians and nurses to handle general hospital services and create an environment of patient safety and staff safety.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nThe reopening of the health care system is very important. We already know that a lack of access to health care leads to inadvertent complications.\n\nOne only has to think of how many cancer patients have been affected by changes in schedules, how many organ transplants have been delayed, and how all the effects of monitoring patients with diabetes, hypertension and cardiac disease could affect some of the long-term health problems that we hope to reduce year after year.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nEvery hospital, every physician and nurse, and all who support the health care system are committed to getting back to their regular schedules and are dedicated to continuing to protect and save the lives of patients in this country.\n\nI am very grateful that many politicians are pointing out that health care workers are heroes. I hope this continues after we get back to normal. Health care workers have always been heroes to me.",

Sign up here.\n\nDr. Manny Alvarez, a Fox News contributor and chairman of obstetrics and gynecology at Hackensack University Medical Center in New Jersey, shares advice on extra precautions you can take if you're pregnant during the COVID-19 outbreak.\n\nWhat should I be doing to prepare to have a baby during this COVID pandemic?\n\nThe first thing that couples should think about during this pandemic as they get ready to have a baby is PREPARENESS, PREPARENESS, PREPARENESS! Keep the lines of communication open with your obstetrical provider and know what their visitation policies look like. Make sure that you understand what tests or ultrasounds need to be made since a lot of these things are time sensitive and require the proper gestational age to be coordinated with the tests. Examples are genetic testing, diabetic screening, anatomy ultrasound and fetal surveillance tests. Many providers are currently using telemedicine, which is a very good way to have a thorough conversation with your provider regarding issues of any complaints of headaches, shortness of breath and fetal movement.\n\nHow do I protect myself against COVID-19 if I'm pregnant?\n\nThe best way to protect yourself against COVID-19 is to follow the same general guidelines that we have been giving to all patients. Cover your face with a mask, wash your hands, keep your social distance and keep away from any suspected person who might be presumed COVID-19 positive. It is also very important to recognize that many pregnant patients who have had COVID-19 tend to recover well, but those patients who are COVID-19 positive and are having respiratory issues must immediately contact their obstetrical providers and report to the hospital for further evaluation. Finally, there is no present evidence that there is any fetal transmission of the COVID-19 virus during pregnancy. The few cases of neonatal exposure seem to have come after the birth of the child.\n\nWhat should I know about my hospital stay if I am going into labor?\n\nKeep yourself informed of the current policies being implemented in the hospital in which you are delivering the baby. Many of these policies change depending on the state of affairs and the size and acuity of your hospital. For the most part, hospitals allow you to bring a visitor to stay with you. Please remember that you will be asked to wear a mask as well as you companion. Some hospitals are screening for COVID-19 while other hospitals are screening for signs and symptoms of COVID-19. It is important to be honest with your health providers as we want to keep the staff and yourself safe. Delivery will progress as normal depending on whether you have a vaginal delivery or Cesarean section, and the postpartum phase should be an enjoyable one with your little one next to you. Patients who are COVID-19 positive might be isolated from their infants until the acute phase of the infection is over. Once you take you newborn home, please remember to follow the same guideless as recommended to minimize your exposure to COVID-19.",

Sign up here.\n\nIda Zelcer, age 91, is a Holocaust survivor who saw her dear brother Hershel burned alive in front of her by the Nazis when he was 5. Nevertheless, she managed to survive, to make it to America and to raise a family, including a son, Dr. Alan Zelcer, my father's cardiologist, who has saved his life in the past month from COVID-19 and then from skyrocketing blood pressure.\n\nDr. Zelcer learned from his mother to value how precious and fragile life is, and how best to honor and protect it.\n\nIda lives in a skilled nursing facility in Palm Beach County, Florida, known as Lakeview Care Center. Dr. Zelcer chose this place for a reason. It is a well-lit, clean place with kind, highly skilled and caring staff.\n\nBENNETT & LEIBSOHN: CORONAVIRUS RESPONSE -- COMPARE FLORIDA WITH NEW YORK, AND LOOK AT THE RESULTS SO FAR\n\nLakeview is a great example of a nursing home that is taking seriously Gov. Ron Desantis's edict that these facilities are \"ground zero\" for COVID-19. Gilda Anderson, Lakeview's administrator told me in an interview that \"we screen our staff daily prior to entering the building, including taking their temperatures. Our staff ... are wearing the required PPE (Personal Protective Equipment) and we're enforcing all infection control protocols.\"\n\nDr. Zelcer told me that he receives a phone call notifying him whenever a patient in his mother's nursing home tests positive for COVID-19. The patient is then immediately isolated and the concerned staff is on the phone with an infectious disease specialist at Delray Medical Center, where the patient is frequently transferred.\n\nAs opposed to New York state, the patient is not returned to Lakeview Care Center until they are completely symptom-free and have received negative tests for COVID-19.\n\nIt is a complete disgrace and shows disregard for our most vulnerable treasure that New York still allows COVID-19 positive patients into our nursing homes.\n\nConsider that more than 5,000 people have died from COVID-19 in New York's nursing homes since March 1, which is three times the number of COVID-19 deaths (1,669) in the entire state of Florida, a state of comparable size and population, which also has major urban centers. New York has also not mandated testing of workers and patients in their nursing homes the way Florida has.\n\nThe solution to New York's nursing home COVID-19 problem is to look to Florida as a role model. We need to separate out people who are sick and could have the virus. Be on the lookout not just for cough, shortness of breath and fever in our elderly, but bowel problems, loss of sense of taste and smell, discolorations on toes and fingers, swollen legs (blood clots), and above all changes in behavior and fatigue.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nAny suspected COVID-19 patient should be isolated and a nearby hospital (with an established protocol with the nursing facility) should be contacted. Deep disinfection in the nursing home should be a daily event, and all staff and residents should be tested frequently for COVID-19 (the test is only 60 to 70 percent accurate) as they are at Lakeview Care Center.\n\nDiabetes, obesity, heart and lung disease and being immuno-compromised put people at additional risk (along with age) and residents with these conditions should be treated with extra care and caution.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe Trump administration should issue a set of guidelines based on the way Lakeview Care Center conducts business, and these guidelines should be sent to every governor of every state for every skilled nursing facility in the country.\n\nI would add one guideline that I haven't seen anywhere. As the weather warms, it is time to bring our nursing home residents out of doors and allow them to see their families in the flesh while observing very careful rules of social distancing. It is those moments that make life most worth living, for Ida Zelcer and her wonderful son, and for us.",

Sign up here.\n\nWe have nowhere near enough tests, and it's not clear how many week or months away we are from having them. Facts are stubborn things, and so is math.\n\nROBERT GARRETT: CORONAVIRUS - 6 LESSONS FROM A NEW JERSEY HOSPITAL SYSTEM ON THE FRONT LINES\n\nIdeally, we would test everyone in the country with symptoms of COVID-19, every one of their contacts, every hospitalized patient, and many people in places such as nursing homes, homeless shelters, prisons, and jails where the virus can spread explosively and kill quickly. That would be over a million tests a day, more than four times more than we are doing now. And that's without even considering testing others at risk, such as health care and other essential workers who don't have symptoms. That would require millions of more tests per day.\n\nPlain fact two:\n\nUntil we have enough tests, we have to prioritize. People who need to be managed carefully and safely in hospitals - such as those older than 60 and people with diabetes, lung or heart disease - need to be tested so they can be cared for more intensively, something that could save their life.\n\nResidents and staff of nursing homes, homeless shelters, prisons and jails who have symptoms must be tested and isolated to prevent explosive spread. Health care workers with symptoms must be tested so we can better protect our front-line heroes and keep our hospitals safe.\n\nContacts of infected people need to be tested so we can box the virus in through testing, isolation, contact tracing and quarantine.\n\nAnd ideally, every hospitalized patient and every resident admitted to a nursing home would be tested to prevent spread.\n\nTesting just those groups is probably twice as many tests as we are doing today.\n\nPlain fact three:\n\nNo matter the reason tests are still scarce, we need to deal with it and do the best we can. In New York City over the past few weeks, we have simply assumed that people with cough and fever have the infection and encouraged them to stay home and not get tested if they are only mildly ill.\n\nThere's a lot that everyone can do until we have enough tests. Stay home. Wear a mask when out. Wash your hands often. Try to avoid touching your face when your hands might have been contaminated.\n\nThere's a lot that everyone can do until we have enough tests. Stay home. Wear a mask when out: this protects others because you might have and spread the infection without knowing it. When others wear a mask, they are protecting you. Wash your hands often. Try to avoid touching your face when your hands might have been contaminated.\n\nWork with communities to ramp up contact tracing in order to support patients and contacts to limit the spread of the virus. Isolate the infected and quarantine the exposed so the virus stops with them. Protect our nursing homes and health care facilities by stopping visits, keeping sub-groups together, finding infections quickly and stopping outbreaks there before they spread.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nIn our report, we address testing for the virus itself, currently done by a method called a polymerase chain reaction, or PCR. Testing for antibodies - which may reflect either current or prior infection with the virus - is different. We do a deep dive into testing in Monday's edition of our weekly science briefing, for those who want to know more.\n\nWe're not certain the priority list we've suggested is the right one. Effective leadership through the COVID-19 pandemic means shifting advice to reflect the best information we have, when we have it. However the list evolves -- some groups might need tests less urgently, other groups might quickly need to be prioritized -- only by prioritizing can we make optimal use of the test capacity we have.\n\nWe can get out into the new normal as soon and as safely as possible if we recognize that there isn't one simple fix. The virus is a dangerous opponent. We have one strong tool against it - staying home. But we don't want to and can't do that forever. So we need to do whatever works, and do it as effectively as possible.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThat means being smart about testing as we scale up capacity. It means being safer as we resume some activities carefully - hand sanitizer, physical distancing, face masks and more. It means investing in and collaborating with public health and contact tracing.\n\nAnd it means recognizing that we're all in this together. We'll get through together by facing facts, acting accordingly and being creative about getting back to as much of our lives as soon and safely as possible.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY DR.

They recruited 127 patients between Feb. 10 and March 2020. Of the 127 patients, 86 were given the three-drug combination, while the remaining 41 were assigned as a control group.\n\nInterferon 1-b has generally been used to treat multiple sclerosis in the past, while lopinavir-ritonavir and ribavirin have been used to treat HIV and hepatitis C, respectively.\n\nNews of the study was first reported on by The New York Times.\n\nA number of drugs are currently being tested to see if they can treat COVID-19, including Gilead's remdesivir, which was recently granted emergency use approval by the Food and Drug Administration.\n\nThe biotech company said last week it is working with other companies to expand its remdesivir manufacturing \"through at least 2022.\" Gilead has previously said it would donate its available stock of the drug and is ramping up production.\n\nThe antiviral drug was previously used to treat Ebola patients and has been garnering massive attention as the world scrambles to contain the coronavirus pandemic. Experts, however, warn that people should not take the drug unless prescribed by a doctor.\n\nThe FDA also recently approved Moderna's COVID-19 vaccine candidate, mRNA-1273, allowing it to move to Phase II and bringing it one step closer to a potential treatment for the devastating disease.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR COMPLETE CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE\n\nAs of Monday morning, more than 4.1 million coronavirus cases have been diagnosed worldwide, more than 1.3 million of which are in the U.S., the most impacted country on the planet.",

        "authors": [],
        "body": "An antiviral drug used to treat Ebola may be an effective medicine for patients with severe COVID-19, very preliminary results from part of a clinical trial suggest.\n\nOf 113 people with severe COVID-19 who were hospitalized at University of Chicago Medicine, all received daily infusions of remdesivir, an antiviral medicine made by Gilead Sciences, according to Stat News, which broke the story.\n\n\"The best news is that most of our patients have already been discharged, which is great. We've only had two patients perish,\" Dr. Kathleen Mullane, the University of Chicago infectious diseases specialist overseeing the remdesivir studies for the hospital, said in a private video meeting that was leaked to Stat News.\n\nRelated: Latest COVID-19 news and U.S. case counts\n\nThe drug appears to reduce fever and alleviate respiratory symptoms associated with coronavirus, allowing many patients who receive it to be discharged from the hospital in less than a week. However, remdesivir has a ways to go before it may (or may not) get approval from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to safely treat COVID-19.\n\nThe patients who received remdesivir at the University of Chicago Medicine were one part of a Phase 3 clinical trial for the drug. During Phase 3, doctors test a drug in a few hundred patients looking for efficacy and monitoring for adverse effects; the fourth and last phase involves testing the drug in a much larger group of patients.\n\nHowever, there is no control group, meaning scientists can't compare these patients with a group of equally sick individuals who did not receive the drug. This is important, because it's possible that the placebo effect or another, unknown cause is playing a role in these patients' recoveries.\n\nThe same clinical trial for severe COVID-19 cases is being run on 2,400 participants at 152 institutions all over the world, but those results aren't yet public. \"What we can say at this stage is that we look forward to data from ongoing studies becoming available,\" Gilead told Stat News.\n\nRelated: Treatments for COVID-19: Drugs being tested against the coronavirus\n\nGilead is also running a trial on moderate COVID-19 cases, which includes 1,600 patients in 169 different centers, Stat News reported. These trials are investigating how effective and safe five- and 10-day trials of the drug are.\n\nRemdesivir also showed promise in a small study published online April 10 in the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM). Doctors gave the drug on a compassionate-use basis to 53 patients with COVID-19 in hospitals around the world. Each patient received the drug for 10 days. At a follow-up, 36 patients (68%) showed improvement in oxygen support. This included 17 of 30 (57%) patients on ventilators who were later extubated.\n\nIn the end, 25 patients (47%) were discharged and seven patients (13%) died, the researchers of the NEJM study reported. In contrast, studies from China (which did not include remdesivir treatment) show that between 17% and 78% of people with severe cases of COVID-19 die, the researchers said.\n\nHowever, like the leaked results from Chicago, the NEJM study did not have a control group.\n\n\"It's still a promising drug, but [the NEJM study] doesn't definitively prove anything,\" Paul Goepfert, an infectious diseases specialist at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, told The Washington Post. Goepfert was not involved in the study, but is enrolling patients in a 600-patient placebo-controlled clinical trial of remdesivir funded by the National Institutes of Health. \"The main thing you can gather from this study is it doesn't cause any untoward harm.\"\n\nRemdesivir also showed promise in rhesus macaque (Macaca mulatta) monkeys infected with the new coronavirus, according to a small, seven-day study that has yet to be published in a peer-reviewed journal. Unlike the other studies, this research, done by the U.S. National Institutes of Health, had a control group.\n\nSix monkeys given remdesivir early in their COVID-19 illness showed significantly reduced clinical disease, including pneumonia, compared with the six monkeys in the untreated group, according to the preprint posted on March 21 to the bioRxiv database. While one of the treated monkeys did have mild breathing problems, all of the untreated monkeys had rapid and difficulty breathing.\n\nIn addition, the treated monkeys had significantly less virus in their lungs and less lung damage than the untreated group did. However, the treated monkeys still shed as much virus as the other group, meaning they were just as infectious.\n\n\"This finding is of great significance for patient management, where a clinical improvement should not be interpreted as a lack of infectiousness,\" the researchers wrote in the study.",

But everyone at the meeting did get infected,\" she continued. \"There were only eight of us, which is under the 10 recommended [by the CDC], just important to keep in mind. And there were people who I had only met a couple of times before. So [it] wasn't social. There was no sharing of food or anything else.\n\n\"But everyone did contract it. And one person has since died a couple of weeks ago.\"\n\nUnaware that she had been infected, Berrent returned home to her family. Four days later, she began to feel symptomatic.\n\n\"I woke up on the morning of Friday the 13th ... and there was nothing subtle about it. I had blisters in the back of my throat. I had at least 102[-degree] fever and I had a respiratory infection. I felt like I had an anvil on my chest,\" she said. \"The first thing I did, and I thank goodness for this every day, is within 15 minutes of waking up with those symptoms, I grabbed my laptop and a couple of other things and I went into my bedroom and I stayed in self-isolation.\n\nNY MOTHER HOPES TO CONNECT FELLOW COROANVIRUS SURVIVORS WITH RESEARCHERS\n\n\"Other than leaving to go get tested, I didn't leave the four corners of my bedroom for 18 days,\" said Berrent, who added to host Dave Anthony: \"I think that there's an overriding civic duty to make sure that if you are infected, the infection stops at you so that you're not responsible for the continued spread.\"\n\nBerrent was initially unable to secure a coroanvirus test due to lack of availability, and required the help of Democratic Congressman Tom Suozzi. After testing positive, she saw a window of opportunity and spent her time in isolation launching an organization to help others affected by the virus.\n\n\"They had this sort of 'Ah-ha!' moment realizing that...

You'll be amazed at how much little rituals of self-care can help lift your mood.\n\n\"Something to remember is - no rules,\" she continued. \"If one night you can't fall asleep, fine.

But it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia, and death for some people, especially older adults and people with existing health problems.\n\nAround the world, confirmed infections stood at more than 3.1 million -- including 1 million in the U.S. -- and the confirmed global death toll topped 217,000, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University. The true toll is believed to be much higher because of limited testing, differences in counting the dead and concealment by some governments.",

Sign up here.\n\nFormer New York Times reporter Alex Berenson, who has become a lightning-rod figure during the coronavirus crisis for his detailed criticisms of state lockdown measures, told Fox News' Brit Hume in an interview Monday that he thinks officials' emphasis on expanded testing for the virus is an \"excuse\" to put off reopening the economy.\n\nBerenson made the comments to Hume on an episode of the \"Fox News Rundown Podcast,\" which comes out Wednesday.\n\nBerenson, who was with the Times from 1999 to 2010 primarily covering the pharmaceutical industry, explained that he thinks the economic harms of keeping businesses closed -- as under current stay-at-home orders from many governors -- are worse than the health effects of lifting them even before comprehensive testing is available.\n\nCORONAVIRUS: WHAT TO KNOW\n\nBRIT HUME'S INTERVIEW WITH EX-NYT REPORTER ALEX BERENSON: READ THE TRANSCRIPT\n\n\"I think the antibody testing matters,\" Berenson said of the tests that can tell people whether they've previously had the coronavirus and have some natural immunity to it. \"I think the infectious testing is an excuse to delay this. I think putting this on widespread testing of live infection of people who are actually infected right now is meaningless.\"\n\nHe continued: \"If people get sick, they can get tested. I mean, I'm not saying we shouldn't test people. But I'm saying that saying we need to be able to do a million tests a day before we can reopen is just an excuse not to reopen the country.\"\n\nHume pushed back on Berenson's answer, noting that public health experts have repeatedly said testing for the coronavirus is the most important thing to have up-and-running before reopening businesses, schools and public gathering places like bars.\n\nMaryland Republican Gov. Larry Hogan, for example, announced with much fanfare Monday that he and his wife Yumi, who is a South Korean immigrant and fluent in Korean, had secured 500,000 coronavirus tests for the state from South Korea after intense negotiation and diplomacy.\n\nEX-NYT REPORTER ALEX BERENSON CALLS ON GOVERNORS TO REOPEN SCHOOLS, QUESTIONS CORONAVIRUS LOCKDOWNS\n\n\"From the beginning of this coronavirus pandemic, one of the biggest problems in America has been the lack of availability of testing,\" Hogan said Monday. \"It remains the most serious obstacle to safely reopening our states.\"\n\n\"What do you think is behind this?\" Hume asked Berenson, noting top White House coronavirus task force doctors Anthony Fauci and Deborah Birx are \"serious, qualified, articulate, able\" experts who are \"on board with this\" and not challenging the current strategy like he is.\n\nBerenson cited other experts who have advocated a different view from Fauci and Birx.\n\n\"On the other side, most notably a Swedish epidemiologist who ... ran Sweden's public health department for a number of years and thinks the lockdowns are a huge mistake. He actually gave a very good interview a couple of days ago,\" Berenson said.\n\n\"I'm not a conspiracy theorist, OK?\" Berenson said. \"You know, I don't think this is like, this is all part of a plan to, you know, to make us green or bring Trump down. ... But here's what I think. When people take a public position that causes massive, massive, massive economic and societal disruption, it's going to be hard to get them to acknowledge that position was wrong. Or even that it can be changed right now in the light of new data.\"\n\nBerenson also addressed a number of other topics in his discussion with Hume, including how his thinking on the coronavirus has evolved and when schools should open. He also questioned how some places are counting their coronavirus deaths, noting that most people who die because of the coronavirus are older.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"And so that raises the question of whether some people are dying with, rather than of, this,\" Berenson said.\n\n\"Some states have decided that you don't even have to have a positive test,\" he continued, later in the conversation. \"That basically it looks like almost anybody who is aged and has any sort of flu-like or pneumonia-like symptoms and dies. You know, in the last month. It's gonna be coded as a COVID death without a positive test. And it's hard to know why. Why the states would do that except to try to get the death counts up.\"\n\nBerenson in recent years has made his name by advocating against the legalization of marijuana, writing a book titled \"Tell Your Children the Truth About Marijuana, Mental Illness and Violence.\"\n\nThe full version of the conversation between Hume and Berenson comes out Wednesday on the \"Fox News Rundown Podcast.\"",

Sign up here.\n\nAn angelic voice singing \"Hallelujah\" echoes off the stately stone and brick canyons of a narrow Montmartre street.\n\nStill struggling with COVID-19 complications two months after falling ill, Parisian soprano Veronica Antonelli wanted the impromptu performance from her third-floor balcony to project hope. Hours earlier, her doctor had delivered troubling news: The lung scarring that sometimes makes her too tired to sing may last for months. Or maybe years.\n\nCORONAVIRUS OUTBREAK AT MARUCHAN RAMEN NOODLE FACTORY IN VIRGINIA SICKENS AT LEAST 7 WORKERS\n\n\"It makes things a bit complicated, given my profession,\" Antonelli said sadly.\n\nThe virus that has sickened over 4 million people around the world and killed more than 280,000 others is so new that patients face considerable uncertainty about what they can expect in recovery and beyond.\n\n\"The short answer is that we're still learning,\" said Dr. Jay Varkey, an infectious disease specialist at Emory University in Atlanta. \"What we know has been gathered mostly by anecdotal reports from COVID-19 survivors.\"\n\nIn support groups created on social media sites, survivors post head-to-toe complaints that read like a medical encyclopedia: anxiety, heart palpitations, muscle aches, bluish toes. It's hard to know which ones are clearly related to the virus, but the accounts help fuel doctors' increasing belief that COVID-19 is not just a respiratory disease.\n\nPersistent exhaustion is a common theme, but every survivor's story is different, said Brandy Swayze, a coronavirus sufferer who created a Facebook survivors group after developing pneumonia. She was hospitalized in late March and early April. Her fatigue comes and goes. Insomnia is another concern.\n\n\"We're just people who have more questions than anybody else about this thing because we're going through it,\" said Swayze, 43, of Cabin John, Md.\n\nOn top of her lung damage and fatigue, Antonelli has issues with her memory and a diminished sense of taste and smell -- a common early symptom that lingers for many, which doctors say stems from the virus attacking nerves.\n\nTwo-thirds of patients in a study in Italy had a loss of smell and taste. Some reports suggest these problems last only a few weeks, but it's been almost two months for Antonelli. She said that when she asked a voice specialist when she would be able to smell again, his answer was \"'We know nothing. We just have to be patient. We have no solution.'\"\n\nAntonelli, 45, needs her stamina back to resume her offbeat career -- singing opera a capella at outdoor monuments and historic sites, a profession she chose because she likes how natural environments shape her voice.\n\nStuck at home, she sings at her balcony when she can to bring happiness and thank health workers, grocers and others for their service during the pandemic. Some days, though, she's simply too tired to leave her bed.\n\nCORONAVIRUS IN THE US: STATE-BY-STATE BREAKDOWN\n\nIn Wuhan, China, where COVID-19 emerged in December, physicians first considered it a type of pneumonia. But they came to realize \"this virus is so smart. It just attacked everywhere in the body,\" Dr. Xin Zheng of Wuhan Union Hospital said in a livestreamed webinar this month.\n\nLungs, hearts, kidneys, even the brain can be affected. Some hospitalized patients develop blood clots, while others have elevated enzymes suggesting liver abnormalities.\n\n\"That's a very unique characteristic of it,\" said Dr. Thomas McGinn of Northwell Health hospitals in New York. He co-authored the largest U.S. study of hospitalized COVID-19 patients, and a follow-up is planned to see how they're faring in recovery.\n\nAlex Melo, a retired marine from York, Maine, became critically ill with COVID-19 last month. He spent a few days on a ventilator for pneumonia, but also developed blood clots that threatened his heart and lungs. After two weeks in the hospital, he was sent home on blood thinners he must take for at least a few months.\n\nThe drugs make him prone to bleeding, and he worries how that will affect his work as a survival instructor for a Department of Defense contractor. But he's not ready for that work anyway. After two weeks at home, his lungs are still recovering and he can't run without getting winded.\n\n\"I need to take this slow,'' Melo said.\n\nReports from China suggest those with mild infections recover two to three weeks after first showing symptoms. For those with more serious infections, recovery may take six weeks, said Varkey, the infectious disease specialist.\n\nBut recovery may take much longer for those with the most severe infections, including patients who spent time in intensive care on ventilators or dialysis.\n\nWuhan doctors have reported heart problems in a small portion of hospitalized patients, including inflammation of the heart muscle and irregular heartbeats, both of which can increase risks for heart failure, Varkey noted.\n\nMany of the problems may be caused by the virus itself, a hyperactive immune response to the virus, the treatment involved or a combination of all three, he said.\n\nSome survivors who had long stays in intensive care may require oxygen therapy or dialysis at home. Some may develop a condition called post-intensive care syndrome, which can include persistent muscle weakness, fatigue, attention and memory problems and anxiety. The condition has been seen in COVID-19 survivors who were put on ventilators, but it can happen after any critical illness and may be related to treatment, including sedation and prolonged bed rest.\n\nConsidering that most COVID-19 patients on ventilators don't survive, western Illinois truck driver Scott Dobbels is making a remarkable recovery.\n\nDobbels spent 17 days in the hospital, eight of them on a ventilator. He returned to his home in Silvis on April 20 weighing 20 pounds less and pushing a metal walker. The next day, he went just to check things out at the lumber yard where he works and returned exhausted.\n\n\"It put me back in bed for three days. Too much, too soon,\" he said.\n\nAt first, just brushing his teeth was an effort. After several sessions with a physical therapist, he's regaining muscle and strength. And to exercise his damaged lungs, he blows into a special inhaler several times a day.\n\nDobbels says he feels great, despite lingering muscle pain and some weakness, and plans to return to work May 13.\n\nHe also has lingering questions about why his case was so severe when his wife, Elizabeth, became infected but experienced only mild symptoms.\n\nHEADING BACK TO WORK POST-CORONAVIRUS: EXPERTS OFFER TIPS ON STAYING SAFE\n\n\"Why me?\" he said. \"Why did I get it, why did I almost die, when others weren't as severely affected?''",

All of the treated patients were in intensive care because of acute respiratory failure and eight had been placed on mechanical ventilation. Some seven of the patients were organ transplant recipients so they were on immunosuppressive treatment and 10 were on dialysis.

    "FDA probes Abbott's rapid coronavirus test accuracy issues": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "WASHINGTON - Federal health officials are alerting doctors to a potential accuracy problem with a rapid test for COVID-19 used at thousands of hospitals, clinics and testing sites across the U.S., including the White House.\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration said late Thursday it is investigating preliminary data suggesting Abbott Laboratories' 15-minute test can miss COVID-19 cases, falsely clearing patients of infection. The test is used daily at the White House to test President Donald Trump and key members of his staff, including the coronavirus task force.\n\nCORONAVIRUS INFECTIOUS WOULD PLUNGE IF 80 PERCENT OF PEOPLE WORE MASKS, STUDY SAYS\n\nThe warning came one day after researchers at New York University reported results suggesting Abbott's test can miss up to half the infections caught by a rival test made by Cepheid. The research has not been peer-reviewed or published in a medical journal and was based on about 100 patients.\n\nThe researchers found that Abbott's test, run on the company's portable ID NOW system, missed one-third of the infections caught by Cepheid's test when swabs were stored in liquid used to transport laboratory samples. When the samples were kept dry the test missed 48 percent of the cases flagged by Cepheid's test.\n\nThe researchers called the test's performance \"unacceptable,\" due to the risk of falsely clearing patients who could spread the infection to others. They acknowledged the shortcomings of the study, including the time needed to transport patient samples to the device for processing.\n\nAbbott rejected the findings, saying the researchers used the test \"in ways that it was not designed to be used.\"\n\nCHILLING VIDEO SHOWS HOW CORONAVIRUS SPREADS AT RESTAURANT BUFFET\n\n\"ID NOW is intended to be used near the patient with a direct swab test method,\" the company said in a statement. The company pointed to other independent study results that found the test accurately detected 90 percent or more infections.\n\nLast month Abbott changed the instructions for its test to explicitly warn against putting patient samples in transport chemicals. The update came after researchers at the Cleveland Clinic reported a 15 percent false-negative rate for samples stored in the chemicals.\n\nThe FDA said in a statement it is reviewing the data with Abbott and working on a letter to health care providers about potential accuracy issues. The agency said physicians may need to confirm the results of a negative Abbott test if patients have signs and symptoms of the virus. Regulators said they are requiring Abbott to conduct follow-up studies on the test's accuracy.\n\n\"This test can still be used and can correctly identify many positive cases in minutes,\" said Dr. Tim Stenzel, FDA's diagnostics director.\n\nThe FDA first cleared Abbott's test in late March under emergency powers used to quickly accelerate the review of tests and treatments during a public health crisis. The agency has authorized more than 90 tests, effectively flooding the market with testing options amid persistent problems ramping up testing levels.\n\nFor weeks, Trump has promoted Abbott's test as a \"game-changer.\" On Monday, the company's ID NOW system and test cartridges were displayed prominently at a Rose Garden press conference meant to highlight the nation's progress on testing.\n\n\"These tests are highly sophisticated -- very quick, very good,\" Trump told reporters.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR COMPLETE CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE\n\nThe administration has shipped more than 235,000 of the tests to state public health laboratories. And Abbott has separately said it has distributed 1.8 million tests to health care facilities in all 50 states.\n\nA White House spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment Thursday night.",

The publication withheld the man's name over privacy concerns.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR COMPLETE CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE\n\nDowd's family was initially told the 57-year-old otherwise healthy woman's death was due to a \"massive\" heart attack that \"likely killed her before she hit the floor,\" the Chronicle reported.\n\nDowd, who worked as an auditor at the semiconductor company Lam Research, traveled a lot for her job and underwent regular health screenings, her father said.\n\n\"Because she had to travel, [her company] had her get checkups by doctors.

Sign up here.\n\nFormer chairman of the California Republican Party Tom Del Beccaro pushed back on the state's stay-at-home order on Wednesday, saying he thinks \"things are going to unravel\" for Gov. Gavin Newsom.\n\n\"California is a big place and treating northern California or the eastern counties the same as L.A. makes no sense,\" Del Beccaro said on \"Fox & Friends First\" on Wednesday. \"There's a lot of rumblings, a lot of lawsuits, a lot of counties that are fighting back.\"\n\nHe then revealed what he called a \"dirty little secret.\"\n\n\"The district attorneys and certain sheriffs aren't enforcing Gavin Newsom's rules, so I think things are going to unravel for him,\" Beccaro said.\n\nDel Beccaro made the statements one day after Newsom unveiled a four-stage plan to reopen the state's economy.\n\nThis week Newsom said, \"Politics will not drive our decision-making, protests won't drive our decision-making.\"\n\nCLICK HERE FOR COMPLETE CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE\n\n\"We need to protect not just the business community, but customers of those businesses,\" he added.\n\nUnlike Georgia and other states that are already allowing hair and nail salons to operate, those would have to wait until a later phase of California's reopening plan, the state public health director Sonia Angell said. Mass gatherings, including concerts and sporting events, are even further away, possibly not until there's a virus treatment.\n\nIt wasn't clear when restaurants could allow dine-in services again. Many have been offering takeout and delivery since Newsom issued his statewide stay-at-home order March 19; however, thousands of restaurant workers have lost their jobs.\n\nThe state's unemployment department has processed 3.2 million unemployment claims because of the coronavirus, Newsom said in a news briefing on Monday, KXTV reported.\n\nDel Beccaro said Newsom's four-stage plan is \"unrealistic,\" emphasizing how important tourism is to California's economy and hospitality industry.\n\n\"Where do restaurants fall in this plan? It's not clear and there's already an estimate that 30 percent to 40 percent of restaurants in California will never reopen,\" he noted.\n\nNewsom said this week that California may be only a few weeks away from making \"meaningful changes\" to its stay-at-home order and warned progress will be jeopardized if people do things like crowd beaches, which occurred last weekend.\n\nDel Beccaro said that Newsom's plan unveiled Tuesday indicates that California's reopening won't happen for months, not weeks.\n\n\"I think he's going to get pushback and also what you find, is here and there, and I talked to people today throughout the state, there are non-essential businesses already doing that kind of work, opening up and doing things,\" Del Beccaro said.\n\n\"California is just too big for one man to try to control and some of these lawsuits are going to overturn his rules,\" he continued.\n\nOfficials from six rural Northern California counties -- Sutter, Yuba, Butte, Colusa, Tehama and Glenn -- wrote to Newsom this week asking to implement \"a careful and phased reopening of our local economies.\" The counties, with a population of about 500,000, have seen fewer than 100 confirmed coronavirus cases and a handful of deaths.\n\nDel Beccaro noted on Wednesday that those counties \"have almost no cases whatsoever.\"\n\n\"Of course they're very sparsely populated, unlike Los Angeles, so those six counties make a great case for saying treat us different than Los Angeles,\" he continued.\n\nHe then noted that \"protests and lawsuits are gaining speed\" and said he expected some of the rulings to be turned over.\n\nThere have been a few protests by people who want to reopen the state, saying their liberty and livelihoods are at stake. On Sunday, dozens rallied in Pacific Beach in San Diego.\n\nThree people were arrested at a rally just north of San Diego and were cited for violating health orders, Sheriff's Lt. Ricardo Lopez said.\n\nMeantime, the six San Francisco Bay Area counties said it's too early for them to ease restrictions.\n\nAs of Wednesday, California has reported more than 46,000 coronavirus cases and 1,862 deaths, according to data compiled by Fox News. More than half of the state's cases and deaths have been reported in Los Angeles County, according to Johns Hopkins University.\n\nThe number of infections, however, is thought to be far higher because many people have not been tested and studies suggest people can have COVID-19 without showing symptoms.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP",

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.\n\nOnly now, she performs in an operating room rather than the pool.\n\nOne of America's greatest Olympic swimmers, Thompson is on the front line of the fight against coronavirus as an anesthesiologist at the VA Medical Center in Charleston, South Carolina.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM\n\n\"I like things that happen fast,\" she said in a telephone interview with The Associated Press. \"In the operating room, things happen fast.\"\n\nThompson competed in four Olympics, winning eight golds and 12 medals overall before she retired after the 2004 Athens Games. Then she turned to her other passion.\n\nHealth care.\n\nThe Massachusetts native chose anesthesiogy because it fit the persona of a swimmer who specialized in shorter races.\n\n\"I loved the acute nature of helping patients during surgery,\" Thompson said. \"As a sprinter, I really appreciated the fast changes you see in physiology. You're giving drugs and seeing immediate results.\"\n\nAfter working in a private practice in Maine for seven years, she moved to Charleston in 2018 along with her husband and their two young sons, now 4 and 7.\n\nThe coronavirus outbreak added a whole new element to her job.\n\n\"When I saw it coming our way, I had a lot of fear about being protected,\" the 47-year-old Thompson conceded. \"Once we had adequate PPE (personal protective equipment), I felt like I was ready.\"\n\nThe virus has yet to have a major impact in South Carolina, which has recorded about 6,500 cases and less than 300 deaths. The VA hospital in Charleston has dealt with only one serious case of Covid-19, according to Thompson, and a handful of other patients who were stricken milder symptoms.\n\nBut aging veterans are an especially vulnerable group. Thompson knows the numbers could get worse, especially with South Carolina joining a growing list of states that are taking steps to reopen even as the death toll in the United States climbs toward 70,000.\n\nA mandatory \"work-or-home\" order was lifted Monday by South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster, who also eased other restrictions on daily life.\n\n\"The end is not anywhere in sight. I know we will see more patients,\" Thompson said. \"We're prepared and we're ready.\"\n\nShe has mixed feelings about lifting restrictions that have helped curb the spread of the highly infectious virus, but have sent the economy into a record-setting plunge.\n\n\"I'm worried there's going to be another surge of cases,\" Thompson said. \"I also think it's a delicate balance of what people can handle, and what the economy can handle. Unemployment is the worst it's been in history, but people need to be accountable for their actions.\"\n\nThis past weekend, there were scenes around the country of people gathering in large numbers, many of them not wearing masks or staying the recommended 6 feet apart. Some headed to the beach. Others congregated in city parks. There were even reports of people lining up at an Atlanta mall to purchase a newly released Air Jordan sneaker from Nike.\n\nThat is troubling to health-care workers such as Thompson.\n\n\"We have to take social distancing seriously,\" she said, \"We have to wear masks. We have to stay 6 feet apart. We can't have parties. We need social responsibility. I know we need to open up, but we need to do it smartly, based on data. We can't just have a date in mind to do it. We need to do it only when it's appropriate for that region based on the data.\"\n\nThompson looks back fondly on her athletic career. She was one of America's greatest relay swimmers, capturing 10 of her 12 Olympic medals while teaming with others. She is tied with fellow swimmers Dara Torres and Natalie Coughlin for the most overall medals by an American woman. Only Michael Phelps has won more.\n\n\"For a long time, I was so immersed in my medical training and starting a new career and having a new family, I didn't think about it too much,\" Thompson said. \"But as time goes on, and people are still talking about what I did, it's becoming more clear that it was a really special career. I'm just so grateful for all the people around me who helped me.\"\n\nSwimming, it turned out, merely prepared her for a higher calling.\n\nThomson still has the fierce competitiveness that served her so well in the pool. Only now, she's taking on a far more daunting opponent.\n\n\"Through my swimming career, I learned mental toughness and how to deal with adverse situations,\" she said. \"I've tried to extend the mental toughness to those around me. This is the ultimate challenge that any of us has ever faced.",

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.\n\nFollowing a media report that Amazon used data from its own sellers to sell competing products, Sen. Josh Hawley, R.-Mo., has written the Department of Justice, asking the agency to \"open a criminal antitrust investigation\" on the tech giant.\n\n\"Recent reports suggest that Amazon has engaged in predatory and exclusionary data practices to build and maintain a monopoly,\" Hawley wrote in a letter addressed to Attorney General William Barr. \"These practices are alarming for America's small businesses even under ordinary circumstances. But at a time when most small retail businesses must rely on Amazon because of coronavirus-related shutdowns, predatory data practices threaten these businesses' very existence.\"\n\nThe letter, dated April 28, comes after The Wall Street Journal reported the Jeff Bezos-led company violated its own policies to launch competing products, citing interviews with more than 20 former employees of the company's private-label business and documents reviewed by The Journal.\n\nAS AMAZON WORKS THROUGH CORONAVIRUS CASES NEAR NYC, COMPANY EXTENDS BENEFITS FOR WAREHOUSE WORKERS\n\nIt's a common practice in the retail industry, especially among grocers, to use third-party data to launch private-label brands.\n\nHowever, the tech giant previously told Congress it does not \"use individual seller data directly to compete\" with businesses on Amazon's platform, according to comments made by Amazon associate general counsel Nate Sutton.\n\nThe Journal cites one example of Amazon employees gaining access to documents and data about a bestselling car-trunk organizer sold by a third-party vendor. That data included total sales, how much the vendor paid Amazon for marketing and shipping, and how much Amazon made on each sale. Later on, Amazon's private-label arm introduced its own car-trunk organizers.\n\n\"The kind of data Amazon can access poses a much greater threat to competition than the data accessible to ordinary retail stores,\" Hawley added. \"Brick-and-mortar stores collect data, such as how often third-party products are purchased, when they are purchased, and whether they are purchased in combination with other products. But online retailers like Amazon can collect so much more data. They can track how long a person's attention lingers on a product, which features attract a person's attention, which images a person views and for how long, and what reviews a person reads. Amazon's capacity for data collection is like a brick-and mortar retailer attaching a camera to every customer's forehead.\"\n\nAMAZON FIRES MORE EMPLOYEES WHO CRITICIZED WAREHOUSE CONDITIONS DURING CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC\n\nFox News has reached out to Amazon and Hawley's office with a request for comment.\n\nThe letter from Hawley is the latest on the company from a U.S. lawmaker over concerns about its business practices.\n\nIn March, a group of four U.S. senators, including Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. and Cory Booker, D-N.J., wrote a letter to Amazon founder and CEO Bezos expressing their concern about the health and safety of the company's warehouse workers.\n\nThe company has also been under intense scrutiny from its own employees over concerns for warehouse workers' safety and well-being.\n\nCORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC FORCES AMAZON TO WAIT-LIST NEW ONLINE GROCERY CUSTOMERS AS IT STRUGGLES WITH DEMAND\n\nFormer Amazon employee Christian Smalls demanded that the Bezos-led company close its Staten Island fulfillment center for a deep cleaning after a worker tested positive for COVID-19 in mid-March. Smalls was later fired, with Amazon telling Fox News it terminated him because he violated several terms of his employment.\n\nAfter the news of Smalls' termination, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio ordered an investigation into the incident. New York Attorney General Letitia James also issued a statement, saying \"it is disgraceful\" Smalls was terminated after he \"bravely stood up to protect himself and his colleagues.\"\n\nEarlier this month, Amazon fired two more employees, Emily Cunningham and Maren Costa, who criticized the alleged lax working conditions at its various warehouses and fulfillment centers around the country.\n\nAmazon senior vice president of worldwide operations Dave Clark recently said the company was boosting the level of safety precautions it was taking at its various fulfillment centers, including checking temperatures of its associates. Clark added it was finally able to secure the \"millions of masks\" it ordered weeks ago.\n\nBezos recently revealed the company is working on building COVID-19 testing capacity for its employees, including those who aren't showing symptoms.\n\nGET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nFox News' Christopher Carbone contributed to this story.",

Additionally, the researchers said that as many as one in five of those who contracted the novel coronavirus were asymptomatic.\n\nPTSD IN CORONAVIRUS SURVIVORS, DOCTORS BECOMES NEW FOCUS FOR HOSPITALS ACROSS US\n\nThe researchers focused on Gangelt, a town near the Dutch border that had the highest number of fatalities in Germany, and analyzed blood and nasal swabs from 919 people. A carnival celebration is believed to have set off the COVID-19 spread. Approximately 15 percent of the town had been infected, according to the study.\n\n\"For the first time, our data enables us to estimate how many people have been infected after the super-spreading event,\" Dr. Hendrik Streeck, director of the institute for virology at the University Hospital Bonn, said in a news release. \"The total number of infections allows us to determine the infection fatality rate. In Gangelt the infection fatality rate (IFR) after the SARS CoV-2 outbreak is .37 percent.\"\n\nThe researchers applied the 0.37 infection rate and the total number of deaths and were able to estimate the number of infections in areas with similar demographics to land on their results, which found about a 10-fold increase in the number of infections that have gone undetected versus those that have been reported.\n\nCORONAVIRUS VACCINE MAY NEVER COME, HEALTH EXPERT WARNS\n\n\"The results can be used to further improve models on the transmission behavior of the virus,\" Dr. Gunther Hartmann, director of the Institute for Clinical Chemistry and Clinical Pharmacology at the University Hospital Bonn and speaker of the Cluster of Excellence, ImmunoSensation, said in the news release. \"Until now, basis for such data has been relatively uncertain.\"\n\nThey are planning further research to explore whether patients who showed symptoms were more active in the carnival celebrations compared to those who were asymptomatic.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR COMPLETE CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE\n\n\"Apparently one in five infections occurs without noticeable symptoms suggests that infected persons who secrete virus and can infect others cannot be reliably identified on the basis of recognizable symptoms of the disease,\" Dr. Martin Exner, head of the Institute for Hygiene and Public Health and co-author of the study, said in a news release. \"Every supposedly healthy person we encounter can unknowingly carry the virus.

Andrew Cuomo reverses his policy on nursing homes taking positive coronavirus patients and enacts strict new precautions; New York Post columnist Miranda Devine reacts.\n\nGet all the latest news on coronavirus and more delivered daily to your inbox. Sign up here.\n\nNew York Gov. Andrew Cuomo is being accused of failing to protect nursing home residents during the coronavirus pandemic, which one state representative called an \"inexcusable tragedy.\" While many are blaming Cuomo's policies for the high death toll, one place you won't hear any questions about it is on CNN, where experts point out the governor is instead lobbed softball questions during playful interviews with his younger brother, CNN anchor Chris Cuomo.\n\nGov. Cuomo recently reversed a March 25 order that forced nursing homes to accept patients who tested positive for coronavirus despite testing deficiencies for both residents and staff. Cuomo signed an executive order on May 11 stopping hospitals from sending infected patients back to nursing homes and ramping up testing for staff.\n\nMore than 4,800 people died from COVID-19 in nursing homes in New York from March 1 to May 1, according to a count by the governor's office. Roughly 25 percent of all deaths in the state have occurred in nursing homes.\n\nCUOMO SAYS 'NOBODY' SHOULD BE PROSECUTED OVER CORONAVIRUS DEATHS AMID CRITICISM OVER NURSING HOME POLICY\n\n\"What may turn out to have been Cuomo's worst unforced error was his March 25 order that nursing homes must accept patients who carried the coronavirus. This now looks like setting off a series of time bombs in New York State's elder-care facilities, and Cuomo didn't reverse this policy until May 11,\" National Review's Kyle Smith wrote in a piece headlined, \"Andrew Cuomo's Reckless Choices.\"\n\n\"We now know that Democratic New York Governor Andrew Cuomo had been packing coronavirus patients into nursing homes for weeks, possibly killing untold numbers of people,\" NewsBusters analyst Nicholas Fondacaro wrote on May 14, while New York Post columnist Michael Goodwin wrote on May 5, \"This nursing home disaster is on you, Gov. Cuomo.\"\n\nSome local lawmakers are demanding action. Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., is seeking a federal probe into Cuomo's policy.\n\nNYC COUNCILMAN SAYS BIPARTISAN PRESSURE MOUNTING FOR PROBE OF CUOMO'S 'BACKWARD' NURSING HOME ORDER\n\n\"Today I joined my [New York GOP] colleagues in the House to call for a federal investigation of Cuomo's failed nursing home policies,\" Stefanik tweeted Friday. \"NOW they admit they unethically changed the way they report nursing home deaths. An INEXCUSABLE tragedy for NY -- NEED ANSWERS.\"\n\nNew York Republican Assemblywoman Nicole Malliotakis also called for an independent federal investigation last week during an appearance on \"Tucker Carlson Tonight.\"\n\n\"On March 24th, Gov. Cuomo said, 'My mother is not expendable, your mother is not expendable' and yet the very next day he signed an executive order mandating nursing homes -- where our most vulnerable mothers and our most vulnerable fathers reside -- to accept COVID positive patients,\" Malliotakis said. \"There are 5,000 residents of nursing homes or patients that have been put into nursing homes that have died, which account for 25 percent of the deaths in the state of New York.\"\n\nVIDEO HIGHLIGHTING CNN HOST BRIAN STELTER'S 'OBSESSION' WITH RUSSIA INVESTIGATION GOES VIRAL\n\nNew York City Republican Councilman Joe Borelli explained on Monday why there are now \"bipartisan calls\" for an investigation.\n\n\"The truth of the matter is on March 25, the Cuomo administration made a decision in the form of a written policy that prevented nursing homes from rejecting patients that were testing positive for COVID-19 from coming back into the nursing home,\" Borelli told \"Fox & Friends First.\"\n\nJust last week, the Empire State reported more than 1,700 previously undisclosed deaths at nursing homes and adult care facilities. According to a tally from The Associated Press, over 5,300 New Yorkers living in nursing homes have died from the virus and the toll has been increasing by an average of 20 to 25 deaths a day for the past few weeks.\n\nCNN DOWNPLAYS MICHAEL FLYNN 'UNMASKING' BOMBSHELL AFTER YEARS OF WALL-TO-WALL RUSSIA-TRUMP COVERAGE\n\nBorelli said that family members of deceased older relatives \"really want answers\" and \"real pressure\" is mounting across party lines.\n\nThey won't be getting any answers from watching \"Cuomo Prime Time.\"\n\nThe governor's younger brother's show on CNN has instead been the showcase for playful banter between the siblings. Governor Cuomo has been interviewed on CNN at least 19 times since March 8, with his younger brother conducting nine of them.\n\n\"CNN's coverage of Andrew Cuomo has been consistent with much of the media, focus on the glowing verbiage and ignore the catastrophic mishandling of nursing homes that led to thousands of deaths,\" Cornell Law School professor and media critic William A. Jacobson told Fox News.\n\nELISE STEFANIK ASKS FEDS TO INVESTIGATE CUOMO'S 'FAILED' NURSING HOME POLICY\n\n\"This problem is compounded by a serious conflict of interest arising from the relationship between Chris Cuomo, one of CNN's highest-profile news personalities, and his brother the Governor,\" Jacobson added. \"Chris Cuomo should not be allowed to cover or comment on air about his brother, and CNN should appoint someone to monitor and review coverage of Andrew Cuomo to prevent this conflict of interest from bleeding over to other news coverage.\"\n\nThe last time anyone from CNN asked the New York governor a question pertaining to nursing homes was all the way back on March 10 -- two weeks before the governor's order that forced nursing homes to accept patients who tested positive for coronavirus -- when Jake Tapper asked if the state was ready to handle the type of coronavirus-related tragedy that occurred in Kirkland, Wash., where 19 people had died at the Life Care Center nursing home.\n\n\"Jake, that's my nightmare. And that's where you're going to see the pain and the damage from this virus. Senior citizen homes, nursing homes, congregant senior facilities -- that is my nightmare. We've taken steps, some drastic steps in this area,\" Cuomo responded. \"All you need is 9-year-old Johnny to visit his grandma in a nursing home, give her a kiss, and you can be off to the races. That's my fear. That population in those congregate facilities. That is really what we have to watch.\"\n\nCuomo was pressed about his nursing home policy this past Sunday, but it not by a CNN reporter. During Cuomo's daily briefing in Albany, a local reporter asked if lives would have been saved if the policy were reversed earlier.\n\nNYC COUNCILMAN SAYS BIPARTISAN PRESSURE MOUNTING FOR PROBE OF CUOMO'S 'BACKWARD' NURSING HOME ORDER\n\n\"People rationalize death in different ways... I don't think there is any logical rationale to say they would be alive today,\" Cuomo said.\n\nCNN's audience has instead grown accustomed to questions such as whether or not the governor considers himself an eligible bachelor, and who is the favorite child.\n\nRecent headlines on CNN's website include, \"Andrew Cuomo may be the single most popular politician in America right now,\" \"Gov. Cuomo got tested for Covid-19 at a press conference to show how easy it is\" and \"Andrew Cuomo is down for Robert De Niro to play him.\"\n\n\"CNN's natural assumption is that the president is an incompetent liar, and Cuomo is comparable to Churchill. No one who watches CNN can ignore that they dramatically favor the Democrats, and Governor Cuomo in particular,\" Media Research Center director of media analysis Tim Graham told Fox News.\n\nCNN hasn't exactly been critical when it covered the nursing home controversy. The network billed Gov. Cuomo as \"trying to head off further disaster\" when it comes to nursing home tragedies and typically only mentions criticism aimed at Cuomo for the sake of amplifying his policy changes.\n\n\"In recent days, CNN has reported on individual states with spiking numbers that are simply flooring. In New Jersey, more than half the state's deaths from coronavirus have come at long-term care facilities. And in New Hampshire, as of a few days ago, nearly 80 percent of the deaths were at nursing homes. In New York, Governor Andrew Cuomo is trying to head off further disaster,\" correspondent Brian Todd said on May 11.\n\nBARSTOOL SPORTS' DAVE PORTNOY SAYS CORONAVIRUS HAS 'CLEARLY BEEN POLITICIZED' BY ANTI-TRUMP MEDIA\n\nThe network's wire report on May 10 previewed Cuomo's new directive without mentioning that he is regularly blamed for the situation the rules were enacted to reverse. Indeed CNN hosts often gloss over negative news when the network returns from airing Cuomo's daily briefings.\n\n\"You are listening to the governor of New York Andrew Cuomo at the end there where we dropped out of that briefing after about 40 minutes or so talking about what will be a legacy stain of the coronavirus crisis that the high rate of deaths in nursing homes not just in New York State, the governor discussing there, but across the United States,\" John King said on May 5. \"Governor saying there is no doubt New York is coming down the other side of the mountain. Its curve is coming off the peak and now getting closer to a better situation.\"\n\nCNN's Fredricka Whitfield briefly acknowledge the criticism on May 10 in order to set up correspondent Evan McMorris-Santoro to discuss how Cuomo's updated policy.\n\n\"When it comes to nursing homes, the governor is saying, essentially, they're going to be putting resources in nursing homes. They're going to be requiring nursing home staff to get tested twice a week. And they're going to be saying that if you have a COVID positive person, will not be transferred into a nursing home, will instead be taken to either stay in a hospital or taken to a COVID specific nursing home. It's all an attempt to sort of round out these questions but it also speaks to how ongoing this problem is even as the state moves into a period where we're going to maybe see some parts of some regions shifting into reopening,\" McMorris-Santoro said.\n\nOn May 17, CNN's media critic Brian Stelter perhaps came closest to a Cuomo criticism when he went on \"CNN Newsroom\" to declare: \"It's a good thing that Cuomo and other governors are being scrutinized for how they handled nursing homes and other vulnerable populations of individuals. Especially in the early days of this crisis.\"\n\n\"CNN has been an active participant in the broad media narrative that promotes Governor Cuomo as the positive counter to Trump,\" DePauw University professor and media critic Jeffrey McCall told Fox News.\n\nCNN'S BRIAN STELTER'S APPARENT HESITANCE TO COVER TARA READE'S BIDEN ACCUSATIONS RAISES EYEBROWS\n\nCNN political analyst Jackie Kucinich oddly called it \"snarky nonsense\" last week when Politico pointed out that some media members regularly praise Cuomo but \"love to hate\" Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis for reopening his state after coronavirus data suggests a sunny outlook.\n\n\"It's amazing that President Trump gets blamed for the number of coronavirus deaths in the U.S. while [New York Governor Andrew] Cuomo somehow gets a free pass for the deaths in New York,\" conservative strategist Chris Barron told Fox News. \"I think the reason Cuomo has been elevated to superstar is the same reason they elevated Beto: the left is constantly looking for their next JFK.\"\n\nCuomo first ordered New Yorkers to halt non-essential functions on March 22, three weeks after the first confirmed COVID-19 case in New York City and one day after neighboring New Jersey shut things down. California's stay-at-home orders came on March 19, Illinois' came on March 21.\n\nCNN ACCUSED OF 'EGREGIOUS MISREADING' OF DATA FROM CORONAVIRUS SURVEY\n\nAlong the way, the Democratic governor's daily press briefings turned the East Coast liberal into a national superstar despite Cuomo largely avoiding responsibility for New York's overwhelming coronavirus totals. NewsBusters managing editor Curtis Houck told Fox News that the chances of CNN holding Chris Cuomo's brother accountable \"in any real, sustained fashion for his nursing homes policy are close to zilch.\"\n\n\"It's so bad he's perhaps the last current elected official on the planet that CNN would report on in a negative fashion. Because for CNN, it's all Trump hate, all the time, and same for red states,\" Houck said. \"The families of the thousands dead would like some answers and tough questions from reporters to Cuomo, but sadly they shouldn't put their trust in CNN. Instead, we're likely to hear more about his dating life than that on CNN's air.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Chris Cuomo has come under fire for the way he handled his bout with coronavirus. The host said he tested positive, vividly describing symptoms on air. He eventually claimed he was finally healthy enough to emerge from his basement, where he said he had been recovering, but that was days after a now-infamous altercation with a cyclist outside an unfinished construction site that he owns.\n\nThe CNN host previously admitted he was involved in a heated altercation with the cyclist -- who filed a police complaint. As a result, Cuomo's so-called \"emergence\" was extensively mocked on social media for misleading CNN viewers.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nLiberal New York Times media columnist Ben Smith even mocked the situation, comparing CNN to a reality TV show.\n\n\"The extent to which CNN has adopted reality TV values here is pretty remarkable. Including eliding the controversy over Cuomo's travel,\" Smith wrote to caption video of Cuomo's return to society.\n\nFox News' Morgan Phillips, Joshua Nelson and Julia Musto contributed to this report.",

    "Groups sow doubt about coronavirus vaccine before one even exists": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "NEW YORK - Get all the latest news on coronavirus and more delivered daily to your inbox. Sign up here.\n\nA coronavirus vaccine is still months or years away, but groups that peddle misinformation about immunizations are already taking aim, potentially eroding confidence in what could be humanity's best chance to defeat the virus.\n\nIn recent weeks, vaccine opponents have made several unsubstantiated claims, including allegations that vaccine trials will be dangerously rushed or that Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's top infectious diseases expert, is blocking cures to enrich vaccine makers. They've also falsely claimed that Microsoft founder Bill Gates wants to use a vaccine to inject microchips into people -- or to cull 15 percent of the world's population.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR FULL CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE\n\nVaccine opponents in the U.S. have been around for a long time. Their claims range from relatively modest safety concerns about specific vaccines or the risk of side effects to conspiracy theories that border on the bizarre.\n\nThe movement is receiving renewed attention, especially as it aligns itself with groups loudly protesting restrictions on daily life aimed at controlling the spread of the virus. Health professionals say vaccine misinformation could have lethal consequences if it leads people to opt for bogus cures instead.\n\n\"Only a coronavirus vaccine can truly protect us from future outbreaks,\" said Dr. Scott Ratzan, a physician and medical misinformation expert at the City University of New York and Columbia University. \"But what if the effort succeeds and large numbers of people decide not to vaccinate themselves or their children?\"\n\nWhile vaccines for diseases such as polio, smallpox and measles have benefited millions, some skeptics reject the science, citing a distrust of modern medicine and government. Others say mandatory vaccine requirements violate their religious freedom.\n\nRita Palma, the leader of the anti-vaccine group in Long Island called My Kids, My Choice, is among those who say their families won't get the coronavirus vaccine.\n\n\"Many of us are anxiety stricken at the thought of being forced to get a vaccine,\" Palma said. \"I will never choose to have a COVID-19 vaccine. I don't want the government forcing it on my community or my family.\"\n\nFrom the outset of the coronavirus pandemic, vaccine skeptics have tailored several long-standing claims about vaccine safety to fit the current outbreak. When the first U.S. case was announced in January, some alleged the coronavirus was manufactured and that patents for it could be found online.\n\nThousands of deaths later, vaccine opponents are endorsing unapproved treatments, second-guessing medical experts and pushing fears about mandatory vaccinations. They've also latched onto protests against stay-at-home orders in the U.S.\n\n\"The coronavirus has created this perfect storm of misinformation,\" remarked David A. Broniatowski, an associate professor at George Washington University's school of engineering and applied science who has published several studies on vaccine misinformation.\n\nLast week, an anti-vaccine activist was arrested in Idaho after repeatedly refusing police orders to leave a playground closed because of the pandemic. The woman, who was there with other families, is affiliated with two groups that protested at the Idaho Statehouse against stay-at-home orders.\n\nFacebook groups formed to organize the protests have been peppered with vaccine hoaxes and myths. Perhaps no one plays a bigger role in the conspiracy theories than Gates, who is funding vaccine research. The online movement has centered concerns around a COVID-19 vaccine on false claims that Gates is planning to microchip people with the vaccine or use it to reduce the world's population.\n\nRobert F. Kennedy Jr., a vaccine critic who helped popularize unsubstantiated claims that vaccines can cause autism, said Gates' work gives him \"dictatorial control of global health policy.\" Roger Stone, a former adviser to President Donald Trump, went further on a New York City radio show, saying Gates \"and other globalists\" are using the coronavirus \"for mandatory vaccinations and microchipping people.\"\n\nSuch wild theories can have real-world effects. False rumors that Gates hoped to test an experimental vaccine in South Africa became mainstream after a news site erroneously reported the claim. One of the country's political parties then sent a letter to President Cyril Rampahosa demanding answers about \"deals\" struck with Gates.\n\nIn fact, Gates and his wife are financing a vaccine trial in Philadelphia and Kansas City, Missouri, not South Africa. He also suggested creating a database of people immune to the virus, not implanting microchips.\n\nOn Monday, during remarks recognizing World Immunization Week, World Health Organization Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus criticized vaccine skeptics for spreading misinformation at a time when many families are delaying or skipping routine childhood immunizations because they're afraid of COVID-19 exposure in doctors' offices.\n\n\"Myths and misinformation about vaccines are adding fuel to the fire,\" he said.\n\nHealth experts have repeatedly said there is no evidence the coronavirus was intentionally created or spread. They also insist that vaccines are not only safe, but essential to global health.\n\n\"Vaccine researchers and anyone who is a vaccine advocate cares deeply about vaccine safety,\" said Dr. Paul Offit, a Children's Hospital of Philadelphia physician and co-inventor of a vaccine for rotavirus, which kills hundreds of thousands of children annually.\n\nFor most people, the coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough, that clear up in two to three weeks. But it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia, and death for some people, especially older adults and people with existing health problems.\n\nThe vaccine debate is fertile ground for groups looking to sow discord in the United States. Russia seized on it to create divisions before the 2016 U.S. election, and appears to be at it again.\n\nFLORIDA SENIORS ISOLATED DURING CORONAVIRUS EPIDEMIC TO RECEIVE ROBOTIC THERAPY DOGS: OFFICIALS\n\nA report from a European Union disinformation task force found numerous conspiracy theories in English-language Russian media, including state-run RT, claiming an eventual vaccine will be used to inject nanoparticles into people.\n\n\"When pro-Kremlin disinformation outlets spread anti-vaccine tropes, they become responsible for those who will hesitate to seek professional medical care,\" the EU report said.",

When I couldn't zero in on things, I knew something was wrong.\"\n\nCELEBRITIES WHO HAVE DIED FROM CORONAVIRUS\n\nThe 51-year-old contractor and handyman said he had no preexisting conditions that he believes would have made him more susceptible to the deadly illness but said that once he developed symptoms, so did his wife, Joanna, 44, and the pair immediately began self-isolating themselves, with each of them taking separate floors in their Staten Island home.\n\nAs far as their three children -- Mia, 17; Eric Jr., 15, and Evan, 12 -- Eremita said the trio migrated to the family's basement where they holed up until things blew over, and Eremita recalled ringing the city's coronavirus hotline in a bid to schedule a testing appointment.\n\nMILEY CYRUS SHARES THE FIRST THING SHE WANTS TO DO AFTER CORONAVIRUS QUARANTINE IS LIFTED\n\n\"They didn't get back to us, and I started getting worse and worse,\" he said, noting that he started having trouble breathing. \"Then one day my wife came to me and said, 'You don't look good. Can you breathe? You're turning blue.'\"\n\nJoanna sprung to action and phoned an ambulance right away.\n\n\"I got to the hospital and, believe it or not, it's kind of a blur from that moment until I woke up off the ventilator,\" Eremita told the outlet.\n\nAccording to Eremita, his body initially rejected the ventilator, which is used for circulating oxygen through the lungs and body while pumping carbon dioxide out. He said that after his body finally accepted the assistance of the ventilator, his family grew worried about the uncertain outcome.\n\nCELEBRITIES WHO HAVE TESTED POSITIVE FOR CORONAVIRUS\n\n\"It took a real toll on my family,\" he said, adding that his children were \"frantic\" but ultimately held it together by focusing on their schooling and each other.\n\nThen doctors began to worry about his health, as well, Eremita said.\n\n\"They told my wife, 'If it doesn't come out tomorrow, we're going to have to figure out something else,'\" he said. \"Then she got really nervous.\"\n\nEremita told People magazine that he got better the very next day and thanked his faith for adjusting the potentially grim outlook.\n\nCORONAVIRUS COULD CHANGE MOVIE DISTRIBUTION MODEL, FILM EXECUTIVE WARNS\n\n\"If you believe in God or not, there's a God out there,\" Eremita said. \"He helped me.\"\n\nThe father of three also thanked the hospital personnel for their care during his stay in the Intensive Care Unit where Eremita's health improved and he was well enough to speak to his family via video call.\n\n\"The nurses were amazing,\" Eremita said. \"They were rooting for me, they were all my team members and were praying for me.\"\n\nFollowing his recovery, Eremita was discharged from the Staten Island University Hospital he had called home for the better part of a month and upon his exit, was greeted with cheers and applause from health care professionals at the hospital.\n\nCAREY HART ON WIFE PINK, SON'S 'INTENSE' BATTLES WITH CORONAVIRUS: 'THEY BOTH GOT EXTREMELY SICK'\n\n\"They're calling me their miracle,\" Eremita said. \"No one else in the hospital that I was in that was on a ventilator walked out alive. I'll be honest with you, it made me very, very humbled, and reminded me to appreciate life.\"\n\nHe's now undergoing intense physical therapy as he learns to walk again after being hooked up to the ventilator and is managing a pneumonia diagnosis that has come on after the virus with prescribed antibiotics.\n\n\"Every day is getting better,\" he said. \"They told me I wouldn't walk without a walker, but now I walk just fine. I got a bit beat up, but I'm the comeback kid.\"\n\nCLICK HERE FOR COMPLETE CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE\n\nFurthermore, Eremita said the experience put things into perspective for him and he hopes his story will empower folks to take the illness seriously.\n\n\"If you think you can't get it, you're mistaken.

That's where our guidance is there for, and we count on local leaders to implement and interpret that according to the local situation.\"\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE LATEST ON THE CORONAVIRUS\n\nAzar also echoed President Trump's concerns that keeping the economy closed will lead to \"serious health consequences.\" Trump has consistently said that the closed economy - which has been accompanied by drastic financial strain for many Americans - can lead to both mental and physical health problems.\n\nThe HHS secretary's comments come amid reports from Columbus, Ohio, and other cities in states that have eased their stay-at-home orders of people crowding into bars despite the ongoing public health crisis.\n\nSeveral bars across Wisconsin were flooded with patrons just hours after the state Supreme Court issued a ruling striking down an extension of Gov. Tony Evers' stay-at-home order that had been in effect since mid-March to limit the effect of the coronavirus.\n\nNick's Bar in Platteville, Wis., shared a photo on Twitter with the caption: \"45 minutes after the bars open in Wisconsin\" showing the establishment packed with mostly young people, none of whom were wearing masks or observing social distancing.\n\nA photo taken by the Green Bay Press-Gazette showed that the State Street Pub in Green Bay, Wis., had briefly reopened with about a dozen customers inside after the state Supreme Court ruling. Decorations for St. Patrick's Day, the March 17 holiday, remained on display the first day of the reopening. Neither the bartender nor the customers were wearing masks.\n\nBut that bar's reopening was also short-lived. By Wednesday night, Brown County Health Officer Anna Destree issued a local safer-at-home order to replace the now resolute state rules, requiring all county residents to remain home until at least May 20.\n\nOn Thursday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released guidelines instructing certain organizations on how to safely open their doors.\n\nThe one page \"decision tool\" documents were released by the CDC on Thursday and provided detailed information for service-based facilities like restaurants and bars, among other establishments, on reopening.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe one-page flowchart for food-service businesses outlines a series of protocols establishments will have to follow in order to open. The sheet identifies requirements such as \"hand washing and employees wearing a cloth face covering, as feasible\" and instructions to \"intensify cleaning, sanitization, disinfection and ventilation.\"\n\nThe businesses are also expected to \"encourage social distancing\" and \"enhance spacing\" by positioning stools or tables away from each other, and continuing to encourage customers to order take-out food instead of dining in.\n\nRestaurants and bars will need to limit occupancy and group sizes in line with local and state mandates, and create distancing for employees in shared spaces.\n\nIn addition, restaurants and bars will have to implement procedures to check employees for symptoms, including possible temperature checks when they arrive for a shift. There must also be a plan in place for if an employee gets sick. To that end, businesses that reopen will have to monitor employee absences, and report positive cases.",

Sign up here.\n\n5) ANTONINE PLAGUE (165-180 AD): 5 MILLION DEAD\n\nLike the coronavirus, the Antonine Plague is believed to have originated in China. Soldiers marching to Rome from Mesopotamia in late 165 AD were ill, many covered in red and black papules that eventually would scab over and fall off. The plague would soon spread across the Roman Empire. Also similar to the current pandemic, not everyone who caught the virus -- which researchers believe was probably smallpox -- died, and those who survived became immune. However, by the time the plague was under control in 180 AD, it had killed millions of people and had practically wiped out Rome's 150,000-man military. It also claimed the life of Emperor Marcus Aurelius.\n\nThe symptoms, described by famous Roman physician Galen, were unpleasant: diarrhea, coughing, fever, dry throat and the aforementioned papules.\n\nOne legend floating around during the time had it that the disease was released when a Roman soldier accidentally opened a golden casket in the temple of Apollo, freeing the cursed plague from confinement. Either way, many were certain that they had done something to anger the gods, such as the sack of the ancient Mesopotamian city of Seleucia. Christians also were blamed for angering the gods.\n\n4) PLAGUE OF JUSTINIAN (540-542 AD): AT LEAST 25 MILLION DEAD\n\nBelieved to have been brought over by rat-infested merchant ships sailing into Egypt, at one point the Plague of Justinian (named after the ruling Byzantine emperor at the time) is said to have killed up to 100,000 people a day on average. Recently these figures have been called into question, but researchers have said the Bubonic Plague (Yersinia pestis) spread and continued to pop up from time to time in Europe, Asia, and Africa for years after its arrival in 541 AD, killing millions of people.\n\nMORE THAN 100 YEARS BEFORE CORONAVIRUS, THE SPANISH FLU PANDEMIC RAVAGED THE GLOBE\n\nByzantine Greek scholar Procopius wrote of the plague's beginnings, \"It began with the Egyptians who live in Pelusium. It divided and part went to Alexandria and the rest of Egypt, and part to the people of Palestine, the neighbors of the Egyptians, and from there, overran the whole earth.\"\n\nThe bubonic plague can be transferred from rats to humans through flea bites. Pus filled buboes then grow on parts of the body -- generally in the armpit and groin area -- and a fever develops. Though the Black Death was caused by the same disease, researchers have determined that a different strain caused the Justinian Plague.\n\n3)HIV/AIDS (PEAK YEARS 2005-2012): 36 MILLION DEAD\n\nThought to have originated in the Congo when the virus was transmitted from chimpanzee to human in 1920, HIV -- the virus that causes Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (AIDS) -- didn't begin to spread in America until the early '80s, though some research indicates it may have arrived in New York City from Haiti as early as 1970. In 1981, gay men began being hospitalized for rare cancers and lung infections. Doctors didn't know how these rare diseases were cropping up, though they believed some condition must have been causing them. In 1982, heroin users began getting these diseases as well, and that year they named the condition AIDS. HIV was isolated in a lab and identified in a French lab in 1983.\n\nThe World Health Organization characterizes HIV/AIDS as a global epidemic, whereas the CDC describes it as a pandemic.\n\nCHILLING VIDEO REVEALS HOW CORONAVIRUS SPREADS FROM A SINGLE COUGH IN A SUPERMARKET\n\nAccording to UNAIDS, an estimated 36 million people are estimated to have died from AIDS-related causes, the peak occurring in 2005 with 2.3 million deaths. The worst area hit was Sub-Saharan Africa, where in 2005, an estimated 2.7 million people became infected with HIV and 2 million adults and children died of AIDS.\n\nIn the years since, while antivirals and preventative medication PrEP have helped to prevent transmission of the disease, the number in the United States has leveled off since 2013 with around 39,000 new HIV infections annually.\n\n2)SPANISH FLU PANDEMIC (1918-1920): 50 MILLION DEAD\n\nThe 1918 Spanish Flu pandemic was the worst in recent history, with one-third of the earth's population becoming infected with the H1N1 virus, eventually killing 50 million people. Researchers still can't pinpoint what made the virus so deadly, but like the current coronavirus pandemic, there was no vaccine at the time. People were instructed to quarantine, maintain social distance, wash hands and sterilize, which was basically all they could do. Some U.S. cities, such as San Francisco, also passed ordinances forcing people to wear masks.\n\nThe disease is believed to have first appeared in 1916 in a British army hospital, located in \u00c9taples, France, and like the H5N1 Virus, may have been caused by birds. This severe pneumonia-like influenza festered and spread in the cold, wet trenches of World War I, and from there, it circled the globe.\n\n1) THE BLACK DEATH (1347-1353 AD): 50 to 200 MILLION+ DEAD\n\nSome figures of the Black Death's toll range from 50 million, others 200 million or higher, which arguably would make it the most deadly pandemic in world history.\n\nSTARVING 'CANNIBAL' RATS ARE ON THE MARCH DURING THE CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC\n\nMany scholars believe that, like COVID-19, the Black Death originated in Asia. It was spread by the movement of Batu Khan's Golden Horde. During the horde's siege of Caffa (A major seaport on the Black Sea), the Mongols -- who were losing numbers rapidly to the disease -- catapulted buboe-riddled bodies over the city walls. It spread to the fleeing populace, whose merchants then took it over the Black Sea.\n\nThe nightmare began for Europe one October day in 1347 as 12 ships from the Black Sea arrived in Sicily. Porters greeting the ships found a grisly sight: a few ill sailors, their bodies ravaged with black, oozing buboes, standing on deck among their dead crewmates. Despite soon banishing the ships from the port, the damage already was done.\n\nCORONAVIRUS LOCKDOWN RESULTS IN 30 PERCENT AIR POLLUTION DROP IN NORTHEASTERN US, NASA SAYS\n\nFrom Sicily, the disease spread like wildfire, ravaging the European population until 1353. Symptoms included high fever, chills, vomiting and diarrhea. It also caused the aforementioned pus-filled buboes as well as parts of the body (nose, fingers, toes, etc.) to become black with gangrene. While it has long been maintained that the Black Death was spread through fleas from rats, many now believe it was spread through human fleas and body lice. Dr. Samuel K. Cohn, a medieval history professor at the University of Glasgow and author of \"The Black Death Transformed\" (2002), was one of the original proponents of the theory that it was spread via human-to-human transmission.\n\n\"It spread very quickly,\" Cohn told Fox News. \"It was not spread by the inefficient mechanism of fleas on rats, although the textbooks demand that that must be the case, especially now with ancient DNA which shows with a strain of Yersinia pestis - however as we know from diseases like SARS and syphilis, different pathogens can be very closely related and produce completely different diseases.\"\n\nCLICK HERE FOR COMPLETE CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE\n\nIn his book, Cohn noted that people developed a resistance to the Black Death, which was a medical impossibility with the \"classic\" Bubonic Plague. Also, the Black Death thrived in temperatures and seasons when rat fleas were at their lowest ebb. What exactly the Black Death was remained unknown, though one thing was sure- it spread fast and would spread even faster today than COVID-19 thanks to modern modes of transportation.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"I would say the Black Death was even faster spreading [than coronavirus] in some ways given its track-record in circumnavigating Europe,\" Cohn explained. \"The Black Death could only move as fast as people and horses could move, so it couldn't spread faster than an airplane can carry people. But, the whole dissemination seems to have been from 1348-49, a more quickly spreading disease within a certain area over time, and the disease knocked out anywhere from a half to 3/4 of the population of Florence in the space of three or four months.\"",

        "body": "This only the fourth human trial for a potential coronavirus vaccine. (iStock)\n\nEach week, I receive tons of questions from my listeners about tech concerns, new products, and all things digital.\n\nSometimes, choosing the most interesting questions to highlight is the best part of my job. This week, I received questions about the new iPhone, keeping gadgets clean, detecting viruses, and more.\n\nDo you have a question you'd like to ask me?\n\nTap or click here to email me directly. I personally read every note.\n\nCOVID Conspiracies\n\nQ: I read on Facebook that 5G antennas spread the coronavirus. This is frightening!\n\nA: This would be terrifying -- if there were an ounce of truth to it. The good news is that 5G antennas do not cause coronavirus. Scientists have found no connection between the two phenomena, so that you can breathe a sigh of relief. The bad news is that this conspiracy theory spread to millions of people, including several celebrities with large social media followings, resulting in the arson of several 5G antennas.\n\nI don't blame people for jumping to conclusions; after all, these are very unusual times, and conspiracy theorists can be very persuasive. But I am deeply troubled to hear that this idea, which has no scientific basis whatsoever, has led to real-world arson. If you notice someone spreading this rumor, please encourage them to stop. It will only make things worse.\n\nTap or click here to get the facts about the 5G coronavirus connection.\n\nSanitize Your Phone\n\nQ: What is the safest best way to clean a smartphone? I read it has more germs than a toilet seat! Gross!\n\nA: Smartphones are magnets for bacteria, even under the best circumstances. Regular cleaning can radically reduce your chances of getting sick. You can use a range of antiseptic wipes, but a more high-tech approach is an ultraviolet phone cleaner. This device is specifically designed to disinfect your phone and depending on the model you buy, it may be able to charge your battery as well.\n\nUV rays may sound a little theoretical, but they are some of the most effective weapons against accumulated germs on the surface of your device. The CDC has approved this method, and many users have turned to UV technology since the pandemic took hold.\n\nQ: Is Apple's new iPhone $399 iPhone worth the money? How can this one be so cheap compared to the $1,000+ models?\n\nA: Millions of people rushed to buy the iPhone X, but millions of others balked at its astronomical price tag. The Apple SE caters to those budget-conscious customers who want exceptional technology but aren't willing to shell out the big bucks. So, is it worth it?\n\nThe SE is a pretty great deal. It has a fantastic processor, a professional camera with portrait mode, and a Retina display. The phone is smaller than its predecessors, and you don't get certain features, such as face recognition or night mode for the camera. But if you have been thinking of upgrading anyway, it's a steal compared to other Apple products, which can often cost as much as a new MacBook.\n\nQ: I need to find a job. I searched online, and all I found were scams.\n\nA: There's a special place in hell for scammers who take advantage of a pandemic to trick people out of their money. But they're still out there, using all the confusion and unemployment to rope you into pyramid schemes and shifty get-rich-quick schemes. At the same time, there are real, legitimate companies that are actively searching for workers - specifically people who can work from home.\n\nIf you read this column regularly, you may be excited to know that many of these employers are tech companies. You'll find educational and healthcare opportunities as well. You may be seeking a temporary position to help you weather a lay-off, but many of these roles could lead to a whole new career path.\n\nTap or click here for a list of 40 companies hiring WFH workers right now.\n\nFree Virus Scans\n\nQ: My computer is running slowly. How can I check to see if it has malware or a virus?\n\nA: The worst malware is the kind you don't even realize is infecting your computer. Unfortunately, malware is often designed to evade notice, and the only symptoms are - as you say - slower operations or other unusual behavior. How can you be sure that there's an infection, and how much will it cost to find out?\n\nYou can still purchase exceptional software, such as Norton AntiVirus, which has led the market for decades. But you can also find highly effective virus scans for free. Meanwhile, don't assume that a Mac is immune to viruses. Apple does do a great job of protecting its software, but there's plenty of malware designed to worm its way into your hard drive. A free virus scan is worth a few extra minutes.\n\nTap or click here for free virus scans for Mac or Windows.\n\nWhat digital lifestyle questions do you have?

Sign up here.\n\nThe Chinese Communist Party and the Hong Kong government used the coronavirus pandemic as a \"golden opportunity\" to crack down on pro-democracy dissidence, knowing that the arrest of more than a dozen activists would have normally seen people \"pouring out onto the street to protest,\" according to one recently arrested political leader.\n\nLee Cheuk Yan, who was among the at least 14 high profile pro-democracy activists taken into custody Saturday, said Hong Kong authorities carried out the arrests in a timely manner in an effort to push through more pro-Beijing candidates in the upcoming legislative council elections in September and, thus, ensure \"more stringent or draconian laws for the future.\"\n\n\"Hong Kong people are very alert to the concern of infection, so they are using the chance of the pandemic,\" Lee Cheuk Yan told the Guardian, claiming officials took advantage of the virus to avoid a repeat of the large scale protests that flooded the streets of the semiautonomous city beginning last June. \"This is a golden opportunity for them.\"\n\nCLICK HERE FOR FULL CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE\n\nHong Kong residents have largely chosen to stay at home since February in an effort to prevent the spread of infection. The semi-autonomous country controlled the outbreak by launching a widespread program that involved testing everyone who showed symptoms, quarantining positive cases in hospitals, and tracing all contacts within the past few days, ordering them to self-isolate.\n\nOver the course of seven months last year, demonstrators flooded Hong Kong's streets to first protest an extradition bill that would have sent Hong Kong prisoners to mainland China for trial, then to push for broader democratic measures, including voting rights and an independent inquiry into police conduct.\n\nProtesters argued China was increasingly intruding on Hong Kong autonomy, violating the 1997 Sino-British Joint Declaration, which transferred power from British colonial rule over to Beijing, provided the city maintained a degree of independence from the mainland.\n\nCORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC LED TO HONG KONG TOILET PAPER THEFT AT KNIFEPOINT: POLICE\n\nCondemning the arrests Saturday, U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said: \"Beijing and its representatives in Hong Kong continue to take actions inconsistent with commitments made under the Sino-British Joint Declaration that include transparency, the rule of law, and guarantees that Hong Kong will continue to 'enjoy a high degree of autonomy'.\"\n\nAttorney General William Barr also weighed in with a statement saying these events show how \"antithetical the values of the Chinese Communist Party are to those we share in Western liberal democracies. These actions -- along with its malign influence activity and industrial espionage here in the United States -- demonstrate once again that the Chinese Communist Party cannot be trusted.\"\n\nBritain's Foreign Office also criticized the arrests, saying \"the right to peaceful protest is fundamental to Hong Kong's way of life and as such is protected in both the Joint Declaration and the Basic Law.\"\n\nHONG KONG PROTESTERS FIREBOMB PROPOSED QUARANTINE BUILDING AMID CORONAVIRUS OUTBREAK: REPORTS\n\nWhile the protests last year began peacefully, they increasingly descended into violence after demonstrators became frustrated with the government's response, claiming Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam had ignored their demands and used the police to suppress them.\n\nHong Kong authorities had denied permission for most of the rallies, and police increasingly used tear gas and pepper spray against demonstrators, arresting hundreds at a time.\n\nThe arrests came in connection to \"organizing and participating in unauthorized assemblies,\" last year on Aug. 18, Oct. 1 and Oct. 20.\n\nLee told The Guardian he believed the Chinese Communist Party was using the arrests Saturday as an act of \"revenge and retaliation.\"\n\nHong Kong authorities had cleared the Aug. 18 protest to take place in a local park, but demonstrators ended up spilling out into the streets after a total of 1.7 million people showed up. Demonstrations were peaceful during that event, according to reports.\n\n\"If we are found to be guilty of the charges, then 1.7 million people should be guilty of participation in an unauthorized assembly,\" Lee said. \"But that's absurd. Are you going to prosecute 1.7 million people?\"\n\nMartin Lee, an 81-year-old activist and former lawmaker, and democracy advocates Albert Ho and Au Nok-hin, were among those arrested Saturday. Those rounded up by police also included media tycoon Jimmy Lai, who founded the local newspaper Apple Daily, as well as Yeung Sum, a former lawmaker from the Democratic Party, according to the Associated Press.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nIt was the second time Lai, Lee Cheuk-yan and Yeung Sum had been arrested this year. They were charged in February over their involvement in a rally on Aug. 31 last year. The League of Social Democrats wrote in a Facebook post on Saturday that its leaders were among those arrested, including Chairman Raphael Wong.\n\nThe Hong Kong government defended the arrests Saturday, saying they were \"not politically motivated.\" The Office of the Commissioner of the Chinese Foreign Ministry in Hong Kong said police were enforcing the law against those suspected of organizing and participating in unauthorized assemblies, and foreign countries have no right to interfere, China's official Xinhua News Agency reported.",

Sign up here.\n\nIf a Medicare patient is diagnosed with - or even presumed to have contracted -- coronavirus, hospitals across the United States are given more money from the federal government to treat that patient, economic assessments show. That amount can as much as triple if the patient requires a ventilator, making some wonder whether there is a financial impetus to overstate coronavirus numbers, with others calling such potential abuse \"unlikely.\"\n\nMedicare, a long-running federal health insurance program for those aged 65 or over - which also happens to be the most vulnerable demographic for an acute coronavirus infection and mortality - functions by paying hospitals a fixed sum depending on which diagnosis the Medicare Severity Diagnosis Related Group (MS-DRG) it falls under.\n\nCOLLEGE STUDENTS FILE LAWSUITS SEEKING REFUNDS FROM SCHOOLS MOVED ONLINE DURING CORONAVIRUS LOCKDOWNS\n\n\"These DRG rates are adjusted each year, and that brings up [one] way in which the government has increased payments to hospitals. Budget rules referred to as sequestration, require across-the-board cuts in Medicare because the federal deficit is so high,\" Doug Badger, visiting fellow for domestic policy studies at The Heritage Foundation, told Fox News. \"Congress eliminated these across-the-board cuts during the COVID-19 epidemic. That translates to an across-the-board increase in Medicare payments to hospitals for any admission of any Medicare patient, whether or not they have COVID-19.\"\n\nHowever, in the case of COVID-19, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) characterizes it under the umbrella of respiratory infections and inflammations, and there are add-ons specific to the illness that was borne out of China late last year and has since infected 1.2 million Americans and claimed the lives of over 70,000.\n\nPROMINENT UNIVERSITY BIO LAB URGED TO REVEAL EXTENT OF RELATIONSHIP WITH WUHAN LAB AT CENTER OF CORONAVIRUS OUTBREAK\n\nRecent federal legislation, known as Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act, or CARES Act, has provisions that enable the government to pay more to hospitals specific to the coronavirus pandemic.\n\n\"The CARES Act authorized a temporary 20 percent increase in reimbursements from Medicare for COVID-19 patients to account for both anticipated and unanticipated increases in the cost of care for these medically complex patients,\" explained Dr. Summer McGee, dean of the School of Health Sciences at the University of New Haven.\n\nAs Badger highlighted, instead of getting paid the DRG rate, a hospital that admits a coronavirus patient will receive 20 percent more compensation than they would for providing that same care to a non-coronavirus patient.\n\n\"Imagine two Medicare patients, one with COVID-19 and another one not, with pneumonia in the same ICU. Medicare will pay, for example, $10,000 for the pneumonia patient who doesn't have COVID-19 and $12,000 for the patient who does,\" he surmised. \"The rationale is that this provides a sort of rough justice method of making sure that hospitals that get a lot of COVID-19 patients also get extra money from the government.\"\n\nMoreover, the Act established a $100 billion fund to aid hospitals - of which some $30-$50 billion is \"used to reimburse healthcare providers, at Medicare rates, for COVID-related treatment of the uninsured,\" the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) stated.\n\nProvisions in the act allow for hospitals to receive three times more per patient in need of a ventilator, multiple analyses have confirmed.\n\nAccording to an April 24 release from the Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonprofit organization focused on American health care issues, HHS increased its allocation from $30 billion to $50 billion to providers.\n\n\"Since Medicaid typically reimburses at lower rates than other providers, this methodology could disadvantage providers who see a high proportion of Medicaid patients,\" the release stated. \"The Terms and Conditions state that this money can be used for 'health care-related expenses or lost revenues that are attributable to coronavirus.'\"\n\nHHS also announced that $10 billion would be set aside for high-impact areas significantly impacted by the coronavirus, emphasizing \"that New York hospitals are expected to receive a large share of the funds.\"\n\n\"This more targeted funding will help address concerns from hospitals in the hardest-hit areas that they had not gotten sufficient funds to help them manage a surge in COVID-19 patients. To help HHS determine which facilities will qualify for this targeted distribution, each hospital must submit the number of ICU beds it has and its total COVID-19 admissions as of April 10, 2020,\" Kaiser observed.\n\nOn April 14, New York's overall coronavirus death toll was revised with a major leap - with some 3,700 fatalities added with the provision that the count now included \"people who had never tested positive for the virus but were presumed to have it.\"\n\nThe uptick ignited a sharp rebuke from President Trump the following day, who then hinted that the hardest-hit state was inflating its numbers.\n\nThat same day, Sen. Scott Jensen, R-Minn., a Minnesota-based physician, took to his Facebook page to question the reimbursement apparatus.\n\n\"How can anyone not believe that increasing the number of COVID-19 deaths may create an avenue for states to receive a larger portion of federal dollars,\" he wrote. \"Already, some states are complaining that they are not getting enough of the CARES Act dollars because they are having significantly more proportional COVID-19 deaths.\"\n\nCLICK HERE FOR COMPLETE CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE\n\nThe issue of the \"presumed\" cases has proven particularly controversial. While some states such as California and Minnesota document only instances of laboratory-verified coronavirus, other states like New York list assumed cases - which is permissible by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in circumstances where an individual meets clinical criteria such as displaying symptoms, but a certified test has not been undertaken.\n\nA \"presumed\" or \"probable\" coronavirus case can also be listed on a death certificate, as per CDC guidelines.\n\nKaiser argues that such \"presumptive cases\" are not adequately defined, and has questioned whether HHS issue any further guidance or clarify if a patient with a suspected case but subsequently tests negative could still qualify as a \"presumptive\" case if symptoms line up or a false-negative is suspected.\n\nCORONAVIRUS: AMID NEW YORK'S UNUSED HOSPITAL BEDS AND VENTILATORS, CRITICS POINT TO MASS WASTE AND MISMANAGEMENT\n\nWhile Medicare is paying hospital fees for coronavirus cases in ranges well into the thousands per patient - a Kaiser analysis using average Medicare payments calculating as much as $40,218 for a patient needing ventilator support for longer than 96 hours - medical professionals contend that exact amounts differ place by place, hospital by hospital and are not necessarily predetermined. CMS makes an assessment on exactly how much to pay a hospital per coronavirus patient based on the DRG and a range of factors, including the resources available and labor costs to treat the patient.\n\nThis, at some point, automatically leads to a larger government check. The Foundation for Economic Education argues that \"the economic incentive to add COVID-19 to diagnostic lists and death certificates is clear and does not require any conspiracy.\"\n\n\"Incentive-based medicine always runs up the bill. Particularly in this environment, no one is going to challenge it,\" cautioned Ohio-based physician Dr. Sherri Tenpenny. \"Potentially, it could [be exploitative] as hospitals are economically strapped to the point of laying off doctors and nurses.\"\n\nBut despite some concerns that hospitals - which are struggling nationwide given that most states have shut down elective and non-emergency procedures which needed to keep budgets balanced - there are no reports of flagrant exploitation, exaggerated coronavirus numbers, or evidence that facilities are purporting to profit off the pandemic to collect more in Medicare payments.\n\n\"In a crisis like this, the fees for service payments are unlikely to be abused. Long-term hospitalizations with medically complex patients on ventilators cannot be paid with a simple standard sticker price,\" McGee asserted. \"Hospitals should be paid for the services they are providing at a premium because of the extremely challenging situation they are in.\"\n\nShe also noted that while hospitals are trying to save critically ill patients in a global pandemic, it is not the time to quibble over reimbursements.\n\n\"After the COVID-19 crisis ends, CMS should do a review to determine the costs of care and to ensure that no health care fraud and abuse took place,\" McGee added.",

Sign up here.\n\nRichard Zaib served in the U.S. Navy. He served his country faithfully and without fear, saluting the flag and protecting everything it represents. He was strong, smart and happy. He loved to sing and compose music and, if the family folklore is true, he even published a comic book. Those were the good old days.\n\nToday, the 83-year-old is confined to a hospital bed at the Long Island Jewish Medical Center/Northwell Health in New York. He's being treated for COVID-19, something his family believes he caught at a New York nursing home.\n\nZaib's roommate also has tested positive for coronavirus.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR FULL CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE\n\nThey are among scores of people who have been unprotected and infected while staying in nursing homes because of a state directive that prohibits facilities from turning away sick COVID-19 patients, even if it means exposing others to the deadly virus that has infected 3.6 million people and killed more than 220,000 globally.\n\nIn March, New York State officials told nursing-home operators that they would be required to accept patients infected with the novel coronavirus who were discharged from hospitals but are still recovering and in need of care. Not only did the directive strain the state's health-care system, it also put virus-free patients in New York's nursing homes like Zaib in jeopardy.\n\nNew York's Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo promised on March 2 to make a \"special effort\" for nursing homes and congregate housing senior citizens. The state directed nursing homes to screen visitors and consider modifying visiting hours on March 6, and later suspended visits to nursing homes statewide on March 12.\n\nThe directive to force nursing homes to take in COVID-19 patients at the risk of others drew pushback from nursing home officials as well as the AMDA, the Society for Post-Acute and Long-Term Care Medicine, which said that \"admitting patients with suspected or documented COVID-19 infection represents a clear and present danger to all of the residents of a nursing home.\"\n\nNEW YORK REPORTS MORE THAN 1,700 UNDISCLOSED CORONAVIRUS DEATHS IN NURSING HOMES\n\nDavid Grabowski, a professor of health policy at Harvard Medical School, told NBC News that there were only a few places that could safely adhere to the state's policy.\n\n\"The existing places that can really do this safely in terms of staffing and building space to keep them separate are in the minority,\" he said.\n\nZaib's nephew, Joseph Ricupero, told Fox News that it's tough to think of his uncle in the hospital going through one of the scariest battles of his life alone.\n\n\"I'm not allowed to visit,\" Ricupero said of his uncle, who went on to become a New York City bus driver after the Navy. \"They don't know how he got (COVID-19) or how long he's had it.\"\n\nZaib, who also served at president of the Amalgamated Transit Union/Division 1056, was admitted to Holliswood Center for Rehabilitation and Nursing in Hollis, Queens, in late February, following a stint at Jamaica Hospital, where he had one of his toes amputated due to complications from diabetes. At Holliswood, his condition deteriorated.\n\n\"He had 104-degree fever and they didn't tell us about it until a week later -- and I'm his health proxy,\" Ricupero said.\n\nRicupero, who talks to his uncle on the phone multiple times a day, says all Zaib wants to do is leave.\n\n\"Every day he wants to go. He says that the food is terrible, the hospital is cold, the call button isn't working and he's tough with his medication -- but he's alive,\" Ricupero said.\n\nNYPD OFFICERS SAY CORONAVIRUS SOCIAL DISTANCING POLICING NEEDS TO END\n\nYes, he's alive. He's one of the lucky ones.\n\nThe consequences of Cuomo's directive have been devastating to some of the state's most vulnerable residents.\n\nNew York has recorded at least 4,968 confirmed and presumed deaths related to coronavirus at nursing homes and adult-care facilities, including 71 confirmed deaths at just one center, according to state data released Monday.\n\nThe state had acknowledged that previous data from nursing homes had been inconsistent, with only some reporting deaths of people who were presumed to have the virus as well as confirmed cases.\n\nWhile the new numbers reflect New York's efforts to have more comprehensive reporting, some uncertainties remain, including the number of nursing home residents who were transferred to hospitals before dying.\n\nParker Jewish Institute in Queens and Isabella Geriatric Center -- one of New York City's largest nursing homes with 705 beds -- reported the highest number of deaths: 71 and 64, respectively.\n\nAudrey Waters, a spokeswoman for Isabella Geriatric Center, said that \"Isabella, like all other nursing homes in New York City, initially had limited access to widespread and consistent in-house testing to quickly diagnose our residents and staff. This hampered our ability to identify those who were infected and asymptomatic, despite our efforts to swiftly separate anyone who presented symptoms.\"\n\nIn many cases, New York's new figures reveal many more deaths than previously reported at nursing homes: Isabella Geriatric Center had 13 COVID-19 deaths reported as of May 1, and now reports the deaths of 21 patients who were confirmed to have COVID-19, along with 43 deaths of residents presumed to have COVID-19. Ozanam Hall of Queens now is reporting a total of 53 deaths, up from just 10.\n\nIn Cobble Hill, 50 people who were suspected of being infected with COVID-19 recently died at the Brooklyn nursing home.\n\nCobble Hill Health Center Chief Executive Donny Tuchman said his center had to go it alone for weeks during the peak of the coronavirus outbreak.\n\nSome of his staff wore garbage bags for protection. Others worked 16-hour shifts. At one point, patients were dying so fast that the center's refrigerated storage hit its maximum capacity and workers were forced to rotate bodies in and out as they waited for space at funeral homes or morgues to open up.\n\nWith dozens of symptomatic patients and almost no gowns in early April, Tuchman begged the state for more PPEs.\n\n\"There is no way for us to prevent the spread under these conditions,\" he wrote to state health officials on April 8, in an email seen by The Wall Street Journal. \"Is there anything more we can do to protect our patients and staff?\"\n\nState officials emailed guidance on how to conserve supplies and told him to resubmit requests daily to New York City's Office of Emergency.\n\nSeveral veterans homes have also been hit hard.\n\nThe Long Island State Veterans Home has reported 53 deaths, including 48 confirmed and five presumed COVID-19 deaths. The New York State Veterans Home at St. Albans in Queens has reported 33 deaths, while New York State Veterans Home at Montrose in Westchester says 22 residents have died.\n\nCritics say it's one of the biggest betrayals to veterans and New York's elderly at a time when the state should be bending over backward to help them.\n\n\"They die alone,\" Ricupero said. \"You can't have a proper send-off for them.\"\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nFormer New York Gov. George Pataki has called for an independent investigation into Cuomo's administration over its handling of COVID-19 in nursing homes across the state.\n\n\"I know Andrew Cuomo is one of the most popular politicians in America today,\" he told Fox News. \"He has his briefings that are calm and informative, but when you look at the job that he is not doing when it comes to nursing homes, those beds should have been used to put the most vulnerable in those facilities... What happened in New York, in my mind, is a disgrace.\"\n\nAn email to the governor's office seeking a comment was not immediately returned.",

    "How are COVID-19 deaths counted?": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "As coronavirus has swept through the United States, finding the true number of people who have been infected has been stymied due to lack of testing. Now, official counts of coronavirus deaths are being challenged, too.\n\nIn Colorado, for example, a Republican state legislator has accused the state's public health department of falsely inflating COVID-19 deaths; in Florida, local media have objected to the State Department of Health's refusal to release medical examiner data to the public, alleging that the state may be underreporting deaths.\n\nThe reality is that assigning a cause of death is not always straightforward, even pre-pandemic, and a patchwork of local rules and regulations makes getting valid national data challenging. However, data on excess deaths in the United States over the past several months suggest that COVID-19 deaths are probably being undercounted rather than overcounted.\n\nDeath certificates can be signed by a physician who was responsible for a patient who died in a hospital, which accounts for many COVID-19 deaths. They can also be signed by medical examiners or coroners, who are independent officials who work for individual counties or cities. Many COVID-19 death certificates are being handled by physicians unless the death occurred outside of the hospital, in which case a medical examiner or coroner would step in, said Dr. Sally Aiken, the president of the National Association of Medical Examiners (NAME). In some jurisdictions, including cities such as Chicago and Milwaukee, medical examiners are involved in determining the cause of death for every suspected COVID-19 case. In those jurisdictions, medical examiners review medical records even of patients who die in hospitals to ensure that the symptoms and any testing indicate that the patient did indeed die of COVID-19.\n\nHaving medical examiners confirm COVID-19 deaths can create more uniformity and clearer documentation, Aiken told Live Science. On a death certificate, there are spaces to list an immediate cause of death, as well as the chain of events that led to that final disease or incident. There are also spaces for adding contributing factors.\n\nRelated: 20 of the worst epidemics and pandemics in history\n\nFor COVID-19, the immediate cause of death might be listed as respiratory distress, with the second line reading \"due to COVID-19.\" Contributing factors such as heart disease, diabetes or high blood pressure would then be listed further down. This has led to some confusion by people arguing that the \"real\" cause of death was heart disease or diabetes, Aiken said, but that's not the case.\n\n\"Without the COVID19 being the last straw or the thing that led to the chain of events that led to death, they probably wouldn't have died,\" she said.\n\nHow hard it is to accurately determine whether COVID-19 was truly that last straw depends on the situation. Most COVID-19 deaths seen at Mount Sinai Health System in New York are in people who have comorbid (or co-occurring) conditions such as coronary artery disease or kidney disease, said Dr. Mary Fowkes, the chief of autopsy services at Mount Sinai. But it's not typically difficult to tell what killed them.\n\nRelated: Why COVID-19 kills some people and spares others. Here's what scientists are finding.\n\n\"Most of the cases are pretty straightforward,\" Fowkes told Live Science. \"The lungs are usually so severely involved with pathology, so they are two to three times or more the normal weight of a normal lung.\"\n\n(The excess weight is due to fluid and cell detritus from damaged lung tissues.)\n\nIn some cases, particularly those where someone dies at home or quickly perishes after entering an emergency room, the determination can be a little more fuzzy, said Dr. Jeremy Faust, an emergency physician at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Massachusetts.\n\n\"The challenge is knowing who died of COVID-19 versus who died with the virus that causes COVID-19,\" Faust told Live Science.\n\nAutopsies can help answer that question, but autopsy rates were low even pre-pandemic, Fowkes said. Even at Mount Sinai, a rare medical system that offers every family a chance to have their loved one autopsied for free, the rate of autopsy was only about 20% prior to the pandemic. According to NAME, there is an ongoing shortage of forensic pathologists working in the United States, with about 500 currently employed and a need for 1,200. Autopsies for COVID-19 can also be dangerous due to the infectious nature of the disease and ongoing shortages of personal protective equipment for pathologists.\n\nAnother complication for assigning a cause of death for COVID-19 is that some younger people have died of strokes and heart attacks and then tested positive for COVID-19 without any history of respiratory symptoms. The virus is now known to cause blood clots, suggesting that COVID-19 was the killer in these cases, too. Fowkes and her colleagues conducted a microscopic inspection of the brains of 20 COVID-19 victims in her hospital system and found that six of them contained tiny blood clots that had caused small strokes before death.\n\n\"We're seeing it in younger patients than you would expect, and we're seeing it in a distribution that you wouldn't expect, so we think it's related to the COVID,\" Fowkes said.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has issued guidelines for how to attribute a death to COVID-19. The guidelines urge using information from COVID-19 testing, where possible, but also allow for deaths to be listed as \"presumed\" or \"probable\" COVID-19 based on symptoms and the best clinical judgment of the person filling out the death certificate. A medical examiner trying to determine a cause of death in the absence of testing would comb medical records and query family and loved ones about the person's symptoms before they died, Aiken said. Postmortem COVID-19 tests may be possible, depending on the jurisdiction.\n\nAll of the inconsistencies of cause-of-death reporting precede the COVID-19 pandemic, says Jay Wolfson, a professor of public health at the University of South Florida (USF). But getting good data about deaths is now extremely pressing, he told Live Science. Death certificates are often used by epidemiologists and public health officials to detect strange clusters of deaths or to link certain risk factors to certain causes of death. But because different states and localities have different rules about recording and reporting causes of death, the cumulative data is always messy.\n\nRelated: 13 coronavirus myths busted by science\n\n\"I think some states are reluctant to open their databases up, knowing they have validity problems or knowing the data might be misused,\" Wolfson said. But public health officials need access, he said, and they need to figure out ways to dig into the data and standardize them. Wolfson and other researchers at USF are already working with state officials to see what kind of data the state can legally release, he said.\n\nMeanwhile, as the political debate over the response to the virus heats up, some have argued that death reports are being deliberately skewed. Aiken rejected the notion of a vast conspiracy by medical examiners; medical examiners are designed to be independent entities, she said, and they run the political gamut from conservative to liberal.\n\n\"It always cracks me up,\" she said. \"Medical examiners and coroners aren't organized enough to have a conspiracy.\"\n\nIn Colorado, the discrepancy over people dying with COVID-19 versus of COVID-19 is due to federal reporting guidelines requiring the health department to report any COVID-positive death to the CDC, even if COVID-19 wasn't thought to cause the death, Gov. Jared Polis said in a news conference Friday (May 15). The health department has been instructed not to report those deaths as being caused by COVID-19 to the public, Polis said.\n\nIn Florida, state law prevents the release of death certificate data, Wolfson said, but it may be possible to get public release of death certificates with identifying information removed, or of cumulative datasets.\n\nBoth undercounts and overcounts of COVID-19 deaths are possible, Wolfson said, but it's not yet clear which is more likely, or whether they might simply balance each other out. Fowkes said that based on her experience, it's more likely that COVID-19 deaths are being missed than overcounted. That's because New York is among several cities that show spikes in deaths at home, and these anomalous spikes could be due to untested, untreated COVID-19.\n\nPerhaps, the best clue as to whether COVID-19 deaths have been undercounted or overcounted is excess mortality data. Excess mortality is deaths above and beyond what would normally be expected in a given population in a given year. CDC data shows a spike of excess mortality in early 2020, adding up to tens of thousands of deaths.\n\nSome argue that many of these excess deaths are related to COVID-19 lockdowns, not COVID-19 themselves, Faust said, because people fear catching the disease if they go to the hospital for other reasons. A study in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology did find that nine major hospitals saw a 38% drop in emergency visits for a particular kind of heart attack in March. That suggests that people really are delaying or avoiding medical care, which could mean that some of them die of preventable causes.\n\nBut non-COVID conditions probably don't explain most excess deaths, Faust said. Only a portion of heart attack visits would have represented lives saved, he said, because doctors must treat perhaps 10 patients to save one life. And other causes of death -- such as motor vehicle accidents -- are down.\n\nThis could change with time, Faust cautioned. For example, if cancer patients forego their treatments for a year, rather than a few months, the impact on their death rates is much more likely to be noticeable in the population-wide data. But for now, he said, \"it's unlikely that the coronavirus deaths are being overcounted by a magnitude that explains our observation that something very unusual is going on.\"",

A big component of Lyme disease is a hyperactive immune system that is always in a state of inflammation,\" he explained, noting this factor, in particular, could make these patients more at risk for severe illness.\n\nWith some 300,000 Americans diagnosed with this tick-borne disease every year, and with summer right around the corner, read on for a look at how Lyme disease patients could be adversely impacted by the ongoing COVID-19 epidemic in the U.S.\n\nThe following has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nFox News: Why are Lyme disease patients considered to be at higher risk?\n\nKellman: Patients who have Lyme disease have a severely impacted immune system. A big component of Lyme disease is a hyperactive immune system that is always in a state of inflammation.\n\nThe coronavirus turns our own immune system against us. It activates our immune system and it overly produces different cytokines, which is further activating the immune system. Coronavirus causes a cytokine storm and overproduction of cytokine, causing much of the damage we see in coronavirus patients, such as pulmonary lung damage and pneumonia that ensues. The inflammation could be a component of the cardiovascular and neurological dysfunction, such as headaches and other neurological manifestations that we see in coronavirus patients as well.\n\nLyme disease patients are faced with similar neurological symptoms, like coronavirus patients, such as pain, headaches, brain fog, etc. People who have Lyme disease are more susceptible because of their inability to fight off disease. Their immunity isn't as strong in killing viruses and microbes. People with Lyme disease are at a greater risk of incidence and severity of coronavirus.\n\nFox News: What concerns do you have as tick season ramps up, coinciding with the ongoing coronavirus epidemic?\n\nKellman: We have to be very vigilant this tick season, more so than any other year, so that we prevent Lyme disease from developing. We also have to take a more proactive stance in our treatment and prevention of coronavirus, in addition to wearing masks and tracking the virus, there is a whole realm of medicine that is not being seen. It is not only drugs and vaccines that will help us combat this pandemic. There are a plethora of natural compounds that have been shown to help other coronaviruses.\n\nFox News: What can be done to support those with Lyme disease as the epidemic continues?\n\nKellman: You want a good assessment of overall health. With Lyme disease, you're not just dealing with an imbalanced and overactive immune system, but there are also other unhealthy systems in the body.\n\nOne way to support good health is to improve the gut microbiome, which plays a profound role in keeping the gut and immune system healthy.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nWe [should also] run a baseline test of vitamin levels and identify deficiencies. Many people have deficiencies and don't realize it. It's important to get vitamin D levels checked to make sure you're in a good range and taking the supplement if you're suffering from a deficiency. Strong vitamin D levels show you have a lower risk of developing the disease and you're more likely to survive the virus.\n\nBlood tests are also important to measure the baseline levels of cytokines to see who is at risk.\n\nZinc and quercetin is a good combination because it is anti-inflammatory and zinc has an antiviral effect. Research in China and the U.S. have found that vitamin C has a positive effect on the coronavirus infection when used both orally and intravenously.",

    "How does the new coronavirus compare with the flu?": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "Since the new coronavirus was first discovered in January, many people have compared it with a more well-known disease: The flu.\n\nMany of these comparisons pointed to the perhaps underappreciated toll of the flu, which causes millions of illnesses and tens of thousands of deaths every year in the U.S. alone. (During the current flu season, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that there have been 39 million to 56 million flu illnesses and 24,000 to 62,000 flu deaths in the U.S., although that number is an estimate based on hospitalizations with flu symptoms, not based on actually counting up every person who has died of flu.)\n\nThe new coronavirus disease, COVID-19, has caused more than 1.4 million illnesses and 85,000 deaths in the U.S. as of May 14, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.\n\nRelated: Is 6 feet enough space for social distancing?\n\nBoth COVID-19 and the flu are respiratory illnesses. But COVID-19 is not the flu. Research so far indicates that COVID-19 spreads more easily and has a higher death rate than the flu.\n\nScientists are racing to find out more about COVID-19, and our understanding may change as new information becomes available. Based on what we know so far, here's how it compares with the flu.\n\nBoth seasonal flu viruses (which include influenza A and influenza B viruses) and COVID-19 are contagious viruses that cause respiratory illness.\n\nTypical flu symptoms include fever, cough, sore throat, muscle aches, headaches, runny or stuffy nose, fatigue and, sometimes, vomiting and diarrhea, according to the CDC. Flu symptoms often come on suddenly. Most people who get the flu will recover in less than two weeks. But in some people, the flu causes complications, including pneumonia. The overall hospitalization rate in the U.S. for flu this season is about 69 hospitalizations per 100,000 people, according to the CDC.\n\nWith COVID-19, doctors are still trying to understand the full picture of disease symptoms and severity. Reported symptoms in patients have varied from mild to severe, and can include fever, cough and shortness of breath, according to the CDC. Other symptoms may include fever, chills, repeated shaking with chills, muscle pain, headache, sore throat and new loss of taste or smell. COVID-19 symptoms appear to come on more gradually than those of flu, according to Healthline.\n\nOlder adults and people with underlying medical conditions, including heart disease, lung disease or diabetes, appear to be at higher risk for more serious complications from COVID-19, compared with people in younger age groups and those without underlying conditions.\n\nThe overall hospitalization rate for COVID-19 in the U.S. is about 50 hospitalizations per 100,000 people as of May 8, although the hospitalization rate for adults ages 65 and older is higher, at 162 hospitalizations per 100,000 people, according to the CDC. (However, because fewer people have likely gotten COVID-19 in the U.S. than have gotten the flu, the odds of becoming hospitalized if you have a confirmed case of COVID-19 are thought to be higher than the odds of being hospitalized with influenza.)\n\nChildren are a high risk group for complications from flu, but this doesn't seem to be the case for COVID-19 -- few children have been hospitalized with the new coronavirus. A study of COVID-19 cases in the United States published March 18 found that, among 4,226 reported cases, at least 508 people (12%) were hospitalized, and of these, less than 1% were younger than 20 years old.\n\nBut recently, COVID-19 has been linked to a rare but serious inflammatory syndrome in children, called pediatric multisystem inflammatory syndrome. New York City has confirmed 100 cases of the syndrome in children, according to The New York Times.\n\nIt's important to note that, because respiratory viruses cause similar symptoms, it can be difficult to distinguish different respiratory viruses based on symptoms alone, according to the World Health Organization.\n\nRelated: Can homemade masks protect you from COVID-19?\n\nThe death rate from seasonal flu is typically around 0.1% in the U.S., according to news reports.\n\nThough the death rate for COVID-19 is unclear, almost all credible research suggests it is much higher than that of the seasonal flu.\n\nIt's important to note that there is no one death rate for COVID-19; the rate can vary by location, age of person infected and the presence of underlying health conditions, Live Science previously reported.\n\nAmong reported COVID-19 cases in the U.S., nearly 6% have died. This is what's known as the case fatality rate, which is determined by dividing the number of deaths by the total number of confirmed cases. But the case fatality rate is limited for a few reasons. First, not everyone with COVID-19 is being diagnosed with the disease -- this is in part due to testing limitations in the U.S. and the fact that people who experience mild or moderate symptoms may not be eligible for or seek out testing. As the number of confirmed cases goes up, the fatality rate may decrease.\n\nResearchers from Columbia University recently estimated that only 1 in 12 cases of COVID-19 in the U.S. are documented, which they said would translate to an infection fatality rate of about 0.6%, according to The Washington Post. But even this lower estimate is still at least six times higher than that of the flu. (The case fatality rate in people who become sick with flu may be 0.1%, but when you account for people who become infected with flu but never show symptoms, the death rate will be half or even a quarter of that, the Post reported.)\n\nWhat's more, unlike the flu, for which there is a vaccine, everyone in the population is theoretically susceptible to COVID-19. So while the flu affects 8% of the U.S. population every year, according to the CDC, between 50% and 80% of the population could be infected with COVID-19, according to a study published March 30 in the journal The Lancet. In the U.S., that would translate to 1 million deaths from COVID-19 if half the population becomes infected and there are no social distancing measures or therapeutics, the Post reported.\n\nAnother limitation with the case fatality rate is that some people who are counted as confirmed cases may eventually die from the disease, which would lead to an increase in the death rate. For example, South Korea initially reported a case fatality rate of 0.6% in early March, but it later rose to 1.7% by the beginning of April, according to New Scientist.\n\nRelated: Why are more men dying from COVID-19?\n\nIt's also important to note that estimates of flu illnesses and deaths from the CDC are just that -- estimates (which make certain assumptions) rather than raw numbers. (The CDC does not know the exact number of people who become sick with or die from the flu each year in the U.S. Rather, this number is estimated based on data collected on flu hospitalizations through surveillance in 13 states.) A recent paper published in the journal JAMA Internal Medicine emphasized this point when it found that, in the U.S., there were 20 times more deaths per week from COVID-19 than from the flu in the deadliest week of an average influenza season, Live Science previously reported.\n\nThe measure scientists use to determine how easily a virus spreads is known as the \"basic reproduction number,\" or R0 (pronounced R-nought). This is an estimate of the average number of people who catch the virus from a single infected person, Live Science previously reported. The flu has an R0 value of about 1.3, according to The New York Times.\n\nResearchers are still working to determine the R0 for COVID-19. Preliminary studies estimated an R0 value for the new coronavirus to be between 2 and 3, according to a review study published Feb. 28 in the journal JAMA. This means each infected person has spread the virus to an average of 2 to 3 people.\n\nSome studies suggest COVID-19 has an even higher R0 value. For example, a study published April 7 in the journal Emerging Infectious Disease used mathematical modeling to calculate an R0 of nearly 6 in China.\n\nIt's important to note that R0 is not a constant number. Estimates can vary by location, depending on such factors as how often people come into contact with each other and the efforts taken to reduce viral spread, Live Science previously reported.\n\nSeasonal flu, which causes outbreaks every year, should not be confused with pandemic flu, or a global outbreak of a new flu virus that is very different from the strains that typically circulate. This happened in 2009 with the swine flu pandemic, which is estimated to have infected up to 1.4 billion people and killed between 151,000 and 575,000 people worldwide, according to the CDC. There is no flu pandemic happening currently.\n\nUnlike seasonal flu, for which there is a vaccine to protect against infection, there is no vaccine for COVID-19. But researchers in the U.S. and around the world are working to develop one.\n\nIn addition, the flu has several treatments approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), including antiviral drugs such as amantadine and rimantadine (Flumadine), and inhibitors of influenza, such as oseltamivir (Tamiflu) and zanamivir (Relenza). In contrast, the FDA has yet to approve any treatments for COVID-19, although approval for remdesivir, an antiviral initially developed to treat Ebola, is pending.\n\nIn general, the CDC recommends the following to prevent the spread of respiratory viruses, which include both coronaviruses and flu viruses: Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds; avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed hands; avoid close contact with people who are sick; stay home when you are sick; and clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces.\n\nWearing cloth face coverings in public and practicing social distancing -- or staying at least 6 feet (1.8 meters) away from other people -- is also recommended to prevent the spread of COVID-19.",

Sign up here.\n\nU.S. states and countries worldwide are cautiously relaxing restrictions while watching for potential spikes in coronavirus infections. Getting the timing right is complicated. Disease trackers note the impossibility of seeing clearly what's happening without widespread testing.\n\nCAN THE CORONAVIRUS SPREAD IN POOL WATER?\n\nA look at when we might start to see any health impacts of reopening:\n\nWHEN ARE WE GOING TO KNOW?\n\nThe virus can circulate undetected, then flare up in a nursing home or after a family gathering. So it could be several weeks to see surges in infections. What's more, there are still new infections happening now during lockdowns. Some parts of the U.S. are seeing increasing numbers of daily new cases and some are seeing declines. Health officials will be looking at the number of new cases per day and the percentage of positive COVID-19 tests.\n\nWHY DOES IT TAKE THAT LONG?\n\nAfter exposure to the virus, it can take three to five days for someone to feel sick, and many infected people won't have symptoms or only mild ones. Some with mild illness might delay getting tested. It can take another few days to get test results back and report them. All told, it can take two weeks or so -- the time for one group of people to spread the virus to another -- to have enough testing data. Crystal Watson of the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security said it will take a few rounds of infection spread -- five to six weeks -- to know how reopening has affected epidemic curves.\n\nCATS CAN PASS THE CORONAVIRUS TO EACH OTHER, STUDY FINDS\n\nIF THERE'S A SPIKE, HOW WOULD WE STOP IT?\n\nIdeally, investigators would call people who test positive, track down their contacts and get them into quarantine before they can spread the virus to others. There's evidence the coronavirus can spread before people feel sick, making it important to act quickly. States are just starting to expand their ability to do this contact tracing. Without adequate testing and contact tracing, returning to restrictions or a lockdown might be necessary if there is a surge in infections.",

Check out what's clicking today in entertainment.\n\nGet all the latest news on coronavirus and more delivered daily to your inbox. Sign up here.\n\nAlthough the coronavirus pandemic has caused thousands of people who work in the film industry to face an uncertain future, many are already looking ahead to gauge how much the business will change once production is allowed to begin again.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic forced countless movies in production to close up shop as guidelines on social distancing and nonessential workers remain in effect. As time goes on, it's becoming clear that the thousands of on and off-camera workers who are desperate for their jobs to start up again won't be returning to the kind of film sets they're used to.\n\nChristian Simonds, a partner at the global law firm Reed Smith's Entertainment and Media, told Fox News that even when restrictions are lifted, it's likely the same number of jobs won't be returning.\n\nCORONAVIRUS: WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW\n\n\"I think crews will be limited to essential production personnel only. I think many ancillary positions - production assistants, etc. - will no longer be allowed on set,\" Simonds explained. \"The goal will be to minimize crew as much as possible while cast is on set.\"\n\nSenior media analyst at Exhibitor Relations, Jeff Bock, echoed those sentiments, telling Fox News that the industry can expect \"smaller crews\" and \"fewer locations\" as well as \"an insane increase and reliance on VFX.\"\n\n\"Background actors. VFX can easily replace them, but obviously that comes at a cost,\" Bock explained when asked who would likely be hit the hardest. \"Expect a lot of crew to double as extras in the months/years to come. Every director will end up being Alfred Hitchcock as their services as extras will no doubt be utilized.\"\n\nHowever, unions like SAG-AFTRA, which represents mostly on-camera workers, is currently being as proactive as possible to make sure that it's prepared to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on its members.\n\nHOW PAST OUTBREAKS SHAPED CORONAVIRUS RESPONSE IN US\n\n\"We're working aggressively with our internal experts, with industry safety representatives and coordinating with other guilds and unions on the issue of safety,\" National Executive Director of SAG-AFTRA, David P. White, told Fox News in a statement. \"No one yet knows when the industry will be able to return to work, but we intend to be ready at the earliest possible time while ensuring the safety of our members.\"\n\nThe International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees (IATSE), which handles mostly below-the-line workers, says it's doing the same.\n\n\"We want everyone to get back to work as soon as possible, but we need to do it right,\" a spokesperson for IATSE told Fox News. \"Every worker in our industry deserves a safe workplace, period.\"\n\nHowever, there is only so much planning that can happen. Until movies are allowed to go into production again, everything remains hypothetical.\n\n\"Bottom line -- a safe environment as dictated by the insurance companies,\" Bock told Fox News when asked what needs to happen before the industry can start back up. \"Until production companies can secure insurance for their movies and TV shows they simply won't be able to ramp up production again. This new wrinkle will obviously change the parameters of the Hollywood game as guidelines are currently being shopped around.\"\n\nTIPS ON TALKING CORONAVIRUS WITH YOUR KIDS\n\nWhile filming in Hollywood remains virtually nonexistent, one ever-growing moviemaking hub in the U.S., Georgia, is currently ironing out the details to get its industry back to work. Thanks to Gov. Brian Kemp making the controversial decision to be among the first states to loosen lockdown restrictions, the state's Department of Economic Development has already been hard at work figuring out what the new film landscape will look like to provide an example for the industry at large.\n\n\"The state has been working on plans for a safe return to operations across industries, including bolstering testing capabilities as we look to move forward with projects cautiously while protecting our terrific crews here,\" a spokesperson for the department told Fox News. \"We are in constant talks with studios and production companies as they determine the best methods to ensure the safety of all cast and crew in the state. We thank the film and entertainment industry for the many ways they have stepped up to support Georgia's fight against COVID-19 while on hiatus.\"\n\nHOW CORONAVIRUS DIFFERS FROM FLU: SYMPTOMS TO WATCH FOR\n\nWhile studios, guilds and unions prepare for the eventual return to work Simonds notes that the industry should be less concerned with what making movies will look like than what seeing movies will look like.\n\n\"I don't think sets will normalize until at least 2021. The bigger question will be, 'how will content be released/consumed (theaters v. digital/VOD)?'\" Simonds said. \"This will be a heated debate in coming months as production resumes but audiences remain reluctant to return to theaters.\"\n\nThe debate already took a drastic turn after the AMC Theater chain announced it would no longer carry movies made by Universal after comments about the very successful VOD releases of \"Trolls World Tour\" made by NBCUniversal CEO Jeff Shell, arguing that VOD threatens the theater distribution model that so many people rely on and enjoy.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"To open movie theatres on a scale the industry is used to will take quite a long time,\" Bock concluded. \"This isn't just restarting the box office engine, this is rebuilding the entire exhibition industry. This is going to take time.\"",

Something is wrong with that -- with Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and Google.\"\n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), studies suggest that the COVID-19 virus is spread by people not exhibiting symptoms. Additionally, close contact is not the only issue when respiratory droplets from an infected person hang in the air or on surfaces. These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs.\n\nThe viral video in contention shows Bakersfield, Calif. Accelerated Urgent Care doctors Dan Erickson and Artin Massihi at a news briefing last week. Their message was what many Americas have hoped to hear: that the coronavirus is not worse than influenza, its death rates are low, and America could reopen.\n\nThe pair had set up Bakersfield's only private walk-in COVID-19 testing site and performed about half of all tests conducted in the area.\n\nHowever, some doctors are fighting back against Erickson and Massihi's claims, arguing that their findings are riddled with statistical errors.\n\nIn a rare statement released on Monday, the American College of Emergency Physicians and the American Academy of Emergency Medicine declared they \"emphatically condemn the recent opinions released by Dr. Daniel Erickson and Dr. Artin Messihi. These reckless and untested musings do not speak for medical societies and are inconsistent with current science and epidemiology regarding COVID-19. As owners of local urgent care clinics, it appears these two individuals are releasing biased, non-peer reviewed data to advance their personal financial interests without regard for the public's health.\"\n\nLast week, YouTube CEO Susan Wojcicki told CNN that \"anything that would go against the World Health Organization [WHO] recommendations would be a violation of our policy.\"\n\nIn response, Erickson said Tuesday that the video was comprised of \"raw data\" and was labeled accurately.\n\n\"We had tested about 5,213 at the time of that video and we had about 340 positive which is 6.5 percent. So, I was giving them raw data. It was not a biostatistical analysis. It was not peer-reviewed. And, we didn't say that it was. It was merely raw data,\" Erickson told \"Fox News @ Night\" Tuesday.\n\n\"I think YouTube would realize once we get the economy going and we get people safely back to work it would be better for them,\" he continued. \"And so, really the herd immunity is really the main thing. How do we get herd immunity, that 50 to 70 percent mark, where the disease is controlled and we can get back to work?\"\n\nHuckabee said most people who believe states should continue with \"everything\" shut down are on the government payroll and thus have financial security.\n\n\"There [are] 26 million Americans who don't have a job right now because we have shut everything down. Should we be careful? Absolutely. Should some things be slower in opening? Of Course,\" he added. \"But, what we have done is to put 26 million people out of work and the only people that still get their paychecks are government -- and that includes members of Congress -- and they are not going back to work.\"\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"So, I would say, cut their paychecks off. Quit paying members of Congress. And, let's see how long it is before they say, 'You know what? I think we have got to ramp this economy back up and get people back out into the workplace,\" Huckabee concluded.",

Of those cases, 170 have been caught during health screenings at two large shelters in Denver at the National Western Complex and the Denver Coliseum.\n\nAs coronavirus has spread throughout the country, there have been concerns the virus could sweep through the nation's homeless population, many of whom have chronic health conditions and lack safe places to quarantine themselves. Homeless populations are particularly susceptible to COVID-19, which can be spread through coughing and sneezing.\n\nSAN FRANCISCO FALLS SHORT OF MEETING GOAL FOR LEASING 8,000 HOTEL ROOMS FOR HOMELESS, AT-RISK POPULATIONS\n\nCathy Alderman, the vice president of communications and public policy for the Colorado Coalition for the Homeless, told FOX31 that it's only a matter of time before there's an outbreak inside of the facilities.\n\n\"We're not able to test the hundreds of people that could be asymptomatic,\" she said Saturday. \"And we know that one in three people in many shelter systems across the country is carrying this virus, but not showing any symptoms.\"\n\nSimilar concerns have been raised by activists, including one in California who warned that sheltering people in large spaces such as a convention center could create \"a powder keg\" that could permit the contagion to rapidly spread.\n\nOn Friday night, 579 people were inside the National Western Complex, which is where only men are staying. At the Denver Coliseum, there has been an average of 170 women staying there a night.\n\nCatholic Charities of Denver, which is running operations at the Coliseum, said so far eight women tested positive for the virus at health screenings outside.\n\nCORONAVIRUS IN THE US: STATE-BY-STATE BREAKDOWN\n\nMike Sinnett, who works for the group, said workers are just \"trying to protect the ladies inside the shelter as much as we can.\"\n\n\"Until this thing runs out, I don't think we can be overly prepared, or cautious, or guarded,\" he told FOX31.\n\nThose working at the facilities have also fallen ill.\n\nAt least seven COVID-19 cases have been confirmed among staff at the National Western Complex being operating by the Denver Rescue Mission, Denverite reported.\n\nBrad Meuli, the mission's president and CEO, told the news outlet that of those who tested positive, three have recovered and returned to work.\n\n\"This is the nature of the work that we're doing right now,\" he said. \"We're very much at risk.\"\n\nOn Monday, the Denver City Council is expected to vote on a $1.9 million agreement to provide an additional 140 hotel rooms for people experiencing homelessness.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR FULL CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE\n\nOther states have undertaken similar measures, such as California, where officials have acquired over 15,000 hotel rooms to shelter people during the pandemic.\n\n\"We're trying to move people out of these congregate settings that are high risk,\" Alderman told FOX31. \"So I think that is a really smart strategy to prevent spread and extreme health complications among those high-risk individuals that could overwhelm the hospital system.\"",

The largest protest drew thousands to Lansing, Mich., on Wednesday, and others have featured hundreds in several states.\n\nThe president has said people have \"cabin fever\" and want to \"get their life back,\" and last week appeared to give his endorsement to the demonstrations, tweeting calls on Friday to \"LIBERATE\" Minnesota, Virginia, and Michigan -- all of which have Democratic governors.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR FULL CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE\n\nAttendees of the Sunday rally in San Clemente did not practice social distancing guidelines by standing close together and many did not wear masks.\n\nMany were pictured wearing red, white and blue clothing, hugging, and carrying signs that read \"No Liberty, No Life, Re-open California,\" \"Our Freedom Is Not Yours to Take,\" and \"Pandemics does NOT cancel our Constitutional rights!! Freedom over fear.\"\n\nThe few who appeared to counterprotest the rally said they thought the stay-at-home order was necessary and that officials should not ease restrictions.\n\n\"We don't have enough adequate information for us to really bring society back to the point where we are,\" Michelle Carney told FOX11.\n\nSAN DIEGO-AREA PROTEST TARGETS CORONAVIRUS CLOSURES OF BEACHES, WALKING TRAILS\n\nDonna Vidrine, who has worked as a nurse for over 40 years, told FOX11 she thought the demonstrators were \"disrespecting the health care professionals.\"\n\n\"Nurses and doctors do not have the choice to stay home,\" Vidrine told FOX11. \"We have to take care of these people who are gathering against the rules of the city of San Clemente.\"\n\nThere were heated moments between the two groups, but the Orange County Sheriff's Department told the Orange County Register that no arrests or citations were reported.\n\nProtesters also took aim at the media covering the event with signs such as \"The Media Is the Virus.\"\n\nA photographer from FOX11 was intentionally coughed on by a protester who did not agree with news coverage, but is expected to be OK, according to the station.\n\nCalifornia Gov.

Of those, 735 patients received hydroxychloroquine with azithromycin, 271 were given hydroxychloroquine alone, 211 received just azithromycin and 221 acted as a control group.\n\n\"[T]he fast moving public health implications of the COVID-19 pandemic necessitates that we examine potential treatments for the disease in the most rapid yet careful manner possible,\" the Dean of the School of Public Health at University at Albany, David Holtgrave, said in a statement obtained by Fox News. \"This observational study has given us an important early look at some key questions related to prescribing patterns of hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin and chloroquine. Unfortunately, we did not observe benefits of the most used drug (hydroxychloroquine with or without azithromycin) in this group of seriously ill, hospitalized patients.\"\n\nCORONAVIRUS PATIENT SAYS HYDROXYCHLOROQUINE SAVED HIS LIFE\n\nThe researchers also made several other observations during the study, including that chloroquine \"was so limited in use (less than 2 [percent] of the first several hundred records screened) that it was dropped from further analysis.\"\n\nHydroxychloroquine and chloroquine are antimalarial drugs. No drug should be taken without a doctor's prescription.\n\nThey also found that the combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin was \"associated with significantly elevated levels of cardiac arrest even after statistical adjustment for sex, age, underlying health conditions, and more severe illness upon admission.\"\n\nA study in Brazil testing chloroquine in COVID-19 patients had to be stopped in April after patients who took high doses of the drug developed dangerous heart rhythm problems.\n\nIn late April, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration warned against the use of the two antimalarial drugs following reports of \"serious heart rhythm problems\" in COVID-19 patients treated with the medications.\n\n\"The FDA is aware of reports of serious heart rhythm problems in patients with COVID-19 treated with hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine, often in combination with azithromycin,\" the agency said on its website.\n\n\"We are also aware of increased use of these medicines through outpatient prescriptions. Therefore, we would like to remind health care professionals and patients of the known risks associated with both hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine,\" it added.\n\nIn the past, President Trump has touted hydroxychloroquine as a \"game-changer.\"\n\nSeparately in April, a study of 150 COVID-19 patients in China who received the drug showed it did not clear the patients of the virus, but it did alleviate some symptoms.\n\nJEFF BEZOS MAKES VISIT TO AMAZON, WHOLE FOODS STORES AS SCRUTINY OVER WORKERS' SAFETY INTENSIFIES\n\nIn March, the FDA approved emergency use authorization to try several drugs, including hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine, in an effort to combat COVID-19, despite a lack of clear evidence of their effectiveness.\n\nIn April, a study of hydroxychloroquine use in treating COVID-19 at U.S. veterans hospitals showed no benefit and more deaths, researchers said.\n\nNew York, the hardest-hit state in the U.S., is still running trials on the effectiveness of hydroxychloroquine.\n\nIn March, Fox News reported the state had acquired 70,000 doses of hydroxychloroquine, 10,000 doses of zithromax and 750,000 doses of chloroquine.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR COMPLETE CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE\n\nAs of Tuesday morning, more than 4.1 million coronavirus cases have been diagnosed worldwide, more than 1.33 million of which are in the U.S., the most impacted country on the planet.\n\nGET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nFox News' Madeline Farber and James Rogers contributed to this story.",

One detainee was hospitalized with \"symptoms of a panic attack,\" another was hospitalized due to a preexisting condition and a third \"for a medical incident after being removed from the ICE wing.\" All three are expected \"to be fine,\" the sheriff's department said.\n\nIn a Saturday statement, Todd Lyons, the acting field office director of Enforcement and Removal Operations for ICE, commended the sheriff's office staff \"who responded rapidly and professionally to de-escalate a volatile situation, limiting injuries and further damage to the facility and restoring order.\"\n\nTOM HOMAN: LIBERAL JUDGES USE CORONAVIRUS AS EXCUSE TO FREE DETAINED ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS, ENDANGERING PUBLIC\n\nIvan Espinoza-Madrigal, the executive director of Lawyers for Civil Rights in Boston, which has filed suit on behalf of the detainees, alleged that correctional officers were attempting to move detainees from one part of the facility to the medical wing.\n\n\"'These individuals were justifiably concerned that doing so would dangerously expose them to risk of infection given the cross-contamination with many different individuals from all over the facility who come and go from the medical unit and with many shared surfaces,\" he said in a statement.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nHodgson said the detainees have been moved to single cells pending disciplinary action, COVID-19 testing and criminal charges.\n\nOn Monday, he called allegations that he threw a detainee to the ground and pepper-sprayed him \"ridiculous\" and \"absurd.\"",

It is led by 33-year-old physician-turned venture capitalist Thomas Cahill, according to the Journal.\n\nA document written by the group, which calls itself \"Scientists to Stop COVID-19,\" outlines their plan to tackle the pandemic.\n\nSCIENTISTS TRACK 'ALARMING' CORONAVIRUS SPREAD IN SOUTH KOREAN CALL CENTER\n\nCahill, the managing partner at Boston-based life sciences venture capital firm Newpath Partners, has set up the eclectic group that includes Nobel Prize winner Michael Rosbash, a neuroscientist and professor of biology at Brandeis University.\n\nHarvard chemistry and chemical biology professor Stuart Schreiber is also a member of the group. Like Rosbash, Schreiber is also a Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator.\n\nCahill's connections, including billionaires Peter Thiel and Michael Milken, have given him the legitimacy to reach the officials at the heart of the coronavirus battle, The Wall Street Journal reports.\n\nFDA AUTHORIZES FIRST AT-HOME CORONAVIRUS TEST\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reports that the group is acting as an \"ad hoc review board\" for the flood of coronavirus research, \"weeding out\" flawed research before it reaches policymakers. Over the past month, the group has frequently advised Nick Ayers, a longtime aide of Vice President Mike Pence, as well as agency heads, according to the Journal.\n\nPence is the head of the U.S. Coronavirus Task Force.\n\nIn their plan, which was obtained by the Journal, the scientists offer \"four actionable, non-partisan proposals to produce safe and effective COVID-19 therapeutics and vaccines in the shortest possible timeframe, and to reopen our society in a manner that reduces the risk of future COVID-19 outbreaks.\"\n\n'WALKING MIRACLE' 34-YEAR-OLD CORONAVIRUS PATIENT AT CENTER OF STRUGGLE FOR EXPERIMENTAL DRUG RETURNS HOME\n\nThe plan is dated \"March and April 2020.\"\n\nThe proposals include a first wave of therapies using existing drugs to establish a \"beachhead\" in the fight against the virus and a second wave of potent new antibody drugs developed specifically to neutralize COVID-19. The drugs, the group says, would \"offer a promising combination of speed, safety, and likelihood of being effective.\"\n\nA third wave of vaccines for long-term victory over the virus will offer seasonal or multiyear immunity to COVID-19, the plan says. The authors of the plan also say that the reopening of businesses and schools must use science-driven symptom reporting, virus testing, and personal protective gear to minimize future COVID-19 outbreaks and additional loss of life.\n\nCHILLING VIDEO REVEALS HOW CORONAVIRUS SPREADS FROM A SINGLE COUGH IN A SUPERMARKET\n\nThe group says that testing for the first wave of therapies should occur from April to May 2020, with use immediately afterward. Testing for the second wave of antibody drugs should take place from June to August 2020, with use immediately afterward, it adds.\n\nThe plan also calls for testing of the third wave of vaccines through March 2021, with use immediately afterward. The reopening of businesses and schools could be implemented from May to June 2020, with the measures the scientists advocate lasting until the threat has passed.\n\nFox News has reached out to Cahill and the White House with a request for comment on this story.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR COMPLETE CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE\n\nAs of Tuesday morning, more than 3 million coronavirus cases have been diagnosed worldwide, at least 988,469 of which are in the U.S. The disease has accounted for at least 212,056 deaths around the world, including at least 56,253 people in the U.S.",

The directive also gave CBP the authority to send suspected illegal border crossers back to their country of origin, rather than holding them in CBP facilities for prolonged periods of time.\n\nThe guidance coincided with warnings from the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Robert Redfield, who at the time singled out ports of entries around the country as potential hotbeds for coronavirus to spread to workers at border facilities and U.S. citizens.\n\nThe man is the first person in CBP custody to test positive for coronavirus.

        "authors": [],
        "body": "Fitness dance classes are yet another venue where the new coronavirus appears to easily spread, according to a new report.\n\nThe report found that dozens of people in South Korea caught COVID-19 after participating in fitness dance classes at the beginning of the pandemic.\n\nThe researchers traced the cluster back to a workshop that was held for fitness dance instructors in Cheonan, South Korea, on Feb. 15, according to the report, published May 15 in the journal Emerging Infectious Diseases. The workshop involved four hours of intense training, the report said. Among the 27 fitness instructors who participated, eight later tested positive for COVID-19, although none had symptoms on the day of the workshop.\n\nNot knowing they had COVID-19, those instructors then went on to teach their own fitness dance classes.\n\nBy March 9, the researchers had identified 112 COVID-19 cases tied to fitness dance classes at 12 different sports facilities in Cheonan.\n\nAbout half of the cases occurred due to direct transmission from instructors to students during classes, which lasted nearly an hour and met twice a week. The rest of the cases (not including the instructors themselves) occurred due to spread from the students to their family members or coworkers.\n\nThe researchers noted that the classes involved many people engaging in high-intensity exercise in a small space -- a pretty ideal environment for COVID-19 spread.\n\n\"The moist, warm atmosphere in a sports facility coupled with turbulent air flow generated by intense physical exercise can cause more dense transmission of isolated droplets,\" the authors said.\n\nThe number of people in a class also appeared to play a role in disease spread: Typical-size classes, with up to 22 participants, resulted in disease spread, while small classes with fewer than five people did not result in any spread of COVID-19, the report found.\n\nInterestingly, one of the infected instructors also taught yoga and pilates, but none of these students became infected. The authors hypothesized that the lower intensity of these activities did not result in the same level of transmission as the high-intensity fitness classes.\n\nOverall, \"because of the increased possibility of infection through droplets, vigorous exercise in closely confined spaces should be avoided during the current outbreak,\" the authors concluded.",

Despite testing negative for COVID-19, the Pepperdine University biology professor said her recent sickness is worse than anything she's ever experienced.\n\n\"I've had bad flus before, and I've had weird tropical diseases including a suspected case of Zika from field work in Ecuador during February 2016,\" Finkbeiner told Fox News. \"This felt worse than that.\"\n\nFinkbeiner outlined a near month-long battle in which she experienced symptoms commonly associated with COVID-19, including extreme fatigue, body aches, difficulty breathing and fever. As a result, she believes it's likely she contracted the virus that has affected more than 2.6 million people around the world.\n\nAt the onset, she, like many others, had a runny nose, extreme tiredness and a bad headache, but by the sixth day, her situation had got markedly worse, to the point she sought medical attention.\n\n\"I called the ER [at the time] because I was scared and concerned,\" Finkbeiner said, a call that occurred in mid-March. \"They told me I would be turned away without a COVID-19 test unless I was showing life-threatening symptoms when I arrived.\"\n\nAfter being \"delirious\" for a couple of days, she was able to speak with her doctor who prescribed her a Z-pack. She would feel better in the mornings, but by the afternoon, the symptoms returned and she eventually went to the emergency room at a local hospital, fearful for her life.\n\n\"I took a nap in the afternoon and woke up from the nap with gasping for air,\" she explained, saying she had to \"work\" to breathe, calling the experience terrifying.\n\n\"I went to the ER, afraid symptoms would return. I was brought to a medical tent specifically for patients experiencing COVID-19 symptoms, but again sent home without a test because my vitals were OK when I arrived and my fever wasn't high enough.\"\n\nAfter finally getting approval to take a test, she was told it would still take several days to take the test because of a backlog in appointments. Thirteen days after first experiencing symptoms, Finkbeiner was tested via a nasal swab and her results came back negative, which she believes may be the result of a surfing accident suffered in January.\n\n\"[The] test results turned out negative though, to my surprise,\" she said. \"I had broken my nose in January in a surfing accident and wonder if that might have affected the ability for a proper sample to be taken.\"\n\nTwenty-four days after her first symptom, Finkbeiner said she felt fully recovered. She eventually returned to her day job as a biology professor at Pepperdine University, albeit to a completely different situation than the one she had prior to the pandemic.\n\nFinkbeiner shared how her routine has changed as a result of the novel coronavirus and what she's doing to pass the time.\n\n(Answers have been lightly edited for brevity and clarity.)\n\nFox News: How has your daily routine changed since social distancing measures began?\n\nSusan Finkbeiner: At first, things were pretty busy as I was scrambling to figure out how to provide quality education to my students remotely, whether it be through virtual reality labs, changes in student projects, new ways to administer lectures and exams, etc. Once I became familiarized with new remote teaching software, I started to have fun with it. I've joked more with my students, used fun Zoom backgrounds, and even dressed up in costumes. My pet cat has also become a member of the class!\n\nUsing virtual teaching software has its perks - I am able to have guest speakers and guest lectures from other professors around the world who are able to share their expertise with my students. Last week, I had a professor from the University of Puerto Rico speak to my class about how his research studying butterfly wing patterns and genetics has led to a current project he is undertaking with COVID-19 spread and genetics.\n\nFN: What are the biggest challenges in doing your job during this crisis?\n\nSF: A big challenge is not being able to see my students in person and interact with them. Although virtual teaching is so much better than not having classes at all, I do miss the campus atmosphere and the overall university community.\n\nFN: What do you miss the most about how you did your job before this began?\n\nSF: Before the COVID-19 outbreak and social distancing guidelines, many of the laboratories for my classes were outdoors. They would involve projects done in tidepools, lagoons, or hikes in the Santa Monica Mountains looking for cool plants and animals. I miss the outdoor components of my biology courses and I'm sure the students miss that, too!\n\nFN: What surprised you most about how life has changed?\n\nSF: I am most surprised with no traffic in Los Angeles; supermarket shelves being empty of paper goods; how Tylenol and Thermometers are out of stock on Amazon for over a month; and the closure of public access areas like hiking trails, and beaches, has been tough. The closure of ski resorts was also difficult to endure.\n\nI'm an outdoors person who loves to hike, surf, and snowboard, none of which I am allowed to do right now.\n\nFN: How do you blow off steam?\n\nSF: The best way for me to calm my stress levels are to do yoga in my living room, or spend time in my backyard. Being able to be outdoors right now is important, even if I'm not leaving home! I also play piano and keeping up with my artistic side by making music, helps with stress, too.\n\nI have also been FaceTiming more with my family which is a nice way to feel connected and supported during this time.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR COMPLETE CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE\n\nAs of Friday morning, more than 2.72 million coronavirus cases have been diagnosed worldwide, more than 869,000 of which are in the U.S., the most impacted country on the planet.",

        "body": "Fox News Exclusive - Jared Kushner speaks out of coronavirus pandemic: We're 'working to make sure we're never reliant on foreign supplies again'\n\nThe coronavirus pandemic brought to light the critical importance of securing U.S. supply chains to eliminate the long-time reliance on foreign governments, White House senior adviser Jared Kushner said in a rare interview Sunday on \"The Next Revolution.\"\n\n\"I think the campaign platform that President Trump ran on in 2016 which was basically 'you have to secure your borders and you have to control your own manufacturing as a national security issue.' I think those have been totally vindicated positions from the virus and I doubt it will be easy for people to argue against them in the future,\" Kushner told host Steve Hilton.\n\nKushner has been a key figure in the federal effort to manage the flow of U.S. supply chains and ensure hospitals in need are properly equipped with ventilators and other life-saving medical equipment.\n\nHis team, which has worked together with the coronavirus task force lead by Vice President Mike Pence, is now focused on solving the issue of insufficient testing at the center of the coronavirus crisis in the U.S. Click here for more on our top story.\n\nOther related developments:\n\n- To get all the latest news on coronavirus and more delivered daily to your inbox, sign up here.\n\n- Click here for Fox News' full coverage of the coronavirus pandemic\n\n- Trump: HHS Secretary Azar 'doing an excellent job,' reports he'll be fired 'Fake News'\n\n- New Yorker journalist asks about 'military coup' against Trump, claims he was sarcastic\n\n- Colorado Walmart linked to 11 coronavirus cases, 3 deaths allowed to reopen\n\nWuhan says it has no coronavirus patients in hospitals: report\n\nHealth officials in Wuhan -- the epicenter of the global coronavirus pandemic -- said Sunday that the city's hospitals are clear of any virus patients.\n\nMi Feng, the National Health Commission spokesman, said the number of new coronavirus patients in the city was zero and credited the coordinated efforts between medical personnel from across the country, Reuters reported.\n\nThere have been nearly three million confirmed coronavirus cases across the globe and 206,000 known deaths.

We could go down and sit in this very convivial atmosphere [as] people passed around sandwiches and sang. The next morning we went back to our flat in Maida Vale and it had been completely destroyed.\"\n\nCollins said she has noticed some similarities between her experience in the war and dealing with the current coronavirus pandemic.\n\n'DALLAS' STAR CHARLENE TILTON SAYS FAITH HAS KEPT HER OUT OF 'DARK PLACES' DURING CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC\n\nPRINCE WILLIAM ALLOWS AIR AMBULANCES TO LAND AT KENSINGTON PALACE AMID THE CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC\n\n\"I have been long concerned about this virus for a long time,\" she said. \"When I came from LA two and a half months ago in a mask and gloves I was derided by LAX staff, and by people when I was going to restaurants with wipes. In the war, I was evacuated 12 times. I never saw a banana until after the war. For a long time, we were in Brighton, we'd look out at the sea and the wonderful beaches and we couldn't go out there. All you could see was barbed wire, rather like today.\"\n\nAccording to the outlet, Collins was 11 when VE was celebrated in 1945. The British icon said that she was never really scared of the war because she couldn't quite understand it. And at school, both Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini were made out to be \"cartoon characters.\"\n\n\"VE Day was incredibly catching,\" said Collins. \"My parents relaxed for the first time. Daddy bundled us into his car and we went down to Piccadilly. People were dancing and singing. It was amazing. Everybody was so happy. It was a feeling of such relief.\"\n\nThe outlet shared a two-minute national silence was observed to honor the British servicemen and women who gave up their lives during the conflict. It was led by Prince Charles and his wife Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall and broadcast from Balmoral, where they are isolating during the COVID-19 crisis.\n\n'M*A*S*H' STAR LORETTA SWIT SAYS SHE'S USING HER TIME IN QUARANTINE TO HONOR HEROES: 'THEY ARE OUR LIFELINE'\n\n'BATMAN' STAR BURT WARD SAYS WAKING UP 'EVERY SINGLE DAY IN THE MOST WONDERFUL COUNTRY' IS 'A GIFT'\n\nFor most people, the coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia and death. The vast majority of people recover.\n\nOne of the best ways to prevent the spread of the virus is by washing your hands with soap and water. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends first washing with warm or cold water and then lathering soap for 20 seconds to get it on the backs of hands, between fingers and under fingernails before rinsing off.",

The union is asking affiliates in five states -- California, Colorado, Oregon, Washington and Wyoming -- to ask Kroger to keep the \"Hero\" pay.\n\nThe union did not immediately respond to a Fox News request for comment.\n\nWhen Kroger announced the pay bump, Kroger CEO Rodney McMullen said company employees \"displayed the true actions of a hero, working tirelessly on the front lines to ensure everyone has access to affordable, fresh food and essentials during this national emergency,\"\n\nThe chain said the temporary pay raises will end but that workers will be provided other benefits, including COVID-19 testing based on symptoms, emergency leave, paid time off if they are diagnosed with the virus and financial support through the Helping Hands charity.\n\nFour Kroger employees in Detroit died from the virus in April.\n\n\"Our first priority throughout this pandemic has been the safety and health of our associates and customers,\" Kroger said in a statement. \"Since March, we have invested over $700 million to reward associates and safeguard associates, customers and our communities.

Within a week of the video being taken, 21 inmates tested positive for the virus.\n\n\"We had zero positives up until that spike, but that now, also, that has impacted our staffing as well,\" Villanueva said.\n\nThe inmates denied trying to infect themselves when questioned by investigators, he said.\n\nOfficials said an inmate trustee discovered the plot after finding items his fellow prisoners believed would infect them with the disease. The trustee was beaten by other prisoners after he tried to disrupt the scheme, officials told the Los Angeles Times.\n\nThe county has reduced its jail population in the face of the coronavirus crisis. Officials have reported 357 confirmed cases in the Los Angeles jail system, the nation's largest. As of Friday, the jails held more than 11,000 inmates in a system that typically houses around 17,000, Villanueva said.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nMany of those released had less than 30 days remaining on their sentences. Had the jail facilities had per-pandemic populations, the results would have been \"catastrophic,\" Villanueva said.",

There were more than 45,000 cases in California and nearly 1,800 deaths.\n\nSymptoms can be mild or very severe. They primarily include cough, shortness of breath and difficulty breathing, according to the CDC. They can also carry a combination of two or more of the following: fever, chills, headache, sore throat, chills, muscle pain and the loss of taste or smell.\n\nTo reduce the risk of contracting the illness, health experts recommend staying home as often as possible, frequently washing your hands and social distancing by keeping at least 6 feet between yourself and other people.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nAdditionally, both Los Angeles and California have implemented strict coronavirus shutdown restrictions to stifle the contagion's spread.\n\nThey include the closures of nonessential businesses.\n\nSo far, 49 businesses have been charged with violating Los Angeles' stay-at-home order, according to Feuer's office.",

Sign up here.\n\nA 12-year-old girl in Louisiana infected with the novel coronavirus reportedly developed a rare inflammatory syndrome that temporarily stopped her heart. The condition may be the same one that doctors in the United Kingdom and elsewhere have warned is possibly linked to COVID-19 infections in some children.\n\nThree weeks ago, Juliette Daly was in a battle for her life after she was airlifted to Ochsner Medical Center in New Orleans. She tested positive for the novel virus despite not showing any typical symptoms of it, according to local news station WBRZ. She reportedly went into cardiac arrest as doctors worked to insert a breathing tube.\n\nCORONAVIRUS: WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW\n\n\"After they put the breathing tube down her throat, her heart stopped and they had to do extreme measures. They had to do two minutes of CPR. At that point, my whole world just crumbled,\" Jennifer Daly, Juliette's mother, told the outlet. She said her daughter had been \"perfectly\" healthy prior to her hospitalization and is a generally active child.\n\n\"I died for two minutes,\" Juliette said. \"I felt really bad; my stomach would not stop hurting. I didn't want to move; I didn't want to live, I wanted for it all to stop.\"\n\nThe preteen was then diagnosed with a rare inflammatory condition that can lead to high fevers and swollen arteries, similar to Kawasaki disease, or a condition that causes swelling in medium-sized arteries throughout the body. Kawasaki disease, which primarily affects children, often leads to inflammation in the coronary arteries, according to the Mayo Clinic.\n\n\"COVID-19 can infect the heart and it can cause the cells in the heart to be unhappy and actually start to die,\" pediatric cardiologist Dr. Jake Kleinmahon told WBRZ.\n\nThankfully, Juliette is on the mend. Her mother said she is grateful for the quick treatment her daughter received.\n\nThe news comes after British health authorities in a warning to health care professionals over the weekend said that some severely ill pediatric patients in the country -- including some who have tested positive for the coronavirus -- have presented an \"unusual clinical picture\" that includes inflammatory symptoms possibly linked to COVID-19.\n\nThe U.K. Pediatric Intensive Care Society (PICS), citing an email alert from the National Health Service (NHS) England, said in a news release that health officials have reported \"a small rise in the number of cases of critically ill children presenting with an unusual clinical picture,\" or, more specifically, a \"multi-system inflammatory state\" that may be connected to the novel virus.\n\nHOW THE CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC IS AFFECTING CHILDREN WITH AUTISM: 'WE ARE TRYING OUR BEST'\n\n\"The cases have in common overlapping features of toxic shock syndrome and atypical Kawasaki disease with blood parameters consistent with severe COVID-19 in children. Abdominal pain and gastrointestinal symptoms have been a common feature as has cardiac inflammation,\" the NHS notice reads, per PICS.\n\nA similar condition also affected at least three children in New York who have tested positive for the novel virus.",

Many were deemed essential as the crisis escalated over several weeks and the demand basic necessities surged.\n\nSome of the raises increased workers' hourly pay by $2 to $3. Now, many are surprised to learn that the extra pay is going away soon. Kroger is ending its \"Hero Bonus\" May 16. The grocery chain's decision has riled the United Food and Commercial Workers, which represents thousands of grocery employees.\n\n\"The pandemic exposed how little corporations pay many workers, workers on whom the public deeply depends,\" said John Grant, president of UFCW Local 770, in a statement to the Los Angeles Times.\n\n\"With all eyes on essential workers during the pandemic, grocery corporations were quick to capitalize on the good PR of raising wages, but they cannot justify taking them away, especially since they have continued to do business while so many other businesses are closed and their profits are record high,\" he added.\n\nKroger previously told Fox News that it is \"committed to the continued support of our associates' safety and mental well-being\" and provided other benefits to its employees, such as COVID-19 testing based on symptoms, emergency leave and paid time off if workers test positive for the virus.\n\nSeveral grocery stores have seen employees contract the virus nationwide. Four Kroger employees in Detroit died in April from the disease. In Los Angeles County, 21 employees at a Ralphs in Hollywood tested positive for COVID-19, according to the newspaper.\n\nTo combat the pandemic, many stores have installed glass barriers at cashier stations.\n\nAmazon, which has faced a torrent of backlash from its employees over safety protocols, will end its $2 pay raise May 30. The e-commerce giant spent around $800 million to keep employees safe while at work, a spokesperson previously told Fox News.\n\nCVS and Walmart will dole out a second round of bonuses in June for time worked in May, neither has committed to any beyond that, according to the Times.\n\nStarbucks will phase out its $3 pay raise for workers at the end of the month for employees willing to work. The coffee conglomerate began opening most stores May 4, according to a letter from executive vice president Rossann Williams.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nBrianna Rocha, a barista at a Los Angeles Starbucks, told the newspaper that the raise feels like a \"very performative\" gesture.\n\n\"Every company that has given a little bit more in pay is trying to pitch it like it's for heroes and they're grateful for us. But it's not really reflecting as much anymore,\" she said.",

Sign up here.\n\nThe married woman who is at the center of a scandal involving one of Britain's key scientific coronavirus advisers doesn't believe she has done anything wrong because she considers both households to be one, according to reports.\n\nMatt Hancock, Britain's health secretary, admitted Wednesday he was left \"speechless\" after it emerged Neil Ferguson, whose model suggested 250,000 people could die in Britain from coronavirus without drastic action, broke lockdown rules to meet with his married mistress.\n\nHancock said although Ferguson is a \"very eminent and impressive scientist\", he \"took the right decision\" to resign.\n\nHe told Sky News that the social distancing rules \"are there for everyone, they are incredibly important and they are deadly serious. They are the means by which we have managed to get control of this virus.\"\n\nCLICK HERE FOR FULL CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE\n\nFerguson - who was nicknamed \"Professor Lockdown\" amid the pandemic - admitted he \"made an error in judgment and took the wrong course of action\" when he let the 38-year-old woman to his home.\n\n\"I deeply regret any undermining of the clear messages around the continued need for social distancing to control this devasting epidemic,\" he told the Telegraph.\n\nThe woman in question was identified by British media as Antonia Staats, 38, a left-wing campaigner and activist who has a history of criticizing Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Brexit on social media.\n\nUK SCIENTIST WHO PUSHED CORONAVIRUS RESTRICTIONS RESIGNS AFTER REPORTEDLY MEETING MARRIED LOVER\n\nAccording to the Telegraph, she traveled from the home that she shares with her husband and two children at least twice to visit Ferguson - once on March 30 and a second time on April 8.\n\nThe newspaper said she made the second visit despite telling friends she suspected that her husband had COVID-19 symptoms.\n\nStaats, who declined to speak to the Telegraph, is said to be in an open marriage with her husband and that she does not believe her actions to break the lockdown are hypocritical because she considerers the households to be one.\n\nAccording to the Daily Mail, Staats said in a podcast the day after her first visit that the lockdown was putting a \"strain\" on her relationship with her husband.\n\n\"I think it's also a strain on - maybe strained has sounded too negative - but it's an interesting relationship challenge, for Chris [her husband] and my relationship,\" she said according to the Mail.\n\nThe report says Staats grew up in Isny, south Germany, and went to university in Berlin before traveling to London in 2003 to earn a master's degree in Asian politics from the School of Oriental and African studies. Her husband, Chris, is said to work at the university.\n\nAt one point, she worked for Avaaz, a U.S.-based online network that promotes global activism on issues such as climate change, the Daily Mail reported.\n\nPhotos of her uploaded to Flickr show her protesting outside then Prime Minister Thersa May's London office, 10 Downing Street in 2017.\n\nIn March, Ferguson said on Twitter he had tested positive for the virus. He said he developed a \"slight dry but persistent cough\" that later developed into a fever.\n\nHe described it as \"a strong experience - to be infected by the virus one is modelling.\"\n\n\"Still feeling rough, but not awful,\" he wrote at the time.\n\nSCOTLAND'S TOP MEDICAL OFFICIAL RESIGNS AFTER BEING CAUGHT BREAKING HER OWN CORONAVIRUS LOCKDOWN ADVICE\n\nLondon's Metropolitan Police, which has powers to act against those breaching lockdown restrictions, said in a statement to local media that Ferguson's actions were \"plainly disappointing\" but would not pursue the matter. Hancock had suggested that the police may get involved.\n\n\"It is clear in this case that whilst this behavior is plainly disappointing, Professor Ferguson has accepted that he made an error of judgment and has taken responsibility for that,\" a spokeswoman said. \"We, therefore, do not intend to take any further action.\"\n\nThis is the second time a scientific adviser in the U.K. has quit after failing to follow their own advice.\n\nCatherine Calderwood resigned as Scotland's chief medical officer last month for twice traveling from Edinburgh to her second home.\n\nUK CORONAVIRUS DEATH TOLL APPEARS TO OVERTAKE ITALY TO BECOME HARDEST-HIT COUNTRY IN EUROPE\n\nAs one of the founders of the MRC Centre for Global Disease Analysis at Imperial College London, Ferguson's work has been instrumental in shaping public health responses to outbreaks including swine flu, Ebola, and Zika. Ferguson has long advised authorities including the World Health Organization and national governments in Britain, Europe, and the U.S.\n\nOn March 16, Ferguson and colleagues published a paper suggesting that even with some social distancing measures, the U.K. could see 250,000 coronavirus deaths and that the U.S. might have about 1 million deaths.

Gretchen Whitmer on Thursday signed an executive order to extend the state's stay-at-home order through the end of May for nonessential workers while allowing for manufacturing workers to resume work next week.\n\nWhitmer's executive order comes a day after state lawmakers filed a lawsuit to compel her to reopen the economy following her extension of the state's coronavirus emergency declaration. The lawsuit capped off weeks of protests that featured armed demonstrators at the state Capitol.\n\nDespite frustration over an economy in freefall, the Democratic governor cautioned that Michigan is \"not out of the woods yet, but this is an important step forward on our MI Safe Start plan to re-engage our economy safely and responsibly.\"\n\n\"As we continue to phase in sectors of our economy, I will keep working around the clock to ensure our businesses adopt best practices to protect workers from the spread of COVID-19,\" she said. \"When we all keep doing our part, we can reduce the risk of a second wave and re-engage our economy safely and responsibly.\"\n\nUnder Thursday's extension -- Whitmer's fourth overall -- manufacturing facilities are required to implement safety measures that protect their workers from COVID-19. Workers and all other personnel entering a manufacturing facility must have their temperature screened and answer questions regarding symptoms and exposure to people possibly carrying the virus. Facilities must establish dedicated entry points and prohibit all nonessential in-person visits and tours.\n\nAmong manufacturers allowed to resume work on Monday are Michigan's Big 3 auto companies.\n\nThe order's extension through May 28 means that Michiganders cannot leave their home except \"to run critical errands, to engage in safe outdoor activities or go to specified jobs.\"\n\nAll businesses must require their workers to wear masks when they cannot maintain at least 6 feet of separation.\n\nMICHIGAN BARBER TICKETED FOR DEFYING CORONAVIRUS LOCKDOWN SAYS HE'LL WORK UNTIL ARRESTED OR 'JESUS WALKS IN'\n\nWhitmer drew national attention last month for enacting some of the strictest measures to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus.

April 9 revisions to her initial stay-at-home order included bans on visiting friends and relatives or traveling to vacation homes, and halts on sales of items such as furniture and gardening supplies.\n\nIn a podcast interview, she also said abortions should continue in the state during the virus outbreak because the procedures were part of \"life-sustaining\" health care for women.\n\nIn addition, Whitmer came under fire after a no-bid coronavirus-related state contract was awarded to a firm operated by a well-known Democratic consultant who had written that President Trump should \"get coronavirus ASAP.\" Whitmer's office later acknowleged that the contract was awarded without adhering to normal protocols.\n\nMichigan House Speaker Lee Chatfield, R-Levering, explained the point of Friday's planned session in a Twitter message.\n\n\"The House & Senate will convene tomorrow to create a special oversight committee on COVID-19 to examine our government's response,\" he wrote. \"Michigan needs to handle this pandemic seriously yet properly. It's what the people deserve, and we will see that it happens.\"\n\nIn another tweet, Chatfield noted that marijuana, lottery tickets and alcohol had been declared \"essential,\" while lawn care, construction and fishing in a motorized boat had been declared nonessential amid the outbreak.\n\nOn Monday, Whitmer said she would take a 10 percent cut to her $159,300 annual salary and her staffers would take cuts of 5 percent as the state grapples with the financial fallout of the coronavirus shutdowns. She also continued defending the orders she has issued.\n\n\"I know it's not easy, but the price of losing loved ones is what's at stake,\" she said, noting that many people who contract the virus show no symptoms but can still spread it.\n\nThe theme of Thursday's protest in Lansing, the state's capital city, was that many Michiganders who are able to work should be able to do so, Pannebecker said.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR COMPLETE CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE\n\n\"Younger people, healthy people, without putting anybody else in danger, including ourselves, and others in danger, should be able to go back to work,\" Pannebecker told FOX 2.\n\nThe demonstration came eight days after a larger gathering outside the Statehouse called \"Operation Gridlock.\"\n\nAs of late Thursday, Michigan had more than 35,200 confirmed cases of the virus and nearly 3,000 deaths, the Detroit News reported.",

Gretchen Whitmer on Thursday -- the same day reports emerged that she plans to extend the state's coronavirus stay-at-home order by two weeks until May 15.\n\nThe demonstration, dubbed \"Operation Queen's Castle,\" featured an image of Whitmer wearing a crown, FOX 2 of Detroit reported.\n\nMeanwhile, the Michigan Legislature has scheduled a special session for Friday with the goal of creating an oversight committee to review Whitmer's coronavirus orders and possibly strip her of some of her powers, the Detroit Free Press reported.\n\nCritics have accused Whitmer, a 48-year-old first-term Democratic governor, of overstepping her authority with a series of measures intended to stem the spread of coronavirus in the state.

A chart released by during the White House coronavirus task force news briefing by the DHS showed the novel coronavirus dies within two minutes in hot summer humidity while on surfaces and a minute and a half while in the air.\n\nBryan, however, warned that the results from a DHS study were still in the nascent stages and cautioned Americans to continue practicing social distancing and other hygiene measures outlined by the federal government.\n\nEarlier Thursday, Vice President Mike Pence appeared hopeful the pandemic would begin to recede as summer approaches - telling Fox News' Geraldo Rivera it could \"largely\" be \"behind us\" by Memorial Day Weekend.

WGME-TV of Portland, Maine, reported Thursday.\n\nThe expanded list comes as researchers from around the world work to learn more about the deadly pandemic that has infected at least 2.7 million people worldwide and killed nearly 200,000.\n\nThe CDC still warns that older adults and those with underlying medical conditions continue to be at higher risk for serious complications from the virus. Its website says fever, cough, shortness of breath, chills, repeated shaking, muscle pain, headache, sore throat and new loss of taste or smell could all be symptoms that appear between two and 14 days after exposure.

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.\n\nAndre Nnebe hollers over the breeze coming off the bay behind home plate and announces to the group, \"First pitch, 2:10!\"\n\nThe Milwaukee Brewers minor leaguer thanks college catcher Eamonn Lance for showing up because now there can be live batting practice, something Nnebe hasn't done since the coronavirus put a sudden halt on sports.\n\n\"You saved the day,\" Nnebe tells Lance.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM\n\nFor this informal simulated game last week at a noted high school field, the catcher isn't the only player wearing a mask. Nnebe stands in wearing a protective face covering, and same with the guy waiting in the on-deck circle.\n\nNnebe and thousands more players like him are trying any way they can to stay ready amidst the uncertainty of whether there will even be a big league baseball season, let alone anything for the game's lower levels. They are trying to prepare while social distancing from 6 feet apart and without drawing a crowd as California is under a shelter-in-place order.\n\nFor now, for 90 minutes anyway, Nnebe and seven others are in their element again, albeit far different than just six weeks ago.\n\nThey relish talking everything baseball -- the draft, how the ball is carrying, the future. Hearing that familiar crack of the bat is both refreshing and energizing, briefly taking the players' minds off the pressures and all that is going on in the world.\n\nThey got a tip that the gates of Encinal High School's famous Willie Stargell Field were open, and decided to give it a try.\n\n\"This is the closest thing to a game,\" says University of California senior pitcher Jack Delmore, from Alameda. \"I haven't been excited in a while.\"\n\nThree Canadian geese stand in as infielders, playing the shift, no less. Dozens more continuously honk from beyond left field, next to a dirt track that has been closed because of COVID-19, providing an impromptu rooting section.\n\nMultiple resistance bands hang from the chain link fence, cell phones perched on tripods outside the batter's box to capture video.\n\nAfter Nnebe's first round of swings, Joey Wagman walks out to offer a squirt of hand sanitizer to Lance.\n\nNo high-fives. No handshakes. The new norm.\n\nWagman previously pitched in Oakland's farm system, then spent the past two years in independent ball. The right-hander had been set to play for Israel in the Olympics this summer.\n\n\"Need a little break?\" Nnebe asks Lance at one point.\n\n\"Let's keep rolling,\" the Santa Clara catcher replies.\n\nIt's back to work.\n\nWagman shoots video as Delmore pitches. Soon, it's Wagman's turn on the mound. He has a little fun with the hitters: \"Just so you know, I don't throw a cutter. That's a four-seam.\"\n\n\"I feel bad to be a pitcher today. If it gets in the air it's going 50 feet further than it should,\" declares Nick Adgar, a free agent outfielder who had his senior season at Menlo College interrupted.\n\nAdgar plans to play in the Mexican League, where big league veterans Rajai Davis and Bartolo Col\u00f3n were set to be this year.\n\nA day after this workout last Friday, Adgar and Wagman hopped a fence at Lincoln Middle School across town for more hitting work. They always have an eye out for available fields.\n\nThe virus outbreak has forced athletes to get creative.\n\nFor most people, the new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks. Older adults and people with existing health problems can experience severe illness, including pneumonia and death.\n\n\"It's just crazy,\" Adgar says. \"It's the same thing every day so it's stay ready for a date we don't really know when. We should be playing games right now. With the uncertainty, we have to stay as ready as we can.\"\n\nAt 6-feet-6 1/2 and 240 pounds, Nnebe hears people compare his frame to that of New York Yankees slugger Aaron Judge, a star from California's Central Valley.\n\nNnebe, out of Santa Clara University, began his pro career last year and hit four home runs over 34 games in rookie ball for the Brewers.\n\nNnebe and University of Washington right-hander Leo Nierenberg, both from Oakland, played catch at Lincoln Middle School last week, too.\n\nTo get his swings in, Nnebe built a batting cage in the backyard at his house and ordered some basic gym equipment.\n\n\"We've been going to different spots. With everything going on, I think no one really knows what's going to happen,\" Nnebe says. \"It might be big leagues only, it might be minor leagues, it might be nothing at all.\"\n\n\"The guys I work out with it, it's kind of a mix of college and pro,\" he says. \"We're just trying to stay as ready as possible because if it starts back up, you want to be as close to not missing a beat as you can.\"",

Sign up here.\n\nBiotech company Moderna announced on Monday that its potential COVID-19 vaccine produced antibodies in all 45 participants in a trial, a significant milestone in the fight against the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nThe Phase I trial of mRNA-1273 saw all patients receive a 25 microgram, 100 microgram or 250 microgram dose. Fifteen patients were in each group and those who participated in the study received two doses of the potential vaccine via an injection in the upper arm, 28 days apart.\n\nAt day 43, the group that received 25 micrograms, saw the same level of antibodies as people who had recovered from the disease. At day 43, the 100 microgram dose group saw levels of antibodies that \"significantly exceeded the levels\" seen in those who had recovered from the disease, the company added.\n\nEXPERIMENTAL CORONAVIRUS TREATMENT LERONLIMAB RESULTED IN 'REMARKABLE RECOVERIES,' DEVELOPER SAYS\n\nThe Cambridge, Mass.-based biotech said second dose data for the 250 microgram group was not yet available.\n\n\"These interim Phase 1 data, while early, demonstrate that vaccination with mRNA-1273 elicits an immune response of the magnitude caused by natural infection starting with a dose as low as 25 \u00b5g,\" said Tal Zaks, M.D., Ph.D., Chief Medical Officer at Moderna, in a statement. \"When combined with the success in preventing viral replication in the lungs of a pre-clinical challenge model at a dose that elicited similar levels of neutralizing antibodies, these data substantiate our belief that mRNA-1273 has the potential to prevent COVID-19 disease and advance our ability to select a dose for pivotal trials.\"\n\nIn addition, neutralizing antibodies against the novel coronavirus were produced from the vaccine in eight participants, four from the 25 microgram group and four from the 100 microgram group.\n\nModerna also explained mRNA-1273 was \"generally safe and well tolerated,\" though it added there was one person in the 100 microgram group who had redness around the injection site. In the 250 microgram group, three patients had \"grade 3 systemic symptoms, only following the second dose.\"\n\nThe drug from the biotech company, which uses messenger RNA therapeutics and vaccines for its drugs, has gotten some praise from the scientific community, despite still being studied.\n\nIn mid-April, Fox News medical contributor Dr. Marc Siegel appeared on \"Tucker Carlson Tonight\" and spoke briefly about the possible coronavirus vaccine, saying White House Coronavirus Task Force member Dr. Anthony Fauci had said he was optimistic about the process.\n\n\"Tony talked to me about the vaccine development. And he said that the Moderna vaccine that the NIH is looking at is very encouraging,\" Siegel told Carlson. \"And it's about to go out of Phase I trials and soon into Phase II, that's where they really see how effective it is. That's where they look for the manufacturing process by the time it gets to market several months from now.\"\n\nThe Phase I study was led by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and was performed at Kaiser Permanente Washington Health Research Institute in Seattle.\n\nFAUCI 'CAUTIOUSLY OPTIMISTIC' A CORONAVIRUS VACCINE CANDIDATE WILL BE EFFECTIVE\n\nEarlier this month, Moderna announced the FDA had been awarded mRNA-1273 fast-track designation to accelerate the development of an effective COVID-19 vaccine.\n\nIn early May, Moderna announced the FDA approved its COVID-19 vaccine candidate, allowing it to move to Phase II, prior to publishing the Phase I results.\n\nModerna said it anticipates Phase III trials for the 25 and 100 microgram groups to start in July.\n\nShares of the biotech were surging in early Monday trading, up more than 24 percent to $89.47.\n\nCurrently, there is no known scientific cure for the disease known as COVID-19, however, a number of drugs are being tested to see if they can treat it.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR COMPLETE CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE\n\nAs of Monday morning, more than 4.73 million coronavirus cases have been diagnosed worldwide, more than 1.48 million of which are in the U.S., the most impacted country on the planet.",

But virus-related rashes are more typically seen in children, Shinkai said. \"That's why it's much more striking\" to see numerous reports of rashes in adult patients with COVID-19, she said.\n\nExactly how common the rashes are remains unclear. In one early study of more than 1,000 COVID-19 patients in China, published Feb. 28 in the New England Journal of Medicine, rashes were noted in only 0.2 percent of patients. However, in a more recent study of about 150 hospitalized COVID-19 patients in Italy, rashes were found in 20 percent of patients.

Whether this will be the case for COVID-19 patients remains to be seen, the JAMA editorial said.\n\nSo far, a variety of rashes have been noted in COVID-19 patients. A Spanish study published April 29 in the British Journal of Dermatology grouped coronavirus-related rashes into five categories: a \"maculopapular\" rash, or one that's characteristic of viral infections such as measles, with red bumps on reddish skin; a \"urticaria\" rash characteristic of hives; a 'livedo\" rash with a lace-like or fishnet pattern; a \"vesicular eruption\" or blistering rash; and a frostbite-like rash on the toes, unofficially dubbed \"COVID toes.\"\n\nIn addition, one recent case report published April 30 in JAMA Dermatology described the case of a man in Spain who developed \"petechiae,\" or tiny red dots on the skin; and a separate case report, also published in JAMA Dermatology, described a patient in France who developed larger lesions known as a \"digitate papulosquamous eruption.\"\n\nThe timing of rash symptoms with COVID-19 also seems to vary widely -- in some cases, rashes precede symptoms such as fever; in other cases, rashes may appear a few days into the illness or not show up until late in the course of the infection.\n\nRelated: 13 coronavirus myths busted by science\n\nResearch is needed to comprehensively evaluate these rashes and when they occur, Shinkai said. Doctors will also need to examine tissue samples to determine if the virus that causes COVID-19, known as SARS-CoV-2, can be detected in the skin itself, which is the case for some viral illnesses that cause rashes, Shinkai said.\n\nEVEN AFTER RESPIRATORY SYMPTOMS FADE, CORONAVIRUS VICTIMS FACE DANGER\n\nIn addition, the significance of these rashes -- such as whether they are tied to better or worse outcomes for patients -- should also be studied, she said.

Sign up here.\n\nAt least 13 sailors serving aboard the USS Theodore Roosevelt have tested positive for coronavirus a second time, according to reports.\n\nAn unnamed Navy official confirmed Saturday that eight additional sailors serving aboard the aircraft carrier docked in Guam have become infected again after recovering from COVID-19, The Associated Press reported. The Navy official was not authorized to speak publicly and requested anonymity.\n\nIn a statement Friday, the Navy had announced five had tested positive a second time.\n\nAll 13 sailors have again been removed from the ship and are in isolation at the U.S. Naval Base Guam, Politico reported.\n\nAnother sailor was removed from the ship after being diagnosed with tuberculosis, a bacterial infection that affects the lungs and involves similar symptoms to COVID-19, such as coughing, fever and difficulty breathing.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR FULL CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE\n\n\"This week, a small number of TR Sailors who previously tested COVID positive and met rigorous recovery criteria have retested positive,\" Navy spokesperson Cmdr. Myers Vasquez said in a statement, according to Politico. \"These protocols resulted in a small number of close contacts who were also removed from the ship, quarantined and tested. The ship remains on the road to recovery and will prepare to get back underway once a critical mass of crew with the required expertise is onboard.\"\n\n\"In the course of the ship's rigorous infection surveillance, a single active case of TB was identified and diagnosed,\" Vasquez said. \"The individual has been removed from the ship, isolated, and will remain under the direct care of the naval health system until cleared by doctors.\"\n\nAn estimated 1.5 million people died from tuberculosis last year worldwide - more than any other infectious disease. Tuberculosis is considered rare in the United States.\n\nBefore being allowed to return to the ship, all sailors who had previously tested positive for COVID-19 underwent at least two weeks of isolation and had to test negative twice in a row, with the tests separated by at least a day or two.\n\nUSS THEODORE ROOSEVELT SAILOR WHO DIED FROM CORONAVIRUS-RELATED COMPLICATIONS IDENTIFIED\n\nAfter an outbreak was discovered aboard the Roosevelt in March, the ship was forced to dock in Guam and some 4,000 of the 4,800- member crew were sent ashore for either quarantine or isolation.\n\nHundreds of sailors began returning to the ship in coordinated waves earlier this month to prepare to set sail again. That process has been slowed due to the discovery of new cases, which has raised questions about the reintegration of previously infected troops into the ranks.\n\nThe crew members who became infected a second time \"developed influenza-like illness symptoms and did the right thing reporting to medical for evaluation,\" the Navy said in a statement. As of Thursday, more than 2,900 sailors had returned to the ship. More than 1,000 crew members who had tested positive for the coronavirus have since recovered.\n\nThe accuracy of testing itself has also been called into question. Sailors were tested for the virus using nasal swabs. In some cases, an infection can be at such a low level that it is not detected by the test, which could mean no relapses occurred, and those cleared for the virus really had levels too low for detection.\n\nThe Roosevelt made headlines when the ship's captain was relieved of command. Brett Crozier was accused of going \"outside the chain of command\" and leaking a letter to the media in which he raised concerns about more than 200 sailors on the ship who had tested positive for COVID-19.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe ship pulled into Guam on March 27, 10 days early for its scheduled maintenance stop due to the outbreak aboard.\n\nThe Navy has identified one Roosevelt crew member who died in mid-April after becoming infected with the coronavirus. Chief Petty Officer Charles Robert Thacker Jr., 41, of Fort Smith, Ark., died April 13 at U.S. Naval Hospital Guam.\n\nBy late April, the entire crew of the aircraft carrier had been tested for the coronavirus.\n\nFox News' Lucas Tomlinson, Nick Givas and The Associated Press contributed to this report.",

Sign up here.\n\nAt least three children in Connecticut are being treated for a mysterious inflammatory condition that is likely linked to the novel coronavirus. The condition has also been reported in recent weeks in pediatric coronavirus cases in a handful of U.S. states and elsewhere, raising alarm for doctors in New York and California as well as abroad in the United Kingdom.\n\nCORONAVIRUS IN THE US: STATE-BY-STATE BREAKDOWN\n\nConnecticut-based Yale-New Haven Children's Hospital (YNHCH) on Monday announced what is said to be the state's first cases of the pediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome, or PIMS, which doctors have said is similar to Kawasaki disease, or a condition that causes swelling in medium-sized arteries throughout the body.\n\nThe cases have since been reported to the Connecticut Department of Public health, the hospital said in a news release.\n\n\"Unfortunately, this disease carries features of toxic shock syndrome and elements of Kawasaki disease and strikes school-aged children. While these cases are exceptionally rare, given our proximity to New York where there has been a significant number reported, we have been watching their experience closely,\" said Clifford Bogue, physician-in-chief of YNHCH, in a statement.\n\n\"We are working diligently with local and state health officials to address this issue and strongly recommend that children who may be suffering from symptoms seek early referrals to pediatric infectious disease specialists, rheumatologists, or cardiologists,\" he added.\n\nSigns of the mysterious condition include persistent fever, rash, and gastrointestinal symptoms such as vomiting and diarrhea. Cardiac inflammation has also occurred in cases of PIMS, as has a swollen, red tongue.\n\nThe cases were also announced by Gov. Ned Lamont during his daily press briefing on Monday, the Hartford Courant reported. He noted the children are \"doing OK\" and are responding to anti-inflammatory treatments.\n\n\"It seems to be [that] the immune system is hyper-reactive and has an increased response to the virus, such that it doesn't shut down,\" Dr. Thomas Murray, the associate medical director in infection prevention at Yale-New Haven Children's Hospital, said at the news conference, as per the outlet. \"We all need that inflammation to help us get rid of infections but then the body shuts it down and that's how we get better. But something is triggering in these kids -- it seems to be happening later in their experience with the virus -- the inflammation to not shut down.\"\n\nThe news comes after British health authorities, in a warning to health care professionals in late April, said that some severely ill pediatric patients in the country -- including some who were positive for the coronavirus -- presented an \"unusual clinical picture\" that included inflammatory symptoms possibly linked to COVID-19.\n\nThe U.K. Pediatric Intensive Care Society (PICS), citing an email alert from the National Health Service (NHS) in England, said in a news release that health officials had reported \"a small rise in the number of cases of critically ill children presenting with an unusual clinical picture\" at the time. More specifically, it is a \"multi-system inflammatory state\" that may be connected to the novel virus.\n\n\"The cases have in common overlapping features of toxic shock syndrome and atypical Kawasaki disease with blood parameters consistent with severe COVID-19 in children. Abdominal pain and gastrointestinal symptoms have been a common feature as has cardiac inflammation,\" the NHS notice reads, per PICS.\n\nSince then, at least three young children in New York have died after being hospitalized with the rare Kawasaki disease-like illness, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Saturday.\n\nThe condition has also affected several patients at Children's Hospital Los Angeles in California, as well as at least one child in Louisiana and at least three children in Washington, D.C.\n\nA 6-month-old who was hospitalized in California with Kawasaki disease last month also tested positive for COVID-19, Reuters reported at the time.\n\nCLICK FOR COMPLETE COVERAGE OF THE CORONAVIRUS OUTBREAK\n\nDr. Jacqueline Szmuszkovicz, a pediatric cardiologist at Children's Hospital Los Angeles, recently said that children who have a fever that lasts for four or more days should seek medical attention.\n\n\"Certainly, if they see any of the other signs -- the rash, the red tongue, red eyes -- we encourage them to seek care,\" she told The Los Angeles Times.",

Sign up here.\n\nDr. Craig Spencer reacted Thursday on \"America's Newsroom\" to a new study revealing that most of the people in New York City who were hospitalized due to coronavirus had one or more underlying health issues.\n\nHealth records from 5,700 patients hospitalized within the Northwell Health system -- which housed the most patients in the country throughout the pandemic -- showed that 94 percent of patients had more than one disease other than COVID-19, according to the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA).\n\nSpencer, the director of Global Health and Emergency Medicine at New York-Presbyterian Columbia University Medical Center, said it's been known for weeks that people with underlying health issues like high blood pressure, obesity and diabetes are at a much greater risk for complications.\n\nUS OFFICIALS CONFIRM FULL-SCALE INVESTIGATION OF WHETHER CORONAVIRUS ESCAPED FROM WUHAN LAB\n\nHe said the study reinforces how serious the virus could be if it spreads throughout the country since so many Americans suffer from these conditions. Spencer said there is no guarantee a vaccine will be ready any time soon.\n\nSpencer said that there is also a concern for people with life-threatening issues that may be avoiding the emergency room or a doctor because they may be assuming that coronavirus patients are the focus or don't want to be exposed to the virus.\n\n\"We're going to have a lot of people with these strokes, with heart attacks, with other emergencies that will either continue to have complications that worsen or, maybe in fact, die at home,\" he said.\n\nMeanwhile, COVID-19, the disease-causing the coronavirus pandemic, has largely been associated with symptoms such as fatigue, a persistent cough, fevers and, recently, lesions. However, it may also cause strokes in patients under 50.\n\nIn an interview with CNN, Mount Sinai Health System neurosurgeon Dr. Thomas Oxley said the virus is causing clots in arteries, resulting in \"severe strokes.\"\n\n\"Our report shows a seven-fold increase in the incidence of sudden stroke in young patients during the past two weeks,\" Dr. Oxley added. \"Most of these patients have no past medical history and were at home with either mild symptoms (or in two cases, no symptoms) of COVID.\"\n\nCLICK HERE FOR FULL CORONAVIRUS MAP\n\nIt's possible the patients, who are in their 30s and 40s and have mild symptoms associated with the disease, are less likely to seek urgent medical care and call 911 because of the influx of COVID-19 patients.\n\nDr. Oxley and colleagues tested five patients at the hospital, all with mild symptoms, and noted that they all tested positive for the virus, with two delaying in calling an ambulance.\n\nSpencer, the first Ebola patient in New York City and the fourth in the country in 2014, said there needs to be more data showing how much blood clots are tied to coronavirus. He noted that coronavirus has caused \"blood clotting.\"\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nSpencer also said that this has been a concern for the past couple of weeks.\n\n\"Really, this is a long-term complication and, potentially, a mortality concern for a lot of patients who aren't coming [to the hospital],\" he concluded.",

Sign up here.\n\nNearly 70 residents sickened with the coronavirus have died at a Massachusetts home for aging veterans, as state and federal officials try to figure out what went wrong in the deadliest known outbreak at a long-term care facility in the U.S.\n\nWhile the death toll at the state-run Holyoke Soldiers' Home continues to climb, federal officials are investigating whether residents were denied proper medical care and the state's top prosecutor is deciding whether to bring legal action.\n\n\"It's horrific,\" said Edward Lapointe, whose father-in-law lives at the home and had a mild case of the virus. \"These guys never had a chance.\"\n\nAT MASSACHUSETTS VETERANS' HOME, CORONAVIRUS OUTBREAK AND 32 DEATHS PROMPTS FEDERAL PROBE\n\nSixty-eight veteran residents who tested positive for the virus have died, officials said Tuesday, and it's not known whether another person who died had COVID-19. Another 82 residents and 81 employees have tested positive.\n\nThe home's superintendent, who's been placed on administrative leave, has defended his response and accused state officials of falsely claiming they were unaware of the scope of the problem there.\n\nThe superintendent, Bennett Walsh, said earlier this month state officials knew that the home was in \"crisis mode\" when it came to staffing shortages and were notified early and often about the contagion at the facility.\n\nStaffing problems that plagued the home for years contributed to the virus spreading like wildfire, said Joan Miller, a nurse at the home.\n\nBecause staffing was so tight, workers from one unit were constantly moving to other units to help out -- and bringing their germs with them, she said. At one point, a unit was shut down because there wasn't enough staff to operate it, and those veterans were moved into close quarters in other parts of the building, she said.\n\n\"Veterans were on top of each other,\" she said. \"We didn't know who was positive and who was negative and then they grouped people together and that really exacerbated it even more,\" said Miller, who spoke through a mask during a break from her job at the facility.\n\n\"That's when it really blew up,\" she said.\n\nMASSACHUSETTS GOVERNOR EXTENDS STAY-AT-HOME ORDER UNTIL MAY 18\n\nThe situation is now \"somewhat contained\" because there are so few veterans living there, Miller said. There were nearly 230 residents living at the home in late March and only about 100 remained on Monday, The Boston Globe reported.\n\nFor most people, the coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough, that clear up in two to three weeks. For some, especially older adults and the infirm, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia.\n\nBeth Lapointe said her father's roommate tested positive for the virus in March -- and later died -- but her father was initially denied a test because he didn't show any symptoms. As the virus spread, family members were kept in the dark about what was going on inside, she said.\n\n\"Every day I would ask different people, 'What's going on in there?' And I would never get information,\" she said.\n\nRepublican Gov. Charlie Baker's administration has hired an outside attorney to conduct an investigation into the deaths. Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey is also investigating to determine \"what went wrong at this facility and determine if legal action is warranted.\"\n\nAnd the U.S. attorney's office in Massachusetts and the Department of Justice's Civil Rights Division are looking into whether the home violated residents' rights by failing to provide them proper medical care.\n\nThe death toll at the home appears to be the largest at a long-term care facility in the United States, experts said.\n\n\"It's also symbolic of how unprepared many nursing facilities have been,\" said Dr. Michael Wasserman, president of the California Association of Long Term Care Medicine.\n\n\"Geriatricians and experts in long-term care medicine were sounding alarms at the beginning of March and we've essentially been ignored by everyone. Federal, state, local government and the nursing home industry,\" he said.\n\nThere is currently no official count of nursing home deaths across the country. The federal government has only recently required the nation's more than 15,000 nursing homes to start reporting numbers of confirmed and presumed deaths and infections, but it is not yet clear when that count will be published.\n\nIn the meantime, The Associated Press has been compiling its own tally from state health departments and media reports, finding at least 13,762 deaths from outbreaks in nursing homes and long-term care facilities across the country.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE\n\nBut that is also likely an undercount because only about half the states are currently reporting nursing home deaths and not all count those who died without ever being tested for COVID-19.",

    "New MLB rules: Shower at home, don't spit, Mr Met stay away": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "National Baseball Writer for the Wall Street Journal, Jared Diamond, discusses the status of the 2020 season.\n\nMajor League Baseball will look somewhat like high school ball this year under protocols to deal with the new coronavirus, with showers at ballparks discouraged and players possibly arriving in uniform, like they did when they were teenagers.\n\nTeam personnel will be banned from eating at restaurants on road trips.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM\n\nEven the Phillie Phantic and Mr. Met will be missing, banned from the field along with all other team mascots.\n\nThe traditional exchange of lineup cards would be eliminated, along with high-fives, fist bumps, and bat boys and girls, according to a 67-page draft of Major League Baseball's proposed 2020 Operations Manual. A copy was sent to teams Friday and obtained by The Associated Press. The guidelines, first reported by The Athletic, are subject to negotiation with the players' association.\n\nTeams will be allowed to have 50 players each under the plan, with the number active for each game still be negotiated.\n\nSpitting is prohibited along with water jugs and the use of saunas, steam rooms, pools and cryotherapy chambers. Hitting in indoor cages is discouraged, batting gloves encouraged.\n\nBatting practice pitchers are to wear masks, dugout telephones disinfected after each use. Players may not touch their face to give signs, and they're not allowed to lick their fingers. Teams are encouraged to hold meetings outdoors, players spread apart.\n\nTeams were asked to respond with their suggested input by May 22. The protocols were written by MLB senior vice presidents Patrick Houlihan, Bryan Seeley and Chris Young, and vice president Jon Coyles. Young is a former pitcher who retired after the 2017 season.\n\nProtocols include details on testing for team staff, who are divided into three tiers. All others may not enter clubhouses, dugouts and the field.\n\nSeats in the empty stands near the dugout should be used to maintain distance, according to diagrams in the manual, and the next day's starting pitcher can't sit in the dugout. Everyone must keep their distance during \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" and \"God Bless America,\"\n\nFielders are \"encouraged to retreat several steps away from the baserunner\" between pitches. First and third base coaches are not to approach baserunners or umpires, and players should not socialize with opponents.\n\nManagers and coaches must wear masks while in the dugouts. The entire traveling party -- including players -- must wear personal protective equipment while on buses and flights. Restaurants are off limits on the road, including the ones in hotels, as are hotel fitness centers.\n\n\"We emphasize that this is a first draft, and will undergo several rounds of changes as we collect comments and suggestions from the clubs, the players' association, players, and government officials,\" deputy commissioner Dan Halem wrote in an email to owners, team presidents and CEOs, and general managers that accompanied the protocols.\n\n\"The document is designed to set minimum standards and identify best practices, but we have attempted to provide clubs with enough flexibility to achieve the desired health and safety objectives in a manner that is tailored to their particular circumstances, including ballpark configuration, location, and the nature of any local governmental regulations or restrictions,\" Halem wrote.\n\nScoreboard video is prohibited but music allowed. While there won't be fans, at least not at the start, it will provide a familiar background audio for the telecasts critical to MLB's bottom line.\n\nA ball will be thrown away after it is touched by multiple players, and throwing the ball around the infield will be discouraged. Personnel who rub baseballs with mud for the umpires must use gloves.\n\n\"Individuals must avoid any physical interactions (such as high-fives, fist bumps, or hugs) while at club facilities,\" the manual says.\n\nTier 1 people in the plan include players, managers and coaches plus two each from among physicians, athletics trainers and bullpen catchers plus one strength and conditioning coach.\n\nTier 2 includes clubhouse staff, additional coaches, medical and training staff, traveling staff, owners, front office, translators, communications staff, video personnel, the head groundskeeper and security plus players' union and MLB staff along with contractors.\n\nTier 3 covers broadcast personnel and other event services.\n\nPlayers must wear masks while in restricted areas \"except while on the field or engaging in other strenuous activities\" and lockers must have at least 6 feet between them. If needed, temporary clubhouse space will be added, preferably outdoors or areas with better ventilation.\n\n\"Showering in club facilities should be discouraged,\" the plan says. \"To the extent showering occurs, clubs should explore modifications to facilities to allow for physical distancing and hygiene\" such as installing partitions and limiting the number of players using the showers at the same time.\n\nTeams \"should consider requiring (on-field staff) to arrive at club facilities dressed for the day's activities in order to limit time spent in the clubhouse or locker room.\"\n\nOnly medical personnel allowed near injured players.\n\nThere will be staggered reporting dates for the resumption of spring training. When pitchers and catchers arrive, only five players may work out at a time. Then come full team workouts, with small groups encouraged but not required, followed by exhibition games. There will be intake screening upon arrival followed a self-quarantine for 24-48 hours until results are available. Players not assigned to big league team when the season starts will remain at spring training or another separate facility.\n\nAll games at spring training facilities in Florida and Arizona, whether exhibition or regular season, must be scheduled for 7-9 p.m. local time unless MLB gives specific consent.\n\nA fifth umpire would be allowed when the temperature reaches a certain level, allowing for rotation, including sharing of plate umpire duties, Teams should take batting practice on back fields.\n\n-- Private airports encouraged and if not available, teams are to use private aviation facilities to board and exit.\n\n-- Transportation Security Administration screen should take place at ballparks if it can be arranged.\n\n-- In-flight catering is limited.\n\n-- Lower floors are to be used if possible at hotels, so stairs can be used instead of elevators, and private areas arranged for entrances, exits and check-in.\n\n-- Six staggered bus trips will be scheduled to and from the ballpark.\n\nTeam staff, including players, will be given thermometers for self screening and are to take two tests in quick succession each morning.\n\nAt the ballpark, people will be given temperature checks twice a day and multiple fluid swabs each week. Comprehensive Drug Testing will collect samples and Sports Medicine Research and Testing Laboratory in Salt Lake City is to provide results within 24 hours.\n\nFamily members of players, umpires and the households of anyone covered under the plan will be offered access to testing and PPE. The individuals are encouraged to avoid crowd when away from ballpark.\n\nAnyone with a temperature of 100 or higher or who exhibits COVID-19 symptoms or has come in contact with someone confirmed to be infected will be subject to rapid testing at a nearby site. A person cannot rejoin the team until testing negative twice in tests taken at least 24 hours apart. The person also must not exhibit symptoms or COVID-19, and the team physician and MLB medical staff must determine the person not at risk.\n\nIf an individual is exposed to a person with an infection, that person must show no signs of disease, be tested daily for at least seven consecutive days and undergo more frequent temperature checks. The person also must wear a mask at all times except while on the field.\n\nEach spring training and regular season ballpark must have dedicated testing and isolation areas. MLB also will offer testing of people who live in same household as covered individuals and to health care workers/first responders in big league cities.\n\nMost tests will take saliva but there may be oral or nasal swabs. Blood samples will be collected less frequently for serology testing used to detect antibodies.",

        "body": "New York facing criticism for unused field hospital beds and ventilators; former New York Governor George Pataki reacts.\n\nGet all the latest news on coronavirus and more delivered daily to your inbox. Sign up here.\n\nNew York State is reporting more than 1,700 previously undisclosed deaths at nursing homes and adult care facilities as the state faces scrutiny over how it has protected vulnerable residents during the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nAt least 4,813 people have died from COVID-19 in the state's nursing homes since March 1, according to a tally released by Gov. Andrew Cuomo's administration late Monday that, for the first time, includes people believed to have been killed by the coronavirus before their diagnoses could be confirmed by a lab test.\n\nExactly how many nursing home residents have died remains uncertain despite the state's latest disclosure, as the list doesn't include nursing home residents who were transferred to hospitals before dying.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR FULL CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE\n\nThe revised list shows that 22 nursing homes, largely in New York City and Long Island, have reported at least 40 deaths.\n\nParker Jewish Institute in Queens and Isabella Geriatric Center -- one of New York City's largest nursing homes with 705 beds -- have reported the highest number of deaths: 71 and 64, respectively.\n\nAudrey Waters, a spokeswoman for Isabella Geriatric Center, said in an email last week, \"Isabella, like all other nursing homes in New York City, initially had limited access to widespread and consistent in-house testing to quickly diagnose our residents and staff. This hampered our ability to identify those who were infected and asymptomatic, despite our efforts to swiftly separate anyone who presented symptoms.\"\n\nIn many cases, the state's new figures reveal many more deaths than previously reported at nursing homes: Isabella Geriatric Center had 13 COVID-19 deaths reported as of May 1, and now reports the deaths of 21 patients who were confirmed to have COVID-19 along with 43 deaths of residents presumed to have COVID-19. And Ozanam Hall of Queens now is reporting a total of 53 deaths, up from just 10.\n\nNYPD OFFICERS SAY CORONAVIRUS SOCIAL DISTANCING POLICING NEEDS TO END\n\nSeveral veterans homes have been especially hard-hit by the virus: The Long Island State Veterans Home has reported 53 deaths, including 48 confirmed and five presumed COVID-19 deaths. The New York State Veterans Home at St. Albans in Queens has reported 33 deaths while New York State Veterans Home at Montrose in Westchester says 22 residents have died.\n\nCuomo promised on March 2, when only a handful of coronavirus cases had been reported in New York, to make a \"special effort\" for nursing homes and congregate homes housing senior citizens. The state directed nursing homes to screen visitors and consider modifying visiting hours on March 6, and later suspended visits to nursing homes statewide March 12.\n\nBut the governor is facing criticism over his administration's role in overseeing and supporting New York's overwhelmed, state-regulated nursing homes as many have struggled to treat COVID-19 patients or amass enough personal protective gear or ensure adequate staffing.\n\n15 CHILDREN IN NEW YORK CITY HOSPITALIZED WITH MYSTERY AILMENT LINKED TO CORONAVIRUS: REPORT\n\nAdvocacy groups for the elderly and family members of nursing home residents have called for greater transparency over COVID-19 cases at each state-regulated nursing home and criticized an April 1 state law granting some immunity to hospitals and nursing homes from civil and criminal liability. They also questioned the state's March 25 policy that says \"no resident shall be denied re-admission or admission to a nursing home solely based on a confirmed or suspected diagnosis of COVID-19.\"\n\nThe governor and his administration have defended that policy as ensuring nursing home residents aren't left lingering in hospitals or without anywhere else to go. Cuomo's spokesman tweeted Monday that the policy follows federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services guidance. But the federal guidance says only that a nursing home \"can accept a resident diagnosed with COVID-19\" so long as the nursing home can follow federal guidance on transmission precautions.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nCuomo has also said the state has facilities that can house transferred COVID-19 nursing home patients, and he recently said that nursing homes that tell the state up-front that they can't care for a COVID-19 patient wouldn't face regulatory scrutiny. His administration hasn't responded to a request for questions on the state's current capacity to care for COVID-19 nursing home residents and whether nursing homes were informed.",

        "authors": [],
        "body": "A mutation in the novel coronavirus mirrors a change that occurred in the genetically similar SARS virus in 2003 -- indicating that the bug might be weakening, researchers announced in a newly published study.\n\nLead study author Dr. Efren Lim, an assistant professor at Arizona State University's Biodesign Institute, and his team use a new technology called next-generation sequencing to rapidly read the genetic code of the coronavirus, referred to scientists as SARS-CoV-2.\n\nThat technology helps researchers to determine how the virus is spreading, mutating and adapting over time.\n\nOut of the 382 nasal swab samples the researchers examined from coronavirus patients in the state, a single sample was missing a significant chunk of its genome. Eighty-one of the letters were permanently deleted, according to the new study published in the Journal of Virology.\n\n\"One of the reasons why this mutation is of interest is because it mirrors a large deletion that arose in the 2003 SARS outbreak,\" Lim said in a statement.\n\nDuring the middle and late phases of the 2003 SARS epidemic, the virus accumulated mutations that lessened its strength, according to the researchers.\n\n\"Where the deletion occurs in the genome is pretty meaningful because it's a known immune protein which means it counteracts the host's antiviral response,\" Lim told the Daily Mail.\n\nA weakened virus that causes less severe symptoms may get a leg up if it is able to spread efficiently through populations by people who don't know they are infected, the scientists say.\n\nHowever, it's too soon to say whether the novel coronavirus is beginning to lose its potency, according to the researchers.\n\nAll of the patients whose samples the Arizona scientists analyzed had some clinical coronavirus symptoms -- meaning that even the version with 81 deletions was still strong enough to make the patient at least somewhat sick, the Mail reported.\n\nThis is the first time such a deletion has been seen in the 16,000 coronavirus genomes that have been sequenced to date, according to the researchers.\n\nThat's less than half a percent of the strains circulating, according to the scientists. There are about 3.6 million confirmed COVID-19 cases worldwide.\n\n\"This is a drop in the bucket,\" Lim told the Mail.\n\n\"One sample is the convincing thing we need to say \"look at this,\"' meaning that if more coronavirus genomes are sequenced, scientists might find far more instances of this attenuated genome,\" he said.",

This may be because cytokine storm is less likely in children,\" said David Waters, emeritus professor of cardiology at UCSF and assistant principal investigator for the UCSF study site, in a statement.\n\nIn order to allow for patients to participate while still observing isolation protocols, the research team has proposed a \"no contact\" study. Patients can apply for the trial by phone and if they're eligible, they will sign informed consent documents accessible via cell phone or computer.

Sign up here.\n\nAs Americans know all too well, the coronavirus pandemic has forced government at all levels - federal, state, and local - to impose protective measures that amounted to a national shutdown. Many of the measures have been necessary, but they have also been devastating.\n\nSince March 14, an astounding 26.5 million Americans have applied for unemployment benefits. The unemployment rate, which was 3.5 percent in February, will likely be in the double digits in April.\n\nAnd it will take time for these workers to return to the labor force. Many will not be able to go back to their old jobs. Too many families and businesses will continue to struggle, through no fault of their own.\n\nDR. WILLIAM HASELTINE: CORONAVIRUS -- REOPENING AMERICA WILL REQUIRE THIS KEY THING THAT'S BEEN IGNORED\n\nUnderstandably, some governors want to begin to reopen their states. President Trump has unveiled federal guidelines for them to do so.\n\nThe three-phase plan recommends that states and localities show a two-week \"downward trajectory\" of coronavirus symptoms and documented cases before beginning to ease lockdowns. Simultaneously, hospitals should be able to treat all patients without crisis care and have robust testing in place.\n\nAs America begins the process of reopening, we need to have a plan. So I thought it would be helpful to hear from someone who is not only designing such a plan, but is also in a position to influence policy at the highest level.\n\nIn this week's episode of my podcast \"Newt's World\" I speak with Larry Kudlow, the director of the National Economic Council. As President Trump's top economic adviser, there is no one better qualified to discuss this issue.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nKudlow, like me, is a strong believer in supply-side economics, which maintains that focusing on incentives for businesses, especially lower taxes and fewer regulations, creates more wealth, more jobs and more opportunities.\n\nThis framework was astonishingly successful for the first three years under President Trump, leading to strong, consistent economic growth and historically low unemployment rates. Only when the pandemic hit did the economy slow down, and Kudlow's job is to get us back to the pre-coronavirus economy.\n\nThe economic model of limiting government's role and prioritizing incentives has worked well for past presidents, including Ronald Reagan, and can succeed for President Trump.\n\nMay will be an important transitional month from a shutdown to a gradual reopening, and the key will be to let the free enterprise system flourish to create rapid economic growth.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nI hope you will listen to this week's episode to learn more specifically how we can revive American society after the pandemic. It is critical to hear what our president's top economic adviser is advising at this pivotal moment for our country.\n\nI also hope you will listen to the next episode of my ongoing series on health care breakthroughs during the coronavirus pandemic, which is set to air this coming week.\n\nTo read, hear, and watch more of Newt Gingrich's commentary, visit Gingrich360.com.",

The three deaths (reported so far by the Ministry of Health) came from outside and nobody within the country has been contaminated,\" \u00c1lvarez said.\n\nDespite his offer of free tickets, only about a tenth of the 8,000 seats in Managua's Alexis Arg\u00fcello gym appeared to be filled.

However, she explained that the nurses have been helping her FaceTime with him and she's noticed a big improvement in his mental status.\n\nHOW CORONAVIRUS DIFFERS FROM FLU: SYMPTOMS TO WATCH FOR\n\n\"He's doing well. Mental status is really coming along which is fantastic,\" she told her followers. \"We're still dealing with a lot of infection in his lungs so that is the overlying issue at the moment. Infection in his lungs that we just have to get under control for Nick so that he can fully get the ventilator out of the trach and get off the ventilator and he can also get off dialysis. So, we're just waiting for that.\"\n\nShe added: \"You know, the doctors and nurses are doing the best they can. They're amazing and every day they're on top of this lung situation so that it doesn't become anything other than just getting rid of the infection that's already there.\"\n\nWhile the improvement is slow, she notes that she and their 11-month-old son, Elvis, are finally able to communicate with Cordero for the first time in weeks.\n\nQUESTIONS ABOUT CORONAVIRUS? ASK AN EXPERT\n\n\"He says he recognizes me,\" Kloots said. \"So if we ask him a yes or no question, this is how we're communicating -- yes, he looks up; no, he looks down. The other day, I asked the nurse, I was like, 'Can he see me over FaceTime?' and she said, \"Ask him.' And so I said, 'Nick, can you see me?' And he looked right up. So I think he can. And when I put Elvis on the FaceTime, his eyes get really big and he seems very, very alert.\"\n\nAlthough Nick is unable to do more than move his eyes at this point, she says his eyes \"light up\" every time she puts Elvis on the screen.\n\nWhile his mental status is improving, there's unfortunately still a long road ahead before they can be reunited because of the pandemic. Kloots explained that the hospital is under strict new guidelines about visitors, even though she's tested negative for COVID-19. Although she's continually heaping praise on the medical staff working on her husband, Kloots says the hardest part of the situation is not being there to see him through this confusing time.\n\n\"I can't imagine.

Specifically, she said that it's hard to tell if he knows that he had to have his leg amputated.",

Dr. David Battinelli, Senior VP and Chief Medical Officer of Northwell Health, says there needs to be a controlled trial before it can be deemed effective.\n\nGet all the latest news on coronavirus and more delivered daily to your inbox. Sign up here.\n\nGene Bad Hawk phoned loved ones on May 5 asking for prayers before entering the hospital for the fourth time due to complications from coronavirus.\n\nIn the 20 days since the North Dakota man's diagnosis, he suffered from high fevers, persistent headaches, nausea, diarrhea and had hardly any appetite, according to the Duluth News Tribune. Then Bad Hawk became dehydrated and lost 26 pounds.\n\nOn the fourth visit, Bad Hawk's conditions worsened, with low blood-oxygen levels and shortness of breath.\n\nGiven his low blood-oxygen levels, doctors at Essentia Health decided to administer a convalescent plasma transfusion with neutralizing antibodies to help fight the disease, according to the news outlet.\n\nCORONAVIRUS SURVIVOR HAD TO HAVE PANDEMIC EXPLAINED TO HIM AFTER COMA, DAUGHTER SAYS\n\nBad Hawk said he felt a little better the next morning, and at the end of the day he reportedly felt good enough to eat his first meal in 10 days. He was discharged on May 8, and 11 days later he told the outlet he didn't have any symptoms.\n\nBad Hawk credits the treatment with saving his life.\n\nThe experimental plasma treatment is only administered to coronavirus patients with low blood oxygen levels, Dr. Karol Kremens, pulmonologist and director of the intensive care unit at Essentia Health, told the Duluth News Tribune. While some initial treatments have been encouraging, there is no clear proof the treatment is effective, Kremens said.\n\nGLOBAL CORONAVIRUS CASES SURPASS 5 MILLION\n\nOf six patients who received plasma donations at Essentia Health in Fargo, N.D., two died, Kremens told the news outlet. Health officials in Fargo work with Vitalant, a nonprofit blood bank that serves the region's hospitals.\n\nSeveral reports surfaced in late April of critically ill coronavirus patients recovering after plasma treatments as well, like two patients in New Jersey who were the first to undergo the treatment statewide.\n\nPrior to the transfusion, the patients -- Renee Bannister, 63, and Andy Fei, 61 -- required a ventilator and the prognosis for both was \"grim,\" according to a statement from Virtua Health. Bannister saw improvement almost immediately; her oxygen flow improved within hours after the plasma donation, and within five days her vital signs returned to normal ranges. Bannister was removed from the ventilator after 11 days and was moved to a rehabilitation center before making her way home.\n\nFei was taken off the ventilator about nine days after receiving the plasma donation, according to the doctor who treated him, Dr. Eric Sztejman.\n\nSimilarly, a Massachusetts patient in critical care from coronavirus-related complications improved within a few hours after the plasma donation. Previously, the patient had relied on maximum support from a ventilator.\n\nDuluth News Tribune said the plasma treatment is \"viewed as an interim treatment\" while the search for an effective vaccine against COVID-19 continues.\n\nFox News' Madeline Farber contributed to this report.",

Feeling particularly exhausted this morning,\" said Marilyn Freeman, a registered nurse at Long Island's Huntington hospital, in Fox Nation's \"COVID Diaries.\" \"I think just all of the emotional and physical exhaustion is starting to really set in.\"\n\nIn \"COVID Diaries,\" doctors and nurses documented their day-to-day experiences treating patients and coping with the extreme strain of the ongoing pandemic.\n\nSoon after Freeman recorded that testimonial for Fox Nation, she lost her sense of taste and smell -- a potential warning sign of infection.\n\nFreeman works on the oncology floor of the hospital, treating cancer patients with compromised immune systems. She is particularly careful to avoid becoming a danger to her own patients, so she decided to get herself tested.\n\nThroughout the series, health care workers have expressed similar concerns over becoming a threat to the people that they are trying to save.\n\n\"When you go into their room, you can, for the first time ever, potentially take something from a patient's room and give it to a non-COVID patient and kill them...

Sign up here.\n\nAs residents at a nursing home in Kirkland, Washington, began dying in late February from a coronavirus outbreak that would eventually take 43 lives, there was little sign of trouble at the Cobble Hill Health Center, a 360-bed facility in an upscale section of Brooklyn.\n\nIts Facebook page posted a cheerful story encouraging relatives to quiz their aging loved ones about their lives, and photos of smiling third-graders at a nearby school making flower arrangements for residents.\n\nThat quickly changed. By the middle of March, the CEO began sending increasingly alarmed emails about banning visitors, screening staff, confining residents, wiping down all surfaces, and having all-hands-on-deck meetings to prepare everyone for the coming coronavirus \"freight train.\"\n\nSHAKE SHACK MAKES BIG DONATION TO HELP FEED NYC CORONAVIRUS HEALTH WORKERS\n\n\"I'll be darned if I'm not going to do everything in my power to protect them,\" Donny Tuchman wrote before things got worse. More than 100 staffers, nearly a third of the workforce, went out sick. Those left began wearing garbage bags because of a shortage of protective gear. Not a single resident has been able to get tested for the virus to this day.\n\nNow listed with 55 deaths it can only assume were caused by COVID-19, among the most of any such facility in the country, Cobble Hill Health Center has become yet another glaring example of the nation's struggle to control the rapid spread of the coronavirus in nursing homes that care for the most frail and vulnerable.\n\nCobble Hill's grim toll surpasses not only Kirkland's but the 49 deaths at a home outside of Richmond, Virginia, 48 dead at a veteran's home in Holyoke, Mass., and five other homes in outer boroughs of New York City that have at least 40 deaths each.\n\nOut of an Associated Press tally of 8,003 nursing home deaths nationwide, a third of them are in New York state.\n\nAP interviews with friends and relatives who have visited the Cobble Hill Health Center in recent weeks, as well as the home's own statements, paint a picture of a facility overwhelmed and unequipped to deal with its coronavirus outbreak, with shortages of staff, personal protective equipment and the availability of reliable testing.\n\n\"They were under siege,\" said Daniel Arbeeny, who brought his ailing 88-year-old father from a hospital to the home in late March. \"They were doing the best they could, as far as we could tell at arm's length, under siege.\"\n\nCORONAVIRUS OUTBREAK SEES SURGE IN RECKLESS DRIVING ON AMERICA'S EMPTY ROADWAYS\n\nTuchman told the AP on Sunday that he believes many other homes have more deaths than Cobble Hill but his has been singled out for its honesty. He said it responded to the state's voluntary survey with cases in which it was \"possible\" COVID-19 could be a factor, since his home wasn't able to test any due to the lack of available kits. He also said he reported 50 deaths, not 55, though the state repeated that tally Sunday.\n\n\"There's been a lot of lip service about how vulnerable nursing homes have been, and everyone has the best intentions, but it didn't materialize,\" Tuchman said. \"The PPE didn't materialize, the staffing surge didn't materialize, the testing didn't materialize. ... How did we expect this not to spread?\"\n\nThough Tuchman doesn't know for sure how the virus got into Cobble Hill, he noted there has been a parade of paramedics and staffers allowed into the building each day who were screened with health questions and temperature checks, not enough to keep out those who are sick but not showing symptoms.\n\nSoon after news broke of Cobble Hill's death toll, Steven Vince went there to talk to administrators about his recently passed uncle, whose death certificate listed him possibly having COVID. An administrator told him they were confident his uncle did not have the virus.\n\n\"It's very surprising because I don't think anyone from the facility contacted us to tell us anything like this or basically bring this to our attention in any way,\" he said.\n\nEva Buchmuller, a New York City artist whose best friend has lived in Cobble Hill with Alzheimer's for three years, said she wasn't that surprised the virus spread in the nursing home's cramped quarters, with small rooms tightly packed along narrow corridors and residents not allowed to open windows. She believes it's highly likely her friend is infected.\n\n\"How could you avoid not getting the virus?\" she said, adding that it's not overcrowded but \"always, always filled up.\"\n\nNEW JERSEY POLICE FIND 17 BODIES INSIDE NURSING HOME AFTER GETTING TIP CLAIMING ONE WAS IN A SHED\n\nBuilt in a stately brick building that once was a 19th-century hospital, Cobble Hill was most recently rated three out of five stars by the federal government for overall quality and the facility has a complaint rate that's half that of the statewide average for nursing homes.\n\nIts beds are in high demand -- it has 98 percent occupancy, according to the state -- in a city that has seen closures in nursing homes that developers have eyed for apartments.\n\nOver the years, it's shown signs of innovation. It has, at various points, taught massage therapy to nursing assistants, housed a small alternative public high school, brought local artists in to teach residents dance, offered music therapy and was at the forefront of nursing homes setting up Alzheimer's units and cutting reliance on antipsychotics that can leave residents with dementia.\n\nIn early 2018, Cobble Hill boasted on its website that it was hosting a delegation of 18 physicians and hospital administrators from Hubei Province, China -- which would become the global epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak -- \"to see best practices first hand.\"\n\nEarlier this month, Daniel Arbeeny and his family decided to move his elderly father -- who was not believed to have COVID-19 -- from the Cobble Hill facility to the family's home on a nearby block. After he left, the family helped coordinate a donation of face shields and doesn't blame the nursing home for the outbreak or its outcome.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE\n\n\"To me, it's just a bad situation,\" he said. \"They were dealt a bad set of cards.\"",

    "Players ask MLB for slew of financial documents": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.\n\nLawyers for the baseball players' union asked Major League Baseball to submit a slew of financial documents that detail the industry's finances, a person familiar with the request told The Associated Press.\n\nThe person spoke on condition of anonymity Thursday because neither side announced the step.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM\n\nBaseball owners on Monday approved a proposal that could lead to the coronavirus-delayed season starting around the Fourth of July with a regular-season schedule of 82 games per team, including 13 against each division rival. Owners also gave the go-ahead to propose basing players' salaries on a 50-50 revenue split, which the union says is a salary cap and a framework players will never agree to.\n\n\"It's hopeful that we will have some Major League Baseball this summer. We are making plans about playing in empty stadiums,\" Commissioner Rob Manfred said Thursday on CNN, adding he is confident of reaching a deal with players.\n\nThe type of financial disclosure the union asked for is more common during overall collective bargaining talks, which play out for many months or years, rather than the limited negotiation time available now.\n\n\"There's so many ways to hide the money,\" Cincinnati pitcher Trevor Bauer said in a video he posted Wednesday on Twitter.\n\nBauer said owners could reduce ticket prices and at the same time charge more for parking garages they control through different entities that do not benefit the club.\n\nDescribing himself as being only slightly lighthearted, the outspoken 29-year-old took a shot at the commissioner.\n\n\"If I'm going to have to trust my salary to Rob Manfred marketing the game to make more money for the game, I am out on that,\" Bauer said. \"Let me market the game and we'll all make more money.\"\n\nTeams made a presentation to the union Tuesday that included a dire financial forecast but no formal proposal.\n\nManagement fears even more financial difficulty if regular-season games are played, causing players to be paid their salaries, and the postseason is canceled because of a second wave of the new coronavirus. Players do not draw salaries during the postseason, when MLB receives the largest portion of its national broadcasting revenue.\n\nPlayers are waiting to receive detailed medical and testing protocols from MLB. Not willing to risk becoming ill, Tampa Bay Rays All-Star pitcher Blake Snell said he would not take the mound this year if his pay is cut further.\n\n\"I'm not splitting no revenue. I want all mine,\" the 2018 AL Cy Young Award winner said on a Twitch stream Wednesday. \"Bro, y'all got to understand, too, because y'all going to be like: 'Bro, play for the love of the game. Man, what's wrong with you, bro? Money should not be a thing.' Bro, I'm risking my life. What do you mean, 'It should not be a thing?' It 100% should be a thing.\"\n\nThe Sports Medicine Research and Testing Laboratory in Salt Lake City, which conducts testing for players with minor league contracts and participated in the recent coronavirus antibody study, would handle MLB's testing for the virus and promised a 24-hour turnaround.\n\n\"All of our players would be tested multiple times a week, PCR testing to determine whether or not they had the virus,\" Manfred told CNN. \"That testing would be supplemented less frequently by antibody testing.\"\n\nA 27-year-old left-hander, Snell agreed in March 2019 to a $50 million, five-year contract that included a $3 million signing bonus, a $1 million salary last year and a $7 million salary this season.\n\nAs part of the March 26 agreement between Major League Baseball and the players' association, Snell is being advanced $286,500 for the first 60 days of the season through May 24 but would not get any more in 2020 if no games are played. The deal calls for players to receive prorated shares of salary if the season does start; Snell would get $43,210 for each day of the schedule.\n\nTeams say they would lose money if games are played in empty ballparks. Manfred says 40% of revenue is gate and related to gate and told CNN if there is no season losses would approach $4 billion.\n\n\"If I'm going to play, I should be at the money I signed to be getting paid,\" Snell said. \"I should not be getting half of what I'm getting paid because the season's cut in half, all on top of a 33% cut of the half that's already there, so I'm really getting like 25%. On top of that, it's getting taxed. ... If I get the 'rona, guess what happens with that? Oh, yeah, that stays -- that's in my body forever.\"\n\nMLB's staff has spent two months working on the testing plan. Manfred said there would be daily temperature checks and symptom analysis. If someone tests positive, they would be quarantined until they have two negative tests over 24 hours.\n\n\"We hope that we will be able to convince the vast, vast majority of our players that it's safe to return to work,\" Manfred told CNN. \"The protocols for returning to play, the health-related protocols are about 80 pages in length. They're extraordinarily detailed. They cover everything from how the players will travel, private charters, how those charters have to be cleaned, who has access to the ballpark, strict limits on number of people, tiering of employees, so even those people who are in the ballpark will be isolated in general from the players.\n\n\"So we'll hope that we'll be able to convince them that it's safe,\" he added. \"At the end of the day, however, if there's players with either health conditions or just their own personal doubts, we would never force them or try to force them to come back to work. They can wait until they feel they're ready to come.\"\n\nTeams would play six games against each rival in the same region's division in the other league, creating six games each between rivals such as the Yankees and Mets, Cubs and White Sox, Dodgers and Angels, and Giants and Athletics.\n\nMLB's preference is for teams to use their regular-season ballparks. Manfred said he has spoken with the 18 governors whose states host MLB teams.\n\n\"Assuming that we try to play some games starting in the first half of July, most governors expressed hope that we would be able to use facilities, of course, initially without fans,\" he told CNN. \"But we do have contingency plans if, in fact, there was a problem in a particular market, we have contingency plans where that team could play somewhere else, at least temporarily.\"",

Sign up here.\n\nThe president of the Sergeants Benevolent Association said on Friday he is not surprised that the NYC health commissioner reportedly made crass comments showing disregard for the NYPD's urgent request for protective masks, also calling New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio's response to the matter \"disturbing.\"\n\n\"What I find disturbing is that this conversation happened two months ago, that the mayor himself was made aware of it and nothing was done,\" Ed Mullins told \"America's Newsroom.\"\n\nMullins reacted to de Blasio saying that the city's Department of Health commissioner should \"apologize\" to New York Police Department officers amid reports that she made derogatory comments while receiving requests for masks to protect the police force from COVID-19.\n\nNYC HEALTH HEAD REJECTED NYPD MASK PLEA: 'I DON'T GIVE 2 RATS' A--ES ABOUT YOUR COPS'\n\nDuring his daily press conference Thursday, de Blasio was asked about reports that the city's Health Commissioner Dr. Oxiris Barbot blew off a request from the NYPD for hundreds of thousands of surgical masks amid the coronavirus pandemic, and reportedly told a high-ranking police official that: \"I don't give two rats' a -- es about your cops.\"\n\n\"I need to understand what happened here, it does need to be addressed,\" de Blasio said. \"If it is accurate, the commissioner needs to apologize to the men and women of the NYPD.\"\n\nCLICK HERE FOR FULL CORONAVIRUS MAP\n\nThe New York Post first reported the back-and-forth this week. The Post reported that Barbot made the remark during a brief phone conversation in March with NYPD Chief of Department Terence Monahan, after he requested 500,000 masks. Barbot reportedly told Monahan that she could only provide 50,000 masks.\n\n\"I don't give two rats' a -- es about your cops,\" Barbot reportedly said. \"I need them for others.\"\n\nThe Post reported that the conversation took place as officers in the NYPD were calling out sick with symptoms of COVID-19, but before the force lost officers to the virus.\n\nBut the Sergeants Benevolent Association, which is comprised of more than 13,000 active and retired sergeants of the NYPD, said that if Barbot's reported comments were true, that she should be \"immediately fired.\"\n\n\"I am not surprised such vile words coming from an appointee of Mayor de Blasio, whose disdain for law enforcement is legendary,\" Ed Mullins, the president of SBA, said in a statement. \"But Dr. Barbot's comments make it clear she has no personal or professional regard for the police.\"\n\nAs of mid-April, more than 4,000 NYPD officers had tested positive for COVID-19.\n\nDe Blasio went after Mullins in the press conference Thursday morning, condemning the SBA's response, noting, \"So much of what comes out of the SBA is divisive and \"meant to set the city back.\"\n\n\"That's absolutely unacceptable.\" de Blasio said.\n\nMullins reacted to de Blasio's comments, telling \"America's Newsroom\" anchor Sandra Smith that de Blasio is \"deflecting\" from the real issue. Mullins said that though doctors and nurses are entitled to equipment, the NYPD did not have any personal protective equipment at that time.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"Think about that from a city that is the number one terrorist target since 2001. Although this is a pandemic and not terrorism, had it been a biochemical attack, our response would have been the same way,\" Mullins said.\n\n\"The purpose of my statement was to draw attention to the issue in a way that we're actually talking about it now on national news.\"\n\nFox News Brooke Singman contributed to this report.",

Sign up here.\n\nAs the global fight against the coronavirus pandemic continues into its six month, Gilead CEO Daniel O'Day said the announcement on Wednesday of a \"positive\" remdesivir trial gives the world a sign of \"important progress and offers hope at a time when it is badly needed.\"\n\nIn an open letter obtained by Fox News, O'Day said the trial of the experimental antiviral organized by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) offers initial answers on helping COVID-19 patients recover faster.\n\n\"The results from the global, placebo-controlled trial run by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) are positive,\" O'Day wrote. \"They show that patients with COVID-19 who received remdesivir recovered faster than similar patients who received placebo.\"\n\nFAUCI SAYS EXPERIMENTAL CORONAVIRUS TREATMENT REMDESIVIR COULD SHORTEN COVID-19 RECOVERY TIME\n\nO'Day continued: \"There is still more work to do and remdesivir has not been approved, but all of us at Gilead are humbled by what these promising results might mean for patients. After years of research and hard work on remdesivir, there is relief and gratitude among our teams today that their efforts have been so worthwhile.\"\n\nApril has been the worst month for coronavirus-linked deaths in the U.S., accounting for 92 percent of the death total. Over the past 10 days, slightly more than 2,000 people per day have died from the virus, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University.\n\nIn addition to the positive results of the NIAID trial of remdesivir, O'Day also pointed out that a SIMPLE (Shockless Implant Evaluation) clinical trial of \"severe\" COVID-19 patients showed that a five-day treatment of remdesivir was just as effective as a 10-day treatment.\n\n\"The data from the first study showed similar clinical improvements in patients with severe symptoms of COVID-19, regardless of whether they received five or 10 days of treatment,\" O'Day explained. \"We are very pleased with these results. They provide valuable information on treatment duration in this severe patient population and show the outcome we had all hoped to see.\"\n\nSpeaking at a White House Coronavirus Task Force press conference on Wednesday, Dr. Anthony Fauci, the government's top infectious disease expert, said the results of the NIAID trial \"shows that remdesivir has a clear-cut significant positive effect in diminishing the time to recovery.\"\n\nO'Day highlighted the benefits of shorter treatment duration, including not only a shorter hospital stay for patients, but the ability to free up health care resources and have more medicine for other patients.\n\nGilead has committed to donating all of the remdesivir treatment courses.\n\nIn the U.S., remdesivir is still awaiting regulatory approval as a coronavirus treatment. The antiviral was previously used to treat Ebola patients and has been garnering massive attention as the world scrambles to contain the coronavirus pandemic. Experts, however, have warned that people should not take drugs unless prescribed by a doctor.\n\nRemdesivir is one of a number of drugs currently in the spotlight. In a press conference last month, President Trump and FDA Commissioner Dr. Stephen Hahn described several approaches under testing, such as chloroquine, a drug long used to treat malaria, and remdesivir.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR COMPLETE CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE\n\nAs of Wednesday morning, more than 3.2 million coronavirus cases have been diagnosed worldwide, more than 1 million of which are in the U.S., the most impacted country on the planet.",

Sign up here.\n\nOfficials in Virginia have announced what is thought to be the state's first case of a mysterious inflammatory condition that primarily affects children and is possibly linked to the novel coronavirus.\n\nVirginia Health Commissioner Norman Oliver during a daily press conference on Monday said that the state has seen at least one case of \"pediatric multi-system inflammatory syndrome in children,\" or MIS-C. The syndrome has been paralleled to Kawasaki disease or a condition that causes swelling in medium-sized arteries throughout the body.\n\nCORONAVIRUS CLAIMS LIFE OF CHICAGO BOY, 12: OFFICIALS\n\n\"We have learned of one case [of] MIS-C at this point and that's the only one we have,\" Oliver said, according to local news station WRIC. \"We are currently getting the data on that, we haven't yet reported it as we've just learned of it.\"\n\nNo other details were provided, including the child's age, location, or current condition.\n\nA seemingly growing list of states have reported cases of MIS-C, with officials in both Oregon and Mississippi reporting their first cases late last week.\n\nPreviously, Yale-New Haven Children's Hospital (YNHCH) in Connecticut announced three cases of the condition in pediatric coronavirus patients there. The cases are said to be the state's first and have since been reported to the Connecticut Department of Public health, the hospital said in a news release.\n\nThe condition has also affected several patients at Children's Hospital Los Angeles in California, as well as at least one child in Louisiana.\n\nA 6-month-old who was hospitalized in California with Kawasaki disease last month also tested positive for COVID-19, Reuters reported at the time. Meanwhile, physicians in Washington, D.C., have also recently reported cases of the mysterious condition.\n\nAdditionally, at least three young children in New York died after being hospitalized with the rare Kawasaki disease-like illness, said New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo earlier this month.\n\nMore cases of the Kawasaki disease-like inflammatory condition are likely to pop up in other children around the country as the virus continues to spread, experts have warned, and the increasing number of cases prompted the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) last week to issue an advisory regarding MIS-C.\n\nThe news comes after British health authorities, in a warning to health care professionals in late April, said that some severely ill pediatric patients in the country -- including some who were positive for the coronavirus -- presented an \"unusual clinical picture\" that included inflammatory symptoms possibly linked to COVID-19.\n\nThe U.K. Pediatric Intensive Care Society (PICS), citing an email alert from the National Health Service (NHS) in England, said in a news release that health officials had reported \"a small rise in the number of cases of critically ill children presenting with an unusual clinical picture\" at the time. More specifically, the news release said, it is a \"multi-system inflammatory state\" that may be connected to the novel virus.\n\n\"The cases have in common overlapping features of toxic shock syndrome and atypical Kawasaki disease with blood parameters consistent with severe COVID-19 in children. Abdominal pain and gastrointestinal symptoms have been a common feature as has cardiac inflammation,\" the NHS notice reads, according to PICS.\n\nMIS-C can also cause persistent fever, rashes, vomiting, and diarrhea, among other symptoms such as a red tongue and eyes.\n\nDr. Jacqueline Szmuszkovicz, a pediatric cardiologist at Children's Hospital Los Angeles, recently said that children who have a fever that lasts for four or more days should seek medical attention.\n\nCLICK FOR COMPLETE COVERAGE OF THE CORONAVIRUS OUTBREAK\n\n\"Certainly, if they see any of the other signs -- the rash, the red tongue, red eyes -- we encourage them to seek care,\" she told The Los Angeles Times.\n\nA spokesperson for the Virginia Department of Health did not immediately return Fox News's request for additional comment on Tuesday.",

Overall, the researchers looked at data from 1,065 pediatric patients who were mostly from China and all under the age of 19.\n\nWith the exceptation of one 13-month-old infant who had a severe case of COVID-19 and another 30-hour-old baby who developed \"mild respiratory distress\" after contracting the virus from his or her mother, most of the pediatric patients reviewed had fever, dry cough and fatigue or were asymptomatic. Though some of the children were hospitalized, they generally only required supportive care and recovered within one to two weeks, the researchers said.",

Putin, who has been working remotely from his residence outside Moscow, did hold an in-person meeting Tuesday with Igor Sechin, the head of oil giant Rosneft, Reuters reported.\n\nWHICH WORLD LEADERS, US POLITICIANS HAVE TESTED POSITIVE OR BEEN EXPOSED TO THE CORONAVIRUS?\n\nPeskov's announcement comes just a day after Putin said Russia was successful in slowing down infections and announced easing some of the nationwide lockdown restrictions.\n\nRussia has reported more than 232,000 confirmed coronavirus cases as of Tuesday. Hours before Putin made televised remarks Monday about ending the country's partial economic lockdown, health officials reported a daily record of over 11,600 new cases.\n\nRussian Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin revealed on April 30 that he had tested positive for the virus, planned to self-isolate and would be temporarily stepping down from his duties amid treatment. Putin asked the prime minister to call him after checking into a hospital.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nCulture Minister Olga Lyubimova and Construction Minister Vladimir Yakushev, as well as one of his deputies, have also tested positive with the virus.\n\nRussian factory and construction workers returned to their jobs for the first time Tuesday after a recent surge in confirmed coronavirus cases pushed the country into the number two spot for worldwide coronavirus infections, second only to the United States.",

Jerry Falwell Jr., president of the evangelical school, appeared to reference Gandy-Golden during a Fox News appearance on Wednesday.\n\n\"Even the one student who was an online student who never was on campus who tested positive, it turns out he quit school to go into the NFL draft back early in March even though he was online, but somehow that got press,\" Falwell said. \"That was crazy.\"\n\nLiberty spokesman Scott Lamb responded to an email inquiry about Gandy-Golden's diagnosis and Falwell's comments with a paragraph from the school's website that does not specifically mention the former football player. The site makes reference to a graduated student who tested positive for the coronavirus on March 24 but was not on campus during the two weeks prior.\n\n\"Prior information that the graduated student came to an on campus clinic was incorrect,\" it said. \"While the student lives in Lynchburg with family, the location of infection cannot be pinpointed, in part, because the graduated student traveled to Florida on business in the two-week period before the test.\"\n\nA Redskins spokesman said the team was unable to comment on Gandy-Golden's medical situation.\n\n\"First things first, you definitely want him to be safe,\" Redskins defensive lineman Jonathan Allen said on a video call with reporters. \"Moving forward, I have full faith in our medical staff. It's really what they determine, what the NFL determines, is safe for us to move forward with. ... You just pray for the players we do have and just do everything you can to take the precaution to be safe.\"\n\nWashington selected Gandy-Golden in the fourth round of the draft last month, 142nd overall.

Sign up here.\n\nQuarantine Routine is a regular feature that asks political power brokers how their daily lives have changed -- and how they're still doing their jobs -- during the coronavirus crisis.\n\nIn normal times, Rep. Katie Porter, D-Calif., has a hectic life. As the only single mother in the U.S Congress, Porter has to juggle the 24/7 demands of representing California's 45th Congressional District with the 24/7 demands of raising three young children.\n\nAdd in the coronavirus pandemic, trying to run her district from the confines of her Orange County home and her new job as the substitute teacher for her children, and Porter's life has gotten even busier over the last month and a half.\n\nBut Porter - who recently announced that the coronavirus test she took after experiencing a fever and cold-like symptoms had come back negative - says that while there are certainly a number of new challenges, it's nothing she can't handle.\n\n\"I've been a working mother for more than 14 years so I'm used to juggling work and my family,\" Porter told Fox News.\n\nPorter, who is now back in Washington D.C. for the first time since mid-March, described how her daily routine has changed since the outbreak of the coronavirus in a Q & A with Fox News:\n\nHow has your daily routine changed since social distancing measures began?\n\nPorter: The demands of Congress require early mornings, especially when I'm on the West Coast, so now it is even more of a difficult challenge as I have to make sure my kids are doing their activities at the right time or doing their school work or not goofing off, while also making calls for Congress. Sometimes I have to yank them off their computer games or their Zoom calls or videos because I need the bandwidth to actually do my work. Right now though, I've just tried to relax a little bit about it like everyone else.\n\nWhat are the biggest challenges in doing your job during this crisis?\n\nPorter: The biggest challenge right now, and one I'm trying to meet head on, is communicating with the public. There is a reason for these policies right now and it is really important for people to know what is going on. How do I show my constituents what I'm doing, that I'm hearing them and that I'm raising their concerns in Congress?\n\nThe same thing goes for oversight as I'm a huge believer in oversight. When I sent a letter in early March to the [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] director about making testing for the coronavirus free for all Americans, he basically blew it off. But when he came before the House hearing to testify and all the cameras were on him, he couldn't ignore and agreed to make testing free.\n\nWhat do you miss the most about how you did your job before this began?\n\nPorter: One of things that I really miss is the back-and-forth with my Republican colleagues. The pandemic has eliminated my ability to get up and talk across the aisle. While I may not always agree with them, it's good to hear the diversity of opinion....Everything right now is done through the Democratic caucus so there is very little with Republicans.\n\nOn my way to Washington, I had to transfer in Charlotte and there were a number of my Republican colleagues on the connecting flight. It was just great to connect with them and see what is going on.\n\nWhat surprised you most about how life has changed?\n\nPorter: When I got back to California on March 14, it had been after a couple of very late nights on Capitol Hill and I just needed some rest. Then I woke up and said \"Here we go\" and got ready for my first meeting, but there were no legal pads or post-it notes or pens. There were, however, a lot of markers, Crayola crayons and a panda-shaped stapler.\n\nNow that has become sort of regular for me. I like the kids' office supplies, they bring me a lot of joy and I'm thinking [of] ordering animal-shaped staplers for my office now.\n\nHow do you blow off steam?\n\nPorter: I don't have a lot of free time, but my kids and I are using the family white board to list some activities we can do together. I've done yoga in the driveway with my daughter. The other day we had a Lego building competition in the driveway, which I was told I did not win. We're baking and trying to cook together. I'm just not used to having to make three meals a day. It really makes me appreciate school lunches.",

At the time, the ship was linked to at least 662 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 11 deaths. By Thursday, the death toll had risen to 15, Reuters reports.\n\nIn the weeks that followed the ship's docking, controversy had ignited over the disembarkation of nearly 2,700 passengers on March 19.

Sign up here.\n\nWe all know a nurse. Nurses are everywhere. Nurses have, and will continue to be, an integral part of our lives. They are with us on our most vulnerable days, cheer us on as we recover, or hold our hands and comfort us when we don't.\n\nNurses have a duty to care - a call to service. The public puts its faith and trust in nurses, wisely so.\n\nDuring this pandemic, all of our nurses rise up every day to meet new challenges, from our pediatric nurses now caring for adults, to nurses in our nursing homes not only looking after residents, but serving as their companions in this time of isolation. The pace of work has been unprecedented, as patients continue to fall ill to the virus - but nurses still come.\n\nREAR ADM. JOHN POLOWCZYK: FEMA'S CORONAVIRUS RESPONSE IS SAVING LIVES\n\nThey are fully present and in action - in hospitals, nursing homes and clinics - as well as on the phone, at the drive-up tent and out in the community. Nurses lead and advocate, take charge, respond and rise again. They take new approaches to tackle problems that are new and unique. They connect to each person, with a mission - to use a holistic approach to care with expert skills and to serve all with compassion.\n\nIn collaboration with physicians, nurses are crucial to the management and therapy of patients. They are adept in symptom science, and absolutely essential to the care of patients as the COVID-19 crisis wears on. Nurses are on the front line to stem the tide and make progress in the suppression of this deadly virus. Listen to your nurse: Stay home and wash your hands.\n\nWe have learned a lot over these past 90 days of this pandemic, and there is much more to learn. Nurses continue to move toward patients, heroes in their own right, moving headfirst into the fire. It is courage and solidarity that give our nurses the strength to carry on.\n\nWhile there is relief coming, we are not there yet; Many hospitals are full, and we are still braving the storm. In places across the country where there is calm - hold fast and stay alert. There is hope; Research is underway to find treatments and vaccines.\n\nNurses are guided by their ethics to do good, to help patients be their best, to keep them from harm and to see that each patient gets the just and fair care they need. Nurses advocate for patients with respect and support each patient's unique condition and resolve to survive. We are thus obligated in this reciprocal relationship to safeguard and protect our nurses, and all health care and essential workers. Some patients are recovering, and this brings hope. Patients are cheered by their nurses as they leave the hospital. And we should all cheer the nurses.\n\nKeep the faith. We can all do this. Pray when needed. Be brave. And know that if you do get sick, there will be a nurse to greet you and to help you navigate this devastating illness.\n\nNurses also comfort the dying. They bind their patients to their families over the Internet and phone and are ready in the spiritual moment, sometimes speaking the last words a dying patient hears. They hold the person's hand, albeit with gloves on, and take on the role of becoming their patients' loved ones. The distress and sorrow in these moments are incredibly powerful. Yet nurses ply resilience and press on.\n\nLet me suggest how to help nurses in this difficult time.\n\nFirst, stay well yourself. Keep your distance and, of course, wash your hands.\n\nSecond, keep all our health care teams protected, including everybody - from the physicians, the techs, the environmental services staff - virtually everyone in the health care industry. For that matter, keep all our community essential workers safe - the bus drivers, the grocery clerks and everyone keeping the community going. All are needed to keep us moving forward.\n\nThird, if you are able, give to your local charities and support your neighbors. It will take a village to contain this pandemic.\n\nFourth, keep connected. Our reliance on one another is still strong, even when we are apart. Call or write. Take care of each other.\n\nFifth, cheer on our nurses, always, not just during National Nurses Week. Honk your horns and blink your lights. Ring bells. Tie a ribbon around your door, your tree or anything nurses can see. Make masks and wear them.\n\nSixth, and finally, keep the faith. We can all do this. Pray when needed. Be brave. And know that if you do get sick, there will be a nurse to greet you and to help you navigate this devastating illness.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nI am inspired by our Georgetown students, alumni and nursing colleagues who have offered their own messages of hope and compassion, in the Jesuit tradition of cura personalis, or care for the whole person.\n\nFor every nurse who is in the fight and for those who are ready and willing to join - believe in yourselves and be strong. Stay true to yourself. Our hope and faith are with you all.",

Sign up here.\n\nScientists have tracked the frightening progression of a coronavirus outbreak in a crowded call center in Seoul, South Korea.\n\nThe research offers a glimpse into the spread of the virus in a crowded setting. The call center, which has not been identified, is in a commercial-residential mixed-use building in the South Korean capital dubbed \"building X,\" according to the research, which was published in the CDC's journal Emerging Infectious Diseases.\n\nOf 1,143 people tested for COVID-19 in \"building X,\" 97 had confirmed cases. \"Of these, 94 were working in an 11th-floor call center with 216 employees, translating to an attack rate of 43.5 percent,\" researchers said in the study.\n\nCHILLING VIDEO REVEALS HOW CORONAVIRUS SPREADS FROM A SINGLE COUGH IN A SUPERMARKET\n\nThe building was closed on March 9, 2020, immediately after the outbreak was reported and testing was offered to building residents and workers over the following three days.\n\nThe high attack rate on the 11th floor underlines the scale of the threat posed by coronavirus. Nearly all the case-patients were on one side of the building on the 11th floor, according to the researchers.\n\n\"This outbreak shows alarmingly that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) can be exceptionally contagious in crowded office settings such as a call center,\" they explained. \"The magnitude of the outbreak illustrates how a high-density work environment can become a high-risk site for the spread of COVID-19 and potentially a source of further transmission.\"\n\nCOVID-19 PATIENTS MAY BE CONTAGIOUS 2 TO 3 DAYS BEFORE SYMPTOMS SHOW, RESEARCH WARNS\n\n\"The household secondary attack rate among symptomatic case-patients was 16.2 percent,\" researchers said.\n\nScientists note that, of the 97 people confirmed with COVID-19, only four remained asymptomatic within 14 days of quarantine and none of their household contacts received secondary infections. \"Extensive contact tracing, testing all contacts, and early quarantine blocked further transmission and might be effective for containing rapid outbreaks in crowded work settings,\" they wrote.\n\nSouth Korea has garnered widespread attention for its handling of the coronavirus pandemic. As of Friday, the country had 10,908 coronavirus cases and COVID-19 had accounted for 240 deaths.\n\nFDA AUTHORIZES FIRST AT-HOME CORONAVIRUS TEST\n\nExperts say one reason South Korea has managed to avoid lockdowns or business bans is because of its aggressive testing and contact-tracing program, which draws from its experience of fighting a different coronavirus - MERS or Middle East Respiratory Syndrome - in 2015.\n\nFollowing that outbreak, which killed 36 people and sickened around 200, South Korea rewrote its infectious disease law to allow health authorities quick access to a broad range of personal information to fight infectious diseases.\n\nAmid criticism from privacy advocates, authorities have fully exercised such powers during the COVID-19 pandemic, aggressively tracing virus carriers' contacts with tools such as smartphone GPS tracking, credit card records and surveillance video. People's movements before they were diagnosed are published on websites and relayed via smartphone alerts to inform others whether they have crossed paths with a carrier.\n\nAIR FORCE SIGNS DEAL FOR COVID-19 ORAL TESTS\n\nThe government is also using smartphone tracking apps to monitor the tens of thousands of people placed under self-quarantine at home and plans to use electronic wristbands on people who defy quarantine orders.\n\nSouth Korea on Wednesday reported 11 new cases of the coronavirus, the 21st day in a row that the daily jump in infections came below 100.\n\nIn a separate study, researchers in Finland recently released a video to model how coronavirus spreads from a single cough in a supermarket.\n\nAs of Friday afternoon, more than 2.76 million coronavirus cases have been diagnosed worldwide, at least 880,112 of which are in the U.S. The disease has accounted for at least 193,671 deaths around the world, including more than 50,000 people in the U.S.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this article.",

With lockdowns lifted, those people would be freer to move and potentially risk new outbreaks.\n\nThere is no approved treatment or vaccine for COVID-19. The new coronavirus has already infected more than 1.2 million and killed almost 72,000 people in the U.S. as of Wednesday.\n\nFOR CORONAVIRUS PATIENTS WITH DIABETES, BLOOD SUGAR CONTROL IS KEY, CHINA STUDY FINDS\n\n\"We'll be looking for second and third waves until... we have vaccines available,\" said Paul Bertsch, land and water science director at Australia's Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation. \"Getting an early warning protection system in place will be very important.\"",

Sign up here.\n\nUniversity of Miami researchers said Friday that around six percent of Miami-Dade County residents -- approximamtely 165,000 people -- have coronavirus antibodies indicating previous infection, a far larger total than the 10,926 county cases confirmed by Florida health officials.\n\nA two-week countywide study of 1,400 participants found about half of respondents tested positive for antibodies indicating past infection and reported no symptoms for up to two weeks before being examined, the Miami Herald reported.\n\nTHE CORONAVIRUS OUTBREAK, STATE-BY-STATE\n\nThe findings of the serology tests could help scientists and health officials understand how widespread the virus is and how soon cities can begin to relax movement restrictions. Serology tests look for the presence of antibodies, which are specific proteins made by the body in response to infections, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nMiami-Dade Mayor Carlos Gimenez said the results supported social distance guidelines already in place.\n\n\"Whatever measures we're going to do to open up, especially the outdoor spaces, is going to be done with those measures in mind,\" he told reporters Friday, according to the newspaper. \"You're not going to be able to get close. You're going to have social distancing.\"\n\nTo account for the limitations of the antibody test, researchers at UM used statistical methods to determine the true number of infections was between 4.4 percent and 7.9 percent of the county population before concluding that six percent was the best estimate.\n\nThey also determined a margin of error of 123,000 infections on the low end and 221,000 on the high end. The findings show that Miami-Dade is far from the 60 percent infection threshold needed to reach herd immunity, referring to when a sufficient portion of the population is infected to slow transmission.\n\nSimilar tests in New York City -- the epicenter of the pandemic in the United States -- found that 21 percent of residents tested positive, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo revealed earlier this week. The results would suggest that more than 1.7 million New Yorkers have had the virus, according to MarketWatch.\n\nStatewide, New York has reported 263,000 COVID-19 cases and 15,740 deaths.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR COMPLETE CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE\n\nIn California, serology tests administered in Santa Clara County found that the true number of coronavirus cases could be 85 times higher than what health officials have tallied. Researchers at Stanford University tested 3,330 adults and children and found that the population prevalence of COVID-19 ranged from 2.49 percent to 4.16 percent.\n\nIn Los Angeles County, health officials found more than 4 percent of residents have coronavirus antibodies in their blood, indicating possible exposure in the past. That means between 221,000 and 442,000 adults in the area have previously been infected, according to a study conducted by University of Southern California and the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health.\n\nFox News' David Aaro and Alexandria Hein contributed to this report.",

Sign up here.\n\nLimited visitors will be allowed at 16 hospitals in New York under a new two-week pilot program that was announced by Gov. Andrew Cuomo on Tuesday.\n\nIt was not immediately clear if visitors will be allowed across all wards in the hospitals, but they will be subject to symptom and temperature checks before entering, and issued mandatory personal protective equipment to be worn once inside.\n\nThe 16 hospitals include locations in Nassau, Suffolk, Manhattan, Bronx, Brooklyn, Queens, Erie, Onondaga, Westchester, Otsego, and Albany. He said the program was developed in coordination with the Greater New York Hospital Association (GNYHA) and the Healthcare Association of New York State (HANYS).\n\nGOVERNORS FACE FACE MOUNTING COURT CHALLENGES OVER CORONAVIRUS LOCKDOWN ORDERS\n\n\"This is getting visitors back into hospitals with the right precaution, with the right equipment, but it is terrible to have someone in the hospital, and then that person is isolated, not being able to see their family and friends,\" Cuomo said. \"I understand the health reasons for that, we were afraid of the virus spread, but this is a pilot project to see if we can bring visitors in and do it safely.\"\n\nHe also announced that Long Island's Nassau County would be eligible to resume elective surgeries.\n\nNew York banned most hospital visitation back in March, except for a support person for labor and delivery patients and a support person for pediatric patients. According to the state's department of health, exceptions were also made when they were deemed medically necessary or essential to the care of the patient, or for family members or legal representatives of patients in imminent end-of-life situations.\n\nCDC PLANS NATIONWIDE CORONAVIRUS ANTIBODY STUDY, REPORT SAYS\n\nDozens of others followed suit, leading to staff nationwide to facilitate video calls and other technological measures for patients who were hospitalized alone. In many instances, health care workers replaced relatives who could not be with loved ones during their final moments.\n\nNew York has seen over 350,000 cases of coronavirus, with more than 22,600 deaths. The state's nursing homes have been hit particularly hard, as Cuomo faces mounting criticism over a policy that required facilities to accept patients infected with COVID-19 after they were discharged from the hospitals but were still recovering and in need of care. Critics say the policy exposed an already-vulnerable population to the virus and overwhelmed an already-strained system.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR COMPLETE CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE\n\nThe state, along with New Jersey, which has the second-highest death toll in the U.S., also allowed health care workers at long-term care facilities who tested positive for the virus to return to work just seven days later, even without a second test to ensure the infection had cleared.\n\nCuomo has since revised the policy and New York now requires all workers at care homes be tested twice per week.",

Players from most clubs began individual training sessions on Friday after nearly two months of confinement because of the pandemic.\n\nThe league said it will \"continue to apply the back-to-training protocol\" that was approved by government authorities to \"guarantee the maximum safety of all players, coaches and club employees.\"\n\nTebas noted the \"very low\" number of positive cases and said it will be virtually impossible for contagion to happen during games because everyone involved will have been tested ahead of time.\n\n\"The matches are where there will be less risk,\" Tebas said.\n\nThe five players who tested positive will remain sidelined until they fully recover. They are all without symptoms and recovering from the disease, according to the league. They will be allowed to resume practicing after testing negative in two consecutive tests.\n\nAll other players tested negative, and the league said only three staff members of clubs tested positive after nearly 2,500 total tests were conducted.\n\n\"This is good news for the football industry and for Spanish society as well,\" Tebas said, adding the league had expected about 30 positive tests.\n\nPlayers, coaches and club employees involved in the training sessions are being tested daily.\n\nThe league did not name the players who tested positive. It also didn't disclose their clubs, but Real Betis goalkeeper Joel Robles later confirmed he was among those with COVID-19. Spanish media said two other players were from first-division clubs, including Atl\u00e9tico Madrid defender Renan Lodi.\n\nAtl\u00e9tico on Saturday posted a message on an official club social media channel with a picture of the Brazilian and the message: \"Renan Lodi says hello from his home. We will see you very soon on the field, Renan!\"\n\nHe did not practice as the rest of Atl\u00e9tico players resumed their activities on Saturday. None of the players who tested positive reportedly play for Barcelona or Real Madrid.\n\nBarcelona was among the first teams to resume individual training on Friday. Real Madrid is expected to be back in action on Monday.\n\n\"Soccer is secondary right now,\" Madrid defender Sergio Ramos said. \"But it can serve as a distraction for the people who have been suffering.\"\n\nTebas said he expects matches to be played every day after soccer resumes in Spain.\n\nBarcelona captain Gerard Piqu\u00e9 said he hoped to have more time for players to prepare.\n\n\"A few more days of practice would be good for us, especially because of the risk of injuries,\" he said.\n\nSpain this week started loosening some of the lockdown measures that had been in place since mid-March because of the pandemic, allowing soccer players to resume training individually at the teams' base camps.\n\nThe league sent clubs a detailed four-stage protocol for the return to practice. The individual training will be followed by smaller group sessions and then full squad sessions.",

Sign up here.\n\nCoronavirus is bad enough, so here's the question: Why would anyone want to make out that it's worse than it is?\n\nRachel Maddow, MSNBC host: America is the largest coronavirus disaster in the world by a million miles.\n\nCOLORADO RESTAURANT DRAWS LARGE MOTHER'S DAY CROWDS IN DEFIANCE OF STATE ORDER\n\n\"By a million miles!\" To try and prove that claim, she showed a graphic of cases with a helpful little red arrow to show you just how bad America. It looks really bad, right? Just the worst.\n\nBut America's population is bigger than all of those countries put together. Even The New York Times isn't that deceptive. They said a better comparison is with Western continental Europe. And on that basis, it turns out, there are many thousands more cases in countries not run by Trump.\n\nBut even that's not the whole picture because the number of cases statistic actually measures the number of tests. So, why don't we compare what really matters - how many lives are being lost.\n\nThere's the actual data, Johns Hopkins deaths per 100,000. America has the least bad outbreak of any major country apart from Germany. And as some have noted, if you take the New York metro area out of it, the rest of America is close to Germany.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nThe media's other constant apocalyptic chorus is about testing.\n\nChris Cuomo, CNN anchor: It just shows how far we are behind in terms of testing and tracing.\n\nBehind who? We test more than anywhere else by far, over eight million tests to date. It's not even close.\n\nOn test per population, we are ahead of South Korea, who the media constantly go on about as the gold standard. And by the way, that's after the initial bungling by the media's precious public sector CDC was replaced by the private sector innovation brought in by President Trump and his team.\n\nIt is not just testing, though. The fear mongers in the East Coast media elite, after weeks of solipsistically assuming their experience in New York was the same as everyone else's, are now trying to frighten the rest of America with misinformation about the coming coronavirus disaster in places like South Dakota.\n\nI don't think they've ever paid so much attention to Red State America in their lives. But now, they can terrify people about the looming disease apocalypse for the meatpacking rubes. They're all in.\n\nBut I checked the data on the deadliest coronavirus day in South Dakota. Five people died; five family tragedies. But the number was five. Deaths per 100,000 in South Dakota, four. In New York, it's 138. We put them on a chart, and you can barely even see South Dakota.\n\nWe're still waiting for the media's South Dakota apocalypse. It's nonstop fear-mongering misinformation.\n\nThey said the new head of the HHS coronavirus response team was a Labradoodle breeder.\n\nChris Hayes, MSNBC host: A Labradoodle breeder is currently running the day-to-day federal government response to a once in a century pandemic at HHS.\n\nFrightening, right? I mean, what an utterly incompetent federal government, putting a dog breeder in charge of coronavirus.\n\nIt's not just coronavirus that kills, the shutdown costs lives, too.\n\nExcept he is not just a dog breeder. He turns out, once you check the facts, to be an experienced government official in multiple administrations, including in the White House in the Health Department.\n\nBut whatever. Let's just scare the American people. Let's just scare them about nursing homes, too.\n\nSen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn.: We have to be able to go into hotspots or potential hotspots like nursing homes or prisons or densely populated neighborhoods and be able to test people who aren't showing symptoms.\n\nYes, senator. And almost two weeks before you said that Dr. Deborah Birx said this.\n\nDr. Deborah Birx, White House Coronavirus Response Coordinator: We'll be doing sentinel surveillance throughout nursing homes, throughout inner city federal clinics, throughout indigenous populations to really be able to find early alerts of asymptomatic individuals in the community.\n\nThe worst disaster in the world. The coming disaster in South Dakota. The government is doing nothing. On and on it goes. But it's all a misinformation. And it matters because Democratic leaders take their cue from what they see on their favorite news outlets -- CNN, MSNBC, and all the rest of them. It's a mutual appreciation society.\n\nNew York Gov. Andrew Cuomo: Thank you for your reporting on this story. You've done a tremendous service to us all.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi: Any chance I get, I want to thank you for the beautiful presentation you make about the challenge that our country is undergoing.\n\nOh, yes. Thank you. Thank you so much. You're so marvelous.\n\nThis misinformation, this fear they stoke, it's not just empty words. It has a real world impact -- the human costs of the shutdown pushed by the shutdown fanatics on TV.\n\nFear stops people from going to the hospital, even when there are empty beds. Fear stops people from going out, even when they're not at risk. Fear costs jobs and livelihoods, yes. But it also costs lives. So, please stop this dangerous divisive misinformation.\n\nIf you want to open up, they say, you want people to die.\n\nChris Cuomo: He is a fan of money first, mortality second.\n\nPelosi: As the President fiddles, people are dying.\n\nChris Hayes, MSNBC host The president is now listening to voices on the right that say, \"Really? What's a million seniors when you're thinking about the whole economy?\"\n\nIgnore the grotesque and gratuitous insult, and just focus on the facts. It's not just coronavirus that kills, the shutdown costs lives, too.\n\nTwo senior cadets at the Air Force Academy committed suicide within days of each other after they were isolated. Zach Branson's liver transplant was canceled when he might just have a month to live. Alison Krupnik was set for cancer surgery before her hospital called it off.\n\nIn April, 1.4 million health care jobs disappeared. The fear stoked by the establishment media, according to this doctor, has literally killed people.\n\nDr. Harlan Krumholz, Yale School of Medicine: My hunch is that it may be a good third of the toll of people dying out of the hospital, maybe because of preventable illnesses that are not the direct result of the virus, but actually indirect result of people being fearful about getting care.\n\nDr. Jeff Tomlin, chief executive officer of EvergreenHealth: People are choosing to stay away, we even found that for stroke and even some of our heart attacks.\n\nAnd just listen to this doctor.\n\nUnidentified doctor: I'm calling as a clinical psychologist and our percentage of death is way less than 0.01 percent. Our percentage of getting it is a little bit higher, but not much. And we're watching as many counties are, the emotional toll that this virus is taking on people with rising incidences of domestic violence, child abuse, and just the emotional devastation.\n\nHeart attack, stroke, child abuse ... but you know, we've got to keep going with the shutdown. Have your heart attack at home; I'm sure you'll be fine. How bad is a stroke, really? Do you need a doctor for that? Child abuse -- it's a price worth paying.\n\nHere's the real intellectual dishonesty of the fear mongers. They don't even ask whether the human cost of the shutdown is worth paying because they pretend there isn't one. Stopping coronavirus infections is the only an absolute imperative. Nothing else matters.\n\nThis is what Santa Clara County Health Officer Dr. Sara Cody said recently. She imposed the nation's first shutdown here in the Bay Area. \"If we lift too soon, there's no reason to think we wouldn't have exponential spread. Our whole population is susceptible and at risk.\"\n\nThat is not true. We know from the data that over 80 percent of those infected have mild or zero symptoms. Our whole population is not at risk.\n\nBecause of this reckless, manufactured climate of fear, people are terrified of even catching this virus. That's ridiculous. As we've said here from the start, the focus should be on protecting the vulnerable. But no, they pushed fear, and we now have a human catastrophe from the shutdown.\n\nMillions upon millions have lost their jobs, their health insurance, and their hope. Most of them, by the way, the exact same people the moralizing media grand standarders saying they speak for. Guess who has been hurt most by the shutdown? Hispanic-Americans. It turns out their biggest threat wasn't from the racist Trump, but you, the fear mongering media.\n\nYour misinformation has a human cost. It breeds fear. Fear stops people from going to the hospital, even when there are empty beds. Fear stops people from going out, even when they're not at risk.\n\nFear costs jobs and livelihoods, yes. But it also costs lives. So, please stop this dangerous divisive misinformation.\n\nI'll give the last word to someone I don't know, but who seems incredibly smart and brilliant at what she does.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP",

Sign up here.\n\nAs the coronavirus shutdown drags on, backed by the work-from-home elitists on TV, the majority of Americans who can't make a living from their laptop are screaming, \"What do we have to do to get our leaders to follow the data and the science?\"\n\nHere's the data: 21 percent of New York City residents have had coronavirus, nearly half a million in Los Angeles. In Santa Clara County, California, up to 85 times more people have had it then the official statistics claimed.\n\nLOS ANGELES COUNTY SAYS THOSE IN LOWER INCOME COMMUNITIES MORE VULNERABLE TO CORONAVIRUS\n\nThe fatality rate, therefore, is not the 3.4 percent or 2 percent or 1 percent we were told. It's closer to 0.01 percent. Yes, seasonal flu is just more contagious. That's why it comes in a rush. That's why we had to flatten the curve and slow the spread.\n\nBut we did that. So, why are we still shut down?\n\nHere's the science. Viruses don't disappear because we stay at home. They keep going until there's not enough people left to infect. A vaccine is over a year away, they say, but millions of Americans have already had the virus.\n\nMost didn't know they had it. Eighty percent have mild or zero symptoms. That's more than you can say for the victims of the shutdown. Their toll is rising every day. And here's what our leaders think about it.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nNew York Gov. Andrew Cuomo: Economic hardship -- yes, very bad. Not death. Emotional stress from being locked in a house -- very bad; not death. Domestic violence on the increase -- very bad; not death.\n\nHave you ever heard anything so callous or stupid? Economic hardship causes death.\n\nHere's what else causes death: Millions of medical procedures cancelled because of wildly inaccurate coronavirus projections. Just one example: In the state of Arkansas recently, there were 80 people in hospital with coronavirus and 8,000 empty beds.\n\nThe mindset of the shutdown zealots is the opposite of science. Instead of adapting their thinking in the light of new information, they cling to their old position, despite new information.\n\nThis insanity has to stop. We know who's most vulnerable and how to protect them. Twenty percent of U.S. coronavirus deaths are in nursing homes. In some states, it's over half. So, what are our leaders doing about that? They're making it worse.\n\nFor weeks, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, instead of sending nursing home coronavirus patients to the nearly empty Navy hospital ship, sent them back into nursing homes. With that one demented decision, he is responsible for a big part of America's death toll.\n\nWe know who's at risk and how to protect them. Why aren't our leaders surging medical capacity and equipment to our nursing homes and care facilities, where the greatest generation is so obviously vulnerable?\n\nI'll tell you why. Because they're too busy putting sand in skate parks, flying creepy surveillance drones, and worst of all, hiring armies of busybody contact traitors to implement this idiotic, unscientific reckless establishment groupthink that the only way we can open up is widespread testing, contact tracing and isolating.\n\nRep. Steny Hoyer, D-Md.: We need to test. We need to isolate those who test positive. We then need to contact trace.\n\nChris Hayes, MSNBC host: We cannot truly reopen the economy without widespread testing.\n\nAnderson Cooper, CNN anchor: Testing, testing, contact tracing, testing, contact tracing. Different forms of testing, antibody testing. You know, testing people who are asymptomatic in order to get the country back to work.\n\nMSNBC had a two-hour special this week based entirely on this misinformation. It was literally called \"Testing and the Road to Reopening.\"\n\nTesting, contact tracing and isolating are great if you're trying to contain an outbreak at the start, where you have hundreds of cases. It is totally absurd after a pandemic with millions infected, where you'll miss most of them anyway because they have no symptoms. And the absurdity rises to a level of grave danger if you're making this a condition for reopening, knowing that every day you delay will kill more Americans.\n\nLast week, we set up questions for Dr. Anthony Fauci. Well, he may not care about being accountable to you, but our state and local leaders do listen to him. He's the one that started this nonsense, still using an old playbook, even though the facts have changed.\n\nI beg you, Dr. Fauci, tell the governors, tell the mayors, how to protect the vulnerable in our nursing homes who are dying in droves because of inadequate infection control. Tell them that if we properly protect the vulnerable, we don't need the costly, complicated, technocratic nightmare of testing and contact tracing.\n\nAnd tell the American people so terrified by months of misinformation that many are scared to go out even if states do reopen. Tell them that most Americans, according to the data, have nothing to fear from coronavirus. Tell them that there is no scientific basis -- as long as we properly protect the vulnerable -- for this shutdown.\n\nThe mindset of the shutdown zealots is the opposite of science. Instead of adapting their thinking in the light of new information, they cling to their old position, despite new information. It's not science, it's ideology. It's not based on data, but dogma.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nDr. Fauci, tell the world that, based on the data, based on the science, we must protect the vulnerable and end the shutdown and save lives now.",

Sign up here.\n\nEATONTON, Ga. - In some parts of the country, summer camps are becoming an option for parents after students have been out of school for months.\n\nIn Georgia, day camps are opening their doors, but overnight camps are waiting for the green light to open.\n\nLast week, Gov. Brian Kemp signed an executive order allowing day camps to open this summer, but they must follow more than 30 restrictions. The restrictions include everything from social distancing, temperature checks, availability of hand sanitizer, masks for everyone, and many more.\n\nAccording to the American Camping Association, around 20 million children usually attend summer camp in the United States, but that number is expected to decrease this summer as the coronavirus pandemic continues.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR FULL CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE\n\nThe Georgia Mountains YMCA day camp decided to open for summer camp at the end of May, but this year their program will be different.\n\nAmy Kienle, the CEO of Georgia Mountains YMCA, said they had to transition very quickly.\n\n\"A very high percentage of our parents and guardians in our community are essential workers, and we knew that this would be a critical need for our community,\" Kienle said.\n\nThe day camp usually attracts 300 kids, but Kienle said they were capping the number at 196 this year.\n\nAlso, the staff at the camp are changing campers' daily routine to protect the employees and children.\n\n\"We don't let parents enter the facility for drop off and pick up, they're remaining in their vehicle. Also, campers are not eating in a communal space. Food is being taken to the children and they're eating in separate spaces,\" Kienle said.\n\nIn the instance that a child becomes sick, \"when a child does show symptoms or becomes ill while they're here, we keep them in an isolated area until their parents can come pick them up,\" Kienle said.\n\nKienle said they are expected to hit capacity this summer but overnight camps like Rock Eagle in Eatonton, Ga., still aren't allowed to open.\n\nRock Eagle summer camp state leader Arch Smith has been a part of the Rock Eagle camping community since he was a child and he said he has never seen it like this.\n\nThe camp has been closed since mid-March.\n\n\"We have delayed the opening of our summer camp program to late June or early July. Whether or not we will be able to do it... we will have to make a call within the next two weeks,\" Kienle said.\n\nThe campground has over 50 cabins and more than 1,000 beds for campers. Due to coronavirus, cabins could be left empty if overnight camps are forced to stay closed.\n\n\"We're not set up to do day programs. It would be difficult because that's just not the business that we are in,\" Kienle said.\n\nSmith said the camp is already facing a financial hit because they have canceled summer programs through the end of June at all five locations. Smith fears that things could get worse.\n\nThat hit is about 45 percent of our annual revenue... so it's in the millions of dollars,\" Kienle said.\n\nThe five camping centers in Georgia that Smith oversees may be empty this summer for the first time in decades.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"If we feel that we can safely operate our facility under those guidelines, we'll make every attempt to do so,\" Kienle said. \"But, at the same time, if those guidelines are more restrictive than we can comply with, we won't try to operate camp.\"",

Over the last four to six weeks, the company brought on hundreds of additional medical providers, psychiatrists and psychologists in an effort to offer 24/7 access to care across 50 states. The online practice aims to connect patients and health care providers in less than 10 minutes, on average.\n\n\"We're seeing this demand right now but I think once the impact of this is fully realized, I think it's going to result in the industry as a whole being changed forever,\" Dr. Nikole Benders-Hadi told Fox News. Benders-Hadi is a board-certified psychiatrist and medical director of behavioral health at Doctor On Demand.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR COMPLETE CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE\n\nShe said while brick-and-mortar behavioral care facilities may take up to 25 days to connect with patients, online care can speed the process up to an \"unprecedented\" one to five days.\n\nWhile the media document the urgency for adequate personal protective equipment, or PPE, Benders-Hadi feels she provides \"emotional PPE\" for frontline healthcare workers.\n\n\"We've been really excited with services expanding, being able to help eliminate some of the barriers of healthcare access and reach people that are really in need at this time,\" she told Fox News. Doctor On Demand has seen an estimated 140 percent uptick in virtual care visits across the board. In particular, child mental health therapy has been in high demand.\n\nHOW DOES THE CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC AFFECT CHILDREN'S MENTAL HEALTH?\n\n\"We want to be able to talk honestly and openly with children about current events and what's going on with coronavirus right now,\" Benders-Hadi said. \"That's going to vary depending on the age and maturity level...children ultimately are looking for safety and want to know that they're OK.\"\n\nThough governing bodies have established social distancing measures, the psychiatrist encourages connecting with others online through Facetime and Skype. She was heartwarmed to learn of virtual book clubs and support groups, too.\n\n\"Just being open and talking about how you're feeling...to have loneliness or sadness or stress and to be validated and know that you're not in this alone, can go a long way as well to help people cope,\" Benders-Hadi said.\n\nCORONAVIRUS IN THE US: STATE-BY-STATE BREAKDOWN\n\nDoctor On Demand -- which is accessible online and as an app --also announced a partnership this week with the Commonwealth of Massachusetts to provide free services to about two million uninsured residents.\n\n\"During the COVID-19 emergency, Massachusetts has made unprecedented efforts to eliminate barriers to health care access, including expansive coverage of telehealth services,\" said Amanda Cassel Kraft, acting Medicaid director, according to a recent press release. \"MassHealth is excited to announce this partnership with Doctor On Demand to provide medical support to our members and uninsured residents seeking guidance on COVID-19 symptoms or risk factors.\"",

Sign up here.\n\nA Texas man who was first diagnosed with the novel coronavirus on March 19 said that while he doesn't have symptoms of the virus anymore, he has since tested positive for the virus two additional times, including as recently as May 1, according to Fox 26 Houston.\n\n\"I'm ready for it to be done,\" Christian Bermea, who has been isolating for over 50 days, told the news outlet. \"I definitely feel a lot better than I did at the beginning, but I'm still not at 100 percent. My smell isn't as good as it used to be, fatigue and shortness of breath.\"\n\nCORONAVIRUS INFECTS WORKERS AT OREGON SEAFOOD PLANT\n\nThe 26-year-old, who said he is planning to get tested for a fourth time this week, said his symptoms first started in mid-March with a dry cough and a slight fever. He told ABC 13 that he isn't sure where he was exposed to the virus, as he hadn't traveled recently.\n\n\"I personally don't know how I got it, but as soon as I started showing symptoms, I called into work like, 'Please let me work from home,'\" he told ABC 13. \"My work was great about it. I just started taking action immediately.\"\n\nAs his symptoms worsened his fever spiked to 102 and he began sleeping for up to 19 hours a day. He's been recovering but told Fox 26 Houston that the battle has also had a mental component.\n\n\"Fifty-two days and counting,\" he told the news outlet. \"This virus isn't just a physical process, it's a mental one, too. You're almost stuck with your thoughts. I'm scared because there's still a virus inside of me.\"\n\nDr. Eric Sandberg, who isn't treating Bermea but answered questions pertaining to his case, told Fox 26 that a positive test may not mean that he's able to infect people, but that he does have part of the genetic code in his body.\n\nMORE EVIDENCE SUGGESTS CORONAVIRUS SPREADS FROM ASYMPTOMATIC, PRESYMPTOMATIC INDIVIDUALS, CDC SAYS\n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), symptoms may appear anywhere between two and 14 days after you contract the virus. The longevity of the case depends on the severity of the illness.\n\n\"How long someone is actively sick can vary so the decision on when to release someone from isolation is made using a test-based or non-test-based strategy in consultation with state and local public health officials,\" according to the CDC. \"The decision involves considering the specifics of each situation, including disease severity, illness signs and symptoms and the results of laboratory testing for that patient.\"\n\nSymptom-based strategy means that at least three days have passed since recovery which is defined as resolution of fever without the use of medications, and improvement in respiratory symptoms and that at least 10 days have passed since symptoms first appeared. A test-based strategy means the resolution of fever without the use of medication, improvement in respiratory symptoms, and negative results of an FDA-approved COVID-19 test from at least two consecutive specimens collected over 24 hours apart.\n\nCLICK FOR COMPLETE CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE\n\nThe CDC notes, however, that detecting the virus' RNA does not necessarily mean that infectious virus is present, but regardless, Bermea said he will continue taking precautions.\n\n\"Even if it comes back positive, and you feel like you can't infect anyone else, it's to play it safe than sorry,\" he said.\n\nAs of Tuesday, Texas had at 33,369 confirmed cases of COVID-19, including 906 deaths.",

Sign up here.\n\nTexas officials announced Tuesday state prisons will begin widespread testing for inmates after concerns the coronavirus has largely entrenched the system while so far going widely undetected.\n\nTexas Department of Criminal Justice (TDCJ) spokesperson Jeremy Desel said tens of thousands of tests will be sent out and divided among all 104 state prison units. Inmates will be shown an agency video on how to administer the tests themselves to prevent contagion to staff, the Texas Tribune reported.\n\nAs of Monday, only about 2 percent of some 140,000 inmates in the Texas prison system had been tested for the virus. Of those tested, nearly 74 percent yielded a positive result.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR FULL CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE\n\nThat figure is drastically higher than the rate of the rest of the Texas population. Of the 538,172 tests administered statewide, at least 41,048 - or just below 8 percent - yielded positive results. At least 1,133 people have died in Texas after contracting COVID-19.\n\n\"Increasing the information available to our medical professionals will help us to further enhance the agency's ability of stop the spread of COVID-19,\" Bryan Collier, TDCJ's executive director, said in the statement, according to the Tribune.\n\nMore than 2,100 inmates - incarcerated across 40 separate jail units - had yielded positive test results by Tuesday, according to the latest data released by TDCJ. More than 650 employees and contract staff across the state prison system have tested positive.\n\nMASSIVE CORONAVIRUS OUTBREAK AT TEXAS FEDERAL PRISON RACKS UP COUNTY TOTAL TO NEAR 4,000\n\nThat included at least 10 inmates at Wallace Pack Unit, a geriatric prison near Houston, which has been targeted by a class-action lawsuit alleging social distancing and proper sanitization procedures were never enforced to protect at the onset of the pandemic, KVIA-TV in El Paso reported.\n\n\"We do anticipate that there's going to be a significant increase in the number of positive tests,\" Desel said. \"Any type of asymptomatic or mass testing has had at least some level of increase.\"\n\nAt least 30 inmates and at least 7 TDCJ employees have died presumably from COVID-19.\n\nMORE THAN 70 PERCENT OF FEDERAL PRISONERS TESTED NATIONWIDE FOR CORONAVIRUS WERE POSITIVE; LA LOCKUP HAS WORST OUTBREAK\n\nBefore late April, when large-scale outbreaks were detected at several state prisons, only symptomatic inmates were being tested.\n\nSeveral prisons then began targeted testing for asymptomatic inmates identified as the most vulnerable to serious complications from the virus, including those 65 or older or with pre-existing health conditions. Employees without symptoms were tested at some facilities.\n\nAs of Friday, any facility with a confirmed positive inmate or employee COVID-19 test was placed on a precautionary lockdown for at least 14 days from the date of the positive test. That was in addition to existing medical restriction and medical isolation measures already in place.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nAdvocates have called for the release of prisoners amid the pandemic, arguing smaller inmate populations allow more space for social distancing and separating the sick, as well as those who have come in contact with an infected person, from the rest of those incarcerated.",

Sign up here.\n\nTexas saw its deadliest COVID-19 day of the coronavirus pandemic so far, with state officials reporting 58 deaths during a time span between Wednesday and Thursday afternoon, according to state tabulations.\n\nIn Corpus Christi, 63 workers of the 747 employees, contractors and vendors at the STX Beef processing plant tested positive for COVID-19, Nueces County health officials said.\n\nAlso, the U.S. Supreme Court let stand a ruling that, for now, Texas does not have provide inmates at one prison with hand sanitizer, masks and unrestricted access to soap amid the coronavirus pandemic. The high court's decision upheld an appeals court ruling that had put a previous ruling on hold.\n\nIn Houston, meanwhile, a $15 million program that was created to help residents who have been hurt economically by the coronavirus and are struggling to pay their rent ran out of money within 90 minutes after applications were accepted online.\n\nCOVID-19'S DEADLIEST DAY\n\nThe Texas Department of State Health Services reports the number of deaths linked to COVID-19, the illness caused by the coronavirus, reached 1,216 Thursday, up from 1,158 Wednesday. State figures also show 116 COVID-related deaths over the past three days.\n\nThe number of confirmed coronavirus cases reported to the state rose by at least 1,800 in one day to almost 44,000 on Thursday. However, the true number is likely higher because many people have not been tested, and studies suggest people can be infected and not feel sick.\n\nThe biggest jump in the number of cases reported Thursday came in Dallas County, where 243 new cases were reported, bringing its total to 6,602. That was still second to Harris County, where 205 new cases reported Thursday brought its total to 8,621. The biggest increase in COVID-19-related deaths was reported in El Paso County, which reported eight new deaths on Thursday. The highest death toll remained in Harris County, where five new deaths reported Thursday brought its total to 188.\n\nFor most people, the new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia and death.\n\n63 WORKERS AT SOUTH TEXAS MEAT PLANT TEST POSITIVE FOR COVID-19\n\nThe 747 workers at the STX Beef plant were tested for COVID-19 from Saturday through Wednesday, Nueces County Health Director Annette Rodriguez said. No evidence was found of food or food packaging being associated with coronavirus transmission, she said, and there have been no reports of meat contamination.\n\nIn a statement, STX Beef has said it is implementing extra safety precautions, including face masks, face shields, social distancing measures in break rooms and other safety measures.\n\nOn Wednesday, a JBS USA meatpacking plant in the Texas Panhandle accepted the state's offer to test employees for the coronavirus as officials try to contain a cluster of infections connected to the facility. Hundreds of cases of COVID-19 have been linked to the Moore County plant near Amarillo, and Gov. Greg Abbott has singled out the county as an area of concern.\n\nOutbreaks have hit meat plants across the country. President Trump has ordered them to remain open, but Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden called the plants among \"the most dangerous places there are right now.\"\n\nHIGH COURT LETS STAND APPEALS COURT STAY OF INMATE COVID-19 RELIEF\n\nJustice Samuel Alito's decision Thursday let stand a 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruling that held up a lower-court order that Texas must take additional measures to protect the health of inmates at a prison that houses mostly older and infirm men.\n\nThe class-action suit was brought by two men who contend conditions at the Pack Unit, near Navasota, about 60 miles northwest of Houston, violate their constitutional rights.\n\nCORONAVIRUS: WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW\n\nAfter weeks of litigation and the death of one Pack Unit prisoner who had COVID-19, U.S. District Judge Keith Ellison had ordered Texas to take a number of additional steps to protect inmates there from the virus. He wrote the failure to do so showed \"deliberate indifference.\"\n\nRENT-ASSISTANCE PROGRAM RUNS DRY\n\nIn Houston, nearly 12,000 renters applied for the rent-assistance program on Wednesday. The program, to be paid for by federal funding from the CARES Act, was expected to help about 7,000 households.\n\n\"I knew going into it, that the need would be greater than the amount provided. That is why last week I sent a letter urging the federal leaders to commit at least another $100 billion to rent relief and $75 billion to homeowners being foreclosed,\" said Mayor Sylvester Turner. \"We're hoping that Congress will do something.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe program was set up to provide qualified low-to-moderate income Houston residents up to $1,056 in rental assistance for each of the months of April and May.\n\nHouston joins other cities in Texas, including Austin, Dallas and San Antonio, with similar rent assistance programs.",

Sign up here.\n\nTourists appeared ready to roam Grand Canyon National Park again after it partially reopened Friday, despite objections from Navajo officials and others that it could hurt efforts to control the coronavirus.\n\nBy 7:30 a.m., more than two dozen people were enjoying viewpoints along the South Rim.\n\nNATIONAL PARK SERVICE SHARES SAFETY TIPS AS YELLOWSTONE REOPENS\n\nAmong them were friends Jack Covington from Texas and Judy Smith from Tucson, Arizona. They had planned their trip to the Grand Canyon a year ago since Covington had never seen it. They changed their plans and were visiting other places in northern Arizona when they found out the park would be open.\n\n\"We figured we'd go for an adventure, and we got lucky,\" Smith said.\n\nNATIONAL PARK SERVICE TESTS REOPENING, PREPS VISITORS FOR 'NEW NORMAL': HERE'S WHAT TO EXPECT\n\nThe Grand Canyon had been closed since April 1, one of the last big national parks to shut down completely to visitors. At the time, health officials in Coconino County said keeping the park open put employees, residents and tourists at risk.\n\nA spokeswoman for Coconino County Health and Human Services did not immediately return messages seeking comment Friday.\n\nPark officials said the South Rim entrance will only open from 6-10 a.m. through Monday. Commercial services within the park remain closed. Those include hiking trails, visitors centers, hotels and restaurants -- the places people tend to congregate. Visitors were told to bring food, water and hand sanitizer. There are no overnight accommodations available. Some restrooms along with portable ones were available.\n\nMeanwhile, the residential area where more than 2,000 people live year-round was cordoned off with cones and barrels to keep visitors away from the housing areas. About 20 miles (32 kilometers) of roadway were accessible to tourists that allow them to walk along the rim of the canyon and stand at a number of viewpoints.\n\n\"We saw this route as a good option to reopen,\" Grand Canyon spokeswoman Lily Daniels said. \"We're kind of mirroring how the operational stance was prior to us closing, that was a phased closure.\"\n\nIt reopened Friday, in line with the expiration of Gov. Doug Ducey's stay-at-home order.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR COMPLETE CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE\n\nSigns went up reminding tourists to keep their distance from another and stay in groups of less than 10. Park employees also were giving friendly reminders, Daniels said.\n\n\"It's mostly self-awareness, but we are still encouraging the same guidelines that the CDC is putting out,\" she said.\n\nThe National Park Service says it is working with federal, state and local public health authorities to closely monitor the pandemic and using a phased approach to increase access on a park-by-park basis.\n\n\"This initial reopening phase will increase access to our public lands in a responsible way by offering the main feature of the park for the public, the view of the canyon, while reducing the potential exposure of COVID-19 to our nearly 2,500 residents,\" Grand Canyon National Park Superintendent Ed Keable said.\n\nThe Grand Canyon will also be open from Friday to Monday of Memorial Day weekend with increased access and extended hours.\n\nThe parks gets about 6 million visitors a year, most of whom go to the South Rim. Those entrance gates were open Friday, and tourists were allowed in free. Visitors were blocked from entering at the East Rim entrance to limit travel through the Navajo Nation, where coronavirus has hit residents hard.\n\nHowever, officials on the Navajo Nation, which stretches into northern Arizona, expressed disappointment at the reopening. There have been at least 3,632 positive cases and 127 deaths on the reservation, which also includes parts of New Mexico and Utah.\n\n\"We welcome the economic benefits that tourists bring, but we are also fearful of the potential negative impacts and had hoped that when the Grand Canyon closed on April 1, the park would remain closed until our positive COVID-19 numbers have flattened,\" Navajo Nation President Jonathan Nez said.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe Sierra Club also cited the Navajo Nation in its criticism of the reopening. Alicyn Gitlin of the Sierra Club's Grand Canyon Chapter said it could result in a \"patrolling and enforcement nightmare.\"\n\n\"Cases in Coconino County where Grand Canyon's South Rim is located are still rising,\" Gitlin said. \"The large population that lives at Grand Canyon and all nearby communities are put at risk by this move.\"\n\nFor most people, the new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia, and death.",

Ferguson repeatedly invited his married mistress over to his apartment for sex. Perhaps most striking of all, he was infected with the coronavirus at the time.\"\n\nWhen confronted by the Telegraph, Carlson added, Ferguson attempted to explain himself by saying, \"I acted in the belief that I was immune, having tested positive for coronavirus and completely isolated myself for almost two weeks after developing symptoms.\"\n\nHowever, Carlson said it was not clear that Ferguson was immune from the virus during all of his encounters with his lover.\n\n\"For a famous scientist, Neil Ferguson is curiously ignorant of science. He's also obviously an appalling hypocrite, and he's not alone in that,\" Carlson said. \"So many of the people making our policies are like this almost compulsively.\"\n\n\"Again and again, they do the very things they punish us for doing when they're caught. They acknowledge no shame,\" Carlson said. \"They are entirely lacking in self-awareness. They have no idea how absurd they are.

On some level, they do. They know they're hypocritical frauds. And that's exactly why they lecture you so hysterically. It makes them feel better.\"\n\n\"It's just so obvious they simply don't care enough about your opinion to bother with what you think,\" Carlson said. \"That's all of them.

        "body": "Tucker: Only science will free us from this pandemic\n\nReal science is complicated and hard and often incremental.\n\nGet all the latest news on coronavirus and more delivered daily to your inbox. Sign up here.\n\nFrom early on in this crisis, we took the virus seriously, but we doubted that Chinese-style lockdowns were a wise response to the Chinese coronavirus. Even if they worked as advertised and as you just heard, there's now overwhelming evidence that they don't work as advertised, despite what politicians continue to say.\n\nMass quarantines under the best circumstances are really just a stopgap. The only way to tame a virus like this is with science.\n\nA single effective treatment would make all the difference right away. You wouldn't have to cure every sick patient, but if you could cure a significant number of sick patients and lower the death rate, this would be a completely different country.\n\nHope would return. Fear would reside. We could begin to regard this as a manageable illness as we do so many other illnesses.\n\nLARRY ELDER: BELIEF THAT CORONAVIRUS CAME FROM A CHINESE LAB GAINS INCREASING CREDENCE\n\nMore than 600,000 Americans, for example, will die this year from cancer. That's a tragic number. You doubtless know some of them.\n\nBut we accept it, and we live our lives bravely in the face of it, in part because cancer, horrible as it is, isn't very mysterious anymore.\n\nThere are treatments for it. Those treatments, sadly, don't always work, but they work often enough that we can manage to live without panic.\n\nIt's been obvious from day one that the main goal here as we fight this pandemic has got to be finding effective treatments for the virus.\n\nThat's obvious, and most people understand it intuitively.\n\nThe president does. He regularly uses his daily press briefings to tout potential new medical advances.\n\nOne of the first off-label drugs that doctors around the world used to treat the coronavirus was hydroxychloroquine.\n\nHydroxychloroquine is a cheap, decades-old medicine long recognized as a therapeutic for lupus and rheumatoid arthritis -- autoimmune diseases.\n\nIt was originally an antimalarial drug. If you've traveled to the third world, it's entirely possible you have already taken this drug. Early evidence suggested that hydroxychloroquine might be promising. Physicians in the hardest-hit countries, Spain and Italy, fox example, reported that it was their preferred treatment for the coronavirus.\n\nOne day, from the podium, the president touted the drug as a promising lead.\n\nFrom that moment on, precisely that moment, in the minds of the partisans in our media establishment, hydroxychloroquine was purely a political issue.\n\nThe drug was no longer a medicine or therapy. It was the medical equivalent of Vladimir Putin.\n\nIt was a cudgel they could swing in the air mindlessly to hit their ideological opponents in hopes of political gain. They ignored evidence that hydroxychloroquine might be effective in some ways. They waited anxiously for evidence that it might not be, and the other day they got it. Several recent studies suggested hydroxychloroquine is unlikely to help people who are already severely ill with the coronavirus.\n\nFor most Americans, this was disappointing news. They wanted it to work. But at CNN, it was cause for celebration. The network produced a video for its website tallying up every time the president had mentioned hydroxychloroquine.\n\nOver at The Washington Post, which so often seems to work in tandem with CNN and shock troops for the Democratic Party, a person called Philip Bump produced a 3,000-word timeline looking at \"the rise and fall of Trump's obsession with hydroxychloroquine.\"\n\nIt was yet another exercise in deep irony.\n\nBump himself obsessively chronicled every time the president as much as retweeted a mention of the drug. Bump logged the precise number of times that hydroxychloroquine was mentioned on this channel and on Fox Business.\n\nPaging Dr. Freud: It's possible that Mr. Bump may be exhibiting symptoms of obsession.\n\nEarlier this week, Bump wrote yet another article on the same topic, and he ended that piece this way with a suggestion of a sinister conspiracy at work, writing, \"Why promote that drug and why so energetically?\" Hmm. He left the question hanging in the air.\n\nPhilip Bump doesn't believe in human optimism. He always assumes a secret agenda.\n\nBut as usual, this was pure projection. What the creeps in big media accuse you of doing, every single time, they are fervently doing themselves. They're the ones obsessed with hydroxychloroquine.\n\nMost people just want a drug that works. Those in the media are the ones with a weird, unspoken agenda that's obvious, and yet hidden.\n\nMost people in this country just want a drug that works, and in fact, in some circumstances, this drug may work. Hydroxychloroquine is still being used to treat coronavirus patients.\n\nDozens of studies of its effectiveness are now in progress, still, at this hour. Many doctors believe it can help if used early or in mild cases of the disease. Veterans Affairs Secretary Robert Wilkie recently said as much in an interview with Stephanie Ruhle on MSNBC recently:\n\nQUESTION: President Trump has touted this, but it is linked to higher rates of death in the V.A. coronavirus related. Can you elaborate? What's going on with this drug?\n\nROBERT WILKIE, SECRETARY OF DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS: Sure. That's an observational study. It's not a clinical study.\n\nIt was done on a small number of veterans.\n\nSadly, those of whom were in the last stages of life, and the drug was given to them. And I have to -- I have to also say that the drug -- we know the drug has been working on middle age and younger veterans.\n\nOh, so correlation is not causation. These are deep waters. Many people on television are not prepared. They're not wearing their swimsuits.\n\nIn real life, we are getting mixed results. We need to know more.\n\nThis is how science actually works. It's why we still haven't cured cancer despite decades of working on it. But we have prolonged the lives of cancer patients significantly.\n\nThat's a victory.\n\nThese are the kinds of victories you get in this business. Real science is complicated and difficult and almost always incremental.\n\nThe party of science no longer understands that because they left science a long time ago.\n\nKaren Whitsett is a Democratic lawmaker in the state of Michigan. She believes she was suffering from coronavirus and steadily getting worse until she received hydroxychloroquine from her physician. Then she recovered.\n\nWhitsett came on this show to explain what happened, and as she explained it, she gave some credit to a president she didn't vote for.\n\nKAREN WHITSETT (D), MICHIGAN STATE REPRESENTATIVE: Dr. Arsiwala did save my life and I do credit, you know, the president to doing so and putting this out there because it wasn't accessible to me if it weren't for that fact.\n\nCARLSON: Yes.\n\nWHITSETT: I had very little time to be able to get to this and be able to make it because my breathing did become very labored.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nSo, you just saw a woman who at bare minimum went through a harrowing experience and escaped with her life. We should celebrate, but not everybody is.\n\nA Detroit branch of the Democratic Party says it plans to censure Whitsett and expel her from the Democratic Party for daring to meet with the president after she got well. They didn't congratulate her for surviving. They punished her for violating party orthodoxy.",

Additional clinics will be sent to more facilities \"as needed.\"\n\nCDC ISSUES GUIDELINES FOR MEAT AND POULTRY WORKERS AMID CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC\n\nTyson's announcement comes after several of the company's plants in Illinois, Iowa, Kentucky, Maine, Nebraska, and Washington reported outbreaks of COVID-19 among workers, raising concerns for the well-being of its employees, as well as the security of our nation's food supply.\n\nOne outbreak at a plant in Logansport, Ind., has so far infected nearly 900 of the facility's 2,200 employees to date. As of last week, four Tyson Foods employees working in U.S. plants were reported to have died of coronavirus, as well.\n\n\"Tyson is committed to implementing all possible measures to protect our team members,\" said Hector Gonzalez, Tyson Foods' senior vice president of human resources, in a media release. \"We want to reopen our previously idled facilities, but also want to instill confidence in our workers and reassure them that we care deeply about their individual health needs. Our partnership with Matrix Medical Network will allow us to take additional precautions to help keep our employees safe.\"\n\nServices provided by the mobile clinics will include diagnostic testing for COVID-19, daily on-site screenings, on-site nurse practitioner care, and educational and support resources for employees. The Matrix Medical Network will also be assisting with the \"environmental design of Tyson facilities to mitigate the risk of COVID-19 spread,\" per the release.\n\nThese measures will supplement Tyson Foods' current precautionary measures, which include temperature screenings, new social-distancing protocols, installing dividers, requiring facial protection, and encouraging workers to stay home if exhibiting symptoms.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER\n\nThe shutdowns of Tyson's facilities -- as well as those of meat-processing plants operated by Smithfield and JBS, among others -- had prompted Tyson Foods Chairman John H. Tyson to take out a full-page ad in Sunday's New York Times, Washington Post and Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, to outline the company's response to the ongoing coronavirus health crisis. He also stated that further closures would put more stress on the nation's food supply.\n\n\"The food supply chain is breaking,\" Tyson warned earlier this week.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR FOX NEWS' CONTINUING CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE\n\nIn the following days, financial analysts and industry insiders claimed that consumers could be seeing less selection in their supermarket meat aisles as early as next week.",

Workers who tested positive will receive paid leave and will not return to work until they have met requirements set by the CDC and Tyson.\n\nIn a press release on its website, Tyson revealed that 570 workers tested positive at the plant, where 2,244 team members were tested.

According to Johns Hopkins University, the U.S. lost 1,433 people to coronavirus on April 20, adding to the overall death toll of 42,364.\n\nAccording to the data, nearly 93 percent of all U.S. deaths from the pandemic have occurred in the past three weeks, 44 percent of which have occurred over the last seven days. But after several sharp spikes last week, the number seems to be slowing, with the data reflecting an average of 600 less deaths than previous days.\n\nCORONAVIRUS IN THE US: STATE-BY-STATE BREAKDOWN\n\nThe news comes as several states begin cautiously plotting out plans to slowly reopen businesses as early as the end of this week. Georgia, which as of Tuesday had 19,398 cases and at least 774 deaths, will reopen gyms, hair salons and other businesses beginning on Friday.\n\nGov. Brian Kemp, who earlier this month ordered Georgia's schools to remain closed for the rest of the 2019-20 school year, said Monday that his state would expand COVID-19 testing and that hospitals were in a position to resume elective surgeries after securing necessary protective personal equipment.\n\nAMERICA CAN'T REOPEN WITHOUT MASSIVE INCREASE IN CORONAVIRUS TESTS, EXPERTS WARN\n\n\"Given the favorable data, enhanced testing, and approval of our healthcare professionals, we will allow gyms, fitness centers, bowling alleys, body art studios, barbers, cosmetologists, hair designers, nail care artists, estheticians, their respective schools and massage therapists to reopen their doors this Friday,\" Kemp said.\n\nMeanwhile, South Carolina, which has at least 4,439 COVID-19 cases and 124 deaths, said businesses previously deemed nonessential could begin reopening to customers as early as 5 p.m. on Monday, but would need to adhere to social distancing guidelines. Gov. Henry McMaster also \"restored public beach access for locals.\"\n\nThere was no decision on whether the state would be reopening schools.\n\nExperts have cautioned about re-opening the country too early without widespread testing availability, over fears that doing so would create another spike in the number of cases and further increase the death toll. Data compiled by the CDC indicates that, since the start of April, up to 140,000 COVID-19 tests per day have been conducted in the U.S., but several experts caution that number is far too low, and it's targeted at the wrong patient populations.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR COMPLETE CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE\n\n\"The United States isn't performing anywhere near enough tests. Worse still, we are testing the wrong people. To safely reopen closed businesses and revive American social life, we need to perform many more tests -- and focus them on the people most likely to spread COVID-19, not sick patients,\" oncologist Ezekiel Emanuel and Nobel Laureate economist Paul Romer, wrote in DefenseOne.\n\nOthers have called for widespread coronavirus antibody testing to determine who can safely return to work, which have begun to roll out in some areas of the country. In one study conducted in Santa Clara County, researchers found that the true number of coronavirus infections may be 85 times higher than what's been recorded. The Stanford-University-led researchers said their findings could help better determine the virus' true fatality rate.\n\nAnother antibody study in Los Angeles found that 4.1 percent of the county's adult population had been exposed to the virus. Based on the county's population, that means that between 221,000 and 442,000 adults in the area have previously been infected, the study estimated.\n\nCORONAVIRUS ANTIBODY TESTING FINDS BAY AREA INFECTIONS MAY BE 85 TIMES HIGHER THAN REPORTED: STUDY\n\n\"We haven't known the true extent of COVID-19 infections in our community because we have only tested people with symptoms, and the availability of tests has been limited,\" said lead investigator Neeraj Sood, professor of public policy at the USC Price School for Public Policy. \"The estimates also suggest that we might have to recalibrate disease prediction models and rethink public health strategies.\"\n\nThe U.S. still leads the world in both COVID-19 cases and fatalities. Italy has the second-highest number of fatalities, at 24,114, while China, where the outbreak began, has not updated its count since Friday.\n\nFox News' Louis Casiano, David Aaro and Christopher Carbone contributed to this report.",

        "body": "A U.S. Navy sailor assigned to the USS Roosevelt has died from coronavirus.\n\nGet all the latest news on coronavirus and more delivered daily to your inbox. Sign up here.\n\nThe U.S. aircraft carrier USS Theodore Roosevelt is returning to sea, nearly two months after the ship was sidelined in Guam with a rapidly growing coronavirus outbreak, U.S. officials said.\n\n\"The ship left Naval Base Guam and entered the Philippine Sea May 21 to conduct carrier qualification flights,\" according to a U.S. Navy statement.\n\nIn an interview from the aircraft carrier, Navy Capt. Carlos Sardiello said Monday the ship will sail with a scaled-back crew of about 3,000, leaving about 1,800 sailors on shore who are still in quarantine.\n\nThose include up to 14 sailors who recently tested positive again, just days after getting cleared to return to the carrier. The puzzling COVID-19 reappearance in the sailors adds to the difficulty in getting the ship's crew healthy again, and fuels questions about the quality of the testing and just how long sailors may remain infected or contagious.\n\nThe Roosevelt has been at the center of a widening controversy that led to the firing of the ship's previous captain, the resignation of the Navy secretary and an expanded investigation into what triggered the outbreak and how well top naval commanders handled it.\n\nMore than 1,000 sailors on the ship have tested positive over the past two months, and the entire crew has had to cycle through quarantine on shore before being allowed to reboard.\n\nCHINA STEPPING UP CORONAVIRUS-ERA 'HARASSMENT' OF U.S. SPY PLANES, WARSHIPS, OFFICIAL SAYS\n\nPreparing to go back to sea has been an intense process, requiring sailors to go through mandated preparations and training to ensure all the systems are working and that troops are ready despite the added requirements of masks, constant cleaning, social distancing and other virus-related restrictions.\n\nSardiello said they were able to get special black neck gaiters for the flight deck crew, because wearing regular masks wouldn't be safe. And they've set up one-way corridors, spaced out berthing for the crew members, and are keeping mess halls open longer so fewer sailors are there at any one time.\n\nThe crew will conduct carrier qualifications for the flight-deck crew, including fighter jet take-offs and landings. After about two weeks, the carrier plans to return to Guam to pick up healthy sailors who have finished quarantine and then return to sea.\n\nAfter the outbreak was discovered and the ship docked in Guam, more than 4,000 crew members went ashore for testing and quarantine, while about 800 remained on the ship to protect and run the high-tech systems, including the nuclear reactors that run the vessel.\n\nIn recent weeks, sailors were methodically brought back on board, while the others who had remained went ashore for quarantine.\n\nSardiello, a former Roosevelt captain, was abruptly sent back to the ship in early April to take command after Capt. Brett Crozier was fired for urging his commanders to take faster action to stem the virus outbreak onboard.\n\nAfter a preliminary review last month, Adm. Mike Gilday, the Navy's top officer, recommended that Crozier be reinstated as ship captain. But the Navy decided to conduct the broader investigation.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThat review, which effectively delays a decision on Crozier's reinstatement, is supposed to be done by the end of the month.\n\nFor most people, the new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia and death.",

Sign up here.\n\nThe ongoing coronavirus pandemic has some looking for ways to keep their immune systems in tip-top shape, and there's evidence that the supplement vitamin D can help with exactly that. But should you take it? And what about its effect on COVID-19?\n\n\"It's important to keep in mind that there are no clinical studies that show the effectiveness of vitamin D or any other supplements or vitamins to treat coronavirus,\" Dr. John Whyte, the chief medical officer of the health care website WebMD, told Fox News.\n\nMOST CHILDREN WITH CORONAVIRUS HAVE MILD SYMPTOMS, RECOVER WITHIN 2 WEEKS: STUDY\n\nHe noted there are some trials underway to study the effectiveness of vitamin D on hospitalized COVID-19 patients -- like this one in Spain, for instance -- but the results are pending.\n\nSpeaking to Fox News, Dr. Linda Anegawa, an internist with the virtual health platform PlushCare, referenced one study that explored vitamin D's role in the prevention of the common cold. Researchers analyzed data from 25 clinical trials involving more than 10,000 patients.\n\nBut, she noted, \"There didn't seem to be much risk reduction (40 percent reduction in the vitamin D group and 42 percent in the placebo group). So it certainly would be a stretch to say that vitamin D can prevent or treat COVID-19 based on the current data available.\"\n\nThat aside, medical professionals already know that vitamin D helps to strengthen bones, and Anegawa noted that the supplement also \"regulates cellular function throughout the body.\"\n\n\"With respect to the immune system, vitamin D is known to participate in the activation of certain types of white blood cells which fight infections,\" she added.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR COMPLETE CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE\n\nAbout 40 percent of Americans are vitamin D deficient, said Whyte, and with the seemingly endless stay-at-home orders in some states, he pointed out that people are staying inside more than normal (vitamin D levels can be influenced by sun exposure.)\n\n\"Given that many of us are inside, and under stay at home orders, it could be worthwhile to consider taking vitamin D supplements,\" he said, adding that people who are deficient in the nutrient, as demonstrated by a lab, should \"certainly\" take the supplement.\n\nThe nutrient can be found in fish, such as salmon, as well as dairy products, such as milk. He recommended 600 to 800 international units of vitamin D each day, a level common in many multivitamins. But he warned against \"megadoses,\" as \"too much is not a good thing and can cause problems.\" (You can learn more about vitamin D toxicity here.)\n\nEARLY SYMPTOM OF CORONAVIRUS MIGHT BE DIGESTIVE ISSUES: STUDY\n\nAnegawa echoed Whyte.\n\n\"If you are vitamin D deficient, it would certainly make sense to take a supplement, but general supplementation doesn't seem to provide an antiviral benefit to those with normal levels. If you are at risk for low vitamin D (suffering from obesity, low sunlight exposure, or have poor gut absorption of vitamins in general), consider asking your physician for testing.\"",

Sign up here.\n\nBANGKOK (AP) -- The World Health Organization said Tuesday that rushing to ease coronavirus restrictions will likely lead to a resurgence of the illness, a warning that comes as governments start rolling out plans to get their economies up and running again.\n\n\"This is not the time to be lax. Instead, we need to ready ourselves for a new way of living for the foreseeable future.\"\n\n-- Dr. Takeshi Kasai, the WHO regional director for the Western Pacific\n\n\"This is not the time to be lax. Instead, we need to ready ourselves for a new way of living for the foreseeable future,\" said Dr. Takeshi Kasai, the WHO regional director for the Western Pacific.\n\nHe said governments must remain vigilant to stop the spread of the virus and the lifting of lockdowns and other social distancing measures must be done gradually and strike the right balance between keeping people healthy and allowing economies to function.\n\nLADY GAGA CALLS WHO CHIEF 'SUPERSTAR,' PRAISES MEDIA -- AS TRUMP LOOKS TO DEFUND AGENCY\n\nDespite concerns from health officials, some U.S. states on Monday announced aggressive reopening plans, while Boeing and at least one other U.S. heavy-equipment manufacturer resumed production. Elsewhere around the world, step-by-step reopenings were underway in Europe, where the crisis has begun to ebb in places such as Italy, Spain and Germany.\n\nAustralia said Tuesday that it will allow the resumption of non-urgent surgeries from next week as health authorities grow more confident that hospitals there won't be overwhelmed by COVID-19 patients.\n\nThe reopenings come as politicians grow weary of soaring unemployment numbers and the prospect of economic depression. Asian shares followed Wall Street lower on Tuesday after U.S. oil futures plunged below zero because of a worldwide glut as factories, automobiles and airplanes sit idled.\n\nThe cost to have a barrel of U.S. crude delivered in May plummeted to negative $37.63 as traders run out of places to store it. It was at roughly $60 at the start of the year.\n\nBusinesses that start operating again in the U.S. are likely to engender good will with President Donald Trump at a time when his administration is doling out billions in relief to companies. Trump has been agitating to restart the economy, singling out Democratic-led states and egging on protesters complaining that the shutdowns are destroying their livelihoods and trampling their rights.\n\nTRUMP ANNOUNCES US WILL HALT FUNDING TO WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION OVER CORONAVIRUS RESPONSE\n\nIn several states -- most of them Republican-led -- governors said they had seen signs that the coronavirus curve was flattening, making it possible to start reopening businesses and public spaces.\n\nGeorgia Gov. Brian Kemp announced plans to restart his state's economy before the end of the week. Kemp said gyms, hair salons, bowling alleys and tattoo parlors could reopen Friday, as long as owners followed strict social distancing and hygiene requirements.\n\nTexas on Monday began a week of slow reopenings, starting off with state parks, while officials said that later in the week, stores would be allowed to offer curbside service. Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee announced that businesses across most of the state would begin reopening as early as next week, although the order did not cover counties with the largest cities, including Nashville, Memphis, Knoxville and Chattanooga. Both states are led by Republicans.\n\nRepublican West Virginia Gov. Jim Justice said Monday that he would allow hospitals to begin performing elective procedures if the facilities met an unspecified set of criteria, while Democratic Colorado Gov. Jared Polis said Monday that he would let his statewide stay-at-home order expire next week as long as strict social distancing and other individual protective measures continued.\n\nHOW COMPLICIT IS THE WHO IN CHINA'S CORONAVIRUS COVER-UP?\n\nBut governors from many other states said they lacked the testing supplies they need and warned they could get hit by a second wave of infections, given how people with no symptoms can still spread the disease.\n\n\"Who in this great state actually believes that they care more about jet skiing than saving the lives of the elderly or the vulnerable?\" Democratic Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer remarked, referring to restrictions in place in her state. \"This action isn't about our individual right to gather. It's about our parents' right to live.\"\n\nBoeing said it was putting about 27,000 people back to work this week building passenger jets at its Seattle-area plants, with virus-slowing precautions in place, including face masks and staggered shifts. Boeing's shutdown went into effect March 25 after workers tested positive for the virus and an inspector for the company died. Washington was the first state to see a spike in COVID-19 cases and enacted strict shutdown orders that helped tamp down the virus.\n\nDoosan Bobcat, a farm equipment maker and North Dakota's largest manufacturer, said about 2,200 workers at three factories around the state returned. Company spokeswoman Stacey Breuer said the reopening came after two weeks spent putting in safety measures.\n\n\"There is definitely still some concern and do we feel 100% safe? Obviously not,\" said William Wilkinson, a Bobcat welder and president of a United Steelworkers union local. He said workers there were wearing face masks and keeping their distance from one another.\n\nWorldwide the virus has infected nearly 2.5 million people and caused more than 170,000 deaths, according to a Johns Hopkins University count. The U.S. has been the hardest hit country with more than 787,000 infections and more than 42,000 deaths.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe true figures are believed to be much higher, in part because of limited testing and difficulties in counting the dead.\n\nThere have been encouraging signs in places like New York state, where hospitalizations have leveled off. Monday's death toll, at 478, was the lowest in three weeks, down from a peak of nearly 800.\n\nDr. Anthony Fauci, the government's top infectious-disease expert, warned on ABC: \"Unless we get the virus under control, the real recovery economically is not going to happen.\"",

It was held nearly two weeks before the state's stay-at-home order.\n\n\"One individual present felt ill, not knowing what they had, and ended up infecting 52 other people,\" said lead author Lea Hamner, calling the outbreak a tragedy.\n\nWASHINGTON CHOIR REHEARSAL LINKED TO CORONAVIRUS OUTBREAK AFTER DOZENS OF MEMBERS FALL ILL, 2 DIE\n\nThe Skagit County Public Health [SCPH] report found that the choir practice provided several opportunities for respiratory transmission, including members \"sitting close to one another, sharing snacks, and stacking chairs at the end of the practice.\"\n\nThe choir members reportedly sat in chairs that were spaced 6 to 10 inches apart with a center aisle dividing left and right stages. While they were within the recommended social distancing space, the report found \"the act of singing, itself, might have contributed to [the] transmission through emission of aerosols.\"\n\n\"Aerosol emission during speech has been correlated with loudness of vocalization, and certain persons, who release an order of magnitude more particles than their peers,\" the report said, which was published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nThose who release more particles than their peers are described as superemitters, which researchers added could have contributed to the choir spread and previously reported COVID-19 superspreading events.\n\nThe spread could have also been much worse if not for the actions by the county's public health department and the decision by many of the group's members to voluntarily self-isolate -- after 24 members reported that they had developed influenza-like symptoms, according to the report.\n\nWASHINGTON STATE RESTAURANTS ORDERED TO KEEP LOGS OF CUSTOMERS WHEN REOPENING AFTER CORONAVIRUS OUTBREAK\n\n\"The choir mitigated further spread by quickly communicating to its members and notifying SCPH of a cluster of cases on March 18,\" it said. \"When first contacted by SCPH during March 18-20, nearly all persons who attended the practice reported they were already self-isolating or quarantining.\"\n\nSCPH later provided practice attendees with isolation and quarantine instructions, while contacts of patients were traced and notified of isolation and quarantine guidelines. Those who did not have symptoms at the initial interview were instructed to quarantine for 14 days from the last practice they had attended, according to the report.\n\nThe choir group also had 122 members, but only half of them attended the practice on March 10.\n\nThe rapid spread shows how deadly and contagious the virus could be, especially with older populations -- as their median age of those who attended was 69-years-old.\n\nThe singers felt their first symptoms -- cough, fever, muscle pain, or headaches -- one to 12 days after the practice.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE\n\nUnderstanding how the coronavirus spreads is important for preventing and tracking the disease it causes. The CDC recommends avoiding large groups, wearing cloth masks in public, and staying at least six feet apart from others.\n\nOther superspreader events include a Chicago cluster of 16 cases, including three deaths, stemmed from a funeral and a birthday party. South Korea is investigating an outbreak linked to nightclubs reopening earlier this month.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report",

Sign up here.\n\nFederal health officials now advise wearing a homemade face mask while in public, recently changing the guidelines in a bid to protect more Americans from contracting the novel coronavirus. But in some states, a face covering of some kind is no longer an option: it's a requirement -- if you're going out in public, at least.\n\nAs the epidemic of the novel coronavirus, or COVID-19, continues to overwhelm America's health care workers who grapple to treat the worst patients, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) earlier this month changed its guidelines to urge citizens to do their part in stopping the spread, which now includes protecting your face with some type of cloth covering when you step out of the safety of your home to restock on essential goods.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR COMPLETE CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE\n\nThe CDC only recently changed its recommendations \"in light of new evidence\" that shows \"a significant portion\" of those with the novel virus is either asymptomatic -- meaning they lack symptoms altogether -- or presymptomatic, meaning they can spread the virus to others without first showing signs of it themselves.\n\n\"This means that the virus can spread between people interacting in close proximity -- for example, speaking, coughing or sneezing -- even if those people are not exhibiting symptoms,\" the CDC stated in its updated guidelines.\n\nA facial covering -- not to be confused with a surgical mask or an N95 respirator, both of which are in low supply and should be reserved for frontline medical workers -- can be made from a few simple items likely found around your home, no sewing required. You can find an easy how-to here.\n\nRead on for a look at what states have issued executive orders mandating that face masks be worn while in public.\n\nConnecticut\n\nConnecticut Gov. Ned Lamont issued an executive order mandating some type of face mask for everyone over the age of 2, effective beginning April 20.\n\n\"Any person in a public place in Connecticut who is unable to or does not maintain a safe social distance of approximately six feet from every other person shall cover their mouth and nose with a mask or cloth face-covering,\" the order reads.\n\nThe coverings are also required when using public transportation or when riding in a taxi, Uber or another ride-sharing service.\n\nAdditionally, essential employees -- those who cannot work from home -- are also required to wear a face mask or face covering.\n\nHawaii\n\nBeginning April 20, Hawaii residents must wear a face covering \"while waiting to enter and while at an essential business or operation,\" according to the order from Gov. David Ige.\n\n\"All employees of essential businesses or operations who have any contact with customers or goods to be purchased shall wear the cloth face-covering recommended by the CDC while at their place of employment,\" the order states.\n\nMaryland\n\nIn Maryland, Gov. Larry Hogan issued an executive order that mandates citizens to wear a face covering while using public transportation in the state. Residents over the age of 9 are also required to wear a mask or covering when shopping in essential \"retail or food service\" establishments. The same applies to staff members at essential businesses.\n\nAdditionally, adults \"shall use reasonable efforts\" to have any children between the ages of 2 and 9 who accompany them during outings to use face masks or coverings, as per the order.\n\nNew Jersey\n\nSimilar to other states, New Jersey also requires its residents to wear a face covering while in public.\n\nIn an executive order that took effect April 8, Gov. Phil Murphy said employees and customers at essential businesses must wear them, as must anyone working for or using New Jersey public transportation.\n\nNew York\n\nEffective April 17, New Yorkers over the age of 2 and \"medically able to tolerate a face covering\" are required to do so, especially when social distancing is not or cannot be maintained, as per the executive order from Gov. Andrew Cuomo.\n\nPennsylvania\n\nEffective April 19, employees at essential businesses are required to wear face coverings while on the job. Employers must provide employees with a mask, according to the state's Department of Health.\n\nCustomers are also required to wear them and can be denied entry to the business \"unless the business is providing medication, medical supplies or food, in which case the business must provide alternative methods of pick-up or delivery of such goods,\" Gov. Tom Wolf's office said.\n\nRhode Island\n\nEffective April 18, employees at essential businesses must wear a face mask or covering, according to Gov. Gina Raimondo's executive order.\n\nCORONAVIRUS: WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW\n\nUnless an employee \"can easily, continuously, and measurably maintain at least 6 feet of distance from other employees for the duration of his or her work,\" all employees at essential businesses \"must wear face coverings in any entry, exit and common areas of the business, including, but not limited to: check-in, registration, reception, hallways, bathrooms, breakrooms, time clock areas, elevators, stairways, etc,\" the order reads.\n\nEmployers must provide their employees either face masks or the appropriate materials to make one, as per the order.",

    "When will a COVID-19 vaccine be ready?": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, recently said that a COVID-19 could take 12 to 18 months to develop, test and approve for public use. But new vaccines typically take years to earn approval -- can we really expect a coronavirus vaccine to be ready by summer 2021?\n\nExperts told Live Science that, for any other vaccine, the timeline would be unrealistic. But given the current pressure to stave off the pandemic, a COVID-19 vaccine could be ready sooner, as long as scientists and regulatory agencies prove willing to take a few shortcuts.\n\nHere's why it probably can't be developed any sooner than 12 to 18 months.\n\nMore than 60 candidate vaccines are now in development, worldwide, and several have entered early clinical trials in human volunteers, according to the World Health Organization.\n\nRelated: Treatments for COVID-19: Drugs being tested against the coronavirus\n\nSome groups aim to provoke an immune response in vaccinated people by introducing a weakened or dead SARS-CoV-2 virus, or pieces of the virus, into their bodies. The vaccines for measles, influenza, hepatitis B and the vaccinia virus, which causes smallpox, use these approaches, according to the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services. Although tried-and-tested, using this approach to develop these conventional vaccines was labor-intensive, requiring scientists to isolate, culture and modify live viruses in the lab.\n\nThat initial process of just creating a vaccine can take 3 to 6 months, \"if you have a good animal model to test your product,\" Raul Andino-Pavlovsky, a professor in the Department of Microbiology and Immunology at the University of California, San Francisco, told Live Science.\n\nGiven the current time crunch, some groups have opted for faster, if less conventional, approaches.\n\nThe first COVID-19 vaccine to enter clinical trials in the United States, for example, uses a genetic molecule called mRNA as its base. Scientists generate the mRNA in the lab and, rather than directly injecting SARS-CoV-2 into patients, instead introduce this mRNA. By design, the vaccine should prompt human cells to build proteins found on the virus' surface and thus trigger a protective immune response against the coronavirus. Other groups aim to use related genetic material, including RNA and DNA, to build similar vaccines that would interfere with an earlier step in the protein construction process.\n\nRelated: 10 deadly diseases that hopped across species\n\nBut there's one big hurdle for mRNA vaccines. We can't be sure they will work.\n\nAs of yet, no vaccine built from a germs' genetic material has ever earned approval, Bert Jacobs, a professor of virology at Arizona State University and member of the ASU Biodesign Institute's Center for Immunotherapy, Vaccines and Virotherapy. Despite the technology having existed for almost 30 years, RNA and DNA vaccines have not yet matched the protective power of existing vaccines, National Geographic reported.\n\nAssuming these unconventional COVID-19 vaccines pass initial safety tests, \"will there be efficacy?\" Jacobs said. \"The animal models suggest it, but we'll have to wait and see.\"\n\n\"Because of the emergency here, people are going to try many different solutions in parallel,\" Andino-Pavlovsky said. The key to trialing many vaccine candidates at once will be to share data openly between research groups, in order to identify promising products as soon as possible, he said.\n\nMetrics used to measure efficacy -- whether a vaccine sparks an adequate response from a person's immune system -- in animal studies and early clinical trials will also need to be clearly defined, he added. In other words, researchers should be able to use these early studies to determine which vaccines to move forward with, which to modify and which to abandon. That whole process -- from lab dish to animal studies -- can take 3 to 6 months, Andino-Pavlovsky said.\n\nDesigning a vaccine that grants immunity and causes minimal side effects is no simple task. A coronavirus vaccine, in particular, poses its own unique challenges. Although scientists did create candidate vaccines for the coronaviruses SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, these did not exit clinical trials or enter public use, partly because of lack of resources, Live Science previously reported.\n\n\"One of the things you have to be careful of when you're dealing with a coronavirus is the possibility of enhancement,\" Fauci said in an interview with the journal JAMA on April 8. Some vaccines cause a dangerous phenomenon known as antibody dependent enhancement (AED), which paradoxically leaves the body more vulnerable to severe illness after inoculation.\n\nRelated: Could a 100-year-old vaccine protect against COVID-19?\n\nCandidate vaccines for dengue virus, for example, have generated low levels of antibodies that guide the virus to vulnerable cells, rather than destroying the pathogen on sight, Stat News reported. Coronavirus vaccines for animal diseases and the human illness SARS triggered similar effects in animals, so there's some concern that a candidate vaccine for SARS-CoV-2 might do the same, according to an opinion piece published March 16 in the journal Nature. Scientists should watch for signs of AED in all upcoming COVID-19 vaccine trials, Fauci said. Determining whether enhancement is occurring could happen during initial animal studies, but \"it is still unclear how we will look for AED,\" Jacobs said.\n\n\"Once there is a good animal model which gives symptoms after SARS-CoV-2 infection, we can ask if vaccination decreases or enhances pathogenesis,\" he said. \"These may be longer term studies that could take several months.\" The AED studies could be done in parallel with other animal trials to save time, Andino-Pavlovsky added.\n\nThere's another challenge too.\n\nA successful coronavirus vaccine will snuff the spread of SARS-CoV-2 by reducing the number of new people infected, Andino-Pavlovsky said. COVID-19 infections typically take hold in so-called mucosal tissues that line the upper respiratory tract, and to effectively prevent viral spread, \"you need to have immunity at the site of infection, in the nose, in the upper respiratory tract,\" he said.\n\nThese initial hotspots of infection are easily permeated by infectious pathogens. A specialized fleet of immune cells, separate from those that patrol tissues throughout the body, are responsible for protecting these vulnerable tissues. The immune cells that protect mucosal tissue are generated by cells called lymphocytes that remain nearby, according to the textbook \"Immunobiology: The Immune System in Health and Disease\" (Garland Science, 2001).\n\n\"It's like your local police department,\" Andino-Pavlovsky told Live Science. But not all vaccines prompt a strong response from the mucosal immune system, he said. The seasonal influenza vaccine, for example, does not reliably trigger a mucosal immune response in all patients, which partly explains why some people still catch the respiratory disease after being vaccinated, he said.\n\nEven if a COVID-19 vaccine can jumpstart the necessary immune response, researchers aren't sure how long that immunity might last, Jacobs added. While research suggests that the coronavirus doesn't mutate quickly, \"we have seasonal coronaviruses that come, year in [and] year out, and they don't change much year to year,\" he said. Despite hardly changing form, the four coronaviruses that cause the common cold keep infecting people -- so why haven't we built up immunity?\n\nPerhaps, there's something odd about the virus itself, specifically in its antigens, viral proteins that can be recognized by the immune system, and that causes immunity to wear off. Alternatively, coronaviruses may somehow fiddle with the immune system itself, and that could explain the drop-off in immunity over time, Andino-Pavlovsky said. To ensure a vaccine can grant long-term immunity against SARS-CoV-2, scientists will have to address these questions. In the short term, they'll have to design experiments to challenge the immune system after vaccination and test its resilience through time, Jacobs said.\n\nIn a mouse model, such studies could take \"at least a couple of months,\" he said. Scientists cannot conduct an equivalent experiment in humans, but can instead compare natural infection rates in vaccinated people to those of unvaccinated people in a long-term study.\n\n\"When you have the luxury, you look at this for five years, 10 years to see what happens,\" Andino-Pavlovsky added.\n\nUnlike an antiviral treatment for COVID-19 that can be given to patients already infected with the virus, a vaccine must be tested in diverse populations of healthy people.\n\n\"Because you give it to healthy people, there's an enormous pressure to make sure it's absolutely safe,\" Andino-Pavlovsky said. What's more, the vaccine must work well for people of many ages, including the elderly, whose weakened immune systems place them at heightened risk of serious COVID-19 infection.\n\n\"Initially, safety studies will be done in small numbers of people,\" likely fewer than 100, Jacobs said. A vaccine may be approved based on these small studies, which can take place over a few months, and then continually monitored as larger populations become vaccinated, he added. \"That's just my guess.\"\n\nRelated: COVID-19 is now the leading cause of death in the United States\n\nA future vaccine may require an additional ingredient, called an adjuvant, that rallies the aged immune system into action, like that found in the shingles vaccine, Jacobs said.\n\nWhile some existing drugs, whose safety risks doctors understand, may be repurposed as COVID-19 treatments, equivalent data does not exist for a vaccine because no coronavirus vaccine has ever entered widespread use. Jacobs said he and his team aim to exploit a potential loophole to develop a powerful vaccine, fast. \"We use surrogate live attenuated vaccines, where we put parts of SARS-CoV-2 into vaccinia virus [which guards against smallpox], and this can be done initially within a month,\" Jacobs said. In general, many vaccine developers are starting from scratch.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDespite the many challenges ahead, certain shortcuts could allow scientists to bring a COVID-19 vaccine faster than anticipated.\n\nFirst, partnering with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and other regulatory bodies can help scientists leap the logistical hurdles associated with clinical trials, such as recruiting healthy volunteers, Andino-Pavlovsky said. \"It can save six months, doing that,\" he said.\n\nAny potential vaccine will need to pass a safety trial, known as a Phase 1 trial, which also helps determine the needed dose. The next step is a larger trial in 100 to 300 people, called a Phase 2, which looks for some biological activity, but can't say for sure if the drug is effective.\n\nIf a vaccine candidate prompts a promising immune response in Phase 2 clinical trials, after passing safety tests in Phase 1, it's possible that the FDA could approve such a vaccine for emergency use \"before the 18-month period that I said,\" Fauci said in the JAMA interview.\n\n\"If you get neutralizing antibodies,\" which latch onto specific structures on the virus and neutralize it, \"I think you can keep moving forward on it,\" Jacobs said. Normally, a vaccine would then enter Phase 3 clinical trials, which include hundreds to thousands of people.\n\nSo adding up these steps, each of which will likely take 3 to 6 months, it's very unlikely we would be able to find a vaccine that is safe and effective in less than 12 months -- even if many of these steps could be done in parallel.\n\nThen comes the issue of manufacturing billions and billions of doses of a new vaccine whose ingredients we don't yet know. Bill Gates has said that the Gates Foundation will fund the construction of factories for seven coronavirus vaccine candidates, equipping the sites to produce a wide variety of vaccine types, Business Insider reported.\n\n\"Even though we'll end up picking at most two of them, we're going to fund factories for all seven, just so that we don't waste time in serially saying, 'OK, which vaccine works?' and then building the factory,\" Gates said.\n\nEven if a fairly promising vaccine surfaces by 2021, and can be mass-produced, the search won't end there. \"Especially with trying to get something out this quickly, we may not get the best vaccine out there right away,\" Jacobs said. Ideally, an initial vaccine will grant immunity for at least one to two years, but should that immunity wane, a longer lasting vaccine may have to be deployed. Historically, so-called live attenuated vaccines that contain a weakened virus tend to perform most reliably over extended periods of time, Andino-Pavlovsky said.\n\n\"That may be what we need in the long run,\" he said. And research into coronavirus immunity should continue, regardless, \"not only for COVID-19, but for the next coronavirus that comes.\"",

In the case of COVID- 19, it's the adults who are getting the high fevers, having severe complications and even dying.\"\n\nThere are a few theories for why this might be. One is that since children have young immune systems, they don't develop the aggressive immune response known as a \"cytokine storm\" like adults do, which fosters lung damage and often harms adults.\n\nMeanwhile, researchers at Boston Children's Hospital on Tuesday announced a new two-pronged study of children and young adults up to age 25 to examine a wide range of factors that may promote vulnerability in COVID-19.\n\n\"Our major goals are to understand why some children get very ill with COVID-19 and why most children aren't getting sick in the same numbers as adults,\" said Adrienne Randolph, a senior physician in Critical Care Medicine at Boston Children's and the study's principal investigator.\n\nCORONAVIRUS LINGERS IN THE AIR OF CROWDED SPACES, NEW STUDY FINDS\n\n\"Based on what we know about other viruses, such as influenza, we would expect children to be the first to get sick and have more severe disease. If we can understand what protects kids, we may get clues as to why older people are so susceptible,\" Randolph said in a statement.\n\nThe study -- backed by $2.1 million in funding from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) -- will perform real-time surveillance at more than 35 U.S. children's hospitals to capture data on 800 patients hospitalized with COVID-19. In addition, it will enroll up to 400 of these patients for detailed, prospective observation and periodic collection of respiratory and blood samples.\n\nAs of Tuesday afternoon, the novel coronavirus had infected more than 1 million people in the U.S., and at least 57,266 people have died from the disease.",

Tony Evers tried to alter the way the April 7 election was conducted, urging that it be done entirely by mail to prevent the spread of coronavirus, but he was shot down by the Republican-led Legislature and conservative Wisconsin Supreme Court.\n\nWISCONSIN SAW NO CORONAVIRUS INFECTION-RATE SPIKE AFTER APRIL 7 ELECTION, STUDY SAYS\n\nIn general, patients who have COVID-19 begin exhibiting symptoms within 14 days of being exposed to the virus, and all of those individuals who contracted coronavirus and attended the election tested positive by April 21.\n\nHowever, several of these people have admitted that they could have been exposed to the virus by other means unrelated to the election, the Wisconsin Department of Health Services (DHS) said Tuesday.\n\nJulie Willems Van Dijk, who heads the state health agency, said the officials won't continue to include the polling sites as part of contact tracing for future coronavirus cases and said \"the door will be closing\" on those cases linked to the election because too much time has passed.\n\nRepublicans said the low number of cases tied to the election proved that voting was done safely, despite calls from Democrats prior to move the date amid warnings of a spike in positive cases.\n\n\"They sought to exploit a global pandemic to fit their narrative and failed,\" said Mark Jefferson, executive director of the Wisconsin Republican Party.\n\nVoters cast their ballots for both the presidential primary and a state Supreme Court race despite the coronavirus pandemic, which has infected more than 6,200 people and killed 300 others in the state since the outbreak began.\n\nAbout 71 percent of all voters in the April 7 election cast absentee ballots and some are pushing for the same in the upcoming special congressional race on May 12, which is expected to draw a smaller crowd than the state's primary did, with only one House seat up for grabs in the 7th Congressional District.\n\nThe region covers all or parts of 26 northern and northwestern Wisconsin counties and is the state's largest congressional district, geographically. The biggest city in the district is Wausau, with a population of about 40,000 people.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nDemocrat Tricia Zunker, president of the Wausau School Board, will face Republican state Sen.

But according to a new study, practicing yoga may help to offset the blues, at least somewhat.\n\nMARYLAND TEEN DIES OF CORONAVIRUS-RELATED COMPLICATIONS, MOM CLAIMS: 'I AM SO LOST RIGHT NOW'\n\nResearchers with the University of South Australia, in a partnership with the Federal University of Santa Maria, UNSW Sydney, Kings College London, and Western Sydney University, conducted what is said to be the first \"world study\" on the mental health benefits of practicing yoga.\n\nIn a meta-analysis of 180 studies across six countries that involved some 1,080 participants -- all of whom had a \"formal diagnosis of a mental disorder, including depression and anxiety,\" as per a news release on the findings -- researchers found that the participants' mental health improved with \"movement-based yoga,\" with the benefits \"being incremental with the amount of yoga they practiced,\" they said.\n\nMovement-based yoga was defined by the researchers as \"any form of yoga where participants are physically active at least 50 [percent] of the time, that is forms of yoga that emphasize holding poses and flowing through sequences of poses,\" as per the news release.\n\n\"As self-isolation escalates and people find themselves working from home and unable to physically catch up with their friends and family, we're likely to see more people feel lonely and disconnected,\" said lead researcher and University of South Australia Ph.D. candidate Jacinta Brinsley, in a statement. \"Exercise has always been a great strategy for people struggling with these feelings as it boosts both mood and health.

However, she opened the post by revealing that she recently got healthy after testing positive for the virus for a month.\n\n\"I had the coronavirus early on, before the shutdown, and a group of my friends also got it. People keep asking me, 'Where did you get it?' and I wish I knew. I feel like I could have spoken in a more eloquent way about my experience had I known,\" she wrote. \"I continued testing positive for a month, which is longer than they're saying you're supposed to.

I'm so grateful for my health and I also feel guilty, in a way, for making it out okay.\"\n\nCORONAVIRUS VACCINE DEVELOPMENT: WHERE DOES IT STAND?\n\nShe went on to thank her own \"neuroses\" for causing her to stay inside before stay-at-home orders were put in place. She explained that the ordeal of catching the virus alongside several of her friends gave her a clear picture of just how diverse people's experience with COVID-19 can be. As a result, she called on readers to abide by the CDC's guidelines and wear masks in public.\n\n\"The reason I want to talk about it now is because it's so important to wear masks. So many people don't show symptoms, and my experience was that me and my friends who got it all had such drastically different symptoms,\" she explained. \"I had a sore throat and felt totally delirious, like I was losing my mind. It was different than the normal 'me feeling like I'm losing my mind.' One of my friends only lost taste and smell. One went to the hospital with the 'normal' symptoms, but another friend had absolutely no symptoms at all. I stayed inside for almost two months, and I still very minimally go out, with a mask.\"\n\nThe 25-year-old star added: \"I hate to sound like I'm trying to be preachy, but it's so important to wear a mask when you go out, even if you think you're okay and think you don't have it or think it's allergies. You just don't know if you have it or not.\"\n\nWHAT COUNTRIES HAVE NOT DECLARED ANY KNOWN CASES OF CORONAVIRUS?\n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic people can still transmit COVID-19 to others. As a result, it recommends wearing a face covering at all times in public in order for people who may be unaware that they have the coronavirus to avoid transmitting it to someone that could show more dangerous symptoms.\n\nAs of Wednesday morning, the novel coronavirus has infected more than 4,913,761 people across 188 countries and territories, resulting in over 323,637 deaths. In the U.S., all 50 states plus the District of Columbia have reported confirmed cases of COVID-19, tallying over 1,528,661 illnesses and at least 91,938 deaths.\n\nDeutch concluded her statement about her COVID-19 experience by noting that, although she wants to do more to help people during this time, she knows that she now poses a risk of transmitting what she had to others.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"I really want to be able to donate blood and get groceries for people who haven't had it and be more of service than I have been able to,\" she explained. \"I am so lucky to be healthy, that I'm safe and not immunocompromised and have access to doctors; I am incredibly privileged. But not everyone shares that privilege -- so we need to be extra careful for those who don't by wearing masks.\"",
