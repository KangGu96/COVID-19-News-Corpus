Kemp urges the state to re-open.\n\nAlbany, Ga., commissioner Demetrius Young objects to plans to open up nail salons, theaters and other businesses where it's impossible to practice social distancing. \"People are like, what?\" he said.

April 26 at 12:21 PM\n\nSheryl Means already has lost so much to the invisible virus burning through her hometown. Her mother and her aunt died within days of each other. Her sister has been on a ventilator for weeks in a hospital miles away, and there are no visitors allowed in the covid-19 isolation unit. She has this tightness in her chest, and she's scared she might be next.\n\nBut Means can't get a test. Even now, six weeks into a national emergency, with the death toll still climbing in southwest Georgia, and her kin sick from the novel coronavirus. Even though, as a home health care worker, she's at high risk for exposure. She isn't displaying enough symptoms to get the required doctor's referral.\n\nIf she wanted, though, she could get her hair and nails done, since the state's governor invited some businesses to reopen Friday, despite local leaders, public health experts and residents like Means insisting Georgia isn't ready..\n\nThey fear the restart will spike new infections, particularly in the southwest region, with some of the highest death rates in the nation. In these small, interconnected towns, where everyone seems to know everyone else, each death reverberates.\n\n\"It's crazy to open these businesses,\" said Means, a 51-year-old Damascus resident. \"Which do you want us to do: be safe or be sorry? Live or die?\"\n\n[Sign up for our Coronavirus Updates newsletter to track the outbreak. All stories linked in the newsletter are free to access.]\n\nOf the 20 counties in the nation with the most deaths per capita from covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, five are in southwest Georgia, including Early, where Means lives. In the state's hardest-hit places, African Americans make up most of the population, and about 30 percent of residents live in poverty. They've struggled for years with a severe lack of access to health care. Some counties have no doctors, no hospitals and a high percentage of uninsured residents. The facilities and physicians already were stretched thin.\n\nA shuttered downtown Albany may soon exhibit signs of life as restrictions on some businesses are lifted. (Kevin D. Liles for The Washington Post)\n\nThen came the coronavirus, fast-moving and super-infectious, preying on the elderly and those with underlying health problems -- perfectly primed to devastate a vulnerable population.\n\nWhen Gov. Brian Kemp (R) announced he was lifting restrictions on businesses, some residents in this region felt cast off, like the state was telling them to fend for themselves once again.\n\n\"To open up businesses where it's impossible to practice social distancing -- hair salons, nail salons, theaters -- people are like, what? You want to put everybody in a closed room, and that's supposed to be okay?\" said Demetrius Young, a city commissioner in Albany, the center of the state's epidemic. \"For black folks, it's like a set up: Are you trying to kill us?\"\n\nWithout a widespread testing infrastructure and local health departments able to do meticulous contact tracing, Young said, his region will continue to suffer. Georgia ranks 40th in tests per resident, well behind states that have pledged to maintain their shelter-in-place orders, according to an analysis of COVID Tracking Project data. Some models say the state has not yet reached its peak number of daily deaths, suggesting the worst is still to come.\n\nCumulative Covid-19 cases per 100,000 population as of April 14\n\n0\n\n10\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\n200\n\nCounties with African-\n\nAmerican majority\n\nGainesville\n\nCartersville\n\nAthens\n\n50 MILES\n\nAtlanta\n\nAugusta\n\nMacon\n\nColumbus\n\nSavannah\n\nHinesville\n\nAlbany\n\nWaycross\n\nValdosta\n\nCumulative Covid-19 cases per 100,000 population as of April 14\n\n0\n\n10\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\n200\n\nCounties with African-\n\nAmerican majority\n\nGainesville\n\nCartersville\n\nAthens\n\n50 MILES\n\nAtlanta\n\nAugusta\n\nMacon\n\nColumbus\n\nSavannah\n\nHinesville\n\nAlbany\n\nWaycross\n\nValdosta\n\nCumulative Covid-19 cases per 100,000 population as of April 14\n\nCumulative Covid-19 cases per 100,000 population as of April 14\n\n0\n\n0\n\n10\n\n10\n\n50\n\n50\n\n100\n\n100\n\n150\n\n150\n\n200\n\n200\n\nCounties with African-\n\nAmerican majority\n\nCounties with African-\n\nAmerican majority\n\nGainesville\n\nGainesville\n\n50 MILES\n\n50 MILES\n\nCartersville\n\nCartersville\n\nAthens\n\nAthens\n\nAtlanta\n\nAtlanta\n\nAugusta\n\nAugusta\n\nMacon\n\nMacon\n\nColumbus\n\nColumbus\n\nSavannah\n\nSavannah\n\nHinesville\n\nHinesville\n\nAlbany\n\nAlbany\n\nWaycross\n\nWaycross\n\nValdosta\n\nValdosta\n\nNote: Cases shown by census block group\n\nCumulative Covid-19 cases per 100,000 population as of April 14\n\n0\n\n10\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150\n\n200\n\nCounties with African-\n\nAmerican majority\n\nGainesville\n\n50 MILES\n\nCartersville\n\nAthens\n\nAtlanta\n\nAugusta\n\nMacon\n\nColumbus\n\nSavannah\n\nHinesville\n\nAlbany\n\nWaycross\n\nValdosta\n\nNote: Cases shown by census block group\n\n\"We need to save lives,\" Young said. \"The way we feel is, this is another 'Black Lives Matter' moment.\"\n\nGlen Singfield, 67, owns two restaurants in Albany that have been shuttered for more than a month.

Liles for The Washington Post)\n\nThrough Friday, African Americans accounted for more than 50 percent of Georgia's deaths, despite making up about 30 percent of the state's 10.6 million population. The toll is far greater in less-populous counties where the largest share of residents is black.\n\nThe number of cases per capita in plurality-black counties is 1.75 times higher than in plurality-white counties. The number of deaths per capita in plurality-black counties is twice that of white counties.\n\nThere are signs the virus's spread is picking up pace in white communities, too, though the mostly black neighborhoods are still seeing the highest number of cases per capita, according to an analysis of Census block-level data scraped from documents on Georgia's Department of Public Health website.\n\nCovid-19 is killing black Americans at an alarmingly high rate, Post analysis shows\n\nThese disparities illuminate a deep racial inequality: In Georgia, where Kemp has resisted Medicaid expansion, African Americans are less likely to be insured and more likely to have preexisting health conditions like diabetes, said Ben Lopman, a professor of epidemiology at Emory University. They're also more likely to work in industries with a greater risk of exposure such as transportation, nursing homes and animal slaughter plants -- like the still-operating Tyson Foods plant in Mitchell County, where four infected workers have died.\n\n\"In the south, we've seen these kinds of inequalities in health for a long time,\" Lopman said, comparing the pattern to the AIDS epidemic. \"These inequalities are being repeated again for covid.\"\n\nApartments and a mostly empty street near downtown Albany. (Kevin D. Liles for The Washington Post)\n\nStates from Wisconsin to Louisiana are seeing disproportionate numbers as well, but the disparity in Georgia is also geographic. Across the United States, urban counties have higher rates of coronavirus cases and deaths than rural counties. In Georgia, it's the opposite. The state's rural areas have a death rate 1.5 times that of its large cities.\n\n\"Is this an indicator of what we're going to see throughout the country? Absolutely,\" Andrew T. Pavia, head of the pediatric infectious diseases division at the University of Utah School of Medicine, said of rural Georgia at an Infectious Diseases Society of America briefing this week. \"It's a perfect storm for risk of death when the virus lands in these poor, more rural communities.\"\n\nThe resources to fight an epidemic like this -- ventilators, intensive care facilities, infectious disease experts, doctors in general -- are overwhelmingly concentrated in cities, Pavia said, making rural areas particularly vulnerable.\n\nDeath rate from covid-19\n\nNationally\n\n51.8 per\n\n100,000\n\nLarge urban\n\ncities\n\nWithin Georgia\n\n8.3\n\n17.2\n\nLarge\n\ncity suburbs\n\n6.0\n\n6.6\n\nMedium\n\ncities\n\n3.4\n\n5.0\n\nSmall\n\ncities\n\n14.5\n\n3.5\n\nTowns\n\n10.3\n\n3.3\n\nRural\n\n12.7\n\nDeath rate from covid-19\n\nNationally\n\n51.8 per\n\n100,000\n\nLarge urban\n\ncities\n\nWithin Georgia\n\n8.3\n\n17.2\n\nLarge\n\ncity suburbs\n\n6.0\n\n6.6\n\nMedium\n\ncities\n\n3.4\n\n5.0\n\nSmall\n\ncities\n\n14.5\n\n3.5\n\nTowns\n\n10.3\n\n3.3\n\nRural\n\n12.7\n\nDeath rate\n\nfrom covid-19,\n\nnationally\n\n51.8 per 100,000\n\nWithin\n\nGeorgia\n\n17.2\n\n14.5\n\n12.7\n\n10.3\n\n8.3\n\n6.6\n\n6.0\n\n5.0\n\n3.5\n\n3.4\n\n3.3\n\nLarge urban\n\ncities\n\nLarge\n\ncity suburbs\n\nMedium\n\ncities\n\nSmall\n\ncities\n\nTowns\n\nRural\n\nDeath rate\n\nfrom covid-19,\n\nnationally\n\n51.8 per 100,000\n\nWithin\n\nGeorgia\n\n17.2\n\n14.5\n\n12.7\n\n10.3\n\n8.3\n\n6.6\n\n6.0\n\n5.0\n\n3.5\n\n3.3\n\n3.4\n\nLarge urban\n\ncities\n\nLarge\n\ncity suburbs\n\nMedium\n\ncities\n\nSmall\n\ncities\n\nTowns\n\nRural\n\nMany of the southwest Georgia counties with the highest death rates have no hospitals. Unlike smaller cities and towns in northern Georgia, which are closer to Atlanta and have easy access to more than one regional medical center, residents in the southwest are forced to travel to Albany, the area's hub, or to neighboring Alabama or Florida.\n\nMonty Veazey, president and CEO of the Georgia Alliance of Community Hospitals, described the dire situation in the state's rural communities, including the southwest: \"Nine counties have no doctors -- none, zero -- 18 counties without family physicians, 32 have no internists, 60 without pediatricians, 76 counties have no OB/GYNs.\" At least seven rural hospitals in Georgia have closed during the past decade.\n\nAmid the outbreak, many doctors have shuttered their offices and are consulting with patients online. But vast swaths of rural Georgia do not have Internet access, further limiting residents' ability to seek care.\n\nAisha Bennett, a nurse at Emory Hospital, takes a nasal swab on April 16 at a drive-through testing site for covid-19 at the Georgia International Horse Park in Conyers. (Curtis Compton/AP)\n\nFederally funded community health centers fill in the gaps in some rural counties, but Veazey said of the nearly 30 counties that make up southwest Georgia, only a handful have those centers. Even those facilities are out of reach for some residents because they charge at least a nominal fee for care.\n\nVeazey's association represents not-for-profit hospitals, and he is concerned some might not survive the pandemic, having halted the elective procedures that typically generate revenue. Hospital closures would mean less access for residents and fewer jobs, contributing to the region's economic distress.\n\nIn Cuthbert, Mayor Steve Whatley is worried about the fate of the only hospital in Randolph County, Southwest Georgia Regional Medical Center. His county's outbreak began in a nursing home, where 43 of its 60 residents have tested positive and are quarantined in the facility. The other 17 were transferred to the hospital, which is straining to take care of them. The crisis has \"really impacted our hospital financially,\" he said.\n\n\"I cannot tell you what it's done to us. We're bleeding money.\"\n\nState Sen. Dean Burke, a Republican who supports Kemp's decision to begin reopening businesses, said the coronavirus has shown the importance of a well-funded rural health care system. Burke, who is also the chief medical officer at a hospital in Decatur, a southwest county that mostly has been spared, said facilities like his will need more financial support from the state and federal governments.\n\nQaadir Larke, wearing a gas mask, gives Brandon Lewis a haircut April 24 at his barbershop, The Quad, in Atlanta. (Kevin D. Liles for The Washington Post)\n\n\"I think we will, after this is all over, come to understand the importance of a rural health network and the fact we can't just let the big cities have big medical facilities and let rural facilities die on the vine,\" Burke said. \"I do think there will be a new appreciation that we have to use more resources to stabilize our rural health care network.\"\n\nIn the absence of robust testing and official contact tracing, residents have used an informal grapevine to form their own theories about how the virus spread: Some attendees of an early March birthday party in Blakely, the seat of Early County, were among the first to fall ill.\n\nBut most believe the region's outbreak began at a Dougherty County funeral in February that drew more than 100 mourners, including a man from Atlanta who died a few days after the services. The virus spread from there, quickly overwhelming Albany, the county seat, and radiating to neighboring locales.\n\nThe county has nearly 1,500 cases and 108 deaths, a toll outnumbering everywhere else in Georgia -- even Fulton County, home to Atlanta, where the population is 10 times that of Dougherty.\n\nReported weekly deaths\n\nMarch 8 to 14\n\nMarch 15 to 21\n\n-- 1 death\n\n-- Dougherty Co.\n\n-- 6 deaths\n\nMarch 22-29\n\nMarch 30 to April 5\n\n-- 11 deaths\n\n-- 13 deaths\n\nApril 6 to 12\n\nApril 13 to 19\n\n-- 41 deaths\n\n-- 17 deaths\n\nReported weekly deaths\n\nMarch 8 to 14\n\nMarch 15 to 21\n\n-- 1 death\n\n-- Dougherty Co.\n\n-- 6 deaths\n\nMarch 22-29\n\nMarch 30 to April 5\n\n-- 11 deaths\n\n-- 13 deaths\n\nApril 6 to 12\n\nApril 13 to 19\n\n-- 41 deaths\n\n-- 17 deaths\n\nReported weekly deaths\n\nMarch 8 to 14\n\nMarch 15 to 21\n\nMarch 22-29\n\nAtlanta\n\n-- 1 death\n\n-- Dougherty Co.\n\n-- 6 deaths\n\n-- 11 deaths\n\nMarch 30 to April 5\n\nApril 6 to 12\n\nApril 13 to 19\n\n-- 41 deaths\n\n-- 13 deaths\n\n-- 17 deaths\n\nReported weekly deaths\n\nMarch 8 to 14\n\nMarch 15 to 21\n\nMarch 22-29\n\n-- 1 death\n\nAtlanta\n\n-- Dougherty Co.\n\n-- 6 deaths\n\n-- 11 deaths\n\nMarch 30 to April 5\n\nApril 6 to 12\n\nApril 13 to 19\n\n-- 41 deaths\n\n-- 13 deaths\n\n-- 17 deaths\n\nReported weekly deaths\n\nMarch 8 to 14\n\nMarch 15 to 21\n\nMarch 22-29\n\nMarch 30 to April 5\n\nApril 6 to 12\n\nApril 13 to 19\n\n-- 1 death\n\n-- 41 deaths\n\n-- 13 deaths\n\n-- 6 deaths\n\n-- 11 deaths\n\n-- 17 deaths\n\n-- Dougherty Co.\n\nMost of those victims have died at Phoebe Putney Memorial, the county's only hospital. The facility's administrators say they've seen significant progress in slowing the spread of the coronavirus, but they're concerned a reopened Georgia will bring another tide of patients.\n\n\"While we have successfully slowed the rate of covid-19 transmission in our area, we know there are still significant numbers of covid-positive individuals in our community,\" Scott Steiner, the hospital CEO, said in a statement the day after Kemp's announcement. \"We worry that if people start returning to large gatherings too soon, we could see another 'super-spreader event' where a lot of people contract the virus. We certainly don't want that to happen.\"\n\nU.S. Rep. Sanford D. Bishop Jr., a Democrat who represents southwest Georgia, said he has worked with state and local officials to get additional resources for Phoebe Putney, including a drive-up testing site. He said the relief package passed this week by Congress will provide money for additional testing, in addition to economic relief for residents and businesses.\n\nPhoebe Putney Memorial Hospital in downtown Albany may receive funding for additional testing for the coronavirus from a relief package passed by Congress. (Kevin D. Liles for The Washington Post)\n\n\"We've had a really, really bad experience in southwest Georgia,\" Bishop said. \"Unfortunately, it's a result of the fact that a lot of people -- some 500,000 people in Georgia -- are not covered by Medicaid, so they do not get regular preventive care and have a lot of preexisting conditions that lend themselves to attack by coronavirus.\"\n\nEven as the state reported more cases and deaths in the days leading up to its reopening, Kemp defended his decision as one bolstered by data and public health recommendations.\n\n\"We remain focused on protecting the lives -- and livelihoods -- of all Georgians,\" Kemp wrote on Twitter.\n\n\"Now, with favorable data and approval from state health officials, we are taking another measured step forward by opening shuttered businesses for limited operations,\" he added.\n\nKemp's office did not respond to questions about his decision and its impact on the state's southwest.\n\nIn Blakely, a city of about 5,000 near Alabama, Mayor Travis Wimbush -- who tested positive for covid-19 -- has streamed regular addresses to his residents on Facebook, imploring them to stay home.\n\n\"I will not put the power of a dollar over the value of a life in any decision that I will make,\" he said on Wednesday. \"There are currently still citizens of Blakely on life support.\"\n\nIn Damascus, Means is still mourning. Her aunt, 83-year-old Rosetta Salter, died April 3, two days before test results confirmed she had covid-19. Means's mother, Bernice McCray, 80, was in a nursing home when she ran a fever. She was at a hospital in Dothan, Ala., where the family was allowed to visit only to say their goodbyes two days before she died April 9.\n\nMeans doesn't know how her sister got infected but suspects it was in Albany. She was first diagnosed with pneumonia, then tested positive for covid-19 and was transferred to Dothan. Means hasn't seen her since.\n\nBecause Means hasn't displayed symptoms other than chest tightness since her family members were diagnosed, her doctor, who she sees regularly for her diabetes, said there was no need to be tested. She was probably just stressed.\n\nShe told him she couldn't rest until she knew. The doctor sent her to Thomasville, over an hour's drive, where a county-run drive-up site tests patients free without a referral.\n\nMeans arrived early Thursday morning. She didn't have a fever, cough or shortness of breath, so the nurse there wouldn't test her. She blamed stress, just like Means' doctor had.\n\nThe nurse's message: \"Don't you go bothering yourself about the coronavirus now.\"\n\nAn uplifting message from reggae pioneer Bob Marley appears on a theater marquee in downtown Albany.

        "body": "Michael Fowler, Dougherty County coroner, on the reopening of Georgia\n\nI'm always driving, going back-and-forth between nursing homes, the hospital, and the morgue. All these roads should be empty if you ask me. But now I see people out running errands, rushing back into their lives, and it's like: \"Why? What reason could possibly be good enough?\" Sometimes, I think about stopping and showing them one of the empty body bags I have in the trunk. \"You might end up here. Is that worth it for a haircut or a hamburger?\"\n\nYou start to think that way as a coroner, especially now. I get fed up. I know the governor told us we could go ahead and reopen in Georgia. I understand businesses are hurting and people need to work. But I see these folks out and about and I wonder: \"Is this another death I'll have to pronounce?\"\n\nMy work never shut down. I've been busier than ever during all this. For six weeks now, I've been answering calls in the middle of the night, taking pictures at the scene, notifying families, trying to get those family members tested. We've had more deaths in the last month here in Albany than we normally have in six months. This is a small community, but we're ground zero for what they call community spread. Our greatest strength has been turned against us. We're close-knit, social people down here. We shake hands. We hug. We go to church and hold onto each other, and this virus takes advantage and keeps passing right along. Our hospital is full, and they're opening up another emergency unit to create more space. We had 200 more people test positive just last week. We've got so many sick in Albany that they're shipping some to Atlanta to find space. My cousin's up there now on a vent with this virus, and it isn't looking so good. Nothing's looking so good. We're right in the thick of fighting this thing, but all of the sudden this is the time to reopen? This is the moment for a tattoo or a trip to the gym?\n\nI don't believe in getting hysterical. It's doesn't do any good. This is a numbers-and-facts job. But we have numbers and facts that are screaming out by themselves.\n\nI deliver an update to the town each week on the death toll. I put on a shirt and tie and a mask, and I go downtown to give a presentation. My whole refrain in this has been: \"Let's keep it below 100 deaths.\" At first, people thought that number was impossibly high. Crazy. One hundred is a lot in a place where it seems like everybody knows just about everybody. But when I gave the update three weeks ago, we were at 49 deaths. The next week it was 67. Then 84. I gave my last presentation a few days ago, and we'd hit 102. By the time I got back to my office, the phone was ringing again, and within a few hours, we were at 107.\n\nIt's been so bad for so long that some people here say they're starting to lose count. Maybe so. But I never lose count. We have less than 90,000 people in this county, and close to 1,500 have already tested positive. All I do is keep counting.\n\n[Sign up for our Coronavirus Updates newsletter to track the outbreak. All stories linked in the newsletter are free to access.]\n\nI'd like to lie and say we were perfectly trained and prepared for something like this to hit -- that all of us on the front lines in Albany were waiting and ready. I'm no rookie. I've counted and examined the dead and done forensics after all kinds of major disasters. I've had three back surgeries from moving bodies. You get your floods and your tornadoes down here in south Georgia. But we're 30 miles from the nearest highway, and our airport has maybe two or three flights a day back-and-forth to Atlanta. You feel a little removed from what's happening in China or Rome or even New York.\n\nThe first alarm started going off in Albany on March 15. It was evening time. I got a call at home about a new case, and I went out to the residence. This was a 43-year-old black female. At first, the process was routine. Usually, when the first responders are done, it's my job to pronounce the death and take a look at the body. I take pictures, look for any medications, talk to the family, fill out the paperwork, and decide if we need to do an autopsy. Sometimes, the body gives away secrets. With an alcoholic, you might see a little clubbing of the fingers, and heart disease can show up as a swollen leg. But this time, I couldn't see anything. There was no evidence of foul play or anything suspicious. I went out and talked to the family. I prayed with them a bit and then asked all my questions. I'm a pastor, and I like to put hands on people when we're talking, listen to their concerns, really get to know them. This family kept repeating her symptoms: high fever, aches, coughing, lots of trouble breathing. It sounded straight out of what I'd been hearing on the news. I said: \"Have you heard about the coronavirus? I think we better get her tested.\"\n\nIt was a hunch, really. Right away, I had this bad feeling. There were 20 people coming and going in that house, grieving and paying their respects, and who knows how many of them were already infected. There was a rumor going around at that time that maybe black people couldn't get this virus. We were dealing with all kinds of confusion and misinformation. Nobody in that home was wearing a mask or gloves or doing any social distancing. At that point, neither was I.\n\nI sent her body to be tested, went home and tried to get back to sleep, but I got two more calls later that night. One was at a nursing home, and the other was in the ER. Same symptoms. Both suspected cases. In one night, we went from zero deaths up to three, and that's how it's been going ever since. It explodes outward in waves like a bomb. One person has it and goes to church, and pretty soon half the pew is testing positive. I console people on the death of their relative one week and end up pronouncing them the next.\n\nI never thought this job could give me nightmares. I've been lucky that way, and it's probably why I've lasted so long. I worked at a rubber factory here in town until it closed in 1986, and as part of the layoff, they offered a few of us free tuition to school for mortuary science. It started off as kind of a joke. I'd never seen or touched a dead body. They had us living in a funeral home in Atlanta, and that first night we got called to a wreck on I-20. A girl had flipped her car. It was a decapitation. We searched the highway with a flashlight, and after we finally found everything, I went home and I slept okay. That's when I first starting thinking this must be what God wanted of me.\n\nYou see a lot of haunting things doing this work. I believe it has to be a calling. Most of the time, you're seeing natural causes, but an average week might have homicides, suicides, drug overdoses, car crashes, child deaths, drowning. Bodies get cold and harder to move. Muscles start to stiffen. We had a flood come through and wash out more than 503 graves a while back, and I spent months sorting bones and skeletons. I've worked 23 international disasters, from a plane crash in Guam to the tsunami in Thailand to nine weeks sorting remains at the World Trade Center. I try not to remember individual cases. I do my examination and write down the circumstances and the cause of death, and then I tell myself: \"Okay. It's gone.\" I pray on it and I move on. I trained myself to do that.\n\nBut what I'm learning lately is, it's a lot harder when the body you're zipping up is a face you know or a face of someone you love. I've lived here my whole life. At least 30 of these victims are people I knew by name or considered friends. Six of our preachers have died. Probably at least seven or eight more from church. Two neighbors. Three school friends. The probate judge who had the office next to mine at the courthouse. These are my contemporaries. I'm 62. We've had 36 people here die in their 60s, and at least a dozen more who were younger than that.\n\nI try not to count down the days or make projections about when all of this is going to be over. The truth is, it's starting to become routine. I always stand six feet away from the families. I always wear my space suit whenever I'm anywhere near a body. I always take off my clothes and have my wife spray me down with Lysol as soon as I get home. The chamber of commerce has gone ahead and given me a tractor trailer with shelves to store extra bodies, which I might need depending on how reopening goes and how many more cases we get.\n\nThe phone calls used to wake me up at all hours of the night. Now, I'm usually up waiting.",

    "A 100-year-old WWII veteran dies of covid-19 a century after the flu pandemic killed his twin brother": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "When he told his life story to his grandchildren, friends and neighbors, it always began with Samuel, and now it seemed to be ending that way too.\n\nThe twins were born into a world still torn by the flu pandemic in December 1919, in New York. Samuel died of influenza just weeks later. Philip survived.\n\nHis life would be shaped by so many historic events in which participated in the years to come -- flying planes in World War II, helping to build the World Trade Center -- but this loss always seemed to haunt him just as badly as what he saw in Iwo Jima, his grandson said.\n\n\"It was always the first thing he brought up before he got into World War II stories, before he got into World Trade Center stories, it was always this,\" his grandson, Warren Zysman, who is also a twin, told The Washington Post late Thursday. \"He really didn't know his twin brother, but it was something that really weighed very heavily on him psychologically -- he held this void, this twin brother he never got to experience growing up with.\"\n\nThe two brothers are \"pandemic bookends,\" as Zysman's wife, Corey Karlin-Zysman put it, bringing two tragedies full circle after the long and wonderful life that Kahn lived in between them. He was laid to rest on Monday, after a brief battle with covid-19 that he fought from his Long Island apartment. The positive test results came back just after his death, Zysman said.\n\nSign up for our Coronavirus Updates newsletter to track the outbreak. All stories linked in the newsletter are free to access.\n\nThe 39-year-old mental health therapist said he was hurt that he couldn't give his grandfather the huge funeral he had always envisioned, packed with war buddies and all the guys from the local electricians' union he worked with for so many years. Instead, it was a small military service, his casket draped in an American flag, attended by just 10 people due to coronavirus restrictions.\n\nBut in the absence of a large celebration, Zysman said what his grandfather really wanted was for his stories to be remembered. His stories and photographs were his most prized possessions, his grandson said.\n\nSo on Thursday, Zysman shared them with The Washington Post and others, in hopes of memorializing the events that shaped his grandfather's life.\n\n\"This is what he wanted,\" Zysman said. \"For him, it was really more about preserving the history.\"\n\nPhilip Kahn was born on Dec. 15, 1919, in Manhattan, the son of an orphaned immigrant father who came to the United States from Europe around the turn of the century, making a living as a baker.\n\nEven though Kahn was only a baby during the influenza pandemic, he grew up in its shadow, as his parents' grief and the stories they told became his own. Raised during the Great Depression, Kahn later enlisted in the Army's Aviation Cadet Training Program in 1940.\n\nBefore long, he was flying B-29 bombers in Japan.\n\n\"There was something about him that was very, very special,\" Sampson Lester Friedman, a veteran who flew planes with Kahn during the war, said during a eulogy at his funeral, in a video provided to The Post. \"Aboard our airplane, he was an engineer, and he was the hardest working guy aboard that airplane.\"\n\nBut piloting bombing missions took its toll. In an interview with Newsday for his 98th birthday in 2017, Kahn described how it weighed on him for many years, having witnessed the terror and destruction from hundreds of feet in the air. He witnessed one case from close range too: He was nearly killed by a booby trap that blew up just feet away from him in Iwo Jima.\n\nHis soon-to-be wife, Rose, feared he wouldn't make it home alive, he told Newsday. But in 1946, he finally did. They married and were together for 73 years, until her death last summer. They raised two daughters, one being Zysman's mother, Lynn. The other, Joyce Laulicht, died a few years ago, Zysman said.\n\nAfter a brief stint as a talented roller-rink dancer, Kahn worked all his life as an electrician. One of his proudest memories was helping to build the World Trade Center in the late 1960s. He led a large team of workers as the electrical foreman, and snapped a picture from the top of one of the towers just before the construction was complete -- another photograph he liked to share at every opportunity.\n\nIt made 9/11 that much harder for him to process, Zysman said.\n\n\"His level of sadness and tears was something that many of us could relate to, but it was like a different level,\" Zysman said. \"It was like something he spent so many years creating, his blood, sweat and tears, was no longer there.\"\n\nHis big family helped him get through it. Kahn had six grandchildren and six great-grandchildren. He was especially thrilled when Zysman and his twin brother were born, Zysman said, as though Kahn were finally getting to experience the bond of twins vicariously through them. \"It was always so special to him,\" Zysman said.\n\nHe liked to show off his '50s roller-rink dance moves at all the grandkids' bar mitzvahs, Zysman said, and taught each one how to swim. Zysman said his message to each one of them was to put their whole hearts into everything that they did. \"Even at 100 years old, he had mastered the art of making things a perfect circle and a perfect heart with my 7-year-old daughter,\" Zysman said.\n\nJust a few months after celebrating Kahn's 100th birthday in December, they stopped being able to visit with him once covid-19 began taking its toll.\n\nZysman said he is not sure how his grandfather ultimately contracted the virus in April, but even before the test, it was clear he had the symptoms. His cough worsened. He slept more and more and had trouble breathing.\n\nOver the phone, Zysman said, he and Kahn talked about what was to come in an uncertain time. He told his grandson he knew this wouldn't blow over soon, warning him that \"this is going to change how people live.\" The stories about his lost twin returned, the memories of the pandemic's enduring impact on his family pouring back to him.\n\n\"He kept telling me, 'Warren, my boy, history is repeating itself,'\" Zysman remembered. \"He said, 'I lived a long time, 100 years, but 100 years is not a long time for history. We could have been better prepared for this.'\"",

        "body": "A lot of people infected with the coronavirus have very mild or even no symptoms, or ones that don't match the usual markers of fever, dry cough or difficulty breathing. The discovery of larger numbers of so-called asymptomatic cases, initially thought to be rare, underscores a key challenge in stopping the pandemic: If people don't know they're infected, they're probably not taking steps to prevent transmitting it.\n\nPeak concentration of the coronavirus in the upper airway seems to occur around the time an infected person develops symptoms. That's usually when a person is most contagious -- coughing, sneezing or otherwise shedding virus. With this virus, however, a carrier is also capable of transmitting it even before getting the tell-tale signs of infection, as some early studies from China, Germany and Singapore indicated. And some people with the virus never feel ill, yet have been implicated in its spread. The extent to which these \"silent carriers\" may also be \"silent spreaders\" isn't clear. It's difficult to pinpoint the source of an individual infection, especially as the virus becomes entrenched in communities. Researchers at the University of Oxford estimated in March that a third to a half of transmissions occur from pre-symptomatic people.",

    "Analysis | The Daily 202: Australian app downloads underscore how far the U.S. lags on coronavirus contact tracing": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "More than 2 million Australians quickly downloaded a coronavirus contact tracing app released Sunday by their government. Prime Minister Scott Morrison says he would be able to ease some lockdown restrictions if enough people sign up, because public health officials could more rapidly identify, isolate, test and treat people who have been exposed to the contagion. Experts say that at least 40 percent of the country's 25 million citizens need to participate for the initiative to be effective.\n\nMeanwhile, the Israeli Supreme Court ruled overnight that Benjamin Netanyahu's government cannot continue to use the state security service to track the cellphones of covid-19 patients beyond the end of April unless the Knesset, their parliament, passes legislation to codify the emergency program.\n\nThe dual developments on the other side of the world put in stark relief just how far behind the eight ball the U.S. government continues to be on contact tracing, which experts agree is critical not just to slowing the spread of the novel coronavirus but also to safely reopening the economy.\n\nAs other developed countries grapple with the implications for civil liberties of voluntary apps like Australia's and more invasive approaches like Israel's, the web site for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention remains a work in progress. \"Detailed guidance for health departments and potential contact tracers is forthcoming,\" the CDC page still said at 10 a.m.\n\nAustralia's national app, called COVIDSafe, uses Bluetooth technology to log every time a user comes within about five feet of someone else. If someone using the app tests positive, everyone else who has the app and had more than 15 minutes of close contact with that person will be notified. \"The encrypted data recorded by the app will only be made available to health officials when someone tests positive for covid-19, and the Australian government says that it will be deleted once the pandemic is over. But privacy advocates have asked for more safeguards, including legislation that explicitly states that the data cannot be used by law enforcement,\" Antonia Farzan reports.\n\nAustralia's app is modeled off the one already widely adopted in Singapore. The United Arab Emirates has also used Bluetooth to record interactions and to identify suspected cases. At least 29 countries are now using mobile data to help with contact tracing. A key part of South Korea's success at flattening the curve was that the government used cellphone location data to reconstruct the movements of infected people so that others could be alerted that they may have been exposed, which reduced the rate of transmission.\n\nThe United States has 54,400 people who have died from the coronavirus, more confirmed fatalities than any other country, with at least 961,000 confirmed cases. The world has lost more than 206,000 people to the pandemic, and about 3 million cases have been reported.\n\nWith the lack of a cohesive federal strategy on testing or tracing, America is relying on a patchwork approach with companies and states racing to fill the void. Apple and Google are jointly developing a Bluetooth system that could be deployed nationally and allow owners of smartphones, including iPhones and Android devices, to know whether they have crossed paths with someone infected with the disease.\n\n\"North Dakota repurposed an app used by North Dakota State University sports fans to stay in touch and check in at locations on their way to out-of-state football games to work as a voluntary contact tracing app. The app was built by a Microsoft engineer and NDSU graduate Tim Brookins, whose company ProudCrowd gave it to the state for free,\" Joe Marks reports in today's Cyber 202. \"Utah entered into a $2.75 million contract with the app company Twenty to build a voluntary coronavirus tracking tool. Officials in Hawaii discussed using GPS trackers to ensure tourists on the islands are following quarantine restrictions. Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont (D), meanwhile, is urging residents to use an app designed by researchers at Harvard, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and other institutions to self-report their locations, symptoms and whether they're diagnosed with the virus -- but that doesn't track their movements.\"\n\nThe CDC announced Thursday that it will send $631 million to state and local health departments to increase their capacity to do contact tracing and testing, but that's \"a fraction of what many officials say they need to safely restart their economies,\" William Wan reports.\n\nThe Financial Times reports that companies like PwC, the consulting firm, are preparing to launch apps that track employees as they move through offices and factories. \"But, unlike the voluntary apps being launched by U.S. states and several Western governments, some of the corporate tracking apps probably will be mandatory. And they could include far fewer privacy protections. The moves underscore how privacy and security concerns are taking a back seat amid efforts to combat the pandemic,\" Joe notes.\n\nThe Israeli spyware firm NSO Group, embroiled in a lawsuit with Facebook over allegations that it helped foreign governments hack into the WhatsApp accounts of dissidents and journalists, is developing a coronavirus tracking app and marketing it to U.S. clients, NBC News reports.\n\nIn Israel, the civil liberties group that brought the legal challenge against the government surveillance program said the Supreme Court's ruling could help rein in a tracing initiative that they argue is ripe for abuse. \"The health of the public is of utmost importance, but these measures, born out of draconian emergency regulations, are bringing us to a slippery slope when it comes to the invasion of privacy and democracy,\" the Association for Civil Rights in Israel said in a statement.\n\n\"There has been little public outcry over the program, which allows the security agency, Shin Bet, to review the cellphone movements people who test positive for the virus and alert others who may have been near them. Hundreds of Israelis have received messages that they had been in proximity of an infected person and ordering them into two weeks of isolation,\" Steve Hendrix writes from Jerusalem. \"The high court's ruling doesn't end the program but stipulates that it must be codified in law. The decision comes as Israel, where the outbreak has been largely contained to date, is beginning to lift some restrictions on movement and business activities. Street side shops across the country were allowed to reopen Sunday and officials were considering restarting some early grade school classes on a limited basis as early as the first week of May.\"\n\nIn contrast to these other countries, the United States has relied mainly on collected sets of anonymous user data, provided voluntarily by companies. \"New Zealand, Taiwan and Thailand have used phone-location tracking to monitor quarantined people's movements, and issue heavy fines to people found to have violated the orders. In China, Poland and Russia, health officials have used facial-recognition software to confirm whether someone has obeyed lockdown orders,\" Craig Timberg, Elizabeth Dwoskin, Drew Harwell and Tony Romm report. \"When California officials wanted to see how closely people were following social distancing guidelines last month, they tapped a powerful new data set -- a map that Facebook provided to state authorities derived from the location coordinates of tens of millions of smartphones. The map showed with alarming clarity that large numbers of people were still gathering on beaches and in public parks. Soon after, Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) ordered them closed to vehicles, sharply restricting access.\"\n\nSkepticism of government surveillance is built into Americans' DNA. A Pew Research Center poll conducted earlier this month found that 6 in 10 Americans say that it would not make much of a difference in limiting the spread of the virus if the government tracked people's locations through their cellphone. Only 16 percent believed this would help a lot, and 22 percent said they think it would help a little to limit the spread.\n\nTony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said recently that collecting cellphone data would be helpful and \"makes sense\" from \"a purely public health standpoint.\" But that creates \"sticky, sticky issues,\" he added. \"You know, you could look at somebody's cellphone, and say, 'You were next to these 25 people over the last 24 hours,'\" Fauci said in an interview with Snapchat. \"Boy, I've got to tell you, the civil liberties-type pushback on that would be considerable.\"\n\nThe draft plans include the reopening of \"schools and camps, child-care programs, certain workplaces, houses of worship, restaurants and mass transit, according to documents under review by administration officials,\" Lena Sun and Josh Dawsey report. \"The guidelines have sparked sharp debates within the administration between public health experts and other officials who fear that the guidelines could restrict worship services, damage the profitability of restaurants and upend daily life in a way they deem unnecessary. ... While sharing menus, passing the offering plate and crowding members of a choir together raise the risk for transmission, some officials said the guidelines are likely to be controversial. 'Churches don't like to be told how to operate,' said one administration official ... Initial guidelines provided few specifics. The guidance under review, drafted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, is considerably more detailed. Changes could be made, but the guidance is likely to be released within the next seven days, officials said. The 17-page guidance lists recommendations for each of six settings. It says all decisions should be made locally in collaboration with local health officials. ... [It also says] the CDC 'offers these suggestions that faith communities may consider and accept or reject, consistent with their own faith tradition.'\"\n\n\"It was the latest instance of conflicting signals coming not just from state and federal leaders but also from within the Trump administration in the midst of a coronavirus pandemic that so far has claimed the lives of more than 54,000 Americans. Last week, Vice President Pence predicted that 'we will largely have this coronavirus epidemic behind us' by Memorial Day weekend,'\" Felicia Sonmez, Paige Winfield Cunningham and Meryl Kornfield report. \"But on Sunday, [the White House's coronavirus task force coordinator] said in an interview on NBC News's 'Meet the Press' that 'social distancing will be with us through the summer to really ensure that we protect one another as we move through these phases.' She cited the need for further testing that would need to be developed following a scientific 'breakthrough.' ... Across the country, however, some states are already relaxing their social distancing restrictions over pressure from protesters, business groups and others.\"\n\n\"Trump has spoken for more than 28 hours in the 35 briefings held since March 16, eating up 60 percent of the time that officials spoke,\" Philip Bump and Ashley Parker report. \"Over the past three weeks, the tally comes to more than 13 hours of Trump -- including two hours spent on attacks and 45 minutes praising himself and his administration, but just 4\u00bd minutes expressing condolences for coronavirus victims. He spent twice as much time promoting an unproven antimalarial drug that was the object of a Food and Drug Administration warning Friday. Trump also said something false or misleading in nearly a quarter of his prepared comments or answers to questions. ...\n\n\"Trump's freewheeling approach ended in a political crisis this past week, after the president's dangerous suggestion at a briefing Thursday that injecting bleach or other disinfectants might cure the coronavirus -- 'almost as a cleaning.' The remarks set off a government-wide scramble and led to Trump telling aides Friday he would skip briefings this weekend. White House officials say privately they are considering scaling back the events entirely. ... In recent days, aides have begun discussing adding an economic component to the virus response that would be separate from the daily briefing with public health officials, in part because they say one of the president's strengths is the economy. ... Advisers are also considering cutting the number of briefings or having the president attend less frequently, as well as discussing getting the president out on the road in the next few weeks.\"\n\n\"Business filings under Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy law rose sharply in March, and attorneys who work with struggling companies are seeing signs that more owners are contemplating the possibility of bankruptcy,\" the AP reports. \"Business owners will try to avoid bankruptcy by seeking leniency from landlords, lenders and vendors, bankruptcy attorney David Wander says. But with their companies' financial troubles beyond their control because of the virus outbreak, many will file for Chapter 11 because the stigma that bankruptcy has long held will be gone, says Wander, a partner at Davidoff Hutcher & Citron in New York. 'The tsunami is going to happen in the coming months and it's going to be ongoing,' Wander says.\"\n\n\"The Post, along with other news outlets, reported early Sunday that White House officials are discussing possible replacements for [the Health and Human Services secretary] as frustrations have grown over his handling of the coronavirus crisis earlier this year, and the uproar that followed his removal of a top vaccine official in his agency last week,\" Yasmeen Abutaleb and Josh Dawsey report. \" 'Reports that H.H.S. Secretary @AlexAzar is going to be 'fired' by me are Fake News,' [Trump] tweeted ... During the past several weeks, Azar has rarely appeared at the daily White House coronavirus news briefings and has been largely sidelined from the response. ... One senior administration official with knowledge of the discussions said Trump has no deep affection for Azar but is unlikely to change secretaries as the coronavirus continues to rage. There is also concern about having a nomination fight in an election year on an issue -- health care -- that many Trump advisers see as a political weakness.\"\n\nDemocrats continued to hammer Trump for his remarks about disinfectants as a possible cure for the virus. \"You know what they call that? They call that embalming,\" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said on CNN's \"State of the Union.\" \"That's the medical term.\"\n\n\"The intensive care unit at Inova Alexandria Hospital has empty beds, and doctors are prepared for a rush of coronavirus patients that has yet to hit the largely white suburb. A dozen miles away at Adventist HealthCare Fort Washington Hospital Center, the ICU is full, and employees treat coronavirus patients in medical tents in the parking lot. Paramedics across Prince George's County are summoned daily to help people struggling to breathe, and funeral home directors are searching for more places to store bodies,\" Rachel Chason, Ovetta Wiggins and John Harden report. \"Prince George's, one of the nation's wealthiest majority-black counties, has reported the most coronavirus infections and some of the highest death tolls in the Washington region. In the hardest-hit neighborhoods, African American and Latino residents make up more than 70 percent of households. The grim statistics mirror data showing black Americans are more likely than white Americans to be infected with the novel coronavirus and more likely to die of it.\n\n\"Officials say the pandemic has hit the county of 900,000 especially hard because many residents are front-line workers exposed daily to the virus, and Prince Georgians disproportionately suffer from underlying health conditions that make the virus more deadly. 'His comment to me was, 'I am the only pharmacist,'' said Bowie resident Nicole Boynes, whose husband, Sean, had asthma but kept working at a pharmacy he helped found in Greenbelt. Sean Boynes, a former Air Force captain, died of covid-19, the disease the virus causes, on April 2. He was 46. Nearly 14 percent of adults in Prince George's have diabetes, according to county health statistics, 36 percent are obese, and 64 percent of the county's Medicare beneficiaries suffer from hypertension -- rates above national and statewide averages. There are fewer hospital beds and primary care doctors than in neighboring jurisdictions, which means residents are less likely to treat medical problems early. The county also spends less on public health efforts than its wealthier neighbors. ... The 174 county residents who had died of covid-19 as of Sunday ... include educators, a maintenance worker, a prominent artist and a pastor.\"\n\n\"Sheryl Means already has lost so much to the invisible virus burning through her hometown. Her mother and her aunt died within days of each other. She has this tightness in her chest, and she's scared she might be next. But Means can't get a test. Even now, six weeks into a national emergency, with the death toll still climbing in southwest Georgia, and her kin sick from the novel coronavirus. Even though, as a home health-care worker, she's at high risk for exposure. She isn't displaying enough symptoms to get the required doctor's referral. If she wanted, though, she could get her hair and nails done, since the state's governor invited some businesses to reopen Friday, despite local leaders, public health experts and residents like Means insisting Georgia isn't ready,\" Reis Thebault, Andrew Ba Tran and Vanessa Williams report. \"Of the 20 counties in the nation with the most deaths per capita from covid-19, ... five are in southwest Georgia, including Early, where Means lives. In the state's hardest-hit places, African Americans make up most of the population, and about 30 percent of residents live in poverty. They've struggled for years with a severe lack of access to health care. Some counties have no doctors, no hospitals and a high percentage of uninsured residents. The facilities and physicians already were stretched thin. Then came the coronavirus.\"\n\n\"The sun had barely risen over East 149th Street in the South Bronx when Edward Halls, 70, got in line. He had seen how long the line was the day before and realized that life now required a plan,\" Stephanie McCrummen reports. \"A line of 32 people stretched out from the front door of the bank where the computers were still down and Halls was still sitting in his folding chair, watching his neighborhood come to life. Across the street, a line was forming at the pharmacy. A few doors down, the line was growing at the credit union. Around the corner, people were lining up for the bus, for the lottery, for the check-cashers ... Two months into the coronavirus pandemic, this is what life was becoming in one of the poorest and hardest-hit neighborhoods in America. A life of lines.\"\n\n\"The C.D.C.'s Field Epidemiology Manual, which devotes an entire chapter to communication during a health emergency, indicates that there should be a lead spokesperson whom the public gets to know -- familiarity breeds trust,\" the New Yorker reports. \"The spokesperson should make special efforts to explain both what is known and what is unknown. Transparency is essential, the field manual says, and officials must 'not over-reassure or overpromise.' The lead spokesperson should be a scientist. Dr. Richard Besser, a former acting C.D.C. director and an [Epidemic Intelligence Service] alumnus, explained to me, 'If you have a politician on the stage, there's a very real risk that half the nation is going to do the opposite of what they say.' During the H1N1 outbreak of 2009, ... Besser and his successor at the C.D.C., Dr. Tom Frieden, gave more than a hundred press briefings. President Barack Obama spoke publicly about the outbreak only a few times ... At no time did Obama recommend particular medical treatments, nor did he forecast specifics about when the pandemic would end.\"\n\nWhen Jeff Duchin, the top public-health physician for Seattle and King County, told county executive Dow Constantine about a cluster of cases at the Life Care nursing home, they started considering restrictions on public gatherings and stay-at-home orders: \"On February 29th, Constantine held a press conference. He had asked [three medical experts] to play prominent roles. Duchin spoke first, and it was as if he had prepared his remarks with the Field Epidemiology Manual in hand. ... Since then, Washington State politicians have largely ceded health communications to the scientists, making them unlikely celebrities. ... Today, Washington State has less than two per cent of coronavirus cases in the U.S. At EvergreenHealth, hospital administrators have stopped daily crisis meetings, because the rate of incoming patients has slowed. They have empty beds and extra ventilators. The administrators remain worried, but are cautiously optimistic.\"\n\nThe initial outbreaks in New York City emerged at roughly the same time as Seattle's, but New York politicians took the lead and the death toll has been vastly higher: \"New York is denser than Seattle and relies more heavily on public transportation, which forces commuters into close contact. ... New Yorkers are in your face, whether you like it or not. ... New York also has more poverty and inequality than Seattle, and more international travellers. ... It's also true, however, that the cities' leaders acted and communicated very differently in the early stages of the pandemic. Seattle's leaders moved fast to persuade people to stay home and follow the scientists' advice; New York's leaders, despite having a highly esteemed public-health department, moved more slowly, offered more muddied messages, and let politicians' voices dominate.\"\n\n\"As governments race to source everything from food aid to face masks, they are prioritizing speed over transparency, dropping competitive bidding and other safeguards to keep pace with the pandemic. Most have no choice. Given the speed of the still-unfolding crisis, it's either buy quickly or put millions at risk. But concern is rising about the percentage of the taxpayer dollars -- and euros and yen and pesos and more -- lining the pockets of corrupt bureaucrats, crony contractors and crime syndicates,\" Anthony Faiola and Vanessa Herrero report. \"Food aid for struggling workers locked out of their jobs is proving to be a particularly juicy target. When the government of Bangladesh launched an effort this month to distribute rice to its most vulnerable citizens, nearly 600,000 pounds disappeared. About 50 people, including bureaucrats and local officials, were accused of trying to resell the rice at higher prices. ... In Romania, where normal bidding processes have been suspended to accelerate procurement, critics are raising red flags about backdoor deals. ... In some instances, corruption-busting regulations are flagging suspect deals. In Buenos Aires, the city government must make public procurement contracts available in searchable form online, even during the coronavirus crisis.\"\n\nA Financial Times analysis of overall fatalities during the pandemic across 14 countries showed \"122,000 deaths in excess of normal levels across these locations, considerably higher than the 77,000 official Covid-19 deaths reported for the same places and time periods. If the same level of under-reporting observed in these countries was happening worldwide, the global Covid-19 death toll would rise from the current official total of 201,000 to as high as 318,000.\"\n\n\"U.S. and South Korean intelligence services remain skeptical of reports that Kim is dead or gravely ill, according to three government officials familiar with the matter,\" Simon Denyer, John Hudson and Min Joo Kim report. \"Commercial satellite images published by the 38 North website, affiliated with the Stimson Center, showed what appeared to be Kim's 250-meter-long personal train at a railway station dedicated to the Kim family in Wonsan on April 21 and 23. ... 'The train's presence does not prove the whereabouts of the North Korean leader or indicate anything about his health, but it does lend weight to reports that Kim is staying at an elite area on the country's eastern coast,' Martyn Williams, Peter Makowsky and Jenny Town wrote in their report. To be sure, something strange is going down in the intensely secretive state. ... If Kim were gravely ill, it's unlikely he would have left the hospital and traveled by train to Wonsan, a distance of over 150 miles. And if he had died and officials wanted to maintain secrecy, it's unlikely his body would have been transported across the country.\"\n\n\"Across the world, the pandemic has forced the postponement of countless weddings, which are top social events of the year in many traditional societies. But some couples are somehow still finding a way to tie the knot -- because they just can't wait or are convinced it's now or never,\" Paul Schemm reports. \"Many governments have recognized the risk of the virus spreading during weddings and moved quickly to close down wedding halls and ban gatherings. ... [In the United Arab Emirates], the government announced that a couple from Abu Dhabi, the capital, had become the first to use the service and be married via Zoom. A similar service is expected to be organized for divorces. Yet it is not the ceremony that everyone remembers but the party with friends and family from all over. With this in mind, Indian couple Preet Singh and Neet Kaur decided to conduct their whole wedding party online; the bride and groom were not even in the same city. ... The couple, fittingly, met online a year ago.\"\n\nThe Boston Globe ran 21 pages of death notices on Sunday:\n\nOn Sunday, his wife's 50th birthday, Trump tweeted angrily about the media, lashing out at reporters who he said \"have received Noble Prizes for their work on Russia, Russia, Russia, only to have been proven totally wrong.\" He appeared to misspell the Nobel Prize, although journalists recognized for their coverage of the Russia investigation received a different prize, the Pulitzer. He later deleted the tweets and then tweeted that he was being sarcastic:\n\nFor over seven hours, the president unleashed a barrage of more than 30 tweets and retweets that also targeted his political opponents. He promoted a claim that accused his opponents of \"three failed coup attempts,\" and tried to discredit a New York Times story about his work habits, Allyson Chiu reports:\n\nTrump claimed he hadn't left the White House in \"many months,\" but he did so last month:\n\nRuth Eglash, one of our correspondents in Jerusalem, got tested for the virus at one of Israel's roadside testing booths:\n\n\"Saturday Night Live\" was back - from home - this weekend, opening with Brad Pitt as Tony Fauci:\n\nThe show also featured a PSA from Michigan Gov.

    "Analysis | The Daily 202: Barr memo threatening lawsuits against coronavirus restrictions is a warning shot": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "Attorney General Bill Barr directed all 93 U.S. attorneys on Monday to \"be on the lookout for state and local directives\" that curtail individual rights in the name of containing the novel coronavirus.\n\n\"Many policies that would be unthinkable in regular times have become commonplace in recent weeks,\" Barr wrote in a two-page memo, \"and we do not want to unduly interfere with the important efforts of state and local officials to protect the public. But the Constitution is not suspended in times of crisis.\"\n\nPresident Trump has put the onus on governors to decide when to ease stay-at-home orders and reopen their states. While somewhat erratic and contradictory vis-a-vis Georgia's policy to start reopening last week, Trump has made increasingly clear in public and private - including a conference call on Monday - that he wants the nation's governors to open sooner than later.\n\nThis new declaration by the nation's chief law enforcement officer, who has heavily politicized the Justice Department during his tenure, should be read as a warning to governors and mayors that they may face challenges in federal court if they don't move quick enough to relax restrictions.\n\nIt also foreshadows how litigious the reopening of the country could become, as individuals bring lawsuits against states - with possible assistance and support from the federal government. Judges in Illinois and Virginia issued rulings on Monday, for example, that undermined the orders by governors in those states.\n\nBarr announced that his point men on \"this important initiative\" will be Matt Schneider, the Detroit-based U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Michigan, and Eric Dreiband, the assistant attorney general who is best known for service as one of Ken Starr's lieutenants during the investigation of President Bill Clinton. This seems notable because Trump has specifically decried restrictions imposed on residents by Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer (D), who has been mentioned as a possible running mate for presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden and leads a top battleground state in the presidential election. \"LIBERTATE MICHIGAN!\", Trump tweeted on April 17.\n\nBarr did not specify any policies in the memo, but he said the duo will review what's going on and, \"if necessary,\" take corrective action. \"If a state or local ordinance crosses the line from an appropriate exercise of authority to stop the spread of COVID-19 into an overbearing infringement of constitutional and statutory protections, the Department of Justice may have an obligation to address that overreach in federal court,\" the attorney general wrote.\n\nDuring an interview with conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt last week, Barr explained that the Justice Department can try to intimidate governors into backing away from policies the Trump administration opposes. \"If we think one goes too far, we initially try to jawbone the governors into rolling them back or adjusting them,\" he said. \"And if they're not and people bring lawsuits, we file statements of interest and side with the plaintiffs.\" He added: \"The idea that you have to stay in your house is disturbingly close to house arrest.\"\n\nA few weeks ago, Barr told Laura Ingraham on Fox News that he considers some policies \"draconian\" and telegraphed that a hardball approach was coming. \"When this period of time, at the end of April, expires, I think we have to allow people to adapt more than we have,\" he said, \"and not just tell people to go home and hide under their bed, but allow them to use other ways -- social distancing and other means -- to protect themselves.\"\n\nThe Justice Department has thus far intervened in only a single lawsuit related to coronavirus restrictions, appearing to back a Greenville, Miss., church that had sued over the city's efforts to shut down drive-in religious services, Matt Zapotosky reports: \"Even in that instance, the department did not unequivocally support Temple Baptist Church in its legal statement of interest, though it said the circumstances the church described 'suggest that the city singled out churches for distinctive treatment,' which would be unconstitutional. ... The city ultimately backed down in the suit.\"\n\nIn his Monday memo, Barr wrote: \"The legal restrictions on state and local authority are not limited to discrimination against religious institutions and religious believers. For example, the Constitution also forbids, in certain circumstances, discrimination against disfavored speech and undue interference with the national economy.\"\n\nA judge in Illinois ruled on Monday that Democratic Gov. J.B. Pritzker cannot enforce his stay-at-home order against Republican state Rep. Darren Bailey. Bailey, who represents a rural area that's been spared from the contagion, argued that the Illinois Emergency Management Agency Act restricts a governor's emergency powers to 30 days from the day he declares a disaster, which was March 9. \"The governor was just clearly overreaching his authority and his powers,\" Bailey told Meagan Flynn.\n\nPritzker promised to appeal. \"Rep. Darren Bailey's decision to take to the courts to try and dismantle public health directives designed to keep people safe is an insult to all Illinoisans who have been lost during this covid-19 crisis, and it's a danger to millions of people who may get ill because of his recklessness,\" the governor said in a statement.\n\nIn Virginia, a circuit court judge ruled on Monday that Gov. Ralph Northam (D) exceeded his authority by forcing an indoor gun range to close as part of his stay-at-home order. This marks the first victory by a business challenging the commonwealth's restrictions, and legal experts told Justin Jouvenal that the case will spur others.\n\nLast week, Wisconsin state GOP lawmakers sued Democratic Gov. Tony Evers and asked the state's supreme court to invalidate his stay-at-home order. They want rural counties to decide their own approaches, not the state, the Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel reports.\n\nTwo California residents, including a GOP candidate for Congress, sued Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) on Monday, arguing that they were illegally denied permits to protest Newsom's stay-at-home restrictions and the state's slow processing of gun background checks. The lawsuit seeks an end to Newson's restrictions, the Los Angeles Times reports.\n\nFresh Washington Post-University of Maryland polling released this morning shows that Americans' concerns about becoming seriously ill from the virus have not eased in the past week, and Americans continue to give their governors significantly higher ratings than they offer Trump, who still draws mostly negative reviews for his handling of the crisis. \"Nearly 2 in 3 Americans say the restrictions on restaurants, stores and other businesses in their states are appropriate, with another 16 percent saying they are not tight enough. Just under 2 in 10, or 17 percent, call the limits on business activity too restrictive,\" Dan Balz and Scott Clement report:\n\n\"About 7 in 10 (72 percent) Democrats and 6 in 10 (62 percent) Republicans say their state's current restrictions on businesses are appropriate. Republicans are more likely to say their state is too restrictive on businesses, though fewer than 3 in 10 say this (27 percent), compared with 17 percent of independents and 8 percent of Democrats. Even in the dozen states that have begun to loosen restrictions or that had less restrictive orders in place, a majority of residents support their state's limitations, with 59 percent calling them appropriate, 18 percent saying they are too restrictive and 22 percent calling them not restrictive enough -- the last figure being eight points higher than in the states with more stringent orders in place.\"\n\n\"Governors, congressional leaders and public health officials have pressed for a robust testing plan from the federal government, insisting that frequent and widespread testing is crucial to ending the stay-at-home orders that have idled businesses across much of the country. Trump responded Monday by announcing what the White House called a 'blueprint' for increasing testing capacity. But it leaves the onus on states to develop their own plans and rapid-response programs. A White House document said the federal role would include 'strategic direction and technical assistance,' as well as the ability to 'align laboratory testing supplies and capacity with existing and anticipated laboratory needs.' The federal government was described as the 'supplier of last resort,'\" Mike DeBonis, Chris Mooney and Juliet Eilperin report. \"Trump outlined the effort at a White House news conference where he was joined by some major retailers, who said they had ramped up the rate of testing and the production of medical supplies. They predicted that they would only accelerate in the month ahead, doubling their rate of testing and the number of sites that would be available to the public. The administration's top testing official, meanwhile, promised that the United States would conduct at least 8 million tests a month by the end of May. But a previous high-profile public-private initiative announced by the president in March ... has been slow to materialize.\"\n\nThe agency says these can appear two to 14 days after exposure: Chills, repeated shaking with chills, muscle pain, headache, sore throat and loss of taste or smell. \"Previously, the CDC listed just three known symptoms: shortness of breath, cough and fever,\" Angela Fritz, Michael Brice-Saddler and Maura Judkis report. \"Though not listed on the CDC website, fatigue also has been reported in people who have either tested positive or told to assume they have covid-19 when testing was not available. ... During the past few weeks, health experts have noted how covid-19 attacks many organs in the body. In some patients, physicians are reporting a blood-clotting complication that does not respond to anticoagulants. Some patients' lungs fill with hundreds of microclots, autopsies have shown, and larger clots can break off and travel to the brain or heart, causing a stroke or heart attack.\"\n\nCancer patients -- especially those with blood or lung malignancies, or tumors that have spread throughout the body -- have a higher risk of death or other severe complications from covid-19. That's according to a study published this morning, which involved 14 hospitals in Hubei province in central China, where the pandemic emerged, included 105 cancer patients and 536 non-cancer patients of the same age -- all of whom had covid-19, Laurie McGinley reports.\n\n\"There's new evidence the disease may be associated with surprising complications in a small number of children. [The National Health Service] issued an alert to physicians warning of an 'apparent rise in the number of children of all ages presenting with a multi-system inflammatory state requiring intensive care across London and also in other regions' that may be related to covid-19,\" Ariana Eunjung Cha and Chelsea Janes report. \"The [NHS] said the cases, seen during the past three weeks, have 'common overlapping features' of toxic shock syndrome and another condition that results in dangerous blood vessel inflammation. The description of symptoms potentially could be related to blood clotting complications described in a small number of critically ill adults diagnosed with covid-19. British health authorities have declined to provide details, including the number of pediatric cases, other than to say serious complications related to the virus are 'very rare' but a growing concern.\" Toxic shock syndrome is most often discussed in the context of tampon use and women who are menstruating.\n\n\"Scientists at the university's Jenner Institute had a head start on a vaccine, having proved in previous trials that similar inoculations -- including one last year against an earlier coronavirus -- were harmless to humans,\" the Times reports. \"That has enabled them to leap ahead and schedule tests of their new coronavirus vaccine involving more than 6,000 people by the end of next month, hoping to show not only that it is safe, but also that it works. The Oxford scientists now say that with an emergency approval from regulators, the first few million doses of their vaccine could be available by September -- at least several months ahead of any of the other announced efforts -- if it proves to be effective. Now, they have received promising news suggesting that it might. Scientists at the National Institutes of Health's Rocky Mountain Laboratory in Montana last month inoculated six rhesus macaque monkeys with single doses of the Oxford vaccine. The animals were then exposed to heavy quantities of the virus that is causing the pandemic -- exposure that had consistently sickened other monkeys in the lab. But more than 28 days later all six were healthy, said Vincent Munster, the researcher who conducted the test.\"\n\nWhile hospitals have declined to talk on the record about how they've decided to ration care in an attempt to save as many lives as possible, a new paper in the Annals of Internal Medicine examines 29 resource allocation plans. They diverge significantly on multiple issues. Ten, for example, give preference for scarce ventilators to health-care workers. Half of the policies use age as a criterion for rationing ventilators. Four plans went in the opposite direction, prohibiting decisions based on age. Seventeen policies prohibit using criteria such as the ability to pay, race and citizenship to determine who gains access to ventilators. (Ariana Eunjung Cha)\n\nThere's also immense inequality across health networks: \"Wealthy hospitals sitting on millions or even billions of dollars are in a competitive stampede against near-insolvent hospitals for the same limited pots of financial relief. Those include the $175 billion in relief funds Congress allotted for health-care providers as part of its two most recent coronavirus packages and loans from private banks,\" Jordan Rau reports. \"Unlike safety-net and smaller hospitals, many big health systems have the resources to stay afloat without financial assistance through the summer and beyond.\"\n\n\"The repeated warnings were conveyed in issues of the President's Daily Brief,\" Greg Miller and Ellen Nakashima report. \"For weeks, the PDB ... traced the virus's spread around the globe, made clear that China was suppressing information about the contagion's transmissibility and lethal toll, and raised the prospect of dire political and economic consequences. But the alarms appear to have failed to register with the president, who routinely skips reading the PDB and has at times shown little patience for even the oral summary he takes two or three times per week ... U.S. officials emphasized that the PDB references to the virus included comprehensive articles on aspects of the global outbreak, but also smaller digest items meant to keep Trump and senior administration officials updated on the course of the contagion. Versions of the PDB are also shared with Cabinet secretaries and other high-ranking U.S. officials.\"\n\n\"In the early weeks of the coronavirus epidemic, the United States recorded an estimated 15,400 excess deaths, nearly two times as many as were publicly attributed to covid-19 at the time, according to an analysis of federal data conducted for The Post by a research team led by the Yale School of Public Health,\" Emma Brown, Andrew Ba Tran, Beth Reinhard and Monica Ulmanu report. \"The excess deaths -- the number beyond what would normally be expected for that time of year -- occurred during March and through April 4, a time when 8,128 coronavirus deaths were reported. The excess deaths are not necessarily attributable directly to covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus. They could include people who died because of the epidemic but not from the disease, such as those who were afraid to seek medical treatment for unrelated illnesses, as well as some number of deaths that are part of the ordinary variation in the death rate. The count is also affected by increases or decreases in other categories of deaths, such as suicides, homicides and motor vehicle accidents. But in any pandemic, higher-than-normal mortality is a starting point for scientists seeking to understand the full impact of the disease.\"\n\nBy the time the rector of a Georgetown church became the city's patient zero on March 7, Woodley Park resident Kathy Hughes had already been feeling ill for three weeks, Tara Bahrampour reports. \"On Feb. 16, a day after returning from a ski trip in northern Italy, the 54-year-old education researcher woke with a fever, chills, a headache and exhaustion. When the illness did not go away after a few days, she went to her doctor. ... Her doctor told her the flu test must have been a false negative. It didn't occur to them that it could be the coronavirus. On Wednesday, Hughes, now recovered from her illness, went to a doctor in Fairfax who administered a finger-prick serology test. Within 10 minutes it came back positive for coronavirus antibodies. If the result was accurate, it would mean the virus was likely present in the District at least three weeks earlier than believed.\"\n\n\"Small businesses must apply for the money through banks, but the SBA guarantees those loans and must approve each application. Shortly after the new round of money became available at 10:30 a.m., bankers around the country began reporting problems accessing the SBA's Web portal, known as E-Tran, and expressed fury on social media over the faltering computer systems,\" Renae Merle, Aaron Gregg and Ben Golliver report. \"Adding to the urgency is the design of the program, which is supposed to dole out loans on a first-come, first-served basis. ... Some analysts said the new round of funding may go even more quickly. ... The SBA acknowledged some problems with its systems but said that by 3:30 p.m. it had processed 100,000 loans submitted by 4,000 lenders. It did not say how much of the $310 billion had been allocated through those loans. Twice as many people attempted to access the program Monday as during any period in the initial phase of funding, SBA Administrator Jovita Carranza said ...\n\n\"The Los Angeles Lakers on Monday became the latest to say that it had applied and received money under the first round of funding. The NBA franchise pledged to return it, something several other companies and organizations have done after their participation was revealed. It was unclear if any other professional sports franchises received these loans. The NBA left the decision to apply for an SBA loan to its individual teams ... At least $500 million went to large publicly held companies, according to a Post analysis of Securities and Exchange Commission records. ... Nearly 80 percent of the small businesses that applied for a loan were still waiting for an answer when the first round of funding ran out, according to a survey by the National Federation of Independent Business.\"\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) \"released a statement confirming his intention to bring the Senate back into session May 4 and said his top priority would be 'strong protections from opportunistic lawsuits' for health-care workers and businesses,\" Erica Werner and John Wagner report. \"House Majority Leader Steny H. Hoyer (D-Md.) told Democrats on a conference call that the House, too, would be reconvening May 4. Earlier, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said Congress might need to consider offering a guaranteed income to some Americans to help the country recover ... The comments from McConnell and Pelosi [set] up an ideological and partisan clash ... A number of Democrats in the House and Senate have advanced proposals that would ensure a guaranteed paycheck for workers impacted by the coronavirus. ... McConnell's statement, by contrast, endorsed some type of a 'liability shield' that would prevent businesses from being sued by customers who contract the coronavirus, an idea that has been under consideration at the White House.\"\n\n\"The new landscape could include one-way hallways, kids and teachers in masks, and lunch inside classrooms instead of cafeterias. Buses may run half empty, and students may have their temperatures read before entering the building.

Then they would swap,\" Laura Meckler, Valerie Strauss and Moriah Balingit report. \"And while many parents are eager to end the national experiment in remote education, others are terrified that any return to school would expose their children to a deadly disease. But President Trump has pressed to reopen the economy, and one key to a functioning workforce is a school system that allows parents to do their jobs.\"\n\nThe staggering acceleration of supply chain disruptions is raising expectations of looming global shortfalls.

Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz is allowing certain manufacturers and offices that do not have in-person interaction with clients to open,\" Robert Klemko and Arelis Hern\u00e1ndez report. \"In Colorado, the state's stay-at-home order expired Monday, ceding to a tapered plan to reopen the state, beginning with curbside retail sales and elective surgeries Monday. ... Denver Mayor Michael Hancock (D) has extended the city's stay-at-home order until May 8, and suburban counties have followed suit. ...\n\n\"In Texas, Gov. Greg Abbott (R) gave most retailers, movie theaters and restaurants the green light to reopen their businesses with limited capacity ... The order supersedes local stay-at-home ordinances that are in place in most of the state's biggest cities. The move could set the stage for a clash between the governor and some leaders of Texas's largest metropolitan areas, where the virus's toll has been more acute, over how a gradual reopening will work. Abbott emphasized that as of May 1, business owners, not the government, will decide whether to reopen. ... Austin Mayor Steve Adler (D) said he worries that infections could spike if reopening moves too quickly and cities aren't able to try to control infection rates with local rules. ... Texas has lagged in per capita testing but Abbott said the models he is consulting show the state's new infection rates have declined.\"\n\n\"'We are turning the valves on reopening,' New York Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo (D) said. ... [He] wants to partially 'unpause' beginning May 15, when regulations expire statewide. Cuomo said he will extend restrictions in some areas of the state,\" Anne Gearan and John Wagner report. \"Cuomo said officials devising reopening measures should ensure that they meet the CDC's guidelines, consider how industries and businesses permitted to reopen will physically distance and monitor workers, and evaluate the capacity their local health systems will have during the flu season. Local officials should also think about their testing, tracing and isolating facilities, Cuomo said.\"\n\nMichelle Obama has recorded robocalls and radio ads reminding residents to stay at home to limit the spread, while Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s is chairing the restaurant committee of the ReOpen D.C.

So an infection-control team headed by Hitoshi Oshitani of Tohoku University placed its bets on a cluster-based approach. ... The strategy initially seemed successful: Working round-the-clock to track down the clusters, the team tamped down the first wave of infections from China and the Diamond Princess cruise ship in February with little social disruption. But then the approach started to unravel as a new wave of infections entered Japan from Europe and the United States before tougher travel restrictions were put in place.\"\n\n\"In India, the incessant beep-beep of cars has disappeared. In New York, Harlem's heart has stopped beating. In the suburbs of Detroit, the chatter of neighbors is muffled. In Toronto, the trains no longer whistle, and in Marseille, every day sounds like a holiday. All around the world, the silence rolls in and out like fog. It hangs in the air -- there but not there. Impenetrable and fragile, weightless and smothering,\" writes Robin Givhan. \"Some people find the quiet calming. They feel closer to God. They give in to the stillness and consider their destiny. They have a silver-lining attitude: The air is cleaner; crimes rates have dropped; school shootings ceased in the United States.

But when we, the agitated, try to breathe deeply and locate our spiritual center, it's elusive.\"\n\n\"I went to some very dark places,\" CNN anchor Brooke Baldwin wrote in her coronavirus diary. \"Under the influence of coronavirus, as each day came to a close, I would often cry, unable to stave off the sense of dread and isolation I felt about what was to come.\" (Allyson Chiu)\n\n\"Apparent corroboration surfaced this week for elements of two accusations made by Biden's former Senate aide Tara Reade, one involving harassment and the second a sexual assault,\" Matt Viser reports. \"Biden has not commented on the allegations, but his campaign has denied them and pointed to his record on women's rights and promotion of women in his offices. Lynda LaCasse, who was one of Reade's neighbors in California, where Reade moved after working for Biden, said in an interview with Business Insider published Monday that Reade told her in the mid-1990s that Biden had 'put his hand up her skirt and he put his fingers inside her.'\n\n\"Lorraine Sanchez, a former colleague of Reade's in the office of a California state senator, also told the news outlet that Reade told her in the mid-1990s that she 'had been sexually harassed by her former boss while she was in DC and as a result of her voicing her concerns to her supervisors, she was let go, fired.' Sanchez did not recall whether Reade mentioned Biden specifically, or whether she provided further details about the allegation. In recent days, a 1993 call into Larry King's CNN talk show also surfaced. In it, a woman whom Reade identified as her now-deceased mother called to report unspecified 'problems' her daughter was having with her employer, whom she called 'a prominent senator.'

        "authors": [],
        "body": "The medical examiner in California's Santa Clara County didn't learn until Tuesday that the novel coronavirus killed a resident there on Feb. 6 - 76 days ago. But it was not for lack of trying.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention was severely restricting testing at the time to people who had traveled abroad, sought medical care for specific symptoms or were in close contact with an infected person. This unidentified person died at home, as did another individual who died in the county on Feb. 17.\n\nBut the local coroner performed autopsies on the two bodies and sent tissue samples to the CDC. Finally, after phone calls to federal authorities, they were tested. Both of the deceased had covid-19, the disease caused by the virus. So did a third person who died on March 6.\n\nInitially, the nation's earliest coronavirus fatality was believed to have occurred on Feb. 29 in a Seattle suburb. A few weeks ago, Washington state health officials linked two deaths on Feb. 26 to the disease.\n\nUntil the CDC alerted Santa Clara officials to the test results on Tuesday, that county's first official fatality had taken place on March 9. But this latest news means someone died there more than a month earlier than previously known.\n\nOne of the reasons this is a huge deal is that local officials do not believe the person who died on Feb. 6 had traveled outside the country, although they're still investigating. This suggests community transmission was underway in the San Francisco Bay Area far earlier than previously known. Santa Clara County is home to San Jose, Silicon Valley and Stanford University.\n\nSara Cody, the county's public health officer, said local officials often had to call the CDC and discuss the specifics of individual cases before the agency would grant permission for testing. \"We did have a very uncomfortable feeling that we were missing cases because we didn't have the tests to be able to confirm,\" she told Allyson Chiu. \"This tells us that yes, we were definitely missing cases.\"\n\nLately, I've received dozens of emails from readers who believe they had the coronavirus earlier in the year, before there was known community spread. While the seasonal flu was going around, and there are overlapping symptoms, this new timeline suggests some number of people indeed had coronavirus cases that were overlooked. Reliable antibody testing is still not widely available so folks cannot easily check their suspicions.\n\nOr how it quietly invaded our country. Recent genetic analysis has suggested that some of the early cases on the East Coast came from Europe, not China. Other analysis has suggested that the virus was spreading around Seattle weeks before anyone realized it was there.\n\nModeling for epidemics relies heavily on the start date of an outbreak. Jay Bhattacharya, a professor of medicine at Stanford, said that, if the start date gets pushed back, the models must be redone and reviewed. This also increases the number of people who are probably infected right now and don't know it, he told Teo Armus.\n\nAs of this morning, at least 44,673 people have died from the coronavirus in the United States and at least 813,000 cases have been reported.\n\nA man in Wuhan, China, was diagnosed with the virus in February. Two months later, he's still living in a quarantine center because tests continue to show that he's carrying the disease - even though he does not have any symptoms. Reuters reports that doctors in that area report a growing number of cases in which people appear to have recovered from the virus but continue to test positive, which means they can spread it.\n\nSome people who have had the coronavirus have a lot of antibodies in their system to defend against a second attack from the virus, but early testing shows that other survivors have relatively few antibodies, making them vulnerable. There have been reports from South Korea of people recovering from covid-19 only to get re-infected. These cases are of immense interest to not just front-line physicians but also the researchers around the globe racing to develop a vaccine.\n\nThe failure by the CDC to quickly produce a test kit for detecting the coronavirus was triggered by a glaring scientific breakdown at the CDC's central laboratory complex in Atlanta, David Willman reported last weekend. Scientists say the CDC facilities that assembled the kits violated sound manufacturing practices, resulting in contamination of one of the three test components used in the highly sensitive detection process.\n\nThat's because it will probably coincide with the start of flu season. He explained during an interview on Tuesday with Lena Sun that having two simultaneous respiratory outbreaks would put immense strain on the health-care system and said federal and state officials need to use the coming months to prepare. As stay-at-home orders are lifted, Redfield added, states still need to massively scale up their ability to identify the infected through testing and find everyone they interact with through contact tracing. \"As part of the White House guidelines released last week for a gradual reopening of the country, testing by CDC teams is already underway in nursing homes in four states for asymptomatic cases. The four states are Nebraska, New Mexico, North Dakota and Tennessee,\" Lena reports.\n\n\"Kentucky and Rhode Island might look similar on paper. They've done comparable numbers of diagnostic tests and lost similar numbers of residents to the disease. But there's one key difference. Kentucky has more than four times Rhode Island's population, meaning it has tested 0.7 percent of its residents, compared with Rhode Island's 3.7 percent, the highest per capita testing level in the United States,\" Juliet Eilperin and Chris Mooney report. \"The difference suggests Rhode Island probably has a better sense of the virus's spread throughout the state, making it better prepared to curb it.\"\n\nSome Senate Republicans are looking for ways to get the federal government more involved in testing. The spending deal advanced by the Senate yesterday includes $25 billion to help expand testing capacity, including $1 billion for the CDC to improve surveillance of infections. \"Led by Sens. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.) and Roy Blunt (R-Mo.), Senate Republicans have largely envisioned the federal government taking a lead role in experimenting with diagnostic and serological tests for the coronavirus, even if some of the ideas ultimately fail,\" Seung Min Kim and Toluse Olorunnipa report. \"Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-La.), has proposed a centralized immunity registry that would track who would be protected from infecting others with the coronavirus, modeling it on existing systems for other diseases that record who has been vaccinated.\"\n\n\"South Carolina, Georgia, Texas, Tennessee and Florida have announced limited easing of business and recreational closures and social gatherings, to start between this week and the end of April. While some of those states have shown a fall in confirmed virus cases on some recent days, other days have presented increased numbers. None has charted the sustained, 14-day 'downward trajectory' outlined in federal guidelines issued last week,\" Karen DeYoung, Miriam Berger and Katie Mettler. \"Trump, speaking at the daily White House virus briefing Tuesday, said that the guidelines were intended to give states the tools to initiate a gradual, 'safe' reopening of the country. But he stressed that they are not mandatory ... The guidelines stress that they are to be implemented on a 'statewide or county-by-county basis at governors' discretion.' In addition to a sustained reduction in confirmed cases, they also propose that hospitals are able to 'treat all patients without crisis care,' and have a 'robust testing' system in place before moving to what the guidelines call the Phase I reopening.\"\n\nSix GOP governors across the Southeast formed their own coalition to discuss reopening the economy: Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, Tennessee, Alabama and Mississippi. This part of the country has underfunded health systems, as well as higher rates of obesity, diabetes and other illnesses that amplify the deadliness of the coronavirus. These states have also lagged on testing and social distancing, Politico reports. \"As of Tuesday morning, the six states had collectively tested about one-tenth of 1 percent of their total populations. Mississippi, which ranks 15th nationally in testing, had the group's best testing rate at 1.7 percent of its population. Georgia was the lowest, with a testing rate of less than one one-hundredth of 1 percent, or 42nd in the country ... By comparison, the coalition of seven states in the Northeast has a collective testing rate twice that of the Southeast, having swabbed more than two-tenths of 1 percent of their collective population.\"\n\n\"There are more important things than living,\" said Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick (R), who is pushing to reopen the state. \"I don't want to die, nobody wants to die, but man, we got to take some risks and get back in the game, and get this country back up and running.\" (Fort Worth Star-Telegram)\n\nAn anti-malarial drug Trump \"has aggressively promoted to treat covid-19 had no benefit and was linked to higher rates of death for Veterans Affairs patients hospitalized with the novel coronavirus,\" Christopher Rowland reports. \"The study by VA and academic researchers analyzed outcomes of 368 male patients nationwide, with 97 receiving hydroxychloroquine, 113 receiving hydroxychloroquine in combination with the antibiotic azithromycin, and 158 not receiving any hydroxychloroquine. Rates of death in the groups treated with the drugs were worse than those who did not receive the drugs, the study found. Rates of patients on ventilators were roughly equal, with no benefit demonstrated by the drugs.\" The president claimed during his Tuesday evening news conference that he was unfamiliar with the VA study.\n\nRick Bright, one of the nation's leading vaccine development experts, has been ousted as the head of the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority. Stat reports there was chafing between Bright and his boss Bob Kadlec, the assistant secretary for preparedness and response at Health and Human Services. Bright is being moved to a narrower role at the National Institutes of Health.\n\nJared Kushner, the president's son-in-law, enlisted private-sector volunteers in the government's response, including eight junior analysts at the investment fund Insight Partners who were assigned to help FEMA secure protective gear and testing kits. The move prompted concerns from FEMA employees that investors are interacting with vendors on the government's behalf, and they are doing so on Gmail accounts, sometimes not copying government addresses, in potential violation of open records laws, the Wall Street Journal reports. Remember: A major theme of the 2016 campaign was Trump attacking Hillary Clinton for using a private email account.\n\nNearly 25,000 email addresses and passwords allegedly from the NIH, CDC, WHO, Gates Foundation, World Bank and other groups battling the pandemic were dumped online by unknown actors. SITE Intelligence Group said the information was released Sunday and Monday and almost immediately used to foment attempts at hacking and harassment by far-right extremists. \"The lists, whose origins are unclear, appear to have first been posted to 4chan, a message board notorious for its hateful and extreme political commentary, and later to Pastebin, a text storage site, to Twitter and to far-right extremist channels on Telegram, a messaging app,\" Souad Mekhennet and Craig Timberg report. \"The report by SITE, based in Bethesda, Md., said the largest group of alleged emails and passwords was from the NIH, with 9,938 found on lists posted online. The [CDC] had the second-highest number, with 6,857. The World Bank had 5,120. The list of WHO addresses and passwords totaled 2,732.\"\n\nAn Australian cybersecurity expert, Robert Potter, said he was able to verify that the WHO email addresses and passwords were real. \"Their password security is appalling,\" Potter said. \"Forty-eight people have 'password' as their password.\" Others, he said, had used their own first names or \"changeme.\" Potter said the alleged addresses and passwords may have been purchased from vendors on the dark Web and that the WHO credentials appear to have come from a 2016 hack.\n\n\"Skylar Herbert loved dressing up and performing. She adored going to kindergarten. She started reading at age 4. She liked 'girly things' and bling,\" Chelsea Janes and Vickie Elmer report. \"About a month ago, Skylar started to complain of headaches. Within days, she was hospitalized in the Detroit suburbs ... On Sunday, surrounded by doctors and her family, the 5-year-old became the first child in Michigan to die of covid-19 ... She was both young and without known underlying conditions. Her death serves as a reminder that the coronavirus can present peril to people at any age. ... Her story disproves 'the myth now that children couldn't get it,' said her father, Ebbie Herbert. The family has agreed that the hospital may use Skylar's tissue to research covid-19, her mother said.\" Skylar's mom is a Detroit police officer, and her dad is a firefighter. \"Boston Children's has admitted 25 children ... Children's National Hospital in the District reported a steady increase in cases, as did Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. ... Mount Sinai Kravis Children's Hospital in New York ... has admitted about 20 children with covid-19.\"\n\n\"New York City has been distilled to its essential workforce. The Bronx, predominantly, is where they live, each day cramming into buses and subway trains that take them into Manhattan. As the city rallies around a mantra of 'New York Tough,' the marginalized here -- among them city transit staff, garbage collectors and health-care workers -- know that New Yorkers are not truly all in this together. There are now more coronavirus infections here per capita than in any of the city's other boroughs,\" Richard Morgan reports from Ground Zero of Ground Zero. \"The Bronx is not just the poorest borough in the city. The 15th District, or NY-15, its chief congressional district, is the poorest in the nation. Of all the unsettling data points to have surfaced during the pandemic, one is front of mind among many of the 1.5 million people who live here: Of New York state's 62 counties, the Bronx ranks dead last by most every measure. ... A covid-19 testing site was announced for the neighborhood this month, but Manhattan -- the city's least affected borough with less than half the Bronx's infection rate -- has converted its Javits Center convention hall and a piece of Central Park into makeshift hospitals. What about the Bronx?\"\n\nThe Los Angeles Times spent over 10 days interviewing doctors and nurses in New York City's Mount Sinai Health System. The health workers recounted how they faced crushing workloads and unrelenting tragedy. But as the days progressed, rare uplifting moments came too, along with the thought, and hope, that things might just be getting better. \"We were walking to a meeting, me and a couple of colleagues, and we walked past transport workers who were taking a deceased patient to the morgue truck,\" said Peter Shearer, from Mount Sinai Brooklyn. \"We have a refrigerated truck to hold the bodies because so many people are dying. After we got a bit down the hall, I turn to the others and asked: 'Did we just walk by a dead body and nobody recognized it?'\"\n\nThe legislation, passed by unanimous consent, would increase funding for the Paycheck Protection Program, boost a separate small-business emergency grant and loan program by $60 billion, and direct $75 billion to hospitals and $25 billion to a new coronavirus testing program. The House is expected to approve the measure tomorrow. \"Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Tuesday that larger firms would now be blocked from using the PPP, and Trump called on some big companies that had already obtained taxpayer-backed loans to return the money,\" Erica Werner and Seung Min Kim report. \"Speaking on the Senate floor shortly before the legislation passed by voice vote, Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) said lawmakers needed to quickly begin work on another piece of legislation that would match the size and scope of last month's $2 trillion Cares Act.\" There are already signs the $310 billion set aside for the PPP will not meet surging demand for loans.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) disagreed with Schumer, arguing now it's time to \"push the pause button\" on additional stimulus spending, at least until lawmakers are able to return to the Capitol in person, which is supposed to be May 4: \"McConnell said that the impact on the deficit and debt is becoming a concern and that the best stimulus is for the economy to start functioning again. He said he was pleased that was gradually starting to happen. ... Democrats fought successfully for money in the bill for hospitals and testing, but they did not get Republicans and Trump administration officials to go along with their demand for $150 billion for cities and states. Schumer said he hopes to see that addressed in the next package, and Trump has indicated he is open to it.\"\n\nThe president's move \"will continue to allow temporary workers on nonimmigrant visas to enter. The president provided a rationale for the unprecedented decision that was primarily economic, arguing that he wants Americans to have access to work as millions of people have lost their jobs,\" Nick Miroff, Maria Sacchetti and Tracy Jan report. \"Trump said the executive order was still being written as of Tuesday night. ... After 60 days, the need for modification will be evaluated 'based on economic conditions' in the country, Trump said, conditions that he would personally assess. ... The president also said that seasonal farm laborers would not be affected by the measures and that the suspension 'will help to conserve vital medical resources.' ... Senior officials at the Department of Homeland Security and other federal agencies could not respond to basic questions about the scope of the order. Other aides said privately that the president had once more announced a sweeping policy that was not yet ready for implementation, and his administration was trying to piece together an executive order for him to sign that would catch up to his whim.\"\n\nA unanimous vote overturned the way things have been done in London for over 700 years. They'll keep arguing -- but at a proper distance. (William Booth)\n\n\"Instead of waiting for sick people to start swamping their health system, potentially overwhelming it, [the government] brought care to the people instead,\" Bornolo Mogotsi and Max Bearak report. \"More than 28,000 health-care workers have spread out across South Africa's nine provinces. Some go door to door, taking down people's travel histories, temperatures and other risk factors. Others, especially in dense, poor communities known as townships, set up pop-up clinics where turnout has been high. ... Two million South Africans -- out of a population of 57 million -- have been screened this way, according to the health ministry. Tens of thousands have been tested who may not otherwise have been. South Africa has more than 3,400 confirmed cases -- the highest number in Africa -- but its government considers that a result of aggressive testing. As of Tuesday, more than 125,000 people had been tested.\"\n\n\"The heavily-redacted report, based on a three-year investigation, builds on a committee finding nearly two years ago that the January 2017 intelligence community assessment (ICA) on Russia was sound. The spy agencies also found that Russia sought to shake faith in American democracy, denigrate then-candidate Hillary Clinton and boost [Trump],\" Ellen Nakashima reports. \"The report, while not unexpected, is nonetheless a milestone -- the first extensive bipartisan congressional affirmation of the intelligence agencies' conclusion, which continues to be at odds with Trump's oft-stated doubts about Russia's role in the 2016 race. ... The committee said the CIA, National Security Agency and FBI -- coordinated by the Director of National Intelligence -- presented a 'coherent and well-constructed' case for their assessment, supported by intelligence from human and electronic sources.\"\n\nTrump continues to be fixated on ratings:\n\nVice President Pence visited a factory in Wisconsin:\n\nPeople across the country are not receiving stimulus checks because they're married to immigrants:\n\nAn anchor for New York's ABC7 took viewers on an emotional roller coaster by declaring that a young man was dead - and then clarifying that he was very much alive:\n\nTrevor Noah lashed out at Trump for his nativist executive order:\n\nAnd Stephen Colbert pleaded with Trump to stop boasting about his ratings as the body count spikes:",

    "Analysis | The Finance 202: Economists and banking analysts debate whether new small business money will be enough": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "The Senate just passed a new infusion of cash for the small business loan program designed to keep businesses afloat as the coronavirus pandemic batters the economy.\n\nBut economists and banking industry leaders already want to know: is the new $310 billion for the Paycheck Protection Program - which brings the total for PPP to $660 billion - big enough?\n\nMany big-bank executives and lobbyists point to their knowledge of those still waiting in line and say it is not. Some economists point to back-of-the-envelope estimates of the need and say the new funding should at least be close. Either way, they agree, the money probably will go fast, so the answer should be at hand soon, too.\n\nThe original PPP pot of $349 billion in forgivable loans -- aimed at helping businesses with fewer than 500 employees keep them on the payroll until June -- ran dry last week. The funding boost - which the House is expected to approve Thursday and President Trump pledged to sign -- would bring the total up to about $660 billion for smaller companies.\n\nThat gets the program in the neighborhood of the $720 billion it needs to keep eligible companies afloat until early summer, according to calculations by economists at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business. Analysts at Goldman Sachs reach a similar conclusion, finding the second round of funding will \"cover close to all PPP-eligible expenses,\" which they peg at $750 billion.\n\nThe teams rely on similar methods, pulling census and Internal Revenue Service data to estimate the number of eligible businesses and their expenses.\n\nThe sector's top Washington hands see a wider gap. \"Banking industry representatives say the program has a burn rate of $50 billion per day and needs closer to $1 trillion to meet demand, with hundreds of thousands of applications pending,\" Politico's Zachary Warmbrodt reports. He notes Rep. Derek Kilmer (D-Wash.), who leads the business-friendly New Democrat Coalition, has sponsored a bill to add $900 billion in funding for the program and extending it for the length of the national emergency.\n\nBank of America economists likewise find the program needs a total sum closer to $1 trillion. Their math: The first tranche provided about $350 billion to 1.6 million firms; there are about 6 million eligible businesses in the entire country, of which they expect 70 percent will seek relief; extrapolating from the first payout brings that amount to $900 billion.\n\n\"Time is of the essence: according to surveys, if companies are closed for 1 month, the likelihood of surviving through December without any assistance was 72%,\" Michelle Meyer and Stephen Juneau wrote at the end of last week. \"If closed for 4 months (through mid-summer), the probability was only 38%.\"\n\nUniversity of Chicago economist Michael Minnis acknowledges there \"could be a very wide confidence interval\" around his team's projection. He tells me arriving at a total price tag of $1 trillion for the loan program is a stretch and unknowns could pull the Chicago estimate in either direction. More sole proprietors showing up to make claims would nudge it up, for example, while businesses that have already laid off staff deciding to skip the process altogether could tug it down.\n\nDialing up the urgency for policymakers, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) indicated this will be the last batch of emergency economic relief from the pandemic until Congress is set to return on May 4.\n\nBigger and better connected companies, including more than 70 that are publicly traded, elbowed to the head of the first line. \"Whether a firm made the cut often came down to how and where it banked,\" the Wall Street Journal reported. Among others, Ruth's Chris Steak House, valued at $250 million, reported receiving $20 million from the program. Wells Fargo, Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, and US Bancorp face lawsuits from small firms that charge them with prioritizing bigger loans.\n\nFor the second round of funding, \"Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said Tuesday that larger firms would now be blocked from using the program, and Trump called on some big companies that had already obtained taxpayer-backed loans to return the money,\" Erica Werner and Seung Min Kim write. Mnuchin said \"there are severe consequences\" for businesses that abuse the program.\n\nAnd policymakers added new strictures on the second tranche to help smaller outfits get access, including reserving $60 billion for lending by small and medium-sized financial firms, per Erica and Seung Min.\n\n\"Other provisions would require participation by lending institutions serving minority or underserved areas, such as Community Development Financial Institutions and minority depository institutions, language sought by the Congressional Hispanic Caucus and others,\" they write. \"An additional $11 billion is included for administrative costs, meaning the total PPP spending in the bill is $321 billion.\"\n\nThe Dow fell 600 points: \"A global oil glut sent prices so low Monday that sellers holding U.S. crude contracts paid buyers as much as $30 per barrel to take it off their hands. The collapse went international Tuesday, with futures prices for the global benchmark, Brent crude, dropping to a fraction of the $50 or so needed for a producer to make money. It was an ominous sign, suggesting that oil markets and the world economy may not stabilize for months,\" Thomas Heath reports.\n\n\"The broader Standard & Poor's 500 dropped 86 points, or 3 percent, to end at 2,736.56. The tech-heavy Nasdaq plunged nearly 298 points, or 3.5 percent, to 8,263.23. All three indexes had pared back even deeper losses. IBM, Apple, Intel and Microsoft were among the big drags on the Dow. All 11 S&P 500 stock sectors were negative.\"\n\nTrump's D.C. hotel is mostly empty: \"In recent weeks, the president's family business has inquired about changing its lease payments, according to people familiar with the matter, which the federal government has reported amount to nearly $268,000 per month,\" the Times's Ben Protess, Steve Eder and David Enrich report.\n\n\"The Trump Organization owns and operates the luxury hotel, but it is in a federally owned building on Pennsylvania Avenue. As part of its deal to open the 263-room hotel, the company signed a 60-year lease in 2013 that requires the monthly payments to the General Services Administration. Eric Trump, the president's son, confirmed that the company had opened a conversation about possible changes to the terms of the lease, which could include adjustments to future monthly payments. The Trump Organization has said it is current on its rent.\" Eric Trump says the company wants to be treated like any other tenant.\n\nJared's moves at FEMA prompt concern: \"White House senior adviser Jared Kushner in March launched an effort under the government's emergency powers to enlist private-sector volunteers in the coronavirus pandemic response,\" the WSJ's Rachael Levy reports.\n\n\"A FEMA spokeswoman said the help was welcome given the seriousness of the pandemic and FEMA's need to buy medical supplies ... But the move also prompted concerns from some FEMA employees over the volunteers' roles in interacting with vendors on the government's behalf. They did so with personal Gmail accounts, sometimes not copying government addresses, leading some vendors to question the authenticity of the outreach, according to FEMA employees.\"\n\nA Trump megadonor is aggressively pushing to reopen Wisconsin: \"An unusual email greeted employees at a Wisconsin shipping-supply company on Friday. It urged them to support a petition for the recall of the state's Democratic governor, Tony Evers, saying he was violating their constitutional right to work during the coronavirus pandemic,\" Bloomberg News's Anders Melin and Polly Mosendz report.\n\nChipotle to pay $25 million fine for food poisoning: \"It's the largest fine ever imposed in a food-safety case, according to a statement Tuesday by the U.S. attorney's office in Los Angeles,\" Bloomberg News's Edvard Pettersson reports of allegations by federal prosecutors that the company's food sickened more than 1,100 people across the United States from 2015 to 2018.\n\n\"The criminal charges pertain in part to norovirus outbreaks at Chipotle restaurants. The highly contagious virus can be transmitted by infected food workers handling ready-to-eat foods and their ingredients, according to the statement. It can cause severe symptoms, including diarrhea, vomiting and abdominal cramping ... Prosecutors alleged that four norovirus outbreaks were caused by employees showing up to work sick, in violation of company policy, and by food products being stored at the wrong temperatures.\"\n\nActivist investor eyes Nintendo: \"Activist investor ValueAct Capital Partners LP has built a stake of over $1.1 billion in Nintendo, according to a letter seen by Reuters, a bet that digital software distribution and the development of new entertainment products will fuel growth at the Japanese consumer electronics company,\" Svea Herbst-Bayliss reports.\n\n\"ValueAct, which first began buying the stock in April 2019, grew the position in Nintendo, known for its gaming consoles and for having turned characters like Mario and Donkey Kong into international hits, during the stock market sell-off in February and March, according to the letter sent to its investors.\"\n\nAmericans have soured on this economy much faster than they did during this century's other two downturns, per the Pew Research Center:",

    "Analysis | The Health 202: Here's one big reason U.S. coronavirus tests are lagging: test kits made by private companies": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "President Trump and governors are pointing fingers at each other over the nation's tardiness in ramping up essential testing for the novel coronavirus.\n\nBut the private-sector makers of these tests -- and their proprietary interests -- are central to the complex problem of why experts say the United States is falling far short of the testing capacity needed to safely lift widespread social distancing guidelines.\n\nLabs around the United States, both public and private, have increased their testing capacity over the past six weeks. But private labs, which process about two-thirds of all tests, are limited by this problem: The companies selling the testing machines typically also make the chemicals, or \"reagents,\" needed to process their tests.\n\nSo if a lab has a backlog of tests to process, it has to get the reagent that is compatible with a particular piece of equipment. If the manufacturer doesn't have enough supply, the testing machine can't be used, even if a company has a backlog of samples to process.\n\nNew York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) described this problem yesterday as part of an extensive explanation of testing holdups. (New York has tested more people than any other state -- more than 3 percent of its population -- but Cuomo said he's aiming for greater testing capacity if the supply problems can be solved.)\n\n\"[Labs] buy these machines from these national companies ... each one requires that you go back to that manufacturer to get a test kit,\" Cuomo said. \"It gets complicated very quickly.\"\n\nConsider the tests used by Quest Diagnostics, one of the country's two biggest commercial labs. Quest uses, among others, a test from manufacturer Hologic.\n\nHologic told me it manufactures its own reagents in its own facility. While the company has increased production dramatically, its supplies of the cartridges containing the reagents are still limited, according to Kevin Thornal, division president of diagnostic solutions at Hologic.\n\nQuest said it also uses a coronavirus test produced by Roche Pharmaceuticals. In this case, too, the test only works when the lab buys a test kit containing the reagent from Roche. The same is true of testing machines produced by Qiagen, a top supplier of diagnostic supplies to labs.\n\nGovernors and the Trump administration are eyeing plans to let some Americans return to work and relax an economic shutdown that has resulted in massive, unprecedented waves of unemployment. About 140,000 tests are being performed daily around the country, but experts say that needs to multiply several times over to be able to identify and isolate cases.\n\nExpanded testing is a key component of virtually every plan put forward. Yet the effort is highly disorganized as governors scramble for supplies, even buying them directly from other countries, as Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan (R) did this week with help from his South Korean wife.\n\n\"We have the capability. It's the supply chain issue that every state is facing\" Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer told CNN. \"We have the capacity to process the tests. We don't have the swabs and the reagents.\"\n\nAndy Slavitt, former head of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, noted the complexity of increasing testing in the U.S.:\n\nSome progress is being made.\n\nThe test, sold by LabCorp, will enable patients to collect nasal samples at home using the kit's swabs and saline. The kits will then be mailed to the North Carolina-based company for testing, my colleague Laurie McGinley reports.\n\nHealth-care workers and first responders on the front lines who may have been exposed or who are showing symptoms will be the first to have access to the newly authorized test.\n\n\"Specifically, for tests that include home sample collection, we worked with LabCorp to ensure the data demonstrated from at-home patient sample collection is as safe and accurate as sample collection at a doctor's office, hospital or other testing site,\" FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn said in a statement. \"With this action, there is now a convenient and reliable option for patient sample collection from the comfort and safety of their home.\"\n\n\"The company said the test will cost $119. Consumers will have to pay out of pocket for the test, a company spokesman said, and ask their insurer for reimbursement,\" the New York Times's Katie Thomas and Natasha Singer report. \"The Trump administration has repeatedly said that diagnostic tests for the coronavirus will be covered so that consumers don't have to foot the bill.\"\n\nFormer FDA commissioner Scott Gottlieb:\n\nYet Democrats and the Trump administration are butting heads over who is responsible for ensuring labs have enough tests. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) want a national strategy, while the president says it's up to the states. Leaders of his coronavirus task force, who had promised way more tests would be completed by now, have been giving less-than-direct answers to queries about the delays.\n\nBrett Giroir, Trump's testing czar, referred in Monday's news briefing to an \"end-to-end issue\" the administration has been dealing with but didn't detail exactly what he was referring to.\n\nThe governor said it's his job to ensure that the labs his state regulates have sufficient testing capacity.\n\n\"Hold me responsible,\" Cuomo said.\n\nBut Cuomo also outlined an area where the administration could help: by stepping in and helping to secure supplies from other countries, so governors such as Hogan don't have to compete with other states for them. The whole effort to expand testing should be a partnership between the states and the federal government, he said.\n\n\"Let the federal government figure out South Korea and China and international supply issues rather than have 50 states now figure out how to be like Governor Hogan,\" Cuomo said.\n\nSome states with extensive health-care resources have made more progress in tracking the virus, while others are struggling to catch up, The Washington Post's Juliet Eilperin and Chris Mooney report. Just look at Kentucky versus Rhode Island. Both states have done comparable numbers of diagnostic tests and lost similar numbers of residents to the disease.\n\nBut there's one key difference,\" Juliet and Chris write. \"Kentucky has more than four times Rhode Island's population, meaning it has tested 0.7 percent of its residents, compared with Rhode Island's 3.7 percent, the highest per capita testing level in the United States.\"\n\n\"The difference suggests Rhode Island probably has a better sense of the virus's spread throughout the state, making it better prepared to curb it,\" they add.\n\nHealth officials in California say at least two people who died in early and mid-February had contracted the virus, The Post's Allyson Chiu and Teo Armus report. Tissue samples taken during autopsies of two individuals who died at home on Feb. 6 and Feb. 17 in Santa Clara County, Calif., tested positive for the virus, local health officials said in a statement.\n\nInitially, the nation's earliest coronavirus fatality was believed to have occurred on Feb. 29, in Kirkland, Wash. \"The Santa Clara County fatalities push the earliest coronavirus-related fatality back by weeks, with the new findings potentially altering the timeline of the U.S. outbreak,\" Allyson and Teo write.\n\nThat's what the head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention told our Post colleague Lena H. Sun, warning that the second wave is also likely to coincide with the start of the flu season in the winter.\n\n\"There's a possibility that the assault of the virus on our nation next winter will actually be even more difficult than the one we just went through,\" CDC Director Robert Redfield told Lena. \"And when I've said this to others, they kind of put their head back, they don't understand what I mean.\"\n\nThe possibility of two respiratory outbreaks at once could pummel the health-care system.\n\nThe first wave of the coronavirus has already overwhelmed hospitals and revealed testing gaps as well as shortages in critical equipment, including ventilators and protective equipment.\n\nRedfield told The Post that federal and state officials need to use the coming months to prepare for that next wave. Redfield acknowledged a larger workforce is critical and he said the CDC is planning to hire more workers to assist with tracking the virus. \"Redfield said the agency is talking with state officials about the possibility of using Census Bureau workers, Peace Corps and AmeriCorps volunteers to build 'an alternative workforce,' \" Lena writes.\n\nRedfield's comments underline the greater need for workers to track the virus.\n\n\"Before the pandemic, state and local health departments had fewer than 2,000 workers carrying out contact tracing -- the detailed investigatory work to track and stop outbreaks of everything from syphilis to measles,\" Politico's Dan Goldberg and Alice Miranda Ollstein report. \"The real number needed could be somewhere between 100,000 and 300,000 -- an astronomical figure that seems near impossible to reach without a massive national program to build a highly trained public health workforce.\"\n\nThere have been at least 25,000 more deaths during the pandemic than official death reports, the New York Times's Jin Wu and Allison McCann report, citing a review of mortality data in 11 countries.\n\n\"In the last month, far more people died in these countries than in previous years, the New York Times found. The totals include deaths from Covid-19 as well as those from other causes, likely including people who could not be treated as hospitals became overwhelmed,\" they write. \"These numbers undermine the notion that many people who have died from the virus may soon have died anyway. In Paris, more than twice the usual number of people have died each day, far more than the peak of a bad flu season. In New York City, the number is now four times the normal amount.\"\n\n\"Today's rise in all-cause mortality takes place under conditions of extraordinary measures, such as social distancing, lockdowns, closed borders and increased medical care, at least some which have positive impacts,\" Vladimir Shkolnikov from the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research told the Times. \"It is likely that without these measures, the current death toll would be even higher.\"\n\nColorado Gov. Jared Polis (D) announced this week he will shift his stay-at-home order, which is expiring Sunday, to a \"safer at home\" phase.\n\nPolis said starting Monday, retailers can open with curbside pickup, and they can open with social distancing guidelines in place and limited numbers of in-store customers starting on May 1, the Denver Post's Shelly Bradbury reports.\n\n\"Companies likely can reopen offices with 50% of their workforces the following Monday, on May 4, the governor said, although he added that telecommuting should be maximized as much as possible, particularly with older employees,\" Shelly adds. \"Personal service providers and elective medical providers, including hair salons, dental offices and tattoo shops, will be able to reopen with some precautions on April 27, such as hair stylists wearing masks. One-on-one real estate showings -- though not open houses -- and child care can restart then, too, Polis said.\"\n\nColorado Public Radio has a helpful table comparing the stay-at-home and safer-at-home phases.\n\nIn Georgia, Republican Gov. Brian Kemp's move to ease restrictions and begin reopening the state \"put his state at the center of a deepening national battle over whether Americans are ready to risk exacerbating the public health crisis to revive the shattered economy,\" our Post colleague Isaac Stanley-Becker reports.\n\n\"Epidemiologists say restrictions on economic activity and public assembly, combined with ramped-up testing and aggressive contact tracing to identify other potentially infected people, are necessary to contain the outbreak of the new coronavirus, which has killed more than 42,000 Americans,\" Isaac writes.\n\n\"Many governors, including some Republicans, have heeded that advice, holding out against protesters who have descended on state capitol buildings to decry the emergency orders. Others are charting a different course.\"\n\nA Washington Post-University of Maryland poll found that 54 percent of Americans say the president's overall response to the coronavirus outbreak has been not so good or poor. That's compared with 72 percent of Americans who say governors' overall response has been excellent or good.\n\nMost Americans are also expecting to stay home for at least a couple more months. A majority say it will be June or later before it will be safe to have larger gatherings of 10 or more people, our Post colleagues Scott Clement and Dan Balz report.\n\nThe use of anti-malarial drug hydroxychloroquine for Veterans Affairs coronavirus patients had no benefit and was linked to higher death rates, according to a study by VA and academic researchers.\n\nIt's the latest development to spur questions about the safety and efficacy of the medicine, which has been widely used during the pandemic, our Post colleague Christopher Rowland reports.\n\nThe study \"analyzed outcomes of 368 male patients nationwide, with 97 receiving hydroxychloroquine, 113 receiving hydroxychloroquine in combination with the antibiotic azithromycin, and 158 not receiving any hydroxychloroquine,\" he writes. \"Rates of death in the groups treated with the drugs were worse than those who did not receive the drugs, the study found. Rates of patients on ventilators were roughly equal, with no benefit demonstrated by the drugs.\"\n\nTrump has touted the drug as a treatment for the coronavirus in White House news conferences and on Twitter.\n\nThe panel of experts convened by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, which is led by Anthony S. Fauci, is recommending against the combination of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin for the treatment of patients with covid-19. The experts are warning about potential toxicities, NPR's Joe Palca reports.\n\nTrump has touted the combination in a tweet and in his task force briefings.\n\n\"The recommendation against their combined use would seem to fly in the face of comments made by President Trump suggesting the combination might be helpful,\" Joe writes. \"... As for using the use of hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine alone, the panel said there was 'insufficient clinical data to recommend either for or against.' It reached the same conclusion about the drug remdesivir.\"\n\nA few more developments to catch up on this morning:",

        "authors": [],
        "body": "The United States is finally getting clues about how widespread the novel coronavirus really is among the population.\n\nAntibody testing being conducted by states, localities and private companies is helping officials determine how many people were infected without realizing it.\n\nThe early results are offering some hopeful signs about the severity of the pandemic - and some not as optimistic.\n\nThe good: The virus is less deadly than initially thought. The bad: It is more deadly than the seasonal flu. And \"herd immunity\" is still far off.\n\nIn New York City, nearly 1 in 4 people tested positive for coronavirus antibodies, Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) announced this week. Across the entire state, 15 percent had coronavirus antibodies. It's likely that infections spread much further in New York City - which is the source of roughly 1 in 5 of the more than 58,000 coronavirus deaths in the United States - than in other parts of the country, given the city's urban density and relative slowness to shut down.\n\nIn Miami-Dade County, Florida, officials say antibody testing indicates that between 4.4 and 7.9 percent of the population has been infected.\n\nOfficials in Los Angeles, which locked down several days before New York, reported an even lower rate of positive antibody tests, saying their research indicates between 2.8 and 5.6 percent of the population has already been infected with the virus.\n\nAnd in the ski town Telluride, Colo., just a tiny fraction of the processed antibody tests came back positive: 26 out of 4,757.\n\nIt underscores the reality that many people are hardly affected by the coronavirus. \"Many people experience mild symptoms or none at all, and never get the standard diagnostic test with a swab up the nose, so they're missed in the official covid-19 case counts,\" my colleague Joel Achenbach writes.\n\nAnd many Americans haven't been able to get tested even if they had mild symptoms because of strict state rules seeking to preserve limited testing materials for medical workers and those living in group settings.\n\nThe true fatality rate -- which has been exceedingly hard to determine because the total number of infections isn't known -- now appears below 1 percent. New York City's antibody tests indicate an infection fatality rate of between 0.5 and 0.8 percent.\n\nYet that number still translates to a lot of people nationally, as The Atlantic's Yascha Mounk notes: \"Even if the virus has a fatality rate of a little less than 1 percent, this means that letting it spread through the population of the United States would cause about 2 million deaths.\"\n\nAnd there's a flip side: People with no symptoms can still easily transmit the highly infectious disease to those more vulnerable to it, especially the elderly and those with preexisting medical conditions.\n\nThe point at which a disease's transmission halts naturally is typically if about 60 to 70 percent of the population is exposed to the virus.\n\nA sizable majority of the American public hasn't yet gotten the virus, so the potential for severe illness and death is still quite high. A 0.5 fatality rate is considerably higher than the seasonal flu's fatality rate, which is probably less than 0.1 percent.\n\n\"As infectious disease experts point out, even a seemingly low rate can translate into a shockingly large death toll if the virus spreads through a major portion of the population,\" Joel writes.\n\nQuest Diagnostics, one of the largest networks of commercial laboratories, announced yesterday that individuals can purchase antibody tests through its website for $120 without having to first get a doctor's order. Test results will be available one to two days after the blood is drawn at a Quest lab, and a doctor will be available to discuss the results with the patient, the company said.\n\nAntibody surveys have been started by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the National Institutes of Health, and colleges and universities around the nation.\n\nTrump is expected to sign an executive order to require meat production plants to stay open, ensuring continued food supply during the pandemic. Trump will invoke the Defense Production Act to classify meat plants as essential, Taylor Telford and Kimberly Kindy report, citing a person familiar with the plan.\n\nThe Post has found at least 20 meatpacking plants have closed in recent weeks because of covid-19 outbreaks. \"The government will provide additional protective gear for employees as well as guidance,\" Taylor and Kimberly write. \"... The government order would keep meat companies from using the most effective weapon available to protect their employees -- closures.\"\n\nThe United Food and Commercial Workers said at least 17 workers have died of covid-19. The CDC and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration have released interim guidance for such facilities, including ways to ensure safe distance between employees and procedures for cleaning shared equipment.\n\nIndustry analysts say pork and beef processing has fallen 25 percent because of these outbreaks. \"Major meat companies, including Tyson Foods, Smithfield Foods and JBS USA, have repeatedly touted their essential role in the nation's food supply chain, often resisting calls from government officials and labor advocates to close their facilities due to outbreaks,\" Taylor and Kimberly write.\n\nAs the virus was spreading beyond China's borders in February, deputy national security adviser Matthew Pottinger believed Chinese leaders were engaging in a massive coverup and a \"psychological warfare\" operation to obscure the origins of the virus and deflect blame, David Nakamura, Carol D. Leonnig and Ellen Nakashima report.\n\n\"U.S. intelligence officials were picking up signs that Chinese operatives were deliberately sowing disinformation, including state media manipulating stories to change key facts,\" they write, adding that Pottinger's personal experience as a journalist in China two decades ago \"left him deeply distrustful of the regime in Beijing and is now shaping the administration's hard-line posture.\"\n\n\"Pottinger believes Beijing's handling of the virus has been 'catastrophic' and 'the whole world is the collateral damage of China's internal governance problems,' \" a person familiar with his thinking told our colleagues.\n\nThe 46-year-old is now a pivotal player in the administration's attempts to make U.S. policy on China more confrontational. \"In private, Pottinger has described [Chinese President] Xi [Jinping] as steering China's authoritarian system toward a more dangerous 'totalitarianism,' seeking to implement Orwellian-style controls over most aspects of society,\" David, Carol and Ellen write.\n\nThe director of the Office of Refugee Resettlement, Jonathan Hayes, was reassigned with little notice, World Magazine's J.C. Derrick and Harvest Prude report.\n\nIt was a move that shocked ORR staff as well as the former director's supervisors, including HHS Secretary Alex Azar. Hayes was praised by people across sides of the aisle, especially as he led the office that was at the center of the president's controversial 2018 child separation policy. Hayes was made director of the office in early 2019.\n\n\"Anti-immigration hard-liners -- led by presidential adviser Stephen Miller -- saw Hayes as soft on immigration and ousted him while the nation's attention was focused on the exploding pandemic,\" J.C. and Harvest write. \"Now, they've imported new leaders in an effort to refashion ORR into an arm of immigration enforcement -- sparking concerns that the child-separation policy Melania and Ivanka Trump intervened to stop may return in another form.\"\n\nEven though immigration has been temporarily halted during the pandemic, the change could have long-term effects.\n\nIt was an apparent violation of the Minnesota medical center's policy, as well as a move that flouted the administration's own recommendations, Felicia Sonmez reports.\n\nPence later defended the decision by saying he is frequently tested for the virus.\n\n\"As vice president of the United States, I'm tested for the coronavirus on a regular basis, and everyone who is around me is tested for the coronavirus,\" Pence said.\n\nAfter visiting the clinic, Pence told reporters: \"Since I don't have the coronavirus, I thought it'd be a good opportunity for me to be here, to be able to speak to these researchers, these incredible health-care personnel, and look them in the eye and say thank you.\"\n\nThe CDC's guidelines on wearing masks -- which note that they're helpful for preventing coronavirus transmission -- don't specify whether someone who has been tested recently should still wear a covering, Felicia writes.\n\nThe clinic posted a notice on its website that as of April 13 it is \"requiring all patients and visitors to wear a face covering or mask to help slow the spread of COVID-19.\"\n\nIn a since-deleted tweet, the clinic said it \"had informed @VP of the masking policy before his arrival today.\"\n\nPolitico's Dan Diamond:\n\nAn emergency room doctor and head of the Committee to Protect Medicare:\n\nVox's Aaron Rupar:\n\nMore than 30 organizations, mostly health-care industry trade associations, sent a letter to congressional leaders with suggestions for how to help the growing number of Americans who are losing coverage as they lose their jobs.\n\n\"The magnitude of the COVID-19 crisis is extraordinary. It has taxed our health care system like never before, and it has stressed the economy as consumers and businesses limit commerce and adhere to social distancing to reduce the transmission of the disease,\" the letter reads.\n\n\"These actions have undoubtedly saved lives, but they also have cost millions of jobs -- more than 26 million by the latest employment reports. Because nearly 180 million Americans get their health care coverage through their work, it is critical to ensure millions of Americans continue to have employer coverage.\"\n\n\"The groups are hoping to influence a next relief package being debated on Capitol Hill,\" Amy Goldstein reports in the live blog. \"The options, which industry leaders call a 'menu,' include new subsidies to employers to help them preserve health benefits during the pandemic, as well as helping more Americans afford to buy health plans through Affordable Care Act marketplaces by subsidizing premiums up to a higher income threshold.\"\n\nHere are a few more headlines to catch up on this morning:",

    "Analysis | The Health 202: States are ending their coronavirus lockdowns earlier than health roadmaps recommend": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "Over a nearly three-week span in March, most state governors across the nation locked down their states because of the novel coronavirus.\n\nGradually opening things up will take even longer -- and probably will vary considerably from state to state.\n\nGovernors are feeling pressure from two sides. Many troubling questions about the coronavirus remain unanswered, such as how to get more Americans tested and whether the United States even has enough capacity to track and isolate virus cases. At the same time, they're feeling immense pressure to restart economic activity, with tens of millions of Americans out of work and the country stuck in a deepening economic crater.\n\nYesterday the National Governors Association released a 10-point guide for states. The first point is to make coronavirus testing broadly available. It urges states to improve surveillance to detect outbreaks, ensure hospitals are equipped to respond to surges and create a plan to reopen in stages.\n\nThe plan also warns states against opening prematurely.\n\n\"Opening without the tools in place to rapidly identify and stop the spread of the virus ... could send states back into crisis mode, push health systems past capacity and force states back into strict social distancing measures,\" it says.\n\nThen there's guidance from the Trump administration, which says states should first see a decrease in confirmed coronavirus cases over a 14-day period. That guidance is in line with what public health experts have recommended -- although Trump has also frequently suggested he'd like to see states open sooner.\n\nSome, like Trump, are chomping at the bit. Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp (R) is allowing businesses including gyms and barber shops to reopen on Friday. Colorado Gov. Jared Polis (D) has said some businesses may reopen on Monday, and retailers can have a limited number of in-store shoppers starting May 1.\n\nOther governors are much more cautious. Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam (D), for example, has issued a stay-at-home order in effect until June 10. California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) declined yesterday to name a date for easing restrictions, saying the state hasn't reached its six goals before reopening the economy.\n\nNewsom, however, did indicate progress has been made with his detailed playbook for reopening the state. After a phone conversation with Trump, the governor said the two had agreed to significantly ramp up testing across California, with hundreds of thousands of new swabs on the way and 86 new testing sites opening.\n\nBut virtually every governor is working on plans, some in coordination with other governors, on how to shape the post-quarantine world.\n\nGeorgia: Certain businesses may open on Friday; theaters and restaurants can reopen on Monday. Bars, nightclubs and music venues will remain closed; schools have been closed through the end of the school year.\n\nKemp explained his decision to reopen tanning salons, barber shops, massage parlors and bowling alleys, saying on Monday: \"I see the terrible impact of covid-19 on public health as well as the pocketbook.\" Kemp said he will urge businesses to take precautions, such as screening for fevers, spacing workstations apart and having workers wear gloves and masks \"if appropriate,\" my Washington Post colleagues William Wan, Carolyn Y. Johnson and Joel Achenbach report.\n\n\"Georgia, according to some models, is one of the last states that should be reopening,\" they write. \"The state has had more than 830 covid-19 deaths. It has tested fewer than 1 percent of its residents -- low compared with other states and the national rate. And the limited amount of testing so far shows a high rate of positives, at 23 percent.\"\n\nTrump blasted Kemp's decision during his briefing last night, saying it violates his administration's phase 1 guidelines for when to reopen.\n\nThe New York Times's Maggie Haberman:\n\nColorado: Polis is allowing the state's stay-at-home order to expire Sunday, after which the state will gradually reopen businesses. Starting May 4, nonessential offices may have 50 percent of their workforce at the site, although large workplaces will be advised to conduct symptom and temperature checks.\n\nPolis has warned the restrictions won't all be lifted at the same time.\n\n\"The virus will be with us,\" he said earlier this month. \"We have to find a sustainable way that will be adapted in real time to how we live with it.\"\n\nSouth Carolina: Gov. Henry McMaster (R) said Monday he was allowing nonessential businesses such as department stores and retailers to open, followed by beaches on Tuesday.\n\nBut businesses must follow three rules for operating: They must limit the number of customers in the store; require patrons to be six feet apart; and follow sanitation guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\n\"I urge everyone to remember we are still in a very serious situation,\" McMaster said at a news conference. \"We know that this disease, this virus, spreads easily, and we know it is deadly. So we must be sure that we continue to be strict and disciplined with our social discipline and taking care not to infect others.\"\n\nTennessee: Gov. Bill Lee (R) said he plans to allow some businesses to reopen once his \"safer-at-home\" order expires in one week. But the state's biggest cities will make their own reopening determinations. Lee has appointed a 30-member economic recovery group to create a plan.\n\nLee, along with Kemp and McMaster, have met with the governors of Mississippi, Alabama and Florida to consider how to reopen their economies in a coordinated way in the country's southeast region. The number of new cases and deaths in Florida has leveled off somewhat -- something the state's governor, Ron DeSantis (R), has been pointing to as he urges a speedy reopening in his state.\n\nThe president took issue with the portrayal of comments from Redfield following an interview with our Post colleague Lena H. Sun. In that interview, Redfield warned that a second wave of the coronavirus could be worse than the current one.\n\n\"There's a possibility that the assault of the virus on our nation next winter will actually be even more difficult than the one we just went through,\" Redfield told Lena. He added: \"We're going to have the flu epidemic and the coronavirus epidemic at the same time.\"\n\nTrump tweeted this the next morning:\n\nThe president again repeated the claim at his daily White House coronavirus task force briefing - this time, with Redfield standing awkwardly next to him.\n\nBut Redfield also sought to \"soften his words as the president glowered next to him,\" Lena, Ashley Parker, Josh Dawsey and Yasmeen Abutaleb write.\n\n\"The remarkable spectacle provided another illustration of the president's tenuous relationship with his own administration's scientific and public health experts, where the unofficial message from the Oval Office is an unmistakable warning: Those who challenge the president's erratic and often inaccurate coronavirus views will be punished -- or made to atone,\" they write.\n\nIt's apparent \"Trump is again bristling at a health official offering too dire a scenario,\" our colleague Aaron Blake writes. He points out that Trump was set off a previous time when another top CDC official warned in February that the spread of the coronavirus was inevitable.\n\nRick Bright, previously the director of the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, said he was dismissed and pushed into a narrower role after he called for strictly vetting supposed treatments like anti-malarials repeatedly embraced publicly by the president.\n\n\"I believe this transfer was in response to my insistence that the government invest the billions of dollars allocated by Congress to address the Covid-19 pandemic into safe and scientifically vetted solutions, and not in drugs, vaccines and other technologies that lack scientific merit,\" Bright said in a statement, according to the New York Times's Michael D. Shear and Maggie Haberman.\n\nHe added: \"I am speaking out because to combat this deadly virus, science -- not politics or cronyism -- has to lead the way.\"\n\nThe Post's White House reporter Josh Dawsey:\n\nThe president was asked about Bright during last night's briefing and whether the official was pushed out.\n\n\"Maybe he was and maybe he wasn't. I don't know who he is,\" Trump responded.\n\nIn late January, days after the first coronavirus case was confirmed in the United States, Azar told Trump in a meeting the coronavirus spread was \"under control,\" the Wall Street Journal's Rebecca Ballhaus and Stephanie Armour report. Azar also told the president more than a million diagnostic tests would be available in weeks and that it was the \"fastest we've ever created a test.\"\n\nThese promises didn't pan out.\n\n\"Six weeks after that Jan. 29 meeting, the federal government declared a national emergency and issued guidelines that effectively closed down the country,\" Rebecca and Stephanie write. \"Mr. Azar, who had been at the center of the decision-making from the outset, was eventually sidelined.\"\n\nThere were numerous factors that slowed the administration's initial coronavirus response, but \"interviews with more than two dozen administration officials and others involved in the government's coronavirus effort show that Mr. Azar waited for weeks to brief the president on the threat, oversold his agency's progress in the early days and didn't coordinate effectively across the health-care divisions under his purview,\" they report.\n\nEarlier this year, Azar tapped an aide to lead HHS's day-to-day coronavirus response who had joined the agency after running a dog-breeding business for six years.\n\nThe aide, Brian Harrison, was derisively called \"the dog breeder\" by some within the White House, Reuters's Aram Roston and Marisa Taylor report.\n\n\"Azar's optimistic public pronouncement and choice of an inexperienced manager are emblematic of his agency's oft-troubled response to the crisis,\" they add. \"... Harrison, 37, was an unusual choice, with no formal education in public health, management, or medicine and with only limited experience in the fields. In 2006, he joined HHS in a one-year stint as a 'Confidential Assistant' to Azar, who was then deputy secretary. He also had posts working for Vice President Dick Cheney, the Department of Defense and a Washington public relations company.\"\n\nPolitico's Dan Diamond summed up the day:\n\nDoctors are learning that covid-19, once believed to be a straightforward respiratory virus, is much more frightening. Since the earlier waves of coronavirus cases, doctors have learned that the disease attacks not just lungs but kidneys, the heart, intestines, liver and the brain. Autopsies also have shown that some coronavirus patients lungs were filled with hundreds of microclots, our Post colleague Ariana Eunjung Cha reports.\n\n\"The problem we are having is that while we understand that there is a clot, we don't yet understand why there is a clot,\" said Lewis Kaplan, a University of Pennsylvania physician and head of the Society of Critical Care Medicine. \"We don't know. And therefore, we are scared.\"\n\n\"In hindsight, there were hints blood problems had been an issue in China and Italy as well, but it was more of a footnote in studies and on information-sharing calls that had focused on the disease's destruction of the lungs,\" Ariana writes.\n\nA study found 88 percent of 320 coronavirus patients on ventilators in New York state's largest health system died.\n\nIt's an uptick from pre-pandemic figures. \"That compares with the roughly 80 percent of patients who died on ventilators before the pandemic, according to previous studies -- and with the roughly 50 percent death rate some critical care doctors had optimistically hoped when the first cases were diagnosed,\" Ariana reports.\n\nThe research, published in the journal JAMA, also notes many of the hospitalized had other conditions.\n\n\"The paper also found that of those who died, 57 percent had hypertension, 41 percent were obese and 34 percent had diabetes, which is consistent with risk factors listed by the Centers for Disease for Control and Prevention,\" she adds. \"Noticeably absent from the top of the list was asthma. As doctors and researchers have learned more about covid-19, the less it seems that asthma plays a dominant role in outcomes.\"\n\nThere's a growing chance of a second economic downturn if there's another surge of the coronavirus or if there's an increase in bankruptcies and defaults, our Post colleague Heather Long reports.\n\nInstead of a V-shaped recovery, economists say, it is increasingly likely that the recovery will be W-shaped, in which there are improvements before another downturn later this year or in the following year. That possibility is \"in part because creating a vaccine is likely to take at least a year and millions of Americans and businesses are piling up debt without an easy ability to repay it,\" Heather writes.\n\n\"It could be triggered by reopening the economy too quickly and seeing a second spike in deaths from covid-19, the disease the coronavirus causes,\" she adds. \"... This could cause many businesses, which were barely hanging on, to close again. Many Americans could become even more afraid to venture out until a vaccine is found.\"\n\n\"Pretending the world will return to normal in three months or six months is just wrong,\" said Diane Swonk, chief economist at Grant Thornton, told The Post. \"The economy went into an ice age overnight. We're in a deep freeze. As the economy thaws, we'll see the damage done as well. Flooding will occur.\"\n\nHere are a few more developments to catch up this morning:",

    "Analysis | The Health 202: The newest way to test for coronavirus: Spitting in a tube": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "Getting tested for coronavirus may soon become as simple as spitting in a tube.\n\nTwo states - Oklahoma and New Jersey - are starting to offer saliva testing to determine whether patients are infected with the novel coronavirus.\n\nThis collection method could ultimately prove safer for medical workers at risk of catching coronavirus by swabbing the noses and throats of infected patients - and help conserve valuable personal protective equipment that's in high demand.\n\nIt may also be simpler and more convenient for patients: People can collect their own sample by simply spitting into a collection vessel, avoiding the more invasive swabbing that some find uncomfortable.\n\nOfficials in Oklahoma -- one of the states allowing some businesses to reopen -- will announce a 30-day plan this week to use saliva testing in 150 long-term care facilities with 17,500 residents. New Jersey officials are also planning to deploy saliva tests in group homes, including state-run facilities for people with developmental disabilities and nursing homes in South Jersey.\n\nThis way of collecting samples has already attracted interest from the White House and officials from New York, Illinois and other states seeking to ramp up testing quickly, said Andrew Brooks, chief operating officer at Rutgers University's RUCDR Infinite Biologics, where the approach was pioneered.\n\n\"You will see a lot of it really soon,\" Brooks told me, adding that he's also gotten inquiries from people in South Korea and China on the subject.\n\nThe swabs needed for nasal and throat testing have been in such short supply that President Trump has used the Defense Production Act to compel an unnamed company to produce them.\n\nCollecting saliva samples, which can then be analyzed using the same equipment used for swab testing, could help reduce the need for more swabs.\n\nRutgers researchers developed a saliva-based test that detects infections of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, using saliva collection devices similar to those used by genetic testing companies such as such as 23andMe and Ancestry.com.\n\nAnd Oklahoma noticed. The state was already working with Oklahoma State University's diagnostic laboratory to expand its testing capacity.\n\nElizabeth Pollard, who spent her career working on genetic testing before becoming Oklahoma's deputy secretary of science and innovation earlier this year, saw Brooks discussing the test on the news and reached out.\n\n\"I chuckled, because Dr. Brooks had been a long-term friend and colleague,\" Pollard told my colleague Juliet Eilperin in a phone interview Friday. \"We didn't need to re-create the wheel.\"\n\nThe OSU lab has now independently validated the test first created at Rutgers and has applied for emergency use authorization from the Food and Drug Administration, so the test can be conducted more broadly. Pollard said she expects the state will get approval soon, telling Juliet it \"will certainly open up our testing options and make it easier to test within nursing homes.\"\n\nBrooks predicted the saliva testing will allow three times as many people to be tested in a day and reduce the need for personal protective equipment by 90 percent.\n\nIn New Jersey, home to Rutgers, saliva testing is already being administered at several screening sites. The expanded testing will first be offered to 1,238 residents and around 4,300 employees at the five state-run developmental centers.\n\nUsing nasal and throat swabs can be particularly difficult with older people and those who are on oxygen or hooked up to other equipment. It's \"not a pleasant way to test,\" Pollard noted.\n\n\"It isn't the best strategy, if we can come up with other options,\" she said.\n\nDaily testing numbers in the United States rose in recent days. The U.S. had been testing around 140,000 each day for the past few weeks, and is now testing in the low 200,000s - an upward trajectory experts say is needed for the country to safely reopen. About 1.7 percent of the country's population has now been tested for the virus.\n\nBeyond the saliva testing, Oklahoma also plans to administer antibody testing for long-term care medical workers, as well as an additional 250 medical workers in Tulsa, Oklahoma City and Ponca City. These cities were chosen due to having a larger number of positive cases when the virus first appeared in Oklahoma, which should allow antibodies to now be present in people's system.\n\nSeveral drug and pharmacy executives joined Trump at a briefing last night, as the president announced a \"blueprint\" for increasing testing capacity. The executives promised a rapid rollout of more testing in the coming weeks (although their previous promises haven't always panned out).\n\n\"Among the companies, Quest Diagnostics plans to increase the number of diagnostic tests it analyzes each day from 50,000 now to 100,000 by the end of May, and has reduced its turnaround time to between 24 and 48 hours,\" Juliet and Mike DeBonis write. \"LabCorp will ramp up from 60,000 diagnostic tests a day and begin offering a take-at-home test to consumers across the country.\"\n\nWalgreens said it expects to have 23 drive-through testing locations across 15 states by the end of the week. And CVS chief executive Larry Merlo said his chain of pharmacies plans to expand coronavirus testing to nearly 1,000 locations by the end of May and process as many as 1.5 million tests a month.\n\n\"Beginning in May, we will install testing capabilities in up to 1000 CVS pharmacies,\" Merlo said at the White House press conference. \"We'll be using our drive-through's and our parking lots with swab testing.\"\n\nWarnings about the virus were included in more than a dozen classified briefings prepared for the president in those months, Greg Miller and Ellen Nakashima report. Still, in that time, Trump downplayed the threat. The briefings are meant to call attention to significant global developments and security threats.\n\nOfficials said the attention to the coronavirus in the briefings is comparable to periods when analysts tracked active terrorism threats or conflicts overseas.\n\n\"For weeks, the PDB -- as the report is known -- traced the virus's spread around the globe, made clear that China was suppressing information about the contagion's transmissibility and lethal toll, and raised the prospect of dire political and economic consequences,\" our colleagues write. \"But the alarms appear to have failed to register with the president, who routinely skips reading the PDB and has at times shown little patience for even the oral summary he takes two or three times per week.\"\n\nAn analysis of federal data found the number of deaths then far exceed the number that were at the time publicly attributed to covid-19, Emma Brown, Andrew Ba Tran, Beth Reinhard and Monica Ulmanu report.\n\nThere were 15,400 excess deaths in March and through April 4. At the time, 8,128 coronavirus deaths were publicly reported.\n\n\"The excess deaths are not necessarily attributable directly to covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus. They could include people who died because of the epidemic but not from the disease, such as those who were afraid to seek medical treatment for unrelated illnesses, as well as some number of deaths that are part of the ordinary variation in the death rate,\" our colleagues report. \"The count is also affected by increases or decreases in other categories of deaths, such as suicides, homicides and motor vehicle accidents.\"\n\nThe analysis of federal data was conducted by the Yale School of Public Health.\n\n\"It's really important to get the right numbers to inform policymakers so they can understand how the epidemic is evolving and how severe it is in different places,\" said Daniel Weinberger, a Yale professor of epidemiology and the leader of the research team.\n\n\"The national tally also shapes the public's perception of how serious the disease is, and therefore how necessary it is to continue social distancing despite economic disruption,\" they add. \"The figure has political implications for President Trump, who initially played down the threat of the virus and whose administration failed to ramp up covid-19 testing quickly, allowing the virus to spread undetected for weeks.\"\n\nThe addition of the symptoms signals that health experts are still learning about the virus and how it affects people. The CDC says these symptoms -- chills, repeated shaking with chills, muscle pain, headache, sore throat or new loss of taste or smell -- could show up two to 14 days after exposure. Previously, the CDC had listed just shortness of breath, cough and fever as known symptoms.\n\n\"The additions confirm what patients and doctors have been reporting anecdotally for weeks,\" Angela Fritz, Michael Brice-Saddler and Maura Judkis report. \"In particular, the loss of taste or smell has been known to appear in patients since at least mid-March when a British group of ear, nose and throat doctors published a statement amid growing concern that it could be an early sign someone is infected but otherwise asymptomatic.\"\n\nKnowing there are additional symptoms could help individuals decide when to request a test. It could also help doctors know when patients need to be tested or be told to self-isolate if it's assumed they have the virus, they add.\n\nThe guidelines include the phased reopening of schools, camps, child-care programs, workplaces, restaurants, houses of worship and mass transportation, Lena H. Sun and Josh Dawsey report.\n\nThe 17-page guidance, based on documents being reviewed by administration officials, has not been officially released but has been received by members of the White House coronavirus task force. There may still be changes, and the guidelines could be released within days.\n\nIt's the \"most detailed guidance to date on the administration's plan to gradually reopen key sectors of society and comes as business groups lobby to lift stay-at-home orders and protesters flock to state capitols to demand their end,\" our colleagues write. The guidelines are already fueling debates within the administration, and between public health experts and other officials.\n\n\"Among the most contentious issues are the guidelines for faith communities and restaurants. While sharing menus, passing the offering plate and crowding members of a choir together raise the risk for transmission, some officials said the guidelines are likely to be controversial,\" they add.\n\nNew research finds many states don't have the testing levels necessary to safely reopen.\n\nTo consider easing restrictions after May 1, more than half of country will need a marked uptick in coronavirus testing, Stat News's Sharon Begley reports, citing an analysis from Stat and researchers at Harvard.\n\nAccording to the review, \"31 states and the District of Columbia were doing too little testing last week to identify most infected people in a timely manner. Ten states would need to increase their daily testing totals by at least 10,000 to do so by May 1. New York, for instance, would have to perform more than 100,000 more tests a day, and New Jersey 68,000 more. Nineteen states -- all but two in the South or the western half of the country -- are already doing enough testing.\"\n\nNumerous states announced dates when certain businesses could reopen.\n\nHard-hit New York is moving toward easing restrictions, too.\n\nNew York Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo (D) said the state, which has the most confirmed cases in the nation, is \"turning the valves on reopening.\" Cuomo said he wants to partially \"unpause\" starting on May 15.\n\n\"Cuomo said officials devising reopening measures should ensure that they meet the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's guidelines, consider how industries and businesses permitted to reopen will physically distance and monitor workers, and evaluate the capacity their local health systems will have during the flu season,\" Anne Gearan and John Wagner write. \"Local officials should also think about their testing, tracing and isolating facilities, Cuomo said.\"\n\nThe high court said the government must subsidize insurance companies for offering lower premiums to at-risk individuals. Funding for this \"risk corridor\" program had fallen far short, and the federal government was arguing it didn't have to make up the difference.\n\nJustice Sonia Sotomayor wrote the 8-to-1 decision reflects \"a principle as old as the nation itself: The government should honor its obligations.\" She added that Congress \"created a rare money-mandating obligation requiring the federal government to make payments.\"\n\nInsurers say they're owed $12 billion, under provisions of the 2010 Affordable Care Act.\n\n\"The case had marked the Supreme Court's fifth look at President Barack Obama's signature domestic success. Unlike others -- and another one the court will hear in the fall -- it did not challenge the law's underpinnings,\" Robert Barnes reports. \"The question instead was whether Congress had encouraged insurance companies into offering the kinds of policies that were instrumental to making the ACA work, and then reneged on a pledge to share the cost.\"\n\nHere are a few more notable stories to catch up on this morning:",

    "Analysis | The Health 202: Twelve lessons the 1918 flu epidemic can teach us about the novel coronavirus": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "For most of the seven years John M. Barry spent writing his book about the 1918 flu pandemic, he wanted to abandon the project. He'd originally wanted to write about the U.S. home front during World War I.\n\n\"Every day I wished I hadn't signed the contract,\" Barry told me over the phone.\n\nThe 546-page book describes how a highly lethal virus killed around 50 million people worldwide between the spring of 1918 and early 1920 -- more casualties than from any other pandemic, ever. This H1N1 virus - which historians believe originated in Kansas, likely passed from a pig to a human - struck near the end of the first World War, first among troops who then passed it to the civilian population.\n\nThe book inspired President George W. Bush to develop a comprehensive pandemic plan, for which the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention called on Barry as a subject-matter expert. In 2005, the National Academies of Sciences named it the year's outstanding book on science or medicine.\n\nHe's optimistic the current pandemic won't be nearly as lethal. The virus isn't becoming more virulent, the government and media are taking it more seriously and a vaccine is in the works, he notes. The key to an effective pandemic response, he says, is for health officials to tell the truth about it. That didn't happen in 1918 -- far from it.\n\n\"There was no Tony Fauci back then,\" Barry said, referring to the director of the Institute for Infectious Diseases at the National Institutes of Health, who has become a prominent leader in the response effort.\n\nYour Health 202 author recently finished reading \"The Great Influenza.\" Here are the 12 things we found most interesting:\n\nHistorians believe someone from Haskell County, Kan., initially carried a mild version of the virus to a huge Army base in March 1918, where it then swept through the world that spring, transmitted largely by troops packed in close quarters in barracks and on ships. But the symptoms were so mild that troops called it \"three-day fever.\"\n\nEven doctors questioned whether the disease was influenza. The symptoms were \"of very short duration and so far absent of relapses or complications,\" three British doctors wrote in the Lancet medical journal in an issue dated July 13,1918.\n\nWhen a more strident form of the virus started arriving in the United States in August after being transported to Europe and back again -- largely via Navy ships -- medical workers noticed dramatic and deadly complications. Victims who had developed pneumonia were so severely deprived of oxygen they turned blue, sometimes a very dark blue.\n\nDirely ill patients would also sometimes bleed from their mouth, nose or even ears. Between 5 and 15 percent of men hospitalized in Army camps bled from the nose, the result when blood flooded deeply diseased lungs.\n\nThroughout fall 1918, this aggressive form of the virus swept through the U.S. and the world in a second wave, ultimately killing 0.65 percent of all Americans and double that percentage of young people. Italy lost 1 percent of its population to the virus, the worst death rate of any developed country. Less developed countries were especially vulnerable; historians estimate Mexico lost between 2.3 percent and 4 percent of its entire population.\n\nAt the time the virus struck, civilian medical care had deteriorated because of the war.\n\nIt was several years into World War I, and the U.S. military had employed many of the best doctors and nurses to care for 4 million enlisted Americans. The doctors who remained civilians tended to be either older -- and therefore unaware of the latest medical advances -- or incompetent younger ones. So when the outbreak spread from military bases, major U.S. cities were woefully ill-equipped to respond.\n\nLike today, ships were hot spots.\n\nTroops returning to the United States from European countries brought back the newly aggressive virus starting in August. Many of them had been in Brest, France -- a port town were death rates soared so high the naval hospital was overwhelmed.\n\nThe first of the U.S. cases was reported in a barracks operated by the Navy in Boston, where as many as 7,000 sailors in transit ate and slept. On Aug. 27, two sailors reported sick. The next day, it was eight sailors. The day after that, 58 men were admitted to the sick bay.\n\nThe first terrible outbreak was in Camp Devons, a military base 35 miles northwest of Boston. The base hospital, designed to hold just 1,200, was filled with more than 6,000 at one point, with men lying in hallways and on porches, where they died. Sailors also spread the virus to New Orleans, Philadelphia and New York.\n\nThe already overcrowded city was fertile ground for an epidemic. So many people died that undertakers were overwhelmed and would drive patrol wagons through the streets so that family members could load the bodies. Sometimes, bodies would lie on beds for days as others in the household were too sick to remove them.\n\nIn the current pandemic, San Francisco's mayor was the first to order a citywide lockdown. It was the same in 1918 -- and it helped the city avoid widespread deaths initially. San Francisco's public health director quarantined all naval installations, organized a citywide effort to prepare and urged people to wear masks.\n\nBut despite these efforts, the city was still struck by the pandemic's third wave, in winter 1919. The flu hit eastern cities far harder, but in the end San Francisco suffered the most deaths of any city on the West Coast.\n\nWilmer Krusen, Philadelphia's public health director, only agreed to monitor the situation a full week after the virus first appeared in the city. Krusen insisted to reporters -- who believed him -- the influenza was only \"old-fashioned influenza or grip.\"\n\nHe allowed a major parade to be held on Sept. 28, where several hundred thousand people were jammed along the route. Within 72 hours, every bed in the city's 31 hospitals was filled. People were trying to bribe nurses $100 to let them in. On the third day after the parade, 117 people died in a single day. Krusen didn't ban public meetings until Oct. 3.\n\nSome public officials even said fear made people more vulnerable to the disease. The Arizona Board of Health told people, \"Don't worry,\" to avoid contracting the flu. Newspapers across the country perpetuated this myth.\n\nThe agency, which took the lead on public health before the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention was created in the 1940s, fell far short in its response. Its leader, Rupert Blue, made early missteps that allowed the virus to take hold and spread throughout the country. Nor did the service offer any treatment or vaccine for the flu.\n\nThe agency did distribute information to the public about how to fight the illness, although it was far too late to do any good. It sent ready-to-print plates to 10,000 newspapers, which said the following: \"Remember the three Cs, clean mouth, clean skin, and clean clothes...Keep the bowels open...Food will win the war...Help by choosing and chewing your food well.\"\n\nWilson was confined to his bed for several days while in Paris in early 1919 to negotiate the end of the war. Some historians believe he was affected neurologically by a bad case of the flu, so much so that he yielded to demands by the French despite previously threatening to return home without a treaty.\n\n\"Influenza did weaken him physically, and -- precisely at the most critical point of negotiations -- influenza did at the least drain from him stamina and the ability to concentrate,\" Barry writes. \"That much is certain. And it is almost certain that influenza affected his mind in other, deeper ways.\"\n\nThe Public Ledger in Philadelphia continually minimized the danger. It claimed Krusen's ban on public gatherings was not \"a public health measure,\" writing, \"There is no cause for panic or alarm.\" As daily deaths numbered in the 200s and 300s in the following days, the paper quoted public health officials as saying the peak of the epidemic had been reached.\n\nThis kind of propagandizing was common in media outlets throughout the country. Newspapers also ran all kinds of ads propagating false information about how to treat or prevent the virus, such as recommendations to keep one's feet dry or instructions on making a gas mask.\n\nIn some areas, including Phoenix, San Francisco and parts of Michigan and Georgia, the third wave killed more people than the second wave. Officials in Savannah, Ga., who had reopened public gathering places, re-closed them on Jan. 15 with even stricter rules than before.\n\nIndia was the hardest-hit of any country.\n\nAt peak, more people in Bombay died every day than during the 1900 bubonic plague. More than 10 percent of known cases resulted in death.\n\nOne doctor in Punjab, the region hit hardest, wrote that hospitals were so \"choked that it was impossible to remove the dead quickly enough to make room for the dying...Nearly every household was lamenting a death and everywhere terror reigned.\"\n\nThe $2.2 trillion legislation will boost the national debt to unprecedented levels, exceeding the size of the economy by the end of fiscal 2020 and soon surpassing the prior record after World War II, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, The Washington Post's Dan Balz writes.\n\nDoes that mean bigger government is here to stay? Conservative Republicans supported the massive spending bills, but the consensus on a more involved government is showing signs of fading. Yet advocates for bigger government may have the upper hand.\n\n\"Conservatives recognize the ground may be shifting in ways advantageous to those on the other side of the debate,\" he writes. \"More spending seems inevitable, particularly for public health and potentially for programs such as paid sick leave or family leave.\"\n\nAnother round of spending is expected. And higher taxes could be necessary down the road to repay the debt Washington is incurring.\n\nFormer Federal Reserve chair Janet L. Yellen said the experience \"could be paradigm shifting.\"\n\nWilliam Galston of the Brookings Institution said the moment could end a cycle that began with the past decade's Great Recession and the tea party revolt in 2009 that triggered forces that helped elect President Trump. \"So the movement that began in opposition to a bailout is ending in an administration that finds itself forced to sponsor -- and in many respects urge on -- the largest expansion of government financial activity in our history,\" Galston said.\n\nWhat happens next?\n\n\"The pandemic has exposed crippling weaknesses in the federal government and troubling vulnerabilities in society that will be more difficult to ignore when the crisis begins to ease. For the first time, many Americans are looking to government for their very economic survival. In time, that could make them look at government differently,\" Balz writes.\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration has allowed more than 90 antibody tests on the market without prior review, our Post colleague Laurie McGinley reports.\n\nThat includes some antibody tests -- meant to identify those who overcame covid-19 and developed an immune response -- that are of uncertain quality and have been marketed fraudulently.\n\nThere's concern that unvetted tests could spark confusion.\n\nIf the tests are inaccurate, for one, they could say that individuals have immunity when they don't.\n\n\"The emergence of dozens of tests never reviewed by the FDA -- many of which are being aggressively marketed -- could confuse doctors, hospitals, employers and consumers clamoring for the products, according to critics who say the agency's oversight of the tests has been lax,\" Laurie writes. \"The questions are taking on special importance as federal and state officials debate strategies, including using serological testing, to help determine when they can end state and local lockdowns.\"\n\nNow, the Food and Drug Administration has stepped up warnings about such tests. FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn said during a Washington Post Live interview that \"people should be very cautious\" about tests that haven't received emergency use authorization from the agency.\n\nThe government \"raised the official toll in Wuhan by 50% to 3,869 deaths,\" the Associated Press's Ken Moritsugu reports. \"While China has yet to update its national totals, the revised numbers push up China's total to 4,632 deaths from a previously reported 3,342.\"\n\nBut the jump in numbers is not necessarily a surprise. \"It is virtually impossible to get an accurate count when health systems are overwhelmed at the height of a crisis -- and they confirm suspicions that many more people died than the official figures had showed,\" Ken writes.\n\nThere have been long-running questions about the accuracy of China's official case count, leading to \"accusations that Chinese officials were seeking to minimize the impact of the outbreak and could have brought it under control sooner.\"\n\nAccording to Wuhan's coronavirus response headquarters gave a few reasons for the undercount, saying it was part a result of mistaken reporting by medical staff, deaths at institutions that weren't linked to the epidemic information network, and deaths that occurred outside hospitals.\n\nMore than a dozen researchers, physicians and public health experts, many from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, were at the U.N. agency's Geneva headquarters as the coronavirus emerged late last year. They sent information about its emergence and spread to administration officials, The Post's Karen DeYoung, Lena H. Sun and Emily Rauhala report.\n\nA spokeswoman for the Department of Health and Human Services, Caitlin B. Oakley, confirmed to The Post that HHS had 17 staff members, including 16 from the CDC, at the WHO \"working on a variety of programs, including covid-19 and Ebola.\"\n\nPresident Trump, which is withholding WHO funds, says the agency failed to communicate the extent of the virus's threat and that such a failure is to blame for the rapid spread in the United States. He has also criticized Chinese leadership for withholding information.\n\nOakley said the presence of CDC staffers didn't mean the agency's leaders were being forthright. \"[J]ust because you have Americans embedded in WHO providing technical assistance does not change the information you are getting from WHO leadership.\"\n\nMaryland Gov. Larry Hogan (R) said Trump's comments defending protesters were unhelpful and nonsensical. Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam (D) suggested Trump is focused on protests because he has not been able to provide more critical tests, our colleagues Luz Lazo, Erin Cox and Hannah Natanson report.\n\nIn an interview on CNN, Hogan said he understood the desire to restart the economy, but said doing so soon would be reckless.\n\n\"I understand the frustration among the people that want to get things open right away. I'm frustrated, too. I wish I had someone to protest to,\" Hogan said. He added: \"I don't think it's helpful to encourage demonstrations and encourage people to go against the president's own policy...It just doesn't make any sense.\"\n\nThere are far-right, pro-gun activists pushing for anti-quarantine demonstrations across the United States. It's the \"latest illustration that some seemingly organic demonstrations are being engineered by a network of conservative activists,\" our Post colleagues Isaac Stanley-Becker and Tony Romm report.\n\nThe social media groups have continued to expand after Trump endorsed such protests in a series of tweets on Friday, suggesting citizens should \"liberate\" states.\n\n\"The Facebook groups target Wisconsin, Ohio, Pennsylvania and New York, and they appear to be the work of Ben Dorr, the political director of a group called 'Minnesota Gun Rights,' and his siblings, Christopher and Aaron,\" they write. \"...The online activity helps cement the impression that opposition to the restrictions is more widespread than polling suggests. Nearly 70 percent of Republicans said they supported a national stay-at-home order, according to a recent Quinnipiac poll. Ninety-five percent of Democrats backed such a measure in the survey.\"\n\nThe $400 billion-plus deal would bolster funding for a small-business loan program that dried up because of high demand, our Post colleagues Erica Werner and Jeff Stein report. It would also include about $100 billion in additional funding for hospitals and coronavirus testing.\n\nAt his daily coronavirus task force briefing last night, Trump said they are \"getting close to a deal.\" \"We have some very good negotiations going on right now, and I think you could have a nice answer tomorrow,\" he said.\n\n\"The deal would add about $300 billion to the Paycheck Protection Program for small businesses that was swamped by demand in the three weeks since Congress created it as part of a $2 trillion coronavirus rescue bill,\" Erica and Jeff report.\n\n\"It also would add $60 billion to a separate emergency loan program for small businesses that also is out of money, Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) said on CNN. The agreement would include $75 billion for hospitals and $25 billion for testing, which have been major Democratic demands. Some of the money in the small-business program would be directed specifically to rural and minority businesses, said people familiar with the plan who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe it.\"\n\nHere are other headlines and developments to catch up on this morning.",

    "Analysis | The Technology 202: Businesses are snapping up thermal cameras to detect coronavirus, but they have limits": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "The coronavirus pandemic is spurring a buying spree for thermal-imaging cameras that could detect people's fevers.\n\nManufacturers of the cameras say they're rushing to meet demand, as businesses try to keep essential workers safe from infected customers --and plan for when the economy starts to reopen. Their cameras, they say, can conduct temperature screenings more quickly and efficiently than traditional thermometers - all from a safe social distance.\n\n\"I never would have thought six months ago we would be looking to screen workplaces,\" said Jim Cannon, chief executive of FLIR Systems, a thermal imaging company. \"No one anticipated the impact this virus has had on our world.\" He's drawing major clients in the travel and hospitality industries: Emirates Airline and Wynn Resorts in Las Vegas said they purchased cameras from FLIR.\n\nGary Strahan, the owner of Infrared Cameras Inc., says his customers include essential businesses where workers are still coming in, such as FedEx. But he also says his client list is expanding to include major tech companies such as Facebook, along with retailers and financial services. (Facebook and FedEx declined to confirm this, though the shipper said it was using \"no-touch\" technology to screen its workers.)\n\nAmazon is reportedly using thermal cameras in its warehouses, as the company faces pressure to do more to protect workers as coronavirus cases are reported in its facilities. (Amazon's chief executive, Jeff Bezos, also owns The Post.)\n\nEspecially without public health officials presenting enough evidence that they would actually be effective in combating the virus's spread.\n\n\"Everybody's worried that freedoms that we are giving up to fight this disease might be hard to get back,\" said Jay Stanley, a senior policy analyst at the ACLU Speech, Privacy, and Technology Project. \"It's just an early indicator of how powerful the technology that's coming out is going to be. Right now, we need to be careful about what kind of precedent we set.\"\n\nSuch cameras have been deployed at borders and airports in Asia since the SARS epidemic -- and public health authorities have previously warned that temperature screenings are no silver bullet.\n\nThe World Health Organization says on its website that \"temperature screening alone may not be very effective as it may miss travelers incubating the disease or travelers concealing fever during travel, or it may yield false positive (fever of a different cause).\"\n\nAnd an elevated body temperature doesn't mean someone is positive for the coronavirus. Environmental conditions or a medical condition other than coronavirus could elevate someone's skin temperature and trigger the systems.\n\nA normal temperature reading also doesn't rule out that someone is a carrier. Some experts warn the systems could give employees and customers a false sense of security. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Robert R. Redfield said in a recent NPR interview that as many as 25 percent of people who are infected may not show symptoms. And those who ultimately do show symptoms, he added, might actually transmit the virus for two days before symptoms appear.\n\n\"We're really keen to make sure that people understand what technology can do and can't do and then employ it in the right manner with all their protocols to compensate for this technology's shortcomings,\" Cannon said. \"We're very careful to qualify that this is simply a screening tool, it's not a diagnosis. And no one technology certainly is foolproof.\"\n\nFLIR's thermal imaging cameras have been widely deployed in airports and borders for more than a decade, in countries including South Korea, Japan and China. But in the United States, Cannon says most of the demand is coming from private businesses, which may not be used to doing this kind of screening when a person enters. So the FLIR sales team is working with the companies to provide guidance on appropriate procedures and protocol, he said.\n\n\"This is new territory for us,\" Cannon said.\n\nThere's also concerns there will be a rush of unproven systems in the market as demand surges. Both FLIR and Infrared Cameras International say their systems have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration. But NBC News's April Glaser reports that many companies are touting products without such approval, including Athena Security, Feevr and Remark Holdings.\n\nMatthew Guariglia, a policy analyst at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, is concerned that cameras constantly monitoring workers of any kind could create a new network of surveillance cameras.\n\n\"These cameras are specifically put into place for the purpose of monitoring the faces and bodies of your employees,\" he told me.\n\nBut Cannon argues that the systems are less invasive than existing security camera systems, because they're displaying the emission of heat from a person rather than a detailed image.\n\nNOTE TO READERS: We've debuted a redesign of the Technology 202 this week, aimed at making this tipsheet cleaner, sharper, and easier to read.

UberEats rushed into alcohol delivery during the coronavirus pandemic as states eased laws to allow restaurants to continue selling the beverages.\n\nThat leaves drivers liable for selling minors alcohol, perhaps unknowingly, because Uber's app doesn't tell them if an order contains alcohol: \"It's not worth the risk for $4,\" one person who has worked as a courier for Uber Eats told Faiz.\n\nHalf a dozen drinks ordered by The Post from UberEats did not meet even relaxed state guidelines, Faiz reports. The California Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control said it was opening an investigation after The Post contacted the agency with its findings. Uber Eats spokeswoman Meghan Casserly said that the company removed alcohol listings from the restaurants flagged by The Post.\n\n\"While laws and regulations are shifting rapidly during this pandemic, it's important to note that Uber Eats does not currently allow alcohol sales in California, so we take these types of reports very seriously,\" Casserly said.\n\n\"In the U.S., the need for this conversation in the midst of a pandemic underscores the urgency for a strong federal privacy law,\" write Julie Brill, chief privacy officer, and Peter Lee, corporate vice president for research and regulation.\n\n\"An updated legal framework placing obligations on businesses that collect and use personal data would help provide the necessary guardrails for companies to know how to protect and respect personal data as they create tools and technologies to address urgent societal needs.\"\n\nThe Washington state tech giant is weighing in on a growing debate between privacy and public safety as it is providing AI to researchers, developing a self-checking tool and protecting hospitals from ransomware. The executives also released privacy principles to which they urge governments to adhere when using technology in their responses, including:\n\nThe company's interactive tool makes calculations based on more than two dozen metrics, including recorded Occupational Safety and Health Administration complaints and calls to human resources, Hayley Peterson at Business Insider reports. It also evaluates external metrics, such as the local unemployment rate.\n\nWhole Foods's approach is just \"the next frontier\" in employee surveillance, Celine McNicholas, the director of government affairs and labor counsel for the Economic Policy Institute, told Hayley. \"Employers spend millions of dollars a year to hire union avoidance advisers to see how susceptible they are to their workers organizing,\" said McNicholas.\n\nWhole Foods said the map is used to make sure the \"highest need\" stores get additional resources. But the company wouldn't clarify what that means. \"Whole Foods Market recognizes the rights of our Team Members to decide whether union representation is right for them,\" the company said in a statement.\n\nDonald Trump Jr. sounded off about Facebook's recent decision to remove some anti-quarantine events after state governments said the events violated local stay-at-home orders.\n\nOther conservatives, including Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.), also blasted the company's move:\n\nBut as my colleague Tony Romm points out, Facebook has left up protests in states where governors haven't raised concerns:\n\nUber plans to launch Connect in more than 25 cities around the world.\n\nUber also got permission to bid on government contracts. It could open the door for over $800 million in new revenue for the company by 2025, Lizette Chapman at Bloomberg News reports.\n\nThe scramble to diversify revenue comes less than a month before the company's investors meet. And activists are already gearing up:\n\nFrance wants Apple to remove a feature in its phones that limits the type of Bluetooth tracking the government wants to use for coronavirus response, Helene Fouquet at Bloomberg News reports.\n\nThe government wants to deploy the new app in less than a month, before it lifts restrictions on movement placed in March.\n\nAn Apple spokesman declined to comment beyond referring to a previous joint statement about its partnership with Google on a Bluetooth contact-tracing app.\n\nThe protest is organized by labor groups United for Respect, New York Communities for Change and Make the Road New York, Chris Rodrigo Mills at the Hill reports. The protest follows strikes at warehouses in Staten Island, Chicago and Detroit.\n\nCorporate employees are planning a sickout to protest warehouse conditions for Friday.\n\nThe crowdfunding company has already seen a significant drop in crowdfunding projects being listed on the site, CEO Aziz Hasan wrote in an internal memo, Ashley Carman at the Verge reports.

    "Analysis | We've Lost Time in the Race for a Covid-19 Cure": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "Yet in spite of much hype around several existing drugs, we still haven't found a proven, evidence-based treatment for Covid-19. The stakes are clearly high, with a vaccine at least a year away, if at all, and countries around the world facing a potential second wave of infections as they start to lift draconian lockdown measures. A conclusive finding that one of the already-available medicines can reduce the viral load or severity of symptoms in infected patients would be a \"game-changer,\" as French state medical advisor Jean-Francois Delfraissy said on local radio on Monday.For now, we're still waiting for convincing evidence of whether potentially promising drugs actually work. A European trial of four treatments, dubbed \"Discovery,\" began in March; it was due to give early results in the first week of April. That date was pushed back to the end of April, meaning sometime this week, after a slow start getting off the ground. In that time, tens of thousands of people have died.It's tempting to imagine the blame for lost time lies with bureaucratic red tape and squabbling scientists, preferring idle box-ticking to daring experiments with drugs on the pandemic's front lines. That's the narrative favored by supporters of Didier Raoult, the flamboyant French doctor who first flagged anti-malaria drug chloroquine as a promising treatment in February. While the scientific establishment waits for conclusive trial results, self-declared \"maverick\" Raoult has been using hydroxychloroquine (a less toxic derivative of chloroquine) on patients. U.S. President Donald Trump's endorsement of the drug, and his pressure on regulators to fast track it, have made it a household name.But if anything, it's the mavericks, not the bureaucrats, that have slowed things down.\n\nRecent trials of hydroxychloroquine, for example, have been criticized for cutting a lot of corners without showing clinically significant effects. Raoult's test in Marseilles used a small sample size of 42 patients, their enrollment wasn't randomized and one patient who died was excluded from the results. Subsequent trials elsewhere were also found to be of limited quality: A review by Birmingham University's Robin Ferner and Oxford University's Jeffrey Aronson found that most hadn't been blinded, meaning those involved knew which treatment was being administered to whom. Other drawbacks included inconsistent treatment procedures, such as the addition of the antibiotic azithromycin, which when combined with hydroxychloroquine can cause dangerous heart problems. Of the 142 hydroxychloroquine trials registered as of April 14, only about 35% were designed to be blinded, the review found.Sacrificing speed for standards hasn't just resulted in a lack of evidence; it has hampered and delayed follow-up studies. When the \"Discovery\" mega-study began enrolling patients in March, it immediately hit a big hurdle -- patients swayed by headlines only wanted to be treated with hydroxychloroquine. In the U.S., one patient who was offered the chance to trial Gilead Sciences Inc.'s remdesivir asked for \"Trump's drug\" instead. The hype around potential treatments has also spurred countries to hoard drugs, hurting their availability.Doctors are understandably in an ethical bind in this pandemic; the urge to \"try everything\" is strong when patients and their families are visibly suffering. Yet speed has to be balanced against other trade-offs like patient safety, too. And the grim truth is that a double-blind, randomized trial of several drugs could have been conducted by now. This week, the Paris region's hospital association announced that a randomized 129-patient trial of tocilizumab (marketed by Roche Holding AG as Actemra) launched just a month ago has already shown \"significant\" improvement for Covid-19 sufferers -- though the results aren't yet peer-reviewed.There are other ways to accelerate research in a pandemic. One option is the use of adaptive platform trials, in which several treatments are monitored at the same time so that resources can be shifted toward those that are the most effective, as my colleague Max Nisen has written. Artificial intelligence can also help: The University of Pittsburgh is using machine learning to power its own adaptive trial of potential Covid-19 treatments across 40 hospitals. Even before testing, researchers are being called upon to use computational methods to screen existing treatments quickly, as in one initiative by a European moon-shot foundation called JEDI.And if there is conclusive evidence that a cheap generic drug like hydroxychloroquine works, then the pharmaceutical supply chain may find new ways to meet a rise in demand. French firm Rondol Industrie is testing the ability of drug-blending machines to make more efficient doses of hydroxychloroquine that would improve absorption into the human body. The benefits of a lower dose for the same treatment result could include fewer side effects and lower production costs. It would also make it possible to treat more patients with the same quantity of active pharmaceutical ingredient.Without that evidence, though, we will only be wasting time. Clinical trials are logistically and financially costly, but they're invaluable. A new pledge by world leaders such as France's Emmanuel Macron and Germany's Angela Merkel to raise $8 billion for the development and accessibility of possible treatments for Covid-19 will help. This is a race without an obvious shortcut.",

        "authors": [],
        "body": "The outbreak became evident after a sailor aboard the vessel developed symptoms associated with the virus, and the Navy flew the individual to San Antonio for testing. After the sailor tested positive, the Navy dispatched a medical team to the Kidd to conduct more testing and other cases emerged, said chief Pentagon spokesman Jonathan Hoffman.\n\n\"They are preparing to return to port, where they will undertake efforts to clean the ship,\" Hoffman told reporters on Friday. \"They will remove a portion of the crew from the ship and work to get everybody back to health and get the ship back to sea.\"\n\nThe destroyer, which typically deploys with a crew and aviation detachment of more than 160 people, had been deployed this month in the Pacific Ocean as part of a military task force that carries out drug interdiction, according to the ship's Facebook page. Its home port is in San Diego.\n\n\"Testing continues, and we expect additional cases,\" the Navy said in a statement. \"All measures are being taken to evaluate the extent of the COVID-19 transmission on the ship.\"\n\nThe disclosure came as the Navy prepares to announce the findings of an investigation into a much larger outbreak in the Pacific aboard the USS Theodore Roosevelt, an aircraft carrier that has been crippled in Guam for weeks as testing and quarantining occurs.\n\nSign up for our Coronavirus Updates newsletter to track the outbreak. All stories linked in the newsletter are free to access.\n\nHoffman said he expects the chief of naval operations, Adm. Michael Gilday, to brief Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper on Friday about the Navy's findings. The ship has been under a microscope for weeks, after hundreds of cases emerged and the ship's commanding officer, Navy Capt. Brett Crozier, sent a memo to three Navy admirals raising an alarm about the pace of the service's response.\n\nThat memo leaked in the media late last month, prompting acting Navy secretary Thomas Modly to remove Crozier from command. Gilday is expected to decide whether Crozier gets his old job back, is assigned to another role that allows him to continue his career, or is effectively forced to retire.\n\nCrozier, as captain of the Theodore Roosevelt, was on a fast track to becoming an admiral as commanding officer of one of the Navy's most powerful strategic weapons when he sent an email with the memo attached.\n\n\"I fully realize that I bear responsibility for not demanding more decisive action the moment we pulled in, but at this point my only priority is the continued well-being of the crew and embarked staff,\" Crozier wrote in the email, later obtained by The Washington Post. \"I believe if there is ever a time to ask for help it is now regardless of the impact on my career.\"\n\nThe memo was first reported by the San Francisco Chronicle. It detailed concerns that stopping the spread of the virus on the ship would be tough to do without evacuating all but a few hundred of the Theodore Roosevelt's 4,800 sailors, with others coming to shore for testing and quarantining.\n\n\"We are not at war. Sailors do not need to die,\" the captain wrote in the March 30 memo. \"If we do not act now, we are failing to properly take care of our most trusted asset -- our Sailors.\"\n\nHow an outbreak on the USS Theodore Roosevelt became a defining moment for the U.S. military\n\nModly resigned on April 7, one day after flying from Washington to Guam to visit the crew and delivering a speech in which he insulted Crozier and lectured sailors for supporting him. Crozier, Modly said, had either written the memo to be leaked to the media, or was \"too naive or too stupid\" to be commanding officer of the ship.\n\nModly apologized.\n\nAs of Thursday, 850 of 4,938 sailors from the Theodore Roosevelt -- about 17 percent -- had tested positive for the virus, the Navy said. Four sailors were still hospitalized at Naval Base Guam.\n\nOne Theodore Roosevelt sailor, Chief Petty Officer Charles Robert Thacker Jr., 41, died on April 13 after testing positive for the coronavirus on March 30.",

    "As it works to expand coronavirus testing, Virginia heads to poor neighborhoods": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "\"Oh, damn!\" she said, wiping her nose after undergoing a free coronavirus test in an east Richmond parking lot. \"Whoo!\"\n\nThough she hated how it felt, Smith, 47, had been seeking the nasal swab since she and her husband started having fevers, coughs, sweats and headaches about a week ago. Smith works at an assisted-living facility, where a co-worker caught the novel coronavirus. She and Charles, a self-employed barber, are uninsured, and the cost of tests at a private clinic was too steep.\n\n\"Patient First was talking, like, $90,\" said Smith, who worries that if she and Charles have the virus, their five children could be next. One has been running a fever.\n\nThe Smiths got their tests Tuesday at Eastlawn Shopping Center, a forlorn plaza anchored by a shuttered Food Circus. Next door sits Creighton Court, a troubled public housing complex that the city would like to demolish.\n\nBut on this day, with dozens of medical personnel and volunteers decked out in masks, face shields and bright gowns, the site offered a possible way out of the pandemic -- for a city where 13 out of 14 coronavirus fatalities have been African Americans, and for a state where testing has lagged most of the nation.\n\n\"In order for us to eventually start easing the [business and social] restrictions, we've got to be able to test,\" Gov. Ralph Northam (D) said at the testing site.\n\nSign up for our Coronavirus Updates newsletter to track the outbreak. All stories linked in the newsletter are free to access.\n\n\"It is very important to let all Virginians -- whatever neighborhood they come from, or whatever walk of life -- know that we're here for them,\" Northam continued. \"We want to take care of them.\"\n\nVirginia ranks near the bottom of U.S. states and territories in the number of coronavirus tests administered per capita: 82,753 tests as of Tuesday, or about 9,700 tests per 1 million residents.\n\nThat's on a par with Guam, Texas, Kansas and Arizona, according to the Covid Tracking Project. Neighboring Maryland, by contrast, has conducted nearly 18,000 tests per million residents, according to the tracking project and Census Bureau data. New York, with the nation's worst outbreak, has conducted more than 41,000 tests per million residents.\n\nVirginia officials have said a number of factors contribute to the low rate of testing, which they are striving to improve. Initial shortages of testing supplies nationwide led to strict guidelines for who could be tested -- people showing symptoms, over age 65, in a group home or in a vulnerable line of work, such as first responders.\n\nIn addition, Virginia has vast rural regions with sparse populations where covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, has been slow to spread.\n\nReopening the DMV: We know the road map, but we're far from meeting the benchmarks\n\nLast week, Northam appointed a task force to expand testing and announced a goal of reaching 10,000 tests per day, up from the 2,600 tests per day that Virginia has been averaging.\n\nNortham said the numbers are already up to 4,000 a day, and he hopes to ramp up to 10,000 a day in the coming weeks.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Todd Gilbert (R-Shenandoah) seized on the issue Tuesday, demanding in a written statement that the Democratic governor explain the lag in testing.\n\n\"At first Governor Northam blamed the Trump administration for not getting Virginia the resources needed to conduct tests. Then we learned that Virginia has testing capacity sitting idle,\" Gilbert said.\n\n\"The Governor then said we lacked the swabs and other testing materials. Yet other states have managed to obtain these resources. Something is fundamentally different -- and possibly wrong -- with the way Virginia's testing is being handled. Virginians deserve answers, and they deserve them now.\"\n\nDespite the testing lags, Virginia's per capita covid-19 deaths have been far lower than in Maryland.\n\nThe commonwealth, with a population of 8.6 million, had reported 498 deaths as of Tuesday -- fewer than half the 1,023 fatalities suffered in Maryland, population 6 million.\n\nHere's our tracker of coronavirus cases in the District, Virginia and Maryland\n\n\"I think the governor's been doing a very good job,\" House Speaker Eileen Filler-Corn (D-Fairfax) said. \"It's important that a leader, a governor, in the midst of a crisis, is somebody who's thoughtful, sincere, whose response is based on data, facts and science, and somebody who's very communicative. And I think he's doing exactly all that.\"\n\nThe free testing program in Richmond -- conducted in two neighborhoods last week and planned for three more by the end of this one -- is too limited to help Virginia catch up on its own. A maximum of 100 people could get tested Tuesday.\n\nBut the program could be a first step toward overcoming the financial hurdles and fear that have hindered testing among the hardest hit population -- low-income African Americans.\n\nLawrence Washington traveled from Richmond's north side for the test Tuesday, despite a warning from his boss that the service could be a \"Tuskegee\"-type trap, referring to a notorious and deceptive federal syphilis study on black men in the 20th century.\n\n\"My boss, she was talking about, 'Aargh! I ain't going to get tested. I remember when they did the Tuskegee experiment. They was shooting people up with syphilis,'\u2009\" Washington, a 47-year-old construction worker, said moments after his test. \"I said, 'Well, they ain't doing nothing but putting a cotton swab up the nose.'\u2009\"\n\nWashington live-streamed his test, urging friends and family watching to follow his lead. He lives with relatives who have asthma, heart disease and high blood pressure -- all risk factors for covid-19 complications.\n\n\"This is the makeup of our household ... which is true of every African American household,\" he said.\n\nRichmond Mayor Levar Stoney (D) urged residents not to be deterred by \"myths\" about testing, stressing that the procedure does not involve \"an injection.\"\n\n\"Please show up. Please show up. We're begging you to,\" he said. \"It's the only way that we get a handle on where the coronavirus is throughout our community.\"\n\nConducted by nurses with help from Virginia Medical Reserve Corps volunteers, the testing was offered to people who lack private health insurance and either have symptoms of the virus, have been exposed to it or have underlying health conditions such as high blood pressure or obesity that could make the virus more lethal.\n\nIn a low-income Richmond neighborhood where testing was launched last week, 17 percent of residents who showed up turned out to be positive, said Richmond Health Director Danny Avula. At another, two out of 22 had the virus.\n\n\"It's like shadow boxing,\" Stoney said. \"We know that the enemy is in the room. We just don't know where the enemy is.\"\n\nSylvia Seaborne, 61, arrived at the testing site with a fever, a cough and a headache. She wondered whether she could have been infected by an aunt, an assisted-living resident who has tested positive. The retired special-education teacher had felt ill for two weeks but could not get a doctor's office to test her.\n\n\"I try to push on, to keep going,\" she said.\n\nWayne Thorpe, 70, a retired firefighter with a nagging cough, also showed up -- concerned about his health and that of the brother he lives with, who is on dialysis.\n\n\"At least I would know for sure,\" he said. \"And that's the main thing, so there won't be no guessing.\"\n\nWhy covid-19 is ravaging one of the nation's wealthiest black counties",

    "Avoiding the loneliness of a coronavirus hospital death": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "Emanuela Marchese mourns over the coffin of her father, Carmelo. Suspecting he had contracted the coronavirus, Emanuela and her family decided Carmelo should avoid a lonely hospital death and remain at his home in northern Italy. (Gianluca Panella/SestiniReportage)\n\nWhen it came time for the conversation about whether Carmelo Marchese should go to the hospital, his daughter didn't tell him about her fears -- that he'd be taken away in an ambulance and never see his family again. She didn't mention the images on the news, of black body bags piling up outside hospitals, nor the images in her mind, of her father in one of those bags.\n\nShe just told him what she thought was most necessary. That northern Italy's hospitals were overloaded. That a 93-year-old, weakened already with fever, wouldn't be prioritized. That his odds might be no worse at home.\n\n\"You would end up in who-knows-what tiny hospital room,\" Emanuela Marchese, 59, remembers telling him.\n\nShe looks back on that conversation as the closest thing to a decisive moment about how Carmelo Marchese would die -- in his bedroom, next to an oxygen canister, his crying daughter and grandson steps away.\n\nDuring the coronavirus pandemic, the world has officially recorded more than 130,000 deaths, many of them happening in intensive care wards sealed off to family members in one of the most chilling aspects of the virus. But an uncounted legion has died in a far different way: never making it to hospitals, or even trying to avoid them.\n\nSome of those deaths are less lonely.\n\nYet in place of regretting goodbyes they weren't able to share, family members may be left with the anguish of wondering whether they made the right choice.\n\n\"If I think of my dad right now, I honestly can imagine him a bit angry at me,\" Emanuela said three weeks later, as she and her children cleared out her father's apartment. \"Everyone is telling me that I shouldn't be feeling guilty, but inside of me I have a vision of papa. 'You didn't take me to the hospital. Why?' I have this emotional inner worry that hasn't been lifted.\"\n\nCarmelo Marchese had been a fairly healthy 93-year-old. He had bad knees, bad hearing, but he lived on his own in the city of Brescia, less than a mile down the road from his only daughter. He cooked. He gardened. He used Facebook and WhatsApp.\n\nAs a 13-year-old, he survived a World War II attack. He carried out anti-smuggling missions as a postwar Navy sailor and later worked as a bureaucrat in Brescia's city hall. Into his 80s and 90s, especially after he became a widower, he became chattier, needier of social interaction. If he went more than two days without seeing Emanuela, he'd text: \"Well, can you at least send a photo?\"\n\nSo when he developed a fever on March 21, her first thought was to be with him as much as she could. She said she was moving into his guest room. He protested only a bit.\n\nEmanuela wasn't sure her father had the coronavirus. But he exhibited symptoms and could have contracted it at the nursing home where he received treatment for his balky knees. The family doctor told her to behave as if Carmelo had it.\n\nSo she brought gloves and masks to his house, and wore them whenever she entered his room. She sanitized the bathroom and kitchen relentlessly. She bought an oxygen canister at the pharmacy and followed the doctor's advice to use antibiotics and a medicine to treat fever. But they didn't curb his sickness.\n\nWithin a few days, his fever had spiked above 103 degrees.\n\n\"Look, Dad, it's not like last year,\" Emanuela said. A year earlier, he'd contracted bacterial pneumonia. They'd taken him immediately to a hospital, where doctors and nurses were able to devote plenty of attention to him. He'd recovered fully.\n\nBut in March, the hospitals of northern Italy were at their breaking point. Doctors told of having to reserve ventilators for younger patients with the best chance of survival, while older patients were left to die alone.\n\n\"You do not realize what is out there in hospitals now,\" Emanuela tried to emphasize.\n\nHer father said he understood, but then brought it up again, mentioning how well he'd been cared for a year ago.\n\nAs Emanuela thought about what to do, as she talked with her three children, what she felt most of all was anger. Anger that the family had to even make a choice like this. Anger that the hospitals couldn't care for everybody who required it. Anger that the rituals of dealing with the sick had been so overturned by what Emanuela called \"this blasted virus.\"\n\nHer father mostly stayed in bed. He got up to change his dentures, use the bathroom and have breakfast. He weakened by the day. His hands started trembling. When he struggled to eat, Emanuela spoon-fed him, and though her father didn't say anything about it, she thought she saw some mix of shame and gratitude in his eyes. She wondered: At the hospital, who would have cared for him?\n\nHer eldest daughter, a nurse, came by twice a day to inject antibiotics. Otherwise, Emanuela was alone with her father, checking on him, talking to him if he had the energy. During the days, she sometimes wept quietly, talking out loud to photographs of her deceased mother. A night, she stayed in the guest room, not sleeping much, listening to her father inhale and exhale. By the sixth day of fever, his breathing had become more labored.\n\n\"Like he was running stairs and gasping,\" Emanuela said.\n\nShe called her son, Stefano, to come help. He, too, followed all the precautions he could, putting on a mask and gloves. He was the one who noticed the hallway light flick on around 2 a.m. on March 28. It was his grandfather, in the bathroom.\n\nHe'd gotten there somehow, but it had cost him all his strength.\n\nWalking back down the hallway with Stefano and Emanuela's help, his body gave out, like he'd fainted. They rushed him back to his bed, frightened about what to do. They shook him hard enough to revive him. They propped up his feet. They gave him some sugar water. Maybe the worst for the night was over, they thought.\n\nBut then Carmelo had a request: Could he return to the bathroom? He still needed to go.\n\n\"I didn't want him to soil himself,\" Stefano later wrote in a four-page personal remembrance of his grandfather's last hour.\n\nSo, Stefano helped him to the bathroom again. This time, the walk down the hallway was even harder. This time, while Stefano was holding him, Carmelo's knees buckled. Stefano couldn't catch his grandfather before he fell to the floor. Stefano and Emanuela hauled him up, acting as quickly as they could, and got him back on his bed. But he said nothing. His eyes were rolling back.\n\nStefano, crying, called emergency operators and his sister Elisa, the nurse, to come quickly as they could. Then he tried performing CPR.\n\nEmanuela wailed again and again, \"Papa.\"\n\nWhen the medics arrived 15 minutes later, wearing face guards and blue protective suits, they put Carmelo's body on the hard wooden bedroom floor and tried for several minutes to revive him. One of the medics leaned over him, pressing with dire force on his chest, and it was enough to make his upper body swell and deflate. But he was not breathing. When the medic stopped, Carmelo stopped moving as well.\n\nThree weeks later, the home of Carmelo Marchese was half-empty. His daughter and two of his grandchildren were inside, all wearing masks. Day by day, they had cleaned off and boxed up the dishware, the clothing, the old photo slides, the operas on cassette, the VHS movies. A few pictures were still on the walls. Whenever Italy's lockdown ended, somebody might be able to haul away the boxes.\n\nCarmelo's body was sent to a cemetery in Brescia, awaiting transport -- eventually -- to the southern city of Gallipoli, the place where he'd been born. Whenever that happened, he'd be buried next to his wife. The family imagined a ceremony where everybody would gather, where there'd be a Mass, a recitation of a Navy poem, where Stefano would say a prayer. But when might that happen? Months from now? Years?\n\n\"Once this plague is over,\" Emanuela said.\n\nShe wondered if, by then, they'd be any better at making sense of his death, or even know if he'd died because of the virus. She wondered if, by then, she'd still imagine her father angry at her.\n\nThe younger of her two daughters, Viviana, 29, said keeping Carmelo at home had been the right thing for a 93-year-old, the only way to give him a \"last caress.\"\n\nStefano, 28, said he was replaying his own decisions -- about the CPR he'd tried and whether he should have done something differently.\n\nEmanuela said that was how the human brain worked: concocting things, replaying things, even after it was too late.\n\nShe thought what she'd done was rational. She'd been there for him. She'd made his last days as comfortable as she could. Nobody else in her family had gotten sick in their time with him.\n\n\"But then I think of my father in the beyond,\" she said. \"It's an unjustified guilt. I don't know if it will go away.\"",

    "Boris Johnson says Britain 'past the peak' of the epidemic": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "LONDON -- Making his first appearance at a news conference in over a month, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said Thursday that Britain is \"past the peak\" and \"on the downward slope\" of the first phase of the pandemic. He also promised that next week, his government will begin to describe how the country might slowly loosen its strict lockdown.\n\nJohnson said the coming guidelines for restarting the economy, reopening schools and providing for safe travel and workplaces will not contain specific target dates. Those will be determined by how quickly the number of new infections, hospital admissions and deaths continue to drop.\n\nThe prime minister said the use of face masks might be part of the new strategy, though in the past his scientific advisers had questioned their effectiveness.\n\nJohnson stressed that the country must not \"risk a second spike\" of the virus. \"Nothing we do should lift the R -- or reproduction rate -- back above one,\" he said, introducing a short video that explained the concept.\n\nScientists believe the novel coronavirus, without any countermeasures, allows one person to infect on average another three, giving it a value of R equals 3. After six weeks of lockdown, the R number in Britain today is between 0.6 and 0.9, Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty said at the news conference.\n\nBoris Johnson is back after recovering from covid-19\n\nAsked if his own hospitalization has changed his approach to tackling the crisis, Johnson said, \"I was very, very lucky. I had wonderful carers, I had wonderful treatment, and let's be frank: tragically, thousands of people have been less fortunate than I was. And that's why the objective of this government is to save lives across the country.\"\n\nHe said that objective was there at the beginning of that crisis and remains \"unchanged.\"\n\nSign up for our Coronavirus Updates newsletter to track the outbreak. All stories linked in the newsletter are free to access.\n\nAfter weeks of sickness and recovery -- and after the birth of his son by his fiancee, Carrie Symonds, on Wednesday -- the 55-year-old Johnson looked vigorous enough at the lectern, but sounded a little breathy, and he lost his way once in a long mixed metaphor about peaks, tunnels, lights and pastures.\n\nJohnson has been absent during almost all the 26,771 deaths he reported Thursday.\n\nOn Wednesday, the government began to include in its daily figures those who have died of covid-19 outside hospital settings, including those in nursing homes, hospices and the community.\n\nThe revised numbers mean that Britain's fatalities of the virus are now the third highest in the world, following those of the United States and Italy. If Britain continues on its trajectory, it will soon have the highest death toll in Europe.\n\nAsked about the soaring toll in Britain, Johnson said comparing international data is \"bedeviled with difficulties.\" He said, \"The only real comparison is going to be possible at the end of the epidemic, when you look at total excess deaths.\"\n\nJohnson added, \"Broadly speaking, we did the right thing at the right time.\" Critics have said the government lost valuable time in January while distracted about Brexit and was slow to order a lockdown.\n\nBoris Johnson and his ministers accused of bungling coronavirus response, unleashing disaster\n\nWhitty, the chief medical officer, said the world is \"nowhere near the end of this epidemic\" and urged, \"Let's not go charging in to who's won and who's lost.\"\n\nIn his remarks, Johnson came as close as anyone in the government has to apologizing for logistical challenges on testing and getting protective equipment to the front lines, calling the delivery of gowns and visors to workers \"a knotty and infuriating\" challenge of supply, demand and logistics. He called the testing program frustrating.\n\nBritain's mortality figures are thought to underestimate the situation, as they include only those who have tested positive for the coronavirus and that such testing has largely taken place in British hospitals and not in nursing homes.\n\nBehind London's shopfronts, coronavirus lockdown forces tough calculations\n\nA chilling scientific paper helped upend U.S. and U.K. coronavirus strategies\n\nQueen reassures Britons of eventual victory over coronavirus; Boris Johnson admitted to hospital with 'persistent' symptoms",

The country's top court has already ruled governors and mayors can decide on social isolation measures regardless of the federal government's position. Bolsonaro, meanwhile, wants a quick reopening to stop the deterioration of Brazil's faltering economy.\n\n\"Everything done in excess ends up bringing problems. These measures did not reach their goal in some states,\" Bolsonaro told journalists in front of the presidential residence in Brasilia. \"I hope this is the last week of this quarantine, of this way of fighting the virus.\"\n\nThe Brazilian president favors a less restrictive model in which only those in high-risk groups would be quarantined at home until the end of the outbreak.\n\nAfter Bolsonaro replaced critic Luiz Henrique Mandetta with Nelson Teich as health minister, several governors and mayors said they were considering even stricter isolation measures in an effort to curb the spread of the new coronavirus.\n\nTeich previously published an article defending quarantine policies, but he has not spoken to the press since a vague introduction speech on Friday and it is unclear what he will do on the job.\n\nOn Monday evening, Brazil's health ministry shared a video in which Teich says there will be \"a progressive, structured and planned exit from social isolation.\" He also promised to raise the country's capacity of testing from promised 24 million in the next weeks to up to 46 million.\n\nBrazil confirmed 113 deaths of COVID-19 in the last 24 hours, putting the country's total at 2,575. More than 40,000 people have contracted the disease in the South American nation, the highest figure in Latin America.\n\nFor most people, the new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia and death.\n\nBolsonaro's comments came one day after he met outdoors with dozens of supporters who want the closing of the country's congress and supreme court. His presence in such demonstration is drawing widespread repudiation in a nation that endured a military dictatorship between 1964 and 1985.\n\nThe Brazilian president denied he was attacking the country's democracy at the protest, but said: \"I am actually the constitution.\"\n\nCopyright 2020 The Associated Press.

        "authors": [],
        "body": "Previously, the CDC listed just three known symptoms: shortness of breath, cough and fever.\n\nThe additions confirm what patients and doctors have been reporting anecdotally for weeks. In particular, the loss of taste or smell has been known to appear in patients since at least mid-March when a British group of ear, nose and throat doctors published a statement amid growing concern that it could be an early sign someone is infected but otherwise asymptomatic.\n\nA study of European covid-19 patients found between 85.6 percent and 88 percent of patients \"reported olfactory and gustatory dysfunctions, respectively.\" In an Iranian study, 76 percent of covid-19 patients who reported a loss of smell said it had a sudden onset. In many of the cases, anosmia, as it's called, appeared before other symptoms.\n\n\"It scared the hell out of me,\" said Vallery Lomas, a 34-year-old champion baker, who feared she would never get her senses of smell and taste back. \"I could smell nothing for probably five days.\"\n\nSign up for our Coronavirus Updates newsletter to track the outbreak. All stories linked in the newsletter are free to access.\n\nLomas was presumed positive for covid-19 in the midst of writing a cookbook. Smell and taste are intertwined, so some people who think they have lost both senses may have lost only their sense of smell.\n\n\"What happens with loss of the sense of smell is you lose flavor,\" but not taste, said Jo Shapiro, a professor of otolaryngology at Harvard Medical School.\n\nWhat it's like to suffer from the coronavirus's weirdest symptom\n\nThough not listed on the CDC website, fatigue also has been reported in people who have either tested positive or told to assume they have covid-19 when testing was not available.\n\nHedy Bauman told NBC News the fatigue hit her like a truck. Even reading was exhausting, she said.\n\n\"My bathroom is maybe 15 steps from my bed,\" Bauman told NBC News. \"I wasn't sure I could get from the bathroom to my bed.\"\n\nBauman told NBC she had chills but no fever.\n\nEarly reports of the virus suggested it caused standard respiratory symptoms, though it is extremely contagious and deadly. During the past few weeks, health experts have noted how covid-19 attacks many organs in the body.\n\nIn some patients, physicians are reporting a blood-clotting complication that does not respond to anticoagulants. Some patients' lungs fill with hundreds of microclots, autopsies have shown, and larger clots can break off and travel to the brain or heart, causing a stroke or heart attack.\n\nYoung and middle-aged people, barely sick with covid-19, are dying of strokes\n\nEvidence from the more than 80,000 coronavirus cases reported in China indicates symptoms in about 80 percent of patients are mild. The additional symptoms could make it easier for people to know when to ask for a test, and it could help physicians determine when patients need to be tested or at least be told to assume they have it and self-isolate.\n\nThe CDC continues to recommend managing symptoms at home unless they include trouble breathing, persistent pain or pressure on the chest, new confusion or inability to arouse, or bluish lips or face.",

        "body": "A month had passed since the first-grader last saw her dad, and her mom hadn't stopped by in nearly a week, but now, from the kitchen, she heard a tapping on the front window. Tamina Tracy looked over, and when she saw the woman in a blue surgical mask standing outside the Northwest Washington rowhouse, the girl's hazel eyes widened.\n\n\"Mama! My mama is here!\" said Tamina, 6, as she hopped into the air and sprinted barefoot toward the door, her pigtails bouncing.\n\nShe wasn't expecting her mother, Leah Lujan, that April Saturday. When her parents, both nurse practitioners, started treating patients with a scary new virus, they'd sent Tamina to live with her cousins. Her dad, Jimmy Tracy, also left their Adams Morgan home, moving into a relative's empty apartment. Tamina didn't know he'd developed a fever a few days later or that her parents feared he had the virus until his test came back negative, allowing her mother to visit the day before Easter.\n\nTamina, an only child, had struggled with the move, at times finding the separation unbearable, so they didn't tell her Jimmy was sick. She understood it could happen, though. Before schools closed, a classmate explained that everyone who gets infected with the coronavirus dies. Then she overheard her parents talking about how they both expected to catch it, and she thought that meant they would die, too.\n\nNo, Leah told her daughter. That wasn't true. Most people who get sick recover. But Leah didn't lie, either. Some people, she acknowledged, do not make it.\n\nThat terrified Tamina, one of thousands of children across the country who have suddenly confronted the possibility that their parents' jobs -- to care for the ill -- could cost them their lives. Already, more than 9,200 health-care workers have tested positive for covid-19, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The illness has killed at least 27 of them, the CDC says, but the true number is much higher. National Nurses United found that more than 50 registered nurses, alone, have died.\n\nSome health-care workers have moved away from their families, and many others have isolated in spare bedrooms or basements, trying to explain to their kids that they can no longer hug them because the consequences of even a single touch could be dire.\n\nMost of all, parents have wrestled with how much to divulge, because what their children do and don't know about the pandemic could consume them. In many cases, it already has: Kids have endured nightmares and recorded their anguish in journals, written parents goodbye letters and created detailed plans of what they'll do in case they never see their mom or dad again.\n\nTamina's anxiety seldom relented. Nearly every time her mother visited, the girl asked the same questions.\n\n\"I brought you all kinds of stuff,\" Leah said as she opened a shopping bag packed with toys and clothes.\n\nTamina pulled out her green Easter dress and decided she didn't want to wait until the next day to wear it. She was excited for the holiday, but also worried. Tamina wondered whether the Easter Bunny would realize she wasn't at home.\n\n\"Does he know that you guys work at a clinic so I have to live somewhere else?\" she asked her mom.\n\nThat's what her young life had become -- glimpses of normalcy abruptly interrupted by reminders that nothing was normal. While Tamina picked through the bag, she spotted a bottle of hand sanitizer and immediately squirted a dollop on her hands, then insisted her mom do the same. Later, when she was zipping a toy boat across the red-brick porch, her 10-year-old cousin knocked a ball over the metal fence into a neighbor's yard. Tamina stopped the boat and stared.\n\n\"Don't catch anything over there,\" she said.\n\nEven the lightest moments were tinged with sorrow.\n\n\"I wanna dance,\" she announced, yellow tulips blooming in pots all around her.\n\n\"Should we put music on?\" Leah asked, and Tamina said she wanted to hear \"Budapest.\"\n\n\"Oh, Papa would be so happy,\" Leah said, because that was one of Jimmy and Tamina's favorite songs. Before all this, the two of them would play it in their house a few blocks away and shimmy together, hand in hand.\n\nNow, Tamina danced alone.\n\nOn Easter, she put her green dress back on and hunted for eggs and ate the head off a chocolate rabbit. Tamina thought about her papa again, too, but still didn't know he was sick.\n\nThat night, as she got ready for bed, he began feeling worse. Then his temperature spiked to 102.9. Then came a cough.\n\nIn the other Washington, 2,800 miles away, where covid-19 first exploded in the United States, Keis Alagba-Green knew all about what the virus could do to people, and that's why the boy was still awake one evening early this month when his mom went into his bedroom to check on him.\n\nNiran Alagba is a pediatrician in Silverdale, Wash., and her husband, Lawrence Green, an Army veteran, manages her clinic an hour's drive from Seattle. Niran knew she'd treated patients who were infected, and so did her four children.\n\n\"What happens if you and daddy die?\" Keis asked her as she lay next to him, two weeks before his 10th birthday.\n\nAt dinner soon after he posed the question, his parents answered it for him and his siblings. Their close friends, they explained, had agreed to care for the kids if Niran and Lawrence couldn't. In the days that followed, each child processed the reality that their mom and dad might not survive in starkly different ways.\n\nThird-grader Laila, quiet and matter-of-fact, seldom talked about it, while the 8-year-old's oldest brother, Laith, 11, did all the time. An aspiring paleontologist and Lego devotee, Laith liked to plan. Right away, he wanted to know how their new life would work.\n\nThe family's friends also have four kids and they don't live in a home big enough for four more. He decided that the other family should move into his house, then he mapped out where each kid would sleep.\n\nPreparing for his parents' absence made Laith sad -- in a nightmare, he saw them laying in hospital beds -- but the fifth-grader believed it was his responsibility to consider the \"hardship things\" his siblings wanted to avoid.\n\nThose things troubled Keis the most. One afternoon in early April, the two boys contemplated what the virus might do in the coming months.\n\n\"It could clear up over the summer,\" Laith said. \"It could just keep going on -- .\"\n\n\"And kill everybody,\" Keis interjected.\n\n\"No, not kill everybody, Keis. It wouldn't kill everybody.\"\n\nKeis could never hide how he felt. He hated visiting the hospital when a heart attack took his grandfather's life two years earlier, and he hated the idea of his parents ending up in one now.\n\nHe was convinced that both of them would eventually contract the virus, but he also knew his mom had access to hydroxychloroquine, the unproven drug President Trump touted as a potential cure. Niran explained to her son that the medication might not help, but Keis fixated on it anyway.\n\nHe needed to believe it would work, especially after the bad thoughts bubbled at night, when he would read books, concoct Dungeons & Dragons strategies, go give his parents' hugs -- anything not to obsess over losing them.\n\nBut his youngest sibling, Zade, who is 6, had decided he should do the opposite.\n\n\"I don't want to stop thinking about them dying,\" he explained, because Zade believed that if he forced himself to imagine his mom and dad being gone, he wouldn't forget them when they were.\n\nTaylor Lindsey didn't know when she would see her mother again, so the fifth-grader sat in the pink chair at her desk and picked up a pencil. To prepare for a potential surge of infected patients, Amber Lindsey, a registered nurse, was about to embark on a 10-day stint of overnight shifts at her community hospital in Olympia, Wash., an hour's drive south of Silverdale. That meant Taylor, whose parents were divorced, would head back to her dad's place.\n\n\"Dear Mom, I love you so much I have no idea what I would do with out you I would never forget you,\" Taylor, 10, jotted on a sheet of paper. \"Stay safe don't get sick I be thinking about you everyday!\"\n\nShe tucked the letter under her mom's pillow, and soon, they said goodbye.\n\nTaylor's mother is her closest friend. They tended to their chickens and painted canvases in acrylic and kayaked Puget Sound, always as a pair. They traveled together every summer, hiking in Central Oregon's forest, sunning on Southern California's beaches. Before the pandemic, each had given the other a beloved gift: for Amber, it was a heart-shaped necklace, inscribed with \"BEST MOM EVER,\" that she wore to work every day; for Taylor, a teddy bear dressed in pink scrubs that, when she squeezed its paw, played \"I'll Be There.\"\n\nLEFT: A letter Taylor wrote to her mother. (Family photo) RIGHT: A journal entry by Taylor. (Family photo)\n\nOn March 18, the night her mother returned to work, Taylor added an entry to her journal.\n\n\"Day 2,\" it read at the top, next to \"CoronaVirus.\" \"I really cried because I dont want her to get the Virus... I dont want her to get sick and be home alone. I cant be without her.\"\n\nThe pandemic has instilled a sense of helplessness in children whose parents work in hospitals and clinics, but that feeling is especially acute for those like Taylor, the only child of a single woman living by herself while she treats sick patients. Her worries are not unique. Three-quarters of those 9,200 covid-positive health-care workers identified by the CDC were women, some undoubtedly raising children alone.\n\nFor Lexa Sterritt, 12, what might happen if her mother got sick was so unnerving that she tried never to think about it.\n\nShe and Elise Sterritt moved about six months ago from Chicago to Las Vegas, where the nurse practitioner took a job at a primary-care clinic. In March, the single mother developed a cough a few days after being exposed to two people who were later diagnosed with covid-19. Though she eventually tested negative, the episode shook her and Lexa.\n\nWhat if Elise did get sick, and what if she was hospitalized? Would Lexa have to fly back to stay with relatives in Chicago, 1,700 miles away? Would she have to leave her mother?\n\nLexa didn't let herself ask any of those questions aloud, and when Elise confided she might have to quit her job because the answers were too painful, her daughter assured her she understood.\n\nDaniel Shum tried to understand when his mother explained things, too, but he was only 6.\n\n\"Mama has to take care of very sick people,\" Lila Abassi, a physician, told her son on the day in March she dropped him off at her ex-husband's place across town in New York City. She didn't come back for Daniel the next week or the next or the one after that.\n\nDaniel is smart. He reads at a fifth-grade level and can describe the differences among solids, gases and liquids in detail. He also wants to be a doctor, the kind \"who save lives when people get very big boo-boos and is about to pass away.\"\n\nHe grasped the immense risk his mother was taking, but Lila spared him from the worst of it -- that nearly all of the patients at Mount Sinai Hospital in Manhattan, where she works, were coronavirus cases and that each time she admitted somebody new from the emergency room, Lila wondered whether this would be the one who infected her.\n\nDaniel tried not to blame her for the separation during their FaceTime calls, but he couldn't always help it. In his saddest moments, he closed his eyes and pictured the New Year's Eve ball in Times Square.\n\nAfter nearly a month apart, Lila told Daniel she was going to pick him up. The news thrilled him, at first, but then he overheard an argument between his mom and dad, who contended it was too dangerous for Daniel to see her. Lila insisted it wasn't and that she'd taken every precaution and shown no symptoms. Eventually, her ex-husband relented.\n\nWhen at last she picked Daniel up and they returned to her East Harlem apartment, he followed her everywhere, even when she took out the trash. At night, as he listened to his Harry Potter audiobooks, he fell asleep with both arms wrapped around her neck.\n\nHe was proud of his mom, but sometimes, Daniel wished he didn't have a reason to be.\n\n\"I think why,\" he said. \"I think why did she pick the job to be a doctor?\"\n\n\"Is it okay if I hold your hand?\" Tamina Tracy asked her mother on a mild, spring afternoon.\n\nIt was the first time they had seen each other in person since Tamina moved in with her cousins two weeks earlier. They decided to walk to Rock Creek Park, one of their favorite places. Tamina took her shoes off and waded in the cool water. She ate a Lunchable with two Oreos. She held her mom's hand.\n\nTamina knew her parents were doing something important. Leah and Jimmy, who'd volunteered together in Haiti after the 2010 earthquake, both spoke Spanish and worked in D.C. clinics that treat many immigrants who lack insurance and are at a high risk of contracting the coronavirus. Tamina often talked about wanting to help people, like her parents did, and now, they told her, she could. Her job was to stay healthy and not get anyone else sick, and to do that, she couldn't live at home.\n\nAt her aunt and uncle's house, she reveled in her role as the baby sister to her four cousins -- all girls, all older -- and embraced her newly assigned chores, aside from cleaning up after Crespa, the dog. Her aunt, Julie Lujan, set up a mattress in the living room and built a fort of sheets over it. Tamina found a strung-together wad of faux dogwood flowers and decorated the wall next to her bed with them.\n\nThis wasn't home, though, and she never forgot that.\n\nHer mother painted a 12-by-8-inch portrait of the two of them and gave it to Tamina to keep while they were apart. She would lug it all over the house, then sit and stare at it.\n\nShe saw her dad only through FaceTime calls, but he'd also begun to write her letters, telling his daughter that she made him proud and recounting the parts of his days that wouldn't frighten her.\n\n\"So she doesn't forget me,\" said Jimmy, who wrote them even after the chills took hold and he couldn't breathe for more than a few seconds without coughing. He ended each note with a request that his daughter send one back, and she did.\n\n\"I love you so MUCH,\" she wrote him.\n\nBut she sometimes felt abandoned by her father and mother, and would refuse to accept the arrangement, throwing tantrums, demanding that things return to normal.\n\nOnce, she threatened to run away to her house and sounded so serious that her aunt slept that evening with her back against the front door.\n\nThen came the afternoon of her walk through the park with her mom.\n\nWhen they got back and Leah readied to leave, Tamina unraveled. She grabbed onto her mom and tried to wrap a hair tie around her wrist, imagining that it would keep her there forever. Tamina begged her to stay and screamed at her aunt when she pulled her away.\n\n\"I hate you,\" Tamina said, weeping.\n\nShe looked into her mother's eyes, peering back from above the surgical mask.\n\n\"Why aren't you crying?\" Tamina asked, and as her mother walked away, she did.\n\nLeah returned the following day, because she'd promised to, but the goodbye was no easier. After that, they made a deal: When Leah left, Tamina could call her on FaceTime and stay on until she fell asleep.\n\nThat's what they did at the end of the next visit, a week before Easter, and as Tamina lay in bed, inside her fort, she listened to her mom name the many people who loved her: her grandparents, her cousins, her aunts, her uncles, her Mama, her Papa.\n\nBefore she finished, Tamina's eyes closed.\n\nTamina didn't want to be mad at her mom, just as Daniel, the 6-year-old in New York, didn't want to be mad at his. But as the pandemic upends thousands of doctors' and nurses' lives, it's left many of their children grappling with a rage they've never shown before and that their parents don't know how to manage.\n\nThe bitterness in Sophie Babb, 7, emerged in ways her mother never expected.\n\nMegan, a physician who treats infants in Folsom, Calif., was seldom exposed to infected patients -- and told Sophie that -- but the workdays had gotten longer, mostly because of her push for new health-care reforms in response to the outbreak.\n\nIt wasn't the first time Megan's job had left her with little time for her daughter. Only now, as Sophie became increasingly preoccupied with the virus, had she lashed out over her mom's absence. She would ignore Megan when she came home late at night and snap at her when she apologized for going in early -- \"I know, mom, you're sorry.\"\n\nFor Gabriel Lipkin-Moore, 9, the resentment began to build in early March, when he was on vacation in Florida and his parents told him they couldn't go to the beach anymore. On the trip back to Lancaster, Pa., his mom, Ericka Powell, the medical director of an emergency department, made him wear a mask on the plane, even though no one else was.\n\n\"They don't understand yet,\" she told him, but neither did he.\n\nLike most kids, he sulked because he wasn't allowed to see his classmates or go outside as much, but then his parents delivered far worse news: His mother couldn't touch him anymore. He would sleep in his dad's room, and she would move into Gabriel's, which had its own shower.\n\nAfter she came home from the hospital one day that first week, he walked up to her. His mother stopped him.\n\n\"I need you to stay six feet away,\" she said.\n\nGabriel tried to distract himself, playing video games and practicing violin, but he couldn't shake his anger. At the heart of it, his parents knew, was fear -- fear for his mom, whose hospital was quickly filling with infected patients, and for his father, who at 65, Gabriel learned, was much more likely than younger people to die if he caught the virus.\n\nHis frustration simmered until one day when his grandmother stopped by to drop something off and he learned that he couldn't see her either. Gabriel obeyed, then later exploded, yelling at his mother that he couldn't live this way. He needed her.\n\n\"I would rather die than not hug you, mom,\" he said, and at last, she took him into her arms.\n\nWalt Awdish wasn't angry, and the third-grader tried not to feel afraid either, though he couldn't always help that.\n\nUsually, the more he grasped something, the better he felt, so Walt -- a straight-A student who called his parents by their first names and repeated Simpsons' jokes few 9-year-olds would get -- found out all he could about the coronavirus.\n\nHe learned that it started in China, ravaged Italy and hit his hometown, Detroit, harder than almost anywhere in the country outside New York. He learned how viruses spread when his mom, Rana, a critical-care physician, used tiny foam balls floating in slime to illustrate. He learned that nearly every patient where she worked, Henry Ford Hospital, was infected, and that helped him understand why his parents converted the laundry room into an off-limits space, marked by orange tape on the floor, for her to change clothes when she got home.\n\nNot everything he discovered made him feel better, though. His mom told him she wore protective gear, but he knew it didn't always make a difference. More than 700 people who worked for the Henry Ford Health System had tested positive.\n\nHe also suspected that on the days she came home with puffy red eyes, it meant she had been crying, and that meant she had seen something sad at the hospital.\n\nWalt didn't want to imagine her getting sick, but he needed to find out what could happen if she did. That led him back to his computer.\n\nHe searched fatality rates on Google and clicked on a chart. In his mother's age group, 40 to 49, he saw 0.4 percent.\n\n\"Out of like a hundred, like that's -- that's like very small,\" he explained. \"It would actually be four-tenths of a person for a death rate out of 100 people.\"\n\nThe 10-year-old's father, Brad, an emergency medicine physician, had launched an effort to aid people on the front lines in getting mental health support and finding comfortable housing away from their families. To help, Kaya, who'd just learned to sew, made fabric pouches -- more than a dozen -- and packed each with dried lavender. She gave them to her dad to sell so he could raise money for his project.\n\n\"Keep doing it,\" he encouraged, because he knew that his daughter helping him would help her just as much.\n\nShe did keep sewing, and the work made her feel good, but the outbreak in Arizona soon intensified. Brad decided that he, too, needed to move away from his wife and daughter.\n\nAfter he packed his car, Kaya, as usual, squeezed between her parents and pulled them toward her in a tight embrace, the \"meat between the bread.\"\n\nThen she watched her father drive away.\n\nTamina's father still hadn't come to see her, and she still didn't know why.\n\nBy then, Jimmy had taken a second test for the coronavirus. This time it came back positive. The week after Easter, though, his fever broke and his cough gradually waned. Tamina's parents didn't assume he was clear of all danger. Covid sometimes subsided only to roar back, sending people who thought they'd recovered to intensive care. But Jimmy and Leah also worried their daughter would somehow find out, on her own, about his illness. If she overheard a cousin mention it, would she melt down again or, worse, feel betrayed?\n\nThey decided it was time to tell her the truth.\n\nOn a walk with her mom, Jimmy called over FaceTime. Leah handed her daughter the phone, and she looked at her dad's face on the screen. Jimmy, by then able to get through a few sentences without coughing, explained that he'd been sick and, after a test, learned he had the coronavirus.\n\n\"Huh?\" she replied, her dark eyebrows raised.\n\nEverything would be okay, her dad continued. He was already feeling better. They still couldn't see each other, though, because he might be contagious.\n\n\"Okay,\" Tamina responded, and she didn't say much else.\n\nThe next day, Leah took her daughter over to his apartment, where they stood on the back deck and peered inside. Tamina, who wore a colorful, miniature mask, brought him his favorite Girl Scout cookies, Samoas, the ones she couldn't pronounce.\n\nShe was nervous, her mother could tell. When Jimmy came to the window and started to open it, Tamina backed away.\n\nHe shut the window.\n\nThey spoke for a few minutes on speakerphone, but Tamina didn't talk much. At the end, as they left, she looked back and blew him a kiss.\n\nThat afternoon, at her aunt's house, Tamina was quiet. Out on the front porch, she sat on her mom's lap. Leah wondered what she was thinking.\n\nWould her daughter want to know why they didn't tell her sooner? Whether she should be afraid of her dad? If he was going to die?\n\nBut Tamina didn't ask any of that. She had only one question.",

        "body": "The sun had barely risen over E. 149th Street in the South Bronx when Edward Halls, 70, got in line. He had seen how long the line was the day before and realized that life now required a plan.\n\n\"I passed by and said, 'I'm not going to drink any water. I'll bring the chair. I'll leave early. I was going to leave at 7:30 but my sister said, 'No, you better leave at 7.' \"\n\nNow it was two hours later, and a line of 32 people stretched out from the front door of the bank where the computers were still down and Halls was still sitting in his folding chair, watching his neighborhood come to life.\n\nAcross the street, a line was forming at the pharmacy. A few doors down, the line was growing at the credit union. Around the corner, people were lining up for the bus, for the lottery, for the check-cashers and the two hawkers at folding tables spread with $5 masks, $10 Advil and $20 cough syrup. Two months into the coronavirus pandemic, this is what life was becoming in one of the poorest and hardest-hit neighborhoods in America. A life of lines.\n\n\"Don't cut, wait your turn, go with the system,\" said Halls, a retired hospital janitor, as the line grew longer and the sun rose high enough to clear the buildings and shine down on all the faces behind him.\n\nHolding strong in the fourth position was 81-year old Clara Futch, who needed a money order to pay a bill and was sitting on the walker she'd rolled across six craggy blocks.\n\n\"Life is horrible,\" she said.\n\nBehind her was Ibrahima Sanogo, a taxi driver drawing upon his experience from earlier days in the pandemic. He'd waited six hours in a taxi line for the few passengers left at JFK Airport. He'd waited four hours on the phone to complete his unemployment application. He had been waiting nearly three hours so far to see a teller about his federal stimulus check, and now he glanced at all the people still in front him and realized he would be waiting some more.\n\n\"I can't give up now,\" he said.\n\nLife in line: In a nation that has revered ambition, hustle and individualism, the moment was one that called for the sort of acceptance, patience and ego sublimation summoned by the words of Nelson Rivera, a school custodian standing behind a home health aide standing behind a bus driver standing behind a woman shaking her head outside a Stop & Shop.\n\n\"You home?\" a woman said into her cellphone outside a pharmacy. \"I'm in line.\"\n\n\"Even the butcher had a line,\" said a woman now in line at Plaza Discount.\n\n\"Where do you think I am?\" said an agitated woman through two masks into her phone.\n\nShe was between two pieces of worn blue tape on a Wednesday that could have been a Tuesday, and soon it was midday and she was still in line.\n\nAcross the South Bronx, people were lining up for various food pantries -- at a community center, at the Catholic church and at the Bronx River Houses, a public housing complex of nine brick buildings where the daily announcement came over a loudspeaker in a courtyard: \"Ladies and gentlemen! The meals are coming!\"\n\nPeople emerged from the brick towers and other apartment buildings in the surrounding neighborhood.\n\nHere came an elderly woman in a black wool coat clutching an empty plastic bag. \"Things are tight,\" Barbara Sanders said, taking her place behind an orange cone.\n\nHere came Amaurice Gabot, a laid-off parking lot attendant now in the 45-day waiting period for food stamps he needed to feed his wife and daughter. \"When you don't have nothing, this is very important,\" he said of the free meal.\n\nHere came Toribio Vasquez, another parking lot attendant whose hours had been cut in half. \"Every day it's getting worse,\" he said.\n\nBehind him was an elderly woman with a walker. A woman with wild gray hair and a dazed look. Two women clutching empty garbage bags. A woman in a wheelchair. A man wearing a homemade mask, holding his daughter's hand, and asking with some embarrassment: \"We have to put our name?\"\n\n\"No name, baby,\" said Norma Saunders, the tenant association president and organizer of a line that now stretched down a long breezeway, alongside a fenced-off area where residents said asbestos was being removed, past three overflowing garbage bins and an empty playground -- a column of more than 100 people standing in silence until a yellow box truck pulled into the parking lot and the voice came over the loudspeaker again: \"Ladies and gentlemen! The meals are here!\"\n\nPeople watched as volunteers unloaded cellophane-sealed containers of spaghetti and meatballs, boxes of green beans labeled \"Green Veg 136\" and foil bags of pizza crackers, and as they prepared to move forward, a latecomer tried to slip into the front of the line.\n\n\"Hey!\" someone yelled, pointing.\n\n\"That woman skipped her place!\" yelled a woman from the back.\n\n\"Everyone is going to get the same -- no more, no less!\" yelled another, and as the woman retreated to the back of the line, a volunteer yelled out: \"All right! Bring 'em all through!\"\n\n\"Please, have your bag open!\" a man yelled through a bullhorn. \"Move the line!\"\n\nAn elderly woman fumbled to open her bag quickly, while a man in work boots behind her opened his shopping bag, while a volunteer yelled \"C'mon,\" while in the nearby parking lot, Daniel Barber watched for a moment, checked his clipboard and headed off to deliver the rest of 4,000 meals provided by the celebrity chef Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s, best known for feeding victims of natural disasters.\n\n\"People don't understand the magnitude,\" said Barber, a public housing tenant leader, who was trying to get an accurate count of how many residents had died of the virus, and in which buildings.\n\nHe drove through one neighborhood after another -- streets without traffic, metal grates over shuttered shops, everything empty except for the lines at the bodega, the Western Union, the laundromat.\n\n\"Man,\" he said, seeing one that stretched a whole block.\n\nHis phone rang. It was a woman from another housing project waiting on the meals.\n\n\"My line's getting long,\" the woman told him.\n\n\"Aye, aye, captain,\" Barber said, and soon he pulled up in the driveway, where the woman who had called, Dana Elden, had been waiting in the longest line of all, the invisible line of citizens waiting for the city, the state, the federal government or someone to care about what was happening in a community where the number of virus deaths was proportionately higher than anywhere in the nation.\n\n\"Why has there yet to be any formal testing in this area with all these developments?\" Elden said. \"Why can't they set up a tent here? Because black and brown people don't matter to them.\" She watched Barber unloading the meals, her sense of gratitude equal to the fury she felt toward leaders she felt had failed her neighbors.\n\n\"Thank you, Danny!\" she called out as he left, and people inched forward with their opened bags, and the afternoon inched forward toward so many doors with orange cones marking the start of more lines.\n\nAt the end of the ATM line -- 12 people -- on Melrose Avenue was an unemployed delivery truck driver.\n\n\"I think the lines are getting longer,\" observed Jose Marte.\n\nIn the middle of a line outside a pharmacy on 149th -- 47 people -- was a math professor sitting in a plastic chair.\n\n\"You can't beat it, you can't fight it,\" he said, then noticed the line moving slightly.\n\nHe struggled to stand. He picked up his chair. He placed it back down on the other side of the next piece of worn blue tape. He sat down and looked around at the life on the street.\n\nA homeless man staggered by. Another asked for money. Health-care workers from the nearby hospital were changing shifts and lining up at a bodega for jerk chicken, where the cashier informed one woman, \"The doctors came earlier and bought it all,\" and meanwhile, back at the pharmacy, an employee came outside at 5:30 with an announcement for the line.\n\n\"If you're in line for the pharmacy, from this point on, the pharmacy is closed,\" she said in a monotone, and the formerly placid face of China Rodriguez dissolved.\n\n\"I thought you close at 6!\" she yelled through her mask.\n\n\"We do, but this line is longer than 6,\" said the worker.\n\n\"But I've been waiting here since 4:15! I'm trying to get medicine for my father! He had a heart attack!\" said Rodriguez, who worked nights cleaning medical offices, and was on her day off the designated line-stander for her elderly parents. \"Damn. This is how people lose their cool.\"\n\nA few doors down, the line for the wholesale liquor store was at 54 and growing.\n\nA single mom was behind a postal worker behind a health-care worker who'd just finished another shift and had been waiting 30 minutes so far for some Grey Goose.\n\n\"It won't be long now,\" he told himself.\n\n\"Five go out, five go in,\" said the postal worker, Earl Commador, but way down at the end of the line, things were degenerating.\n\n\"Nobody's following the protocol!\" said Charise Green, trying to keep her composure. \"Nobody is six feet!\"\n\n\"Look at that guy!\" said her friend, pointing to a young man who'd just joined the line. \"No gloves. No mask.\"\n\nAround the corner, the line for the Aldi discount grocery store was 71, now 72, now 73, and as the sun was setting, Jay Lewis, a dance instructor who had not yet eaten breakfast, looked behind him at all the faces.\n\n\"This is kind of how I imagined the End Times to be,\" he said. \"That's what it feels like.\"\n\nThe man behind him, Jos\u00e9 Alvarez, was listening.\n\n\"We just have to hold on,\" he said. \"This is what it is. This is what it's going to be.\"\n\nThey stopped talking. They had to get through the line. Someone was smoking. Someone was standing too close. Someone was walking up and down the line hawking Advil and Aleve. Some kids rode by on bikes and popped wheelies. Some pigeons fought over a scrap of bread, and meanwhile, the line inched toward the next strip of yellow tape, the next orange cone, a few feet more, a few minutes and hours more, sun shifting, time passing.\n\nNearby, a woman wearing two masks, ski goggles and rubber gloves pressed her face to a storefront window. She had already stood in line for groceries, the bank, the discount store, and this was the last line of day.\n\n\"They told me to wait out here,\" said Katherine Torres.\n\nIt was a health clinic. She was waiting on her mother, who was inside trying to see if she could get a test for the virus. She was a home health aide and had all the symptoms. The fever, the cough, the fatigue, and in a place where lines were everywhere now, she was in the most critical one of all. It was almost dark, and Torres looked again through the window.",

        "body": "With the virus having killed 1,910 residents of the District, Maryland and Virginia, area leaders said it's unlikely that they would soon lift shutdown orders that have stunted the local economy -- even as nearly 119,000 more local residents lost their jobs last week.\n\nD.C. Mayor Muriel E. Bowser said the District's 19 new reported covid-19 fatalities and 217 new known infections \"highlights for everybody that we are not done with this virus in this city.\"\n\nThe District's previous daily record for covid-19 fatalities was 15, which officials reported on several other days in April, according to The Washington Post tracker of known cases in the region.\n\nDistrict officials said Thursday that more than 85 percent of the city's 225 fatalities so far were residents with underlying health conditions. Seventy percent had hypertension, while half had diabetes. The majority of those residents -- 70 percent -- had more than one preexisting health problem.\n\nBowser (D) said residents \"have to continue to heed the guidelines by staying at home, wearing a mask when going out, especially to do our essential work, and listening to symptoms that your body is telling you to get tested.\"\n\nSign up for our Coronavirus Updates newsletter to track the outbreak. All stories linked in the newsletter are free to access.\n\nThe region's overall tally of known coronavirus infections climbed to 41,956 on Thursday, the result of increased testing in the area and the virus's continuing spread.\n\nIn Virginia, officials reported 885 additional infections and 30 more deaths.\n\nMaryland recorded 893 more infections and 62 additional covid-19 fatalities, most of which were in the Washington suburbs.\n\nWith more than 647,000 area residents losing their jobs during the past six weeks, Hogan (R) is facing calls from Republican lawmakers and others to lift his state's shutdown orders.\n\nThe governor released a plan last week that outlines how to reopen the state in three stages. Both Bowser and Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam (D) have released similar plans, with all three leaders planning to coordinate a gradual, regional relaunch.\n\nHogan has estimated that the first phase could happen in early May, saying he is primarily focused on a downward trend in hospitalizations and intensive care unit bed use, neither of which has happened.\n\nReopening the DMV: We know the road map, but we're far from reaching the benchmarks\n\nA group called Reopen Maryland said it wants the governor to lift the restrictions sooner, and is planning a 150-mile trek across the state on Saturday to demand that Hogan allow nonessential businesses to reopen.\n\nU.S. Rep. Andy Harris, the state's only Republican member of Congress, is expected to participate, along with Dels. Dan Cox (R-Frederick) and Warren E. Miller (R-Howard), underscoring the fraying support Hogan is facing within his party as he works to manage the crisis.\n\nMiller said \"there is a lot of frustration\" from small business owners and residents who have lost their jobs. He also criticized Hogan's calls for a regional recovery strategy.\n\n\"First it was numbers in the state, now it's numbers in the region,\" Miller said. \"We're tied to Virginia and the District. Some parts of our state have barely been impacted at all. How long do we have do the quarantine? Is it a month? Is it a year?\"\n\nReopen Maryland -- which is similar to groups that have organized rallies in Virginia, Michigan and several other states -- held a demonstration earlier in April that drew several hundred people to Annapolis.\n\nA Hogan spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment. But the governor has said he doesn't want to create a situation where restrictions are lifted in a less-impacted area and then people from hard-hit locations travel to that area to patronize reopened bars and restaurants and other attractions.\n\nKnown coronavirus cases in the District, Maryland and Virginia\n\nHogan has tried to lessen the economic pain for Maryland residents in other ways. An executive order he signed Wednesday bars creditors and debt collectors from garnishing federal stimulus checks issued under the $2 trillion economic relief package signed by President Trump last month.\n\nChild support payments can still be garnished under that order, state officials said.\n\nHogan tweeted Thursday that the checks -- meant for food, housing and other essential needs -- \"are providing critical assistance to Marylanders.\"\n\nThe governor also extended an earlier emergency order prohibiting utilities from shutting off electric, water, phone or Internet services. That order is in effect until June 1 or unless the state of emergency is lifted before then, state officials said.\n\nHogan ordered that state flags be flown at half-mast until Sunday to honor the 1,128 Maryland residents who had died from covid-19 as of Thursday and the health care workers and first responders working to help those who've been infected.\n\n\"We're still kind of climbing that curve in Maryland,\" he said during a Washington Post Live interview.\n\nIn Virginia, several tenants' groups plan to stage simultaneous protests Friday that are meant to pressure Northam into forcing landlords into waiving rents until the economy is reopened.\n\nThe demonstrations in Northern Virginia, the Richmond area and Hampton Roads also mirror protests elswhere in the country. They will be done by cars and from residents' homes, with participants honking or banging pots and pans during the evening, organizers said in a news release.\n\nHogan said the widespread shutdown has slowed the spread of the virus so that hospitals have not become overwhelmed. But, he added, the consequence of a slower moving pandemic is that it will take longer before it stops.\n\n\"We're anxious to get our economy back on track and put people back to work, but we want to make sure we do so in a safe, effective, and a gradual way,\" Hogan said.\n\nErin Cox, Dana Hedgpeth and Rebecca Tan contributed to this report.\n\nWatch my kids please: Parents hire Zoom babysitter so they can shelter in peace\n\nNearly seven weeks into shutdown, why are so many people still getting sick?",

The center will not take direct referrals from primary care physicians or administer testing, according to the systems.\n\n\"This is for patients who still need acute care, but who have 'turned a corner' in their illness,\" said Dr. James Ficke, the field hospital's director.\n\nAbout 1,000 medical professionals were hired for the site, and officials were looking to general internal medicine and family medicine physicians for staffing, according to Ficke.\n\nWork on the 100,000 square-foot (9,290-square-meter) section of the center began about a month ago after Gov. Larry Hogan announced a goal of adding 6,000 hospital beds throughout the state to keep facilities from being overwhelmed as cases increased, news outlets reported.\n\nThe Federal Emergency Management Agency provided the beds and supplies, officials said.\n\nFor most people, the new coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough.

    "Hogan tours reopened Laurel hospital; virus death toll rises": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "Hogan said the facility in Prince George's County will add 135 beds, including 35 intensive care beds, adding to the steadily rising efforts to increase hospital capacity by 6,700 beds.\n\nThe event served as a prelude to Friday's anticipated release of the governor's plan for eventually reopening the state. However, Hogan emphasized that federal guidelines call for a downward trend in key numbers such as hospitalizations before implementing even the start of reopening.\n\n\"We are not at that point, and if you look at the Maryland, D.C. and Virginia area we're still, although we're hopeful that we're going to start to see some numbers level off, we're still currently on an upward trajectory rather than a downward trajectory,\" Hogan said.\n\nMaryland reported at least 14,775 cases on Wednesday, 582 more than Tuesday. The state also that there have been a total of 631 confirmed COVID-19 deaths statewide, up by 47 fatalities from a day earlier. Hogan said the details he will discuss Friday will outline a safe and gradual plan to enable the state to rebuild and recover \"just as soon as it is safe for us to do so.\"\n\nThe plan has four building blocks that need to be in place before the state can begin lifting restrictions. They include enhancing testing capacity, increasing the number of hospital beds, raising the amount of personal protective equipment and creating a robust contact tracing operation.\n\nHogan said the state has made significant progress in all four areas. The governor highlighted a shipment of 500,000 virus testing kits that arrived from South Korea on Saturday -- putting Maryland way ahead, he said, of other states in acquiring testing.\n\nHogan said since Monday's announcement, his phone has been \"lighting up\" from calls by governors across the country asking how they could get tests.\n\n\"I'm not sure what the answer to that question is, because I think that we're the only state that Korea had made an agreement with, but we're going to try to help everybody here in the state of Maryland first of all, but if we can help our neighbors and our other governors find a way to help their states, we're going to do that,\" Hogan said.\n\nMeanwhile, Col. Eric Allely, state surgeon for the Maryland Army National Guard, said it has deployed teams to dozens of nursing homes to help provide medical care and COVID-19 testing of residents and staff members.\n\n\"The testing is definitely helpful because sometimes it means that we can pick up someone who may be asymptomatic and otherwise spreading the disease,\" he said told reporters during a conference call on Wednesday.\n\nFor most people, the new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms that clear up in two to three weeks. For some, especially older adults and those with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia, and be life-threatening.\n\n___\n\nFollow AP coverage of the virus outbreak at https://apnews.com/VirusOutbreak and https://apnews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak.\n\nCopyright 2020 The Associated Press.

    "Hospitals tiptoe toward restarting non-emergency surgery and procedures": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "Acting on guidance released Sunday night by federal officials, medical centers with relatively few covid-19 patients readied some cancer, heart and other care that has been postponed by a nationwide call to halt such procedures.\n\nThe federal government issued those voluntary guidelines March 18 to address the critical shortage of protective gear for front-line health care workers and ensure that hospitals had enough beds for the anticipated surge in covid-19 patients.\n\nA month later, some hospitals are confident they can handle a resumption of some non-emergency work.\n\n\"Now we're in a very different place,\" said Donald M. Yealy, chairman of the Department of Emergency Medicine at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine and the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center. \"We have come to realize that we have plenty of those assets.\"\n\nAcross the 5,500 beds in the 40-hospital UPMC system Monday, there were just 116 people admitted for covid-19 disease, the illness caused by the virus. Those patients occupied just seven percent of intensive care beds and used six percent of ventilators, Yealy said.\n\nSign up for our Coronavirus Updates newsletter to track the outbreak. All stories linked in the newsletter are free to access.\n\nYet the volume of surgeries performed by the system has declined 70 percent from its pre-pandemic level.\n\n\"We think we're able to serve what's really a pent-up demand,\" Yealy said. \"There's a lot of necessary care that can be scheduled. There's even some urgent care that has been put off.\"\n\nHospitals depend on scheduled work such as cancer surgeries, knee replacements and non-urgent heart procedures to bring in money and balance the costly care they must provide to walk-ins and emergency patients. With much of the scheduled work canceled, they have been losing billions of dollars.\n\n\"There is no question it is the apocalypse,\" said Charles N. \"Chip\" Kahn III, president of the Federation of American Hospitals, the trade group that represents for-profit hospitals and health systems.\n\nNow medical centers must figure out how to provide these services in a safe environment and reassure patients who have been watching nonstop media coverage of hospitals overrun by the virus. Some people have become so fearful of contracting covid-19 at emergency rooms that they have stayed home even with chest pain, stroke symptoms and serious infections, according to doctors and early research.\n\n\"This is a phased process,\" Seema Verma, administrator of the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, said Monday about the guidance on reinstating elective surgeries. She noted the recommendations are intended for communities where the incidence of covid-19 is low, new cases are relatively sparse, and hospitals have adequate capacity in case of a surge.\n\nShe emphasized the decision whether to resume elective work rests with state or local officials.\n\nConsiderations about whether a hospital is ready to resume elective surgery include its ability \"to address screening and testing for health care providers, as well as for patients,\" she said.\n\nKahn acknowledged that \"my members really want to get reopened, but it's going to be complicated.\"\n\nAt UPMC, patients preparing to come in will be tested for the virus with nasal swabs two days before arrival, Yealy said, and separated from covid-19 patients by the greatest distance allowed in each facility.\n\nSimilar steps will be taken at Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., which is preparing to offer diagnostic procedures such as nerve and muscle conduction tests, endoscopies to diagnose and treat upper gastrointestinal problems and some colonoscopies.\n\n\"We are taking every precaution to ensure the safety of our patients, staff and communities, while ensuring the proper resources are available to care for all patients, including staff, personal protective equipment, space and supplies,\" a spokeswoman said in an email.\n\nAt Lee Health in Fort Myers, Florida, \"planning is underway\" for \"a potential phased release of our restrictions on surgeries and procedures,\" said Richard A. Chazal, director of the health system's Heart and Vascular Institute.\n\nA spokesperson for Cleveland Clinic said that a task force is looking at how to resume surgical cases. \"It will be thoughtful, responsible and take place in phases. The safety of patients and caregivers remains our top priority.\"\n\nSeveral medical professional organizations have been working on their own guidelines, focusing on a continuum of risk and benefit rather than an abrupt shift or a strict division between elective and nonelective surgeries.\n\nThomas Maddox, chair of the American College of Cardiology's Science and Quality Committee and executive director of the Healthcare Innovation Lab at the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, likened the process to the analysis a doctor would undertake before deciding on surgery for an individual patient.\n\n\"I think what we are trying to do is lay out the risk scales, then look at patients, decide where they fit on those risk scales and line them up.\"\n\nHigh-risk patients, he said, should be brought in quickly, even in areas where the prevalence of covid-19 remains high. Other decisions, he said, will vary by location.\n\nIn St. Louis, for example, the virus is less prevalent in the suburbs than downtown, so it makes sense for a medium-risk patient to go to a suburban hospital.\n\nUnderlying the success of that process is enhanced testing.\n\n\"It's important that you can test everybody,\" said James Howe, a professor of surgery at University of Iowa Carver College of Medicine and president of the Society of Surgical Oncology.\n\nReopening is a process of evaluating the harm caused by delaying surgery in the face of the continued presence of the virus, said Joseph Bosco, president of the American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons.\n\n\"The bottom line is it's a continuum between elective and non-elective procedures,\" he said, and decision about when to go ahead with surgery has to be made locally, based upon the availability of resources.\n\nIn recently updated guidelines that anticipate the gradual reopening of the health care system, the American Dental Association noted that \"FDA-approved tests for covid-19 are not available to dentists in the U.S. Therefore, dentists should be aware that asymptomatic, healthy-appearing patients cannot be assumed to be covid-19 free.\"\n\nMany doctors noted the transformative nature of telemedicine during the pandemic, which they hope will continue as the threat of covid 19-recedes. Providers have been able to see many of their patients online, greatly reducing the number of people who must come in to offices and hospitals.\n\n\"We're hoping there will be a long tail,\" Maddox said.\n\nKahn called the CMS guidelines \"a step in the right direction to send a signal we need to plan our way out of this.\" But he added, \"I think it's going to be tough ... The question of getting back is still where your covid [case count] is, how much [personal protective equipment] you have, and where you are with testing.\n\n\"The trouble is,\" he added, \"there is nothing revolutionary here because there is no vaccine. We live in this reality of coronavirus that we can't deny ... So when you go back in, you are going to have to be taking all kinds of precautions for hospital workers and for patients.\"",

    "How the virus-stricken USS Theodore Roosevelt may help coronavirus researchers": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "Sailors annotate covid-19 symptoms Saturday during door-to-door daily medical checks aboard the USS Theodore Roosevelt at Naval Base Guam. (Jordan E. Gilbert/Navy/AFP/Getty Images) By Alex Horton Alex Horton General assignment reporter covering national and breaking news April 23 at 5:00 AM\n\nWhen the coronavirus roared through the claustrophobic bowels of the USS Theodore Roosevelt, it crippled the aircraft carrier, sickened hundreds of the 4,800 sailors and ultimately ended the tenure of the Navy secretary.\n\nBut the ship's odyssey is far from over -- and the military's biggest covid-19 crisis could yield an epidemiological gold mine as researchers worldwide race to answer questions about the virus.\n\nAt least 777 Roosevelt sailors have been infected, and the rate of asymptomatic infection is about 50 percent, the Navy said Wednesday. In contrast, the general population rate is about half that -- as high as 25 percent, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has said.\n\nAnd now, as experts and governors are struggling to understand the role of asymptomatic transmission to hone guidance and economic recovery options, the ship infections could reveal new clues of how the virus percolates through communities, epidemiologists said.\n\nThe Navy has called for 1,000 volunteers from the crew to submit to swabs and blood tests to better \"connect the dots\" of the transmission, the Navy surgeon general, Rear Adm. Bruce Gillingham, told reporters last week.\n\n[Virus-stricken aircraft carrier erupts in applause and cheers as ousted Navy captain departs]\n\n\"It is an opportunity to understand more,\" said Albert Ko, department chair and professor of epidemiology and medicine at the Yale School of Public Health. \"Unfortunately, outbreaks serve a purpose. They can teach us how to prevent them.\"\n\n[Sign up for our Coronavirus Updates newsletter to track the outbreak. All stories linked in the newsletter are free to access.]\n\nOne big mystery of the virus is whether people develop an immunity and, if so, for how long, Ko said.\n\nThe serology tests would pinpoint antibodies created by the immune system after infection, and closely following their presence will help researchers determine whether immunities have or can be developed.\n\nThe sailors are a captive audience and can be nudged by leadership -- or in military parlance, \"voluntold\" -- to submit to tests, and researchers will be able to easily track and recall participants for follow-ups, Ko said.\n\nThere is also a trove of data inherent to military life: a meticulous accounting of where everyone is at nearly all times.\n\nShips in particular have many duties carried out in the same place, and studying where clusters are found -- and where they are not -- can help inform what facilitates and reduces transmission, said Timothy Brewer, a professor of epidemiology and medicine at the University of California at Los Angeles.\n\nAn F/A-18F Super Hornet launches from the USS Theodore Roosevelt in March. (Nicholas V. Huynh/Navy/AP)\n\nSome duty areas may be less ventilated or more crowded, Brewer said, or staffed at different times of the day. And understanding how the virus circulated with those variables can help reveal how it moves through other close-contact spaces, such as hospitals, elder-care facilities and homes, he said.\n\n\"The more and exact data you have, the better you can interpret it and come up with conclusions,\" Brewer said.\n\nOne fortunate stroke for researchers, Ko said, is the military's health records system. Service members are screened before enlistment, and every medical interaction is recorded in a voluminous file. Cross-referencing infections and their severity with underlying conditions could prove useful, he said.\n\nNavy medical officers did not provide the age range of infected sailors, but most enlisted sailors are under 30.\n\nThere is a \"knowledge gap\" about the virus's impact among younger people, particularly those under 20, Ko said, and some sailors aboard the ship could help researchers fill in the data.\n\n[How an outbreak on the USS Theodore Roosevelt became a defining moment for the U.S. military]\n\nYounger people may have a greater role in spreading the virus than previously understood, he said, because while people with symptoms are quarantined, carriers without symptoms may unknowingly infect many others.\n\nThe tests will take about a week to conduct and be paired with questionnaires that provide data on living conditions and symptoms, Navy health officials said.\n\nThe tests will be sent to the CDC for analysis and shared with the White House coronavirus task force to aid the broader scientific community, Gillingham said.\n\nThe Navy has yet to clearly explain how the virus arrived on board in the first place. Officials have given conflicting answers about whether they believe air-wing members brought it aboard or whether it was contracted during a port visit in Vietnam.\n\nOne sailor has died of the infection and others were hospitalized, though no sailors were in intensive care as of Wednesday, the Navy said.\n\nKo and Brewer cautioned that there are limits to how instructive the ship's outbreak can be.\n\nSailors spend months in closer contact than most people will ever experience, Ko said. They eat elbow to elbow, crowd into berthing spaces to sleep in bunks stacked high and pass one another in narrow passageways where they are lucky to get six inches apart from others, much less six feet.\n\nStudies evaluate populations to see whether they can be compared with other groups, Brewer said, and ships of sailors -- mostly young, mostly healthy and mostly male -- don't have many peer groups beyond other sailors.\n\nThat doesn't erase the value, Brewer said: \"It means you have to be careful.\"\n\nBut Ko, who is also advising the Connecticut governor's office on when to reopen the state's economy, said the ship's journey is one more piece of evidence demonstrating the pernicious effect of phantom infections.\n\n\"A lot of plans are based on testing people who are sick, isolating them, tracing their contacts and quarantining them,\" he said. \"If there is a lot of asymptomatic transmission, then it makes that strategy much more difficult.\"",

    "In New York's largest hospital system, 88 percent of coronavirus patients on ventilators didn't make it ": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "New York State Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo (D) and President Trump sparred over how many ventilators the state was short. DIYers brainstormed modifications to treat more patients. And ethicists agonized over how to allocate them fairly if we run out.\n\nNow five weeks into the crisis, a paper published in the journal JAMA about New York State's largest health system suggests a reality that like so much else about the novel coronavirus, confounds our early expectations\n\nResearchers found that 20 percent of all those hospitalized died -- a finding that's similar to the percentage who perish in normal times among those who are admitted for respiratory distress.\n\nBut the numbers diverge more for the critically ill put on ventilators. Eighty-eight percent of the 320 covid-19 patients on ventilators who were tracked in the study died. That compares with the roughly 80 percent of patients who died on ventilators before the pandemic, according to previous studies -- and with the roughly 50 percent death rate some critical care doctors had optimistically hoped when the first cases were diagnosed.\n\n\"For those who have a severe enough course to require hospitalization through the emergency department it is a sad number,\" said Karina W. Davidson, the study's lead author and a professor at the Feinstein Institutes for Medical Research at Northwell.\n\nSign up for our Coronavirus Updates newsletter to track the outbreak. All stories linked in the newsletter are free to access.\n\nThe analysis is the largest and most comprehensive look at outcomes in the United States to be published so far. Researchers looked at the electronic medical records of 5,700 patients infected with covid-19 between Mar. 1 and Apr. 4 who were treated at Northwell Health's 12 hospitals located in New York City, Long Island, and Westchester County -- all epicenters of the outbreak. Sixty percent were male, 40 percent female and the average age was 63.\n\n\"It's important to look to American data as we have different resources in our health care system and different demographics in our populations,\" Davidson said.\n\nThe paper also found that of those who died, 57 percent had hypertension, 41 percent were obese and 34 percent had diabetes which is consistent with risk factors listed by the Centers for Disease for Control and Prevention. Noticeably absent from the top of the list was asthma. As doctors and researchers have learned more about covid-19, the less it seems that asthma plays a dominant role in outcomes.\n\nOne other surprising finding from the study was that 70 percent of the patients sick enough to be admitted to the hospital did not have a fever. Fever is currently listed as the top symptom of covid-19 by the CDC, and for weeks, many testing centers for the virus turned away patients if they did not have one.\n\nDavidson said that as a result of that findings, Northwell is encouraging people with underlying health conditions, such as hypertension and diabetes, who are potentially exposed to the virus and who might not have a fever to consult with a doctor sooner rather than later.\n\nA mysterious blood-clotting complication is killing coronavirus patients\n\nAfter deaths of two of their own in New Jersey town, some EMTs go AWOL while others soldier on",

    "Is Brazil the next big hot spot as other nations ease up?": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "As some U.S. states and European countries moved gradually Monday to ease their limits on movement and commerce, the intensifying outbreak in Brazil -- Latin America's biggest country, with 211 million people -- pushed some hospitals to the breaking point, with signs that a growing number of victims are now dying at home.\n\n\"We have all the conditions here for the pandemic to become much more serious,\" said Paulo Brand\u00e3o, a virologist at the University of Sao Paulo.\n\nBrazil officially reported about 4,500 deaths and almost 67,000 confirmed infections. But the true numbers there, as in many other countries, are believed to be vastly higher given the lack of testing and the many people without severe symptoms who haven't sought hospital care.\n\nSome scientists said over 1 million in Brazil are probably infected. The country is heading into winter, which can worsen respiratory illnesses.\n\nWorldwide, the death toll topped 210,000, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University. The number of dead in the U.S. surpassed 55,000 -- close to the 58,000 U.S. troops killed during the Vietnam War. Italy, Britain, Spain and France accounted for more than 20,000 deaths each.\n\nIn other developments:\n\n-- U.S. President Donald Trump said Monday that deaths in the United States from the coronavirus could reach as high as 70,000, after putting the number at 60,000 several times earlier this month.\n\n-- The Trump administration worked to draw up new guidelines for how restaurants, schools, churches and businesses can safely reopen. The White House also unveiled what it described as a comprehensive overview of its efforts to make enough tests for COVID-19 available so states can sample at least 2.6% of their populations each month.\n\n-- British Prime Minister Boris Johnson returned to work after a bout with the virus and warned strongly against easing his own country's lockdown too soon: \"I refuse to throw away all the effort and the sacrifice of the British people and to risk a second major outbreak and huge loss of life.\"\n\n-- New York canceled its Democratic presidential primary, set for June 23, since Bernie Sanders has already conceded the nomination to Joe Biden. In a bit of encouraging news, the state reported 337 deaths for the lowest daily count this month, down from nearly 800 almost three weeks ago.\n\n-- Massachusetts recorded its 3,000th known death from the virus. The state is \"still in the surge and very much in the fight against COVID-19,\" Gov. Charlie Baker said.\n\nIn Brazil, Bolsonaro has disputed the seriousness of the coronavirus and said people need to resume their lives to prevent an economic meltdown. But most state governors in the country have adopted restrictions to slow the spread and pushed people to stay at home.\n\nIn mid-April, Bolsonaro fired his popular health minister after a series of disagreements over efforts to contain the virus, replacing him with an advocate for reopening the economy. Residents protested, leaning out their windows to bang pots and pans.\n\nMedical officials in Rio de Janeiro and at least four other major cities have warned that their hospital systems are on the verge of collapse or too overwhelmed to take any more patients.\n\nOfficials in Sao Paulo -- the largest city in South America, a tightly packed metropolitan area of over 21 million residents, many living in poverty -- have issued death certificates over the past two weeks for 236 people who succumbed at home, double the number before the outbreak, according to the SAMU paramedic service.\n\nManaus, an Amazon city of 1.8 million, recorded 142 deaths on Sunday, the most yet, including 41 who died at home. In the main cemetery, workers have been digging mass graves. Brazil's funeral industry warned last week that the city was running out of coffins and \"there could soon be corpses left on corners.\"\n\nIn the U.S., the governors of Nevada and Colorado announced their states will join California, Oregon and Washington state in coordinating their reopenings. The governors of all five states are Democrats.\n\nIn Georgia, where Republican Gov. Brian Kemp has let businesses reopen, restaurants received the go-ahead to resume dine-in service as long as they follow certain restrictions, including keeping tables 6 feet (2 meters) apart.\n\nAt Plucked Up Chicken & Biscuits in Columbus, Georgia, eight regulars showed up in the morning to have their coffee and breakfast and \"chatted at each other across the room,\" manager Alesha Webster said. But only 10 customers could be inside at a time, well below the capacity of 45.\n\nAlex Brounstein, owner of the Atlanta-based chain Grindhouse Killer Burgers, had no plans to reopen right away. \"You're talking about people putting their mouths on things in your restaurant. You now have dirty dishes going back into your kitchen. To me, it's just completely illogical,\" he said.\n\nTexas Gov. Greg Abbott on Monday outlined a slow reopening, allowing restaurants, retailers, movie theaters and malls to start letting customers trickle into their establishments starting Friday.\n\nThe Republican's plan allows those establishments to let in customers up to 25% of capacity as long as they follow social distancing guidelines. Those in counties that have reported fewer than five coronavirus cases will be able to serve customers at a 50% threshold unless there's a spike in new cases.\n\nTechnology is likely to play an important role in helping countries ease their restrictions. Many countries, including Italy, France, Switzerland and Britain, are working on virus-tracking apps and other means of reducing the labor-intensive task of tracing infected people's contacts.\n\nIn Australia, with about 80 COVID-19 deaths, 1.1 million of the country's 26 million people downloaded a new contact-tracing app within 12 hours of its becoming available.\n\n___\n\nBiller and De Sousa reported from Rio de Janeiro and Geller from New York.

The league and its players union agreed last week to have 25 percent of each player's remaining 2019-20 paychecks withheld during the league's shutdown.\n\nNBA Commissioner Adam Silver said on Friday that there was \"too much unknown to set a timeline\" for a return to play.\n\nSign up for our Coronavirus Updates newsletter to track the outbreak.

        "body": "Getting out was more challenging. Hundreds of thousands of people were also trying to leave after being stuck for months in the metropolis of 11 million. The bureaucracy had yet to finalize how they would safely organize their return. Three official documents were needed: A green health code, home neighborhood approval and a recent nucleic acid test.\n\nWuhan has gained notoriety as the origin of the disease but it has a long history as a fulcrum of change in China, a nation 1.4 billion and the world's second largest economy.\n\nOn Oct. 10, 1911, an \"outbreak of serious revolutionary movement\" erupted in the port city spread on either side of the Yangtze, China's mightiest river. As word spread, Associated Press correspondent J.R. Kennedy left Tokyo for Shanghai, then traveled upriver to cover the uprising against the Manchu empire. Another reporter traveled with soldiers sent from Beijing to crush it.\n\n\"The city was a scene of desolation,\" read one AP report. \"Corpses piled everywhere,\" said another.\n\nInsurgencies soon broke out across China, and the tumultuous decades that followed saw occupation by Japan, civil war, and the victory of the Chinese Communist Party in 1949.\n\nIn 2020, international journalists came back to see once again how events in Wuhan might shape the entire world.\n\nFew hotels were accepting foreigners and each neighborhood had different regulations. Some forced multiple nucleic acid tests on journalists and 48 hours of quarantine.\n\nOurs did not, and as the final hours closed on Wuhan's lockdown, AP video producer Olivia Zhang and I climbed atop the steel 1957 Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge to watch the countdown.\n\nSkyscrapers and bridges radiated animated images of health workers aiding patients, along with one building displaying the words \"heroic city,\" a title bestowed on Wuhan by President Xi Jinping.\n\nAlong the embankments and bridges, citizens waved flags, chanted \"Wuhan, let's go!\" and sang acapella renditions of China's national anthem.\n\nOne recently freed resident told us, \"I haven't been outside for more than 70 days. ... Being indoors for so long drove me crazy.\" He seemed shell-shocked, yet happy.\n\nThe next day we went to Hankou Railway Station and filmed the first train departing for Beijing. In between government-arranged media trips over subsequent days, I donned a mask, laced up and ran to the river. The sky was icy blue, the air warm. A guard let me into a riverside park, but only after checking my phone for the green health code.\n\nThis code was generated through WeChat, China's essential messaging app that includes e-payment for utility bills and donations to charity. Tencent, the app's owner, also added a function with algorithms that analyze a user's geolocation data to produce color codes of coronavirus infection risk: safe green, cautious yellow or dire red.\n\nA green code is now required for most public life in China -- a reminder of the state's constant data surveillance.\n\nPeople thronged the riverbank, all wearing masks; parents with children finally free to run and shout, nurses, fishermen, amorous couples and other joggers passing as I took photos of the spring sunlight.\n\nBefore returning to Beijing there was a ritual. The first stop was a local hospital where we stepped through a box of grey decontaminant gas similar to an airlock. We then paid about $40 to spit in a test tube that would return results in 48 hours.\n\nNeighborhood permission was harder. Some allowed home quarantine, others required returnees to spend about $700 on a 14-day quarantine in small hotel rooms. Catering is reportedly adequate.\n\nWith a green health code and neighborhood permission, people could then apply to Beijing's city government for permission to return home. Success came in the form of a phone message with a secret purchasing link when a ticket became available. The link expired in two hours.\n\nTickets bought, we packed up and prepared to leave. I went one last time to the Yangtze before we packed up and headed to the train station.\n\nBack in Beijing, officials in white protective outfits herded us through biosecurity checks at the railway station and a commandeered city park that separated passengers into smaller and smaller groups based on their destination.\n\nThree hours later, a government-chartered bus dropped me off at my apartment complex. Two officials in street clothes took me to my door where I signed a paper pledging that I would stay inside and record my temperature for 14 days. A new poster on my door implores my neighbors to help enforce the quarantine. An electronic sensor records any breaches.\n\nAs soon as I got home, I put my clothes in the wash and myself in the shower, thanking my wife for volunteering to quarantine with me and handing me a cold drink.\n\nEventually we will undergo nucleic acid tests to prove we're virus-free, but no symptoms have appeared so far.\n\nA cool breeze blows in from our windows as the last days of springs slowly pass.\n\n___\n\nMcNeil, a Beijing-based journalist for The Associated Press, visited Wuhan April 4 - 14.

    "Lebanon is in a big mess. But on coronavirus, it's doing something right.": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "BEIRUT -- On Feb. 21, Lebanon reported its first coronavirus infection. Eight days later, the schools were closed, followed quickly by bars, restaurants and the airport. By the time the government declared a total lockdown on March 15, the entire country had already shut down, in a state of self-induced panic as the number of cases seemingly soared.\n\nIt was terrifying. Few places in the world, except for parts of Italy and China, were taking such drastic steps at that time. In the United States, President Trump was still downplaying the risks and resisting restrictions. So why was this happening to us?\n\nI frantically telephoned doctors and health experts to seek answers. The outlook was bleak. The best-case projections, based on modeling from China, anticipated tens of thousands of infections. Only 128 hospital beds and seven ICUs were available nationwide for coronavirus patients.\n\nI was asked by one major international health organization not to share its worst-case scenarios. They involved multiple zeros and scared me silly.\n\nNow, two months since that first case, Lebanon has reported just 677 coronavirus infections and 21 deaths. It is far behind (or ahead) of Norway, which is widely regarded as having done a good job of managing the spread of covid-19 and has a slightly smaller population -- 5.3 million compared to Lebanon's 6 million. Norway has over 7,000 cases and 182 deaths.\n\nSomehow, this messed-up country, teetering on the brink of economic ruin and political chaos, has done something right when it comes to the coronavirus.\n\n\"It's amazing,\" said Samer Saab, dean of graduate studies and research at the Lebanese American University. He published a paper in early March forecasting that Lebanon would have 13,217 infections and 454 deaths by summer even in the best case scenarios involving social-distancing. Without the lockdown, he had predicted the country would have over 2.5 million infections and 150,000 deaths.\n\nSign up for our Coronavirus Updates newsletter to track the outbreak. All stories linked in the newsletter are free to access.\n\n\"Nobody expected the numbers to be so low,\" he said.\n\nThe covid-19 infection curve has not exactly been flat, but it has ascended gently enough to allow an expansion of hospital capacity, to the point where there are more beds available than patients to fill them. There hasn't been a death since last week.\n\nThere are enough tests available to test everyone with symptoms, for free at government hospitals or for a fee at private ones. Results are returned within 24 hours, much less time than it often takes Americans to receive their results.\n\nThere is currently no shortage of protective equipment for health workers. Face masks, gloves and hand sanitizers are widely available in stores -- and are widely used. Some supermarkets are handing out freebie face shields emblazoned with their logo.\n\nHealth experts attribute the success above all to the swift and strictly observed lockdown.\n\nBy way of comparison: Cook County in Illinois, which includes the city of Chicago and has a smaller population (5.1 million), reported its first coronavirus case on Jan. 24, a full month before Lebanon. The state of Illinois closed schools on March 13, two weeks after Lebanon. It issued a stay-at-home order on March 20, five days after Lebanon had locked down. As of Tuesday, Cook County had reported 21,184 infections and 915 deaths.\n\nParadoxically, distrust of the notoriously dysfunctional government may have helped, said Nasser Yassin, Director of Research at the American University of Beirut's Issam Fares Institute. \"Given the health system and the way the government operates, you cannot trust they'll be able to cope.\"\n\nAnd, in contrast to some other worse-hit countries, no senior politicians sought to dismiss or downplay the risks.\n\n\"In Lebanon, everybody has been terrified from day one,\" said Souha Kanj, who heads the infectious diseases department at the Beirut's American University Hospital. \"In a way it's good to be scared and panic because it forces you to be more vigilant.\"\n\nLebanon's small size is another factor, enabling extensive contact tracing. Almost all the early cases detected among arrivals from Europe and Iran, no matter how mild their symptoms, were isolated in the Rafik Hariri University Hospital, the main government hospital charged with managing the epidemic, said Firass Abiad, the hospital's general manager.\n\nMild cases are now given the option of hospitalization or quarantining at home. Many poorer patients choose the hospital because it is free and at home they live in overcrowded conditions. This further aids the containment, Abiad said.\n\nLebanon's relatively young population has also helped, said Krystel Moussally, regional epidemiologist for the international aid agency Medicins Sans Frontiers, who in March predicted over 630,000 infections in Lebanon, based on information available at the time.\n\nThere are almost certainly unreported cases, including among asymptomatic people, as in other countries worldwide. There are suspicions around the low number of reported infections in southern Lebanon, which is controlled by the Hezbollah movement, compared to the rest of the country. Hezbollah runs its own parallel health system and may not have reported all the infections detected there.\n\nBut there do not appear to be significant numbers of unreported deaths or severe cases, said Kanj. Doctors around the country maintain daily contact with one another and any unexpected spike in deaths would be hard to hide in a country the size of Lebanon, she said.\n\n\"This is such a small country you would hear about this if it was happening much more than your average expected deaths,\" Kanj said.\n\nLebanon is not out of the woods yet. The recent experience of Singapore is cautionary, said Abiad. Until last week, Singapore -- with a slightly smaller population (5.1 million) -- had reported a slightly lower number of infections than Lebanon,.\n\nThe Singapore numbers have since jumped more than tenfold, with over 8,000 new infections showing up in recent days as covid-19 belatedly hits the cramped dormitories where migrant workers live.\n\nSingapore lost control of its coronavirus outbreak and migrants workers are the victims\n\nLebanon could witness a similar surge if covid-19 spreads through country's refugee community, Abiad said. Nearly 1.5 million people are Syrian or Palestinian refugees, and they live in densely populated camps and informal settlements.\n\nThe first refugee case was confirmed on Tuesday, in the Wavel camp in eastern Lebanon and health teams have gone to the camp to test and isolate the man's contacts, Abiad said. \"Here in Lebanon, our nightmare is for it to reach the crowded refugee camps,\" he said.\n\nMeanwhile, Lebanese are tired of staying indoors. The weather is glorious, the economy dire. People are starting to venture out again, to work or to socialize. Protests against the country's political leaders have resumed, in a sign of growing frustrations.\n\nA second wave seems inevitable in the months ahead, Abiad warned.\n\nBut for now, Lebanese have been \"pleasantly surprised\" by how the coronavirus has played out, said Kanj. Not much else is going right for the country, but on the coronavirus front, \"something seems to be working well,\" she said.\n\nStirrings of unrest around the world could portend turmoil as economies collapse\n\nCenturies-old Ramadan traditions and practices upended by coronavirus",

        "authors": [],
        "body": "The four infected with the virus are relatives of a woman who tested positive earlier this week and are isolating inside their home, according to a statement from the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees. It said they were so far not in need of hospitalization\n\nThe Palestinian woman who was taken to a hospital in Beirut this week became the first refugee living in a camp in Lebanon to contract the virus, a finding that triggered a spate of testing in the camp. The five confirmed cases are residents of the Wavel camp in the city of Baalbek, known locally as the Jalil, or Galilee camp.\n\nLebanon, a tiny country of 5 million people, is home to more than 1 million Syrian refugees and other Syrians who are residents. It is also host to tens of thousands of Palestinian refugees and their descendants, most of them living in squalid camps with no access to public services, with limited employment opportunities and no rights to ownership.\n\nOn Friday, Palestinian fighters in charge of the camp security wore face masks as they patrolled the narrow streets and alleyways of the camp with an estimated population of up to 3,000. Posters of the late Palestinian President Yasser Arafat and Palestinian flags were plastered on the camp walls.\n\nCamp residents hunkered down at home after being asked to stay indoors, while paramedics in protective suits spraying down the few vehicles that were permitted to enter with disinfectant and took people's temperatures.\n\nLack of testing has stoked fears among millions of displaced people around the world packed into refugee camps and informal settlements.\n\nMost people who become infected experience mild to moderate symptoms. But the virus can cause severe illness and lead to death, particularly among older people and those with underlying health problems. It is highly contagious and can be spread by those who appear healthy.\n\nHealth Minister Hamad Hassan told reporters after visiting a clinic at the camp that Lebanese authorities were working together with the U.N. and other agencies \"to avoid an outbreak in the coming days.\"\n\nLebanon has recorded 22 deaths from among nearly 700 confirmed cases of COVID-19, the illness caused by the virus. The head of Lebanon's main hospital overseeing COVID-19 patients, Firass Abiad, tweeted that apart from the four relatives of the Palestinian woman, all other tests conducted in the camp turned out negative.\n\nAlso on Wednesday, Iran reported 93 more deaths from the virus, with the death toll in the country now reaching 5,574, out of more than 88,000 confirmed cases. Iran is the hardest hit country in the Mideast and one of the world's worst outbreaks of the coronavirus.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Amir Vahdat in Tehran, Iran, contributed to this report.\n\nCopyright 2020 The Associated Press.

        "body": "Posted Tuesday and Thursday afternoons, the program will run between six to 10 minutes and be available on NBC's YouTube channel and other digital platforms.\n\nNBC's medical correspondent, Dr. John Torres, gamely took a whack at Sadie's question, saying experts hoped that within a couple of months, and with adherence to medical advice, she might be able to begin going outside and playing with friends again.\n\n\"It's healthy to have someone who will talk to them in as plain a language as possible and really walk them through what we know and what the coping techniques are for all of us,\" Holt said.\n\nOne of the \"Nightly News\" producers, Bradd Jaffy, came up with the idea a couple of weeks ago and it was quickly put into motion, he said.\n\nBesides the question-and-answer session with Torres, correspondent Kate Snow talked with an expert about tips for home schooling -- yes, you should change out of your pajamas, he suggested. A filmed story featured a teenager in Virginia who didn't have his driver's license but flew a small plane around the state distributing donated supplies to hospitals.\n\nAt the show's end, Holt said that \"we hope you found this informative, answered some of your questions and made you smile.\"\n\nTuesday's show features a report on a virtual zoo visit by Jackson Daly, who's Carson Daly's son, and has a story about a 14-year-old volunteer from Illinois who makes face shields for doctors and nurses.\n\nLinda Ellerbee, who made a series of award-winning news programs for young people on Nickelodeon starting with the first Gulf War, applauded Holt's effort. She said it was the first time since she retired where she wished she was able to make one of her signature shows.\n\n\"I think it's hugely important because it's not a story these kids can avoid,\" she said.\n\nChildren need to feel that they have a voice, and often have trouble digesting bits and pieces of information. \"Kids need to know that it is OK to talk about things, it's OK to be afraid, it's OK to ask questions,\" she said.\n\nEllerbee wasn't an expert in child psychology when first asked to do a program that tries to make sense of complex and disturbing news stories for young people. She followed her instincts. Similarly, Holt is taking cues from his experience as a father and grandparent. Holt said the show won't address the grimmer aspects of the story, like the death toll.\n\nThe coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms for most people, but for some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness.\n\nThe questions that some children sent in to Torres weren't all that different from what some adults would ask. One wanted an explanation of what \"flattening the curve\" meant and another wondered whether coronavirus survived in the water and whether it would be safe to swim (Torres said the most important issue would be not getting too close to fellow swimmers.)\n\n\"The important thing that this program will provide is an affirmation to kids that it's OK to be a little freaked out by this, because all of us are, too,\" he said. \"It's really important that we convey, even if it's in a very subtle manner, that what you're feeling is completely normal.\"\n\nCopyright 2020 The Associated Press.

    "Many struggling restaurants need a break from their landlords. That's easier said than done.": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "Lee Howard and David Calkins had already made up their minds to close down their original location of Urban Bar-B-Que on Chapman Avenue in Rockville, Md. They had a good run, but after 17 years, their barbecue joint was ceding ground to the restaurants popping up along nearby Rockville Pike. The coronavirus pandemic was only making things worse, and in February, the owners told their landlord they wouldn't renew their lease when it expired in August.\n\nBy March, with sales totaling just hundreds of dollars on some days, they asked White Flint Express Realty Group for rent relief to help them weather the pandemic. The request was denied. Facing the prospect of losing thousands of dollars a month just to ride out the lease, Calkins wrote the landlord late in the month, recounting past grievances with property managers and announcing that he and Howard were closing the business. They would surrender the equipment inside (including an $18,000 smoker) as well as the security deposit. In return, they asked White Flint Express to release them from the remaining months of their lease.\n\n[The Cares Act was supposed to help save small businesses, but independent restaurants remain in dire straits]\n\nTo Howard and Calkins, it seemed a reasonable request during an outbreak when many landlords are deferring, reducing or outright forgiving rents for a month or two or three. But in a letter back to Calkins, an attorney for White Flint Express rejected the proposal and threatened to sue Urban's owners, not just for defaulting on April's rent, but for defaulting on the lease by abandoning the property. Any legal action, the lawyer wrote, would seek back rent, late fees, attorneys' fees and all future rent. The letter also noted that Howard and Calkins, along with their spouses (Laura and Laurie, respectively), were personally responsible for the debt. The Washington Post reviewed a copy of the letter.\n\nWithin an hour, Calkins wrote an email saying that White Flint Express, a subsidiary of Greenhill Companies in Bethesda, Md., had already earned more than $1.5 million in rent from Urban Bar-B-Que since it opened in 2003. \"They are not getting another cent,\" he added. Calkins said he looked forward to countersuing.\n\nLeonard \"Lenny\" Greenberg, founder of Greenhill, has another take. \"When you're shutting down stores, with or without the pandemic, you still have obligations,\" he told The Post.\n\nThe coronavirus has brought out the best and the worst in landlord-tenant relationships. At a time when restaurants are limited to carryout and delivery or shut down entirely, restaurateurs, chefs, bakers and bar owners are trying to piece together a survival plan during a pandemic with no obvious end date: They're looking at microgrants, Small Business Administration loans, donations from regulars, pivots into improvised grocery stores, anything to keep the lights on. But one of the largest fixed costs for almost every food establishment is rent, so many operators are looking to their landlords for a break. Any kind of break.\n\nThese are some of their stories. They illustrate a few themes: unclear communication, fear, hidden agendas, harmony, humanity and, sometimes, hostility.\n\nReem Assil outside her restaurant and bakery in the Fruitvale neighborhood of Oakland, Calif. (Scott Hoag/World Central Kitchen)\n\nReem's California in Oakland, Calif.: Good cop, bad cop\n\nUnder normal circumstances, Reem Assil's Middle Eastern bakery and cafe attracts a steady stream of customers heading to or from the BART station, just steps from her shop's entrance in a pioneering development in the multicultural Fruitvale neighborhood of Oakland, Calif. But with ridership down more than 90 percent on the Bay Area Rapid Transit Service, sales at Reem's have plummeted more than 80 percent. Assil closed her shop briefly, then reopened as one of hundreds of restaurants working with World Central Kitchen to feed the vulnerable in their neighborhoods.\n\n[Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s and his nonprofit aim to reopen hundreds of restaurants while feeding needy people]\n\nAssil has had conversations with Chris Iglesias, chief executive of the Unity Council, the community development organization that owns and operates Fruitvale Village, where Reem's California opened in 2017. Iglesias has been sympathetic and hopeful about helping Assil. But, she says, his sense of optimism and generosity has not filtered down to Unity's property managers, who collect the rent.\n\n\"There's a good-cop part, like, 'Don't worry. We're in this with you. We're going to figure it out,' \" says Assil. \"Then you have the property manager who is haranguing us a little bit, just seeing whatever they can get.\"\n\nThe disconnect extends to email communications, too. On March 31, Unity's chief operating officer sent an email to all commercial tenants and residents saying the organization supports Oakland's eviction moratorium. It also provided resources on available grants and loans. It promised to waive all late fees and \"work directly with tenants to develop payment plans.\"\n\nTwo weeks later, on April 13, Assil received an email from Unity's head of property management, wondering where her rent was.\n\n\"They talk as a matter of fact, like nothing's happened,\" Assil says. \"I thought we can talk through this, then we get an email like that. It's just demoralizing.\"\n\nIglesias knows the pandemic has been brutal on his tenants. He knows that \"a lot of our tenants just aren't going to be able to pay us right now.\" But as a landlord, Unity can't say that in its communications, Iglesias says. The nonprofit group has its own debt obligations on the Fruitvale development. It has to work with its lenders to find some breathing room, too.\n\n\"We might keep the discussions going with the tenants, knowing that we're not going to get paid,\" Iglesias says. \"But technically, we can't say, 'Well, we'll just forgive it.' What we want to do is say, 'Hey, let's figure out a way that you can pay us something later, whatever.' \"\n\nMore than a year ago, Iglesias says, Unity refinanced the transit development at Fruitvale. As part of the deal, the community development financial institution that worked with Unity wanted the nonprofit group to build its cash reserves.\n\n[What to know about the risks of restaurant takeout and delivery -- and how to minimize them]\n\n\"Now we have decent reserves,\" Iglesias says. \"That can get us through the next few months potentially, without taking too big a hit to the development. ... So that money shifts the focus to our tenants. What can we do to help them right now?\"\n\nThat information, however, had not been passed along to Assil. At least not yet.\n\nGina Chersevani at Buffalo & Bergen on Capitol Hill. (Allison Lee)\n\nBuffalo & Bergen in Washington, D.C.: Instant forgiveness\n\nMarch 13 was a Friday. It couldn't have been a worse day for Gina Chersevani, founder and owner of Buffalo & Bergen, which opened a bricks-and-mortar location on Capitol Hill in December. Chersevani's mom died that morning, after a heartbreaking battle with dementia. The restaurateur was on her way to New York for the funeral, amid a pandemic that threatened to shut down her business, when she received an email from Eric Korsvall, manager of Massachusetts Avenue Properties, her landlord on the Hill.\n\n\"You probably have a lot of pressing concerns with respect to your operations, staff, guests. Paying your rent at 3rd & Mass might be a concern, and we want to help you by taking that off the table for a few months. We want you to take care of your people first, and to help you do that, we will forgo any rent due,\" wrote Korsvall, who said he was unaware that Chersevani's mother had died when he sent the email.\n\nChersevani was speechless. Her bagel and cocktail counter was just hitting its stride in late January after a protracted build-out, battles with historic preservationists and a slow start. But then her mother's health began to deteriorate, requiring trips to Long Island. The visits provided Chersevani with a glimpse into the future for Washington: The pandemic had interrupted life in New York, and she knew it would soon do the same in the District. The loves of her life, she sensed, were dying.\n\nKorsvall's offer cut through the darkness. It immediately released Chersevani from paying potentially tens of thousands of dollars in rent, depending on the length of the pandemic.\n\n[Watchdog groups say new FDA, CDC guidelines don't go far enough to protect essential food workers]\n\n\"Not a lot of people in the world are ever going to do something like that for you,\" she says. \"Other landlords that I know have tons of money . . . They're not doing anything.\"\n\nThe source of this generosity may surprise you: Massachusetts Avenue Properties is an affiliate of the Heritage Foundation, the conservative think tank known for its fiscal restraint and its influence with Republican and Democratic administrations. Korsvall says the foundation knew about his decision to waive rents for the tenants under the Massachusetts Avenue banner, but he had the authority to make the call himself.\n\n\"We could do this,\" Korsvall told The Post. \"I don't expect that every landlord should do what we did. For us, it was the right business decision, and I don't want to project that this is the model and everybody should do that. ... Some landlords could be in worse shape than their tenant.\"\n\nKorsvall says that, in the long run, it would cost a landlord more money to find a new tenant, and wait out another permitting and build-out process, than to help a current tenant get through the upheaval. Besides, there's no guarantee that new tenants, or the people who invest in them, will have the stomach to launch a business in this atmosphere.\n\nAs of today, the plan is to forgive six months of rent, Korsvall said. If this pandemic stretches out longer, he'll work out a plan with Chersevani that benefits both parties.\n\n\"If we forgo six months or more and we have a successful tenant for the next 10 years, that was a no-brainer,\" the landlord says.\n\nDavid Calkins and family are battling with their landlord. (Jonathan Newton/The Washington Post)\n\nUrban Bar-B-Que in Rockville: Past is prologue\n\nThe war of words between the owners of Urban Bar-B-Que and their landlord is not a symptom of the coronavirus alone. There is history. Both sides have grievances.\n\nThe conflict goes back years. Laurie Calkins, who handles the books for Urban Bar-B-Que, has accused White Flint Express of overcharging for water usage and other maintenance fees. David Calkins says the landlord once put locks on the door when Urban was three days late on rent. White Flint Express also leased the space next to Urban to a medical marijuana dispensary, and on some nights, the skunky aromas can waft into the family restaurant. When Urban informed White Flint Express that they would not renew the lease in February, the landlord quickly slapped a \"for lease\" sign on the Chapman Avenue property.\n\n\"People aren't going to come to a place where the landlord just plastered a sign that says 'for lease' on it. They think you're closed,\" David Calkins says. \"So that was another nail in the coffin.\"\n\n[With baseball paused, the Nationals and Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s's World Central Kitchen hustle to feed the needy]\n\nGreenberg, the founder of White Hill's parent company, has his own complaints. He says Urban's woes had little to do with a pandemic or any other issue. Their food had simply gone downhill over the years, he argues. He says Laurie Calkins was rude and \"nasty to everybody in my office.\" He says the owners are not being accountable to a signed lease, regardless of the conditions outside the door.\n\n\"I would love to walk into my bank and say, 'Gee, things aren't so good today. Let me off the hook,' \" Greenberg says. \"They're not doing that.\"\n\nGreenberg suggests that, had the restaurateurs been more professional, they might have received a more receptive audience when they asked first for rent relief and later to terminate the lease early. He says he has helped other small tenants try to ride out the pandemic: In some instances, he has accepted half a tenant's rent in April, with tenants agreeing to pay the other half, without interest, over the remaining months of their lease, starting in January 2021. For any further breaks on rent, Greenberg says he needs to see proof that tenants have secured loans or grants. He also wants to review their books.\n\nThe rent deferrals are \"what everyone's doing,\" Greenberg says. \"I know people who aren't doing anything, and we have been complimented on our generosity.\"\n\nColorado restaurateur Bryan Dayton. (Half Eaten Cookie Hospitality)\n\nHalf Eaten Cookie Hospitality in Colorado: The futurist\n\nBryan Dayton owns four restaurants, two in Denver and two in Boulder, under Half Eaten Cookie Hospitality. Two of them are closed, and two (Oak at Fourteenth in Boulder and Brider in Denver) remain open for takeout and/or delivery. Dayton says he's not paying rent, other than the minimal common area maintenance fees. He's working with his landlords for long-term relief beyond deferrals or abatement.\n\nTo survive the coronavirus outbreak, he says, he wants to renegotiate all his leases to lower his rates by 25 to 50 percent until restaurants return to their pre-pandemic capacity and sales.\n\n\"If everything goes right, and we don't have another outbreak or anything along those lines, we're not going to see a true reprieve from this for another 18 or 24 months,\" Dayton says. \"There's going to be a lot more economic disaster on the other side of this for us, whether that's higher insurance rates, whether that's outfitting my staff with masks and more rubber gloves, cleaning. All these little things that we're not really thinking about right now.\"\n\nTo Dayton, the questions are not limited to staff or operations, either. Will diners come back? Will vulnerable older customers, who spend more money than younger ones, be too scared to enter restaurants? He expects his restaurants will be at 50 percent capacity once they go back online, and you can't expect to pay prime commercial real estate rents in that environment.\n\nThis is the time for a reset, he says, and not just for restaurant owners. Landlords and their lenders will suffer, too. He wants to see everyone hammer out a future that works for all: If the landlords need a break, they should one negotiate it with their banks, and then pass it along to their tenants.\n\n\"Things were a little bit out of control before this happened, and this is the time to say, 'Hey, let's take a deep breath, let's all work together. Let's get this settled,' \" Dayton says.\n\nDayton wouldn't provide the names of his landlords. The Post tracked down one landlord, who did not return emails seeking comment. So how have they responded to him so far?\n\n\"I'd say that three of my landlords have been really receptive on this,\" Dayton says. One remains unmoved. \"That's where it gets little bit more tense and aggressive, and those are different conversations, and they're not healthy for anyone.\"\n\nRead more on Voraciously:\n\nChef Wolfgang Puck defends Trump's economic revival group: 'This is not about politics'\n\nRestaurants step up to feed hospital workers on the pandemic's front lines\n\nFood delivery can help with 'social distancing,' though some drivers are concerned for their own health",

The United States is now the outbreak's epicenter, with more recorded deaths and reported infections than any other country.\n\nSeveral countries are confirming thousands of new cases of covid-19 each day, led by the United States, where testing was slow to begin.\n\nOn March 31, United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called the pandemic \"the most challenging crisis we have faced since the Second World War.\"\n\n[Tracking the U.S. coronavirus outbreak, state by state]\n\nThe disease, which can trigger severe respiratory symptoms, has been reported on every continent except Antarctica and in at least 180 countries. The World Health Organization declared covid-19 a pandemic on March 11.\n\nThe U.S. total of reported cases is by far the highest in the world. Covid-19 has been confirmed in every state and in most U.S. territories.

Its tally of new infections peaked in mid-February and approached zero by mid-March, although questions surround the accuracy of its data. The country is reporting an uptick in new cases as travelers return from abroad.\n\n[What you need to know about coronavirus]\n\nAs the disease waned in China, it began to surge through Europe, and by late March, more people had died from the virus in Italy and Spain than in China.\n\nChinese officials said the new virus strain emerged in the Hubei province's capital city of Wuhan.\n\nCoronaviruses range from some common cold viruses to those that cause much more serious diseases, including severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). Some strains spread more efficiently than others; the virus that causes covid-19 seems to spread easily from person to person, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\n[Graphic: How epidemics like covid-19 end (and how to end them faster)]\n\nNumber of cases data collected by Johns Hopkins University.

U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis in Greenbelt, Maryland, instructed the county to file a written response to the suit's claims before she rules.\n\nIn a court filing Sunday, attorneys for the county said jail officials acted proactively to protect inmates and staff from the virus.

        "authors": [],
        "body": "Gen. John Hyten, vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told reporters that Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper had recently approved a plan to allocate the force into four tiers that would govern prioritization of coronavirus testing.\n\nThe first tier would include troops involved in \"critical national capabilities,\" such as nuclear forces and at least some Special Operations forces; the second would include troops assigned to combat zones; the third would be troops located overseas on priority missions and those being brought back to the United States following deployments; all remaining troops would make up the last tier.\n\nHyten said testing would be completed this month for \"tier one\" troops, \"focusing our supplies and efforts on these critical forces like our strategic deterrent, making sure that they're always full-up, always ready to go.\"\n\n\"To get to the entire force, the 1.4 million active duty and the entire [National] Guard and Reserve, is going to take us into the summer, but I think we'll get to the deploying, redeploying forces, the forces engaged, all of the tier one forces next month,\" Hyten said.\n\nOfficials said the Pentagon would at the same time prioritize testing according to movements, such as submarine and aircraft carrier deployments and basic-training arrivals. Since the U.S. coronavirus outbreak accelerated, the military has already taken steps to adjust and even pause training recruits.\n\n\"So we're moving quickly. It is a supply issue right now, which is causing us not to be able to go down the full spectrum of all of the forces,\" Hyten said. \"That's why we came up with the tiered approach.\"\n\nWhile the U.S. military has been testing troops for weeks, focused on the sites of known outbreaks, including the aircraft carrier USS Theodore Roosevelt, a national shortage of supplies, restrictive testing policies and several other factors have limited testing.\n\nMore than 3,500 uniformed service members have tested positive to date. Two have died -- a relatively low number officials attribute to the overall youth and fitness of the force.\n\nThe plan outlined by Hyten and Deputy Defense Secretary David Norquist provides the most detailed glimpse to date of how the Pentagon plans to expand preventive testing across the force in an attempt to avoid disruption of its core security mission.\n\nGen. Mark A. Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, has publicly laid out an objective of being able to conduct 60,000 tests per day in the next month or so. However, asked about that goal, Norquist seemed to suggest that the department would initially have a much lower target of about 50,000 per week.\n\nThe Pentagon has issued departmentwide guidelines on physical distancing, the use of masks, increased cleaning and other precautions. Close to a million employees are teleworking.\n\nNorquist said the department would take several steps for troops who cannot maintain physical distance, including recruits and personnel located in close quarters on ships. They include quarantines for 14 to 21 days, \"depending on the risk tolerance,\" in an attempt to identify those who might be infected but not yet exhibiting symptoms, and diagnostic tests and temperature checks before troops leave quarantine.\n\n\"These interim measures enable us to reduce the risk so we continue to operate until we develop therapeutics and vaccines,\" Norquist said. \"And as we learn more about the virus, we will continue to evolve our approach.\"\n\nThe officials acknowledged that challenges remained as they seek to ensure the health of the force, including uncertainty about how long the virus could linger undetected before symptoms present.\n\nThe officials said the department would eventually want to employ antibody testing to learn more about the virus and potential immunity obtained by those who have been infected.",

        "body": "While the mosque in the central England city has been closed in response to the coronavirus pandemic, its parking lot has been transformed into a temporary morgue with room for 150 bodies.\n\nThe volunteer-run mortuary, with its white tents, industrial refrigerators and neat stacks of coffins, is evidence of the toll the virus is taking on Britain's Muslim and ethnic-minority communities. The two most diverse regions of the U.K. -- London and the Midlands area centered in Birmingham -- have seen the largest number of deaths in the outbreak.\n\nMohammed Zahid, a mosque trustee who helped set up the mortuary with a firm of Muslim funeral directors, said the mosque in Birmingham's predominantly South Asian Small Heath district normally holds one or two funerals a week.\n\nIn the last few weeks, \"we were doing five to six a day,\" he said.\n\n\"You can see how the families were grieving,\" said 44-year-old Zahid, who wears a mask, coveralls and gloves as he moves among the coffins.\n\nLocal government social-distancing rules allow only six people to attend each burial.\n\n\"Especially when they can't get their own cousins and brothers and sisters around them -- it's made it really hard for the people who've lost their loved ones,\" said Zahid, who has lost two aunts to COVID-19. \"What do you say to a family who's got five sons or daughters, and some of them have to stay home?\"\n\nIt's a similar story at the nearby Green Lane Mosque, where coffins lie stacked up inside the prayer hall. Usually the mosque holds about 25 funerals a year. For the past three weeks it has seen five a day.\n\n\"Everybody's worrying about whether it will be their family members next, their loved ones,\" said Saleem Ahmed, the mosque's head of welfare and services.\n\nBritain has recorded more than 20,700 hospital deaths of people with coronavirus. Thousands more are likely to have died in nursing homes.\n\nThe virus has hit people of all ages and backgrounds, including Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who spent three nights in intensive care. But evidence suggests that ethnic-minority Britons are feeling a disproportionate impact.\n\nStatistics show that 16% of those who died in Britain with the coronavirus up to April 17 were from black, Asian or minority ethnic (BAME) backgrounds. About 14% of the U.K. population comes from those backgrounds.\n\nEven more starkly, data from Intensive Care National Audit and Research shows that a third of people in intensive care with COVID-19 in the U.K. are non-white. And many of the over 100 health care workers who have died in the outbreak were from BAME backgrounds.\n\nThe government has asked public health officials to investigate the virus' heavy impact on minorities.\n\nA similar trend has been seen in countries including the United States, where an Associated Press analysis found that about 42% of Americans who have died from COVID-19 were black, while African Americans account for roughly 21% of the population in the areas analyzed.\n\nIn France, the poor and largely immigrant neighborhoods on the fringes of Paris have seen some of the highest increases in mortality since the outbreak began.\n\nKamlesh Khunti, a professor of primary care, diabetes and vascular medicine at the University of Leicester, said complex factors may be involved. While black Americans often have worse access to medical care than white Americans, \" in the U.K. we have a free health care service, so we can't put it down to just inequalities in care,\" he said.\n\nKhunti said ethnic-minority Britons are more likely to live in large, multi-generational families and cramped housing. Many hold jobs with a high risk of infection: doctors, nurses, taxi drivers and transit workers.\n\nBlack and South Asian people, in Britain and elsewhere, also have higher rates of cardiovascular disease, diabetes and hypertension, conditions that have been be linked to more severe COVID-19 symptoms.\n\nOthers argue that racism is a factor. Gurch Randhawa, professor of diversity in public health at the University of Bedfordshire, said extensive research shows that minority nurses and health care assistants \"often receive poorer treatment than their colleagues.\"\n\n\"In the context of the present crisis, this means they may have worse access to (personal protective equipment), more trying shift patterns and greater exposure to COVID-19 patients,\" he said.\n\nIn Birmingham's Muslim community, everyone seems to know someone who has died. Haly Bano lost her uncle, a taxi driver who likely caught the virus from a customer.\n\n\"It is really hard for mum, because she can't go to pay respects to the family or anything,\" she said. \"So we just called on the phone and FaceTimed and that's all we could do.\"\n\nPicking up meat for a Ramadan meal in the predominantly South Asian Sparkbrook neighborhood, Bano said she was shocked at the number of people thronging the supermarkets and butcher shops. Some wore masks but few were following government instructions to remain two meters (over 6 feet) apart.\n\n\"People are not listening,\" she said. \"It is really scary and dangerous.\"\n\nAt the Ghamkol Sharif mosque, Zahid is thankful that the temporary morgue hasn't reached its capacity. It was set up amid fears that without sufficient refrigerated storage, bodies would have to be cremated, counter to Muslim custom. But everyone who has been brought here has had a proper burial.\n\n\"We just make sure they get their final rites,\" Zahid said.\n\nScientists say Britain has likely passed the peak of its outbreak. The number of people hospitalized is declining, and the increase in the number of deaths has slowed, even though hundreds with COVID-19 are still dying each day.\n\nZahid said in the past week the number of bodies arriving at the mosque has ebbed but the anxiety has not.\n\n\"There is fear in people about the corona, there's no doubt about that,\" Zahid said.\n\n\"Whatever comes, comes from God,\" he added. \"We just have to carry on doing what we're doing.\"\n\nFollow AP news coverage of the coronavirus pandemic at https://apnews.com/VirusOutbreak and https://apnews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak\n\nCopyright 2020 The Associated Press.

    "NYC emergency doctor dies by suicide, underscoring a secondary danger of the pandemic": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "Lorna Breen, chair of the emergency-medicine department at NewYork-Presbyterian Allen Hospital, died of self-inflicted injuries after being transported to UVA Hospital in Charlottesville, police said.\n\nBreen's father, Philip Breen, told the New York Times that she had described coronavirus patients flooding her hospital and sometimes dying before they could be removed from the ambulances. She had no history of mental illness but seemed detached before she died, the Times reported.\n\n\"She tried to do her job, and it killed her,\" the elder Breen told the newspaper.\n\nHe later added: \"Make sure she's praised as a hero, because she was. She's a casualty just as much as anyone else who has died.\"\n\nAfter she contracted the coronavirus, Lorna Breen, 49, recovered for about a week and a half and then tried to return to work, Philip Breen told the Times. The hospital directed her to go back home, and her family brought her to stay with them in Charlottesville.\n\nSign up for our Coronavirus Updates newsletter to track the outbreak. All stories linked in the newsletter are free to access.\n\nThe Washington Post could not immediately reach Breen's family on Tuesday.\n\nLucky Tran, a spokesperson for Columbia University Irving Medical Center and NewYork-Presbyterian, echoed Philip Breen's praise of Lorna as a hero.\n\n\"Dr. Breen is a hero who brought the highest ideals of medicine to the challenging front lines of the emergency department,\" Tran said in a statement.\n\nThe Allen campus of NewYork-Presbyterian, located on the north side of Manhattan, serves the region of the United States that has been most devastated by the pandemic. New York state had reported 295,106 cases of the coronavirus and 22,866 deaths as of Tuesday.\n\nBreen's suicide comes during a global pandemic that increasingly directs health care workers' attention toward the mental-health risks faced by physicians, who die by suicide at twice the rate of the general population. Among doctors, women are the most vulnerable.\n\nEarly research out of Wuhan, China, where the coronavirus outbreak is believed to have originated, indicated that female front-line workers experienced higher rates or more severe symptoms of depression, anxiety, insomnia and distress than health care workers overall.\n\nSuicides are an occupational risk for emergency physicians, and the brutality of a pandemic can make them more common, said Loice Swisher, an emergency-room physician in Philadelphia and member of the American Association of Suicidology.\n\n\"I'm afraid we're going to see more of this. And not just physicians,\" Swisher said. \"People who are losing their jobs, who think all is lost and just don't see an end to this.\"\n\nWhile suicide and many of the feelings that precede can be difficult to talk about, Swisher said doctors in particular can struggle within a larger culture that views doctors as steady, competent and driven. Doctors who struggle may be especially reluctant to ask for help from the people best positioned to intervene -- their own colleagues.\n\n\"We don't want to be seen as a weak link. We don't want to be seen as incompetent, or place an extra burden on our colleagues,\" Swisher said. \"It's almost like you're being kicked off the island -- you don't belong anymore -- if you admit to [needing help].\"\n\nThere are also professional consequences that can deter doctors from seeking support, said William Jaquis, president of the American College of Emergency Physicians. State medical boards and hospitals often ask doctors seeking hospital credentials whether they have ever been treated for depression.\n\nThose credentialing and licensing boards do not distinguish between whether a depressive episode was 20 years ago or last month, Jaquis said. The risk is the same.\n\n\"We need to be able to get treatment for depression without the stigma behind it,\" he said, adding that a history of depression or mental illness does not necessarily indicate a risk of suicidal thoughts. \"There are 'happy' doctors who kill themselves.\"\n\nCharlottesville Police Chief RaShall Brackney said Breen's suicide serves as a reminder that health care workers on the front lines of the pandemic are not immune to its mental or physical effects.\n\n\"Personal protective equipment (PPE) can reduce the likelihood of being infected,\" she said in a statement. \"But what they cannot protect heroes like Dr. Lorna Breen, or our first responders against is the emotional and mental devastation caused by this disease.\"\n\nBefore working at NewYork-Presbyterian, Breen attended the Medical College of Virginia at Virginia Commonwealth University and completed her residency at Long Island Jewish Medical Center in Queens, N.Y. She also taught emergency medicine at Columbia University Medical Center, according to her bio on the hospital's website.\n\nAs a longtime member of the American College of Emergency Physicians, Breen spearheaded a point-of-care tool -- a research resource that doctors can use while with a patient -- for people with autism spectrum disorder, the organization said in a statement.\n\nJoAnne Tarantelli, executive director of the ACEP's New York chapter, said in the statement that she and Breen often discussed Breen's travels and snowboarding vacations.\n\n\"She was a gentle soul with a kind heart and engaging personality,\" Tarantelli said. \"Lorna will be remembered for her dedication, devotion and contributions to emergency medicine.\"",

But with a community of billions of people globally, Facebook can uniquely help researchers and health authorities get the information they need to respond to the outbreak and start planning for the recovery.\n\nWe recently started showing the Facebook community in the United States an opt-in symptom survey run by health researchers at Carnegie Mellon University. The survey asked people if they have symptoms such as fevers, coughing, shortness of breath or loss of smell that are associated with covid-19. Since experiencing symptoms is a precursor to becoming more seriously ill, this survey can help forecast how many cases hospitals will see in the days ahead and provide an early indicator of where the outbreak is growing and where the curve is being successfully flattened. The survey responses are sent to the researchers and aren't accessible to Facebook.",

        "body": "Despite this reputation, we have the Middle Ages to thank for some of the most enduring advances in public health and medicine. In the crucible of the bubonic plague, which struck Europe in 1347 and recurred periodically for more than two centuries, our medieval forebears forged weapons against disease that remain our most effective tools for combating covid-19.\n\nBubonic plague is a horrific disease. Only recently was the identity of the medieval pandemic confirmed, thanks to ancient DNA preserved in the bodies of its victims. Yersinia pestis, the bacterium that causes plague, has evolved to survive among rodents, spreading to humans primarily through fleas. In modern cases of plague, about half of untreated patients die, usually three to five days after showing symptoms, making the disease around 25 to 50 times deadlier than covid-19.",

    "Opinion | What would robust federal testing really look like? A top expert explains.": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "The stakes here are incalculably huge. It's widely lamented that we won't be able to reopen the economy safely without a massive escalation in testing -- possibly as much as triple what we're doing now.\n\nAccording to the Covid Tracking Project, we saw 152,000 tests on Tuesday. The numbers are edging upwards slowly, but mostly plateauing. Numerous states and hospital professionals have sounded the alarm about the federal government's failure to marshal private sector resources to deliver the supplies needed to seriously scale up.\n\nAnd that's not all: Another major issue is contact tracing, the painstaking push to identify people who have come into contact with someone who is known to be infected. Experts fear that the states, which are escalating their contact tracing efforts, are doing so in a haphazard way with far too few personnel.\n\nDr. Tom Frieden, a former official at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and a former New York City health commissioner, has been advising world governments on how to scale up testing regimes.\n\nI spoke to Frieden about what's needed in the U.S. An edited and condensed version of our conversation follows.\n\nGreg Sargent:\n\nWhat would a robust federal testing regime really entail?\n\nTom Frieden:\n\nThe volume of testing we're doing now is far lower than what we need to be doing. It has scaled up some, but we need to be doing at least three times more per day to meet the bare minimum of the highest priority testing.\n\nYou would want to test every person admitted to hospitals, every person in a nursing home, homeless shelter, or other congregate facility exhibiting symptoms.\n\nGreg Sargent:\n\nYou test every single person admitted to a hospital?\n\nTom Frieden:\n\nAt a minimum those who have suspected COVID. But if you really want to keep hospitals safe, you would test all those admitted. Everyone with pneumonia in America should get tested.\n\nGreg Sargent:\n\nAt this point do we have even a general sense of what percentage of people with COVID-like symptoms admitted to hospitals are being tested?\n\nTom Frieden:\n\nNo. This is the kind of data we should be seeing, but aren't. The most important indicator isn't how many tests we're doing per day, or even how many tests per 1,000 of the population we're doing per day. The most important is: Are we testing the highest priority people?\n\nThere are more people who have symptoms of COVID every day than there are tests. So we can't even test everyone with symptoms of COVID.\n\nEveryone who has tested positive should ideally be tested again at the end of hospitalization or isolation. Every contact with symptoms, and potentially those without, should ideally be tested.\n\nTesting is just one of four crucial components of boxing in COVID-19. Without isolation, contact tracing, and quarantining of contacts, testing itself won't make much difference.\n\nGreg Sargent:\n\nAbout contact tracing -- what do we need in a serious national response?\n\nTom Frieden:\n\nWe need national guidance and policy. We need a pattern for how it gets done. We need many people to do it, led by public health and supported by health care and social service agencies.\n\nThe act of contact tracing is a highly specialized skill. It requires people skills, communication skills, knowledge of confidentiality and medical issues. It needs to be done expertly in order to have good results.\n\nGreg Sargent:\n\nIt's hard to get one's head around how big this response needs to be.\n\nTom Frieden:\n\nLook at Wuhan. It has 11 million people. It has 9,000 contact tracers, and they're doing 50,000 tests a day. And it has almost no cases.\n\nIf we had the kind of contact-tracer-to-population ratio that Wuhan has, that would be 300,000 contact tracers.\n\nOn tests, with 400,000 to 500,000 a day we'd be able to reach the priority population. By priority, I mean the people for whom testing might save their lives and help stop spread.\n\nGreg Sargent:\n\nOn supply chains, what would it look like if we had a fully engaged federal government?\n\nTom Frieden:\n\nOther countries around the world have basically planned, taken over production, made sure it gets done, repurposed factories. A war footing approach.\n\nThe broader issue here is that the way to respond to an emergency like this is to use a structured incident management system. You have an incident manager. You have task forces reporting to the incident manager. The incident manager reports to the head of the country or city or state or province. This is the best practice for how to manage emergencies.\n\nCountries do this all over the world. It seems to still be lacking in the U.S.\n\nGreg Sargent:\n\nHow would you overlay [federal coordination of] testing and contact tracing on to the states?\n\nTom Frieden:\n\nProduction coordination has to be done on a national level. Then the states have to implement the testing. If you're going to get the military or businesses to work in concert producing the whole supply chain of tests, that has to be done with national coordination.\n\nOnce there enough tests, it's up to the states, the health departments, and hospitals to make sure they get used correctly.\n\nContact tracing is a little different. The boots on the ground are going to have to be at the state and local levels. That's going to require a great deal of training and creativity and coordination by a lot of different entities.\n\nIt's huge, but our ability to restart our economy and save lives depends on it. So we need to get past \"this is bigger than anything we've done,\" and say, \"alright, it's going to take awhile, but it's something we have to try.\"\n\nSouth Africa -- they've got 25,000 people doing this. Liberia has 6,000 doing it.\n\nContact tracing. And following cases. We have let our public health infrastructure decay.\n\nGreg Sargent:\n\nWhat are the consequences going to be if we continue on our current course?\n\nTom Frieden:\n\nIf we can't box it in by testing, isolating, contact tracing and quarantining, there is a much higher risk that the virus will explode again, resulting in avoidable infections of health care workers, overload of our health care system, and increased deaths.\n\nOur ability to get to the new normal depends to a great extent on our ability to test, isolate, contact trace, and quarantine.",

    "Perspective | Ask Amy: Mom worries about covid-19 exposure from her young son": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "By Amy Dickinson Amy Dickinson April 23 at 12:00 AM\n\nDear Amy: I have a 3-year-old son. His father and I separated when he was a baby, but we have a good co-parenting relationship. We've never had any problems with this arrangement. My son sees his father nearly every day, and this is how we both like it.\n\nThe problem is this: I have an immune deficiency and mild asthma. Worrying about the covid-19 pandemic, I do not want to leave my young son without a mother.\n\nI'm trying to take every precaution against contracting the virus, including using lots of hand sanitizer and cleaning anything (such as groceries) that comes into my house.\n\nMy ex has a very robust immune system. He is not worried about the coronavirus. He is working and going out for groceries. He is not using hand sanitizer or cleaning frequently touched surfaces, like his car steering wheel or cellphone.\n\nWhile he is physically distancing and washing his hands a bit more than usual, I don't feel like this is enough, given my immune-compromised situation. If he gets the virus, he is likely to have mild symptoms or be asymptomatic. I'm afraid he will catch the virus and give it to my son, who will pass it to me. I've tried talking to him about this, but he is not receptive. I don't know what to do.\n\nWhat is your advice?\n\n-- Worried Mom\n\nWorried Mom: Parents are supposed to have the capacity to forgo their immediate impulses for the sake of their children. The best way to prevent this illness is to avoid exposure. The best way for your son to have both parents in his life, long into the future -- is to avoid exposure. You and your ex should connect with your son's pediatrician -- together, and immediately -- (through video conferencing) to ask for a physician's advice.\n\nYour boy travels between parents nearly every day. One obvious idea would be for these visits to be temporarily stopped, or cut down -- temporarily, for everyone's safety (including his, of course).\n\nIf your ex would agree to cut these visits to even three times a week, this would limit the number of possible exposures between households. You should also seriously discuss the reality and possibility of one parent (you or him) NOT having your son with you, perhaps for the next month, and then negotiating ways to make up the difference after the risk has passed.\n\nThe CDC suggests that children older than 2 should wear a cloth face covering when in a \"community setting.\" When your son is delivered to you, you should wear a mask, he should put on a mask and be taken directly to the bathroom for some healthy hand-washing and to take his temperature. There are many examples online of cloth masks made for kids, and you could either purchase or make one for him at home.\n\nIf you continue visits, don't let him bring toys or books between households.\n\nDear Amy: This is a minor problem, probably, but one that many people share. Quite simply, with the covid-19 stay-at-home directive, I am going stir-crazy!\n\nNetflix can only take a person so far. All of my closets are clean and organized.\n\nAny suggestions?\n\n-- Stirred-Up\n\nStirred-Up: Order a bird feeder and some seed. Birds are incredibly interesting, calming and beautiful.

    "Perspective | Ask Amy: Needy couple might be emotional vampires": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "By Amy Dickinson Amy Dickinson April 21 at 12:00 AM\n\nDear Amy: My wife and I have been friends with \"Sandy\" and \"Keith\" for years. We truly consider them to be family.\n\nA few weeks ago, my wife and I had a miscarriage, which deeply impacted my faith.\n\nMy wife was upset and confused by my reaction and wanted to talk with our closest friends about it.\n\nSandy and Keith said that we could come to their house to meet with them. When we were getting ready to leave, they called and said that Sandy wouldn't be able to talk because she wasn't feeling well. She had flu symptoms and was worried she might have covid-19.\n\nMy wife really wanted Sandy's guidance. We reiterated how important our issue was. We understood that Sandy was sick, but we were willing to get sick ourselves to talk with them both.\n\nSandy wouldn't budge, and we ended up seeking help elsewhere.\n\nOver the course of the following week my wife texted Sandy that we were offended that she was not willing to meet with us. Sandy insisted that she felt \"burned out\" by help she gave to others, in addition to being sick. We felt that the deep need we had should override her other concerns.\n\nSandy said that sometimes adults need to step away for their own mental health. She hasn't apologized. Since they weren't there for us when we needed them the most, we have been reconsidering their place in our life.\n\nAre we unreasonable to expect Sandy to meet with us during our personal emergency? Shouldn't we expect family to be there when we are experiencing personal crisis?\n\n-- Too Close?\n\nToo Close: Well, you (sort of) had me until you stated that you were \"willing to get sick, yourselves\" to share your burden with \"Sandy\" and \"Keith\" in person.\n\nYour willingness to expose yourselves (and others) to a potentially deadly illness to receive exactly what you were looking for -- and on your terms -- is deeply selfish. Can you not receive comfort via phone, text, email or video conferencing?\n\nMiscarriage can be a truly shattering, tragic event (I have been through it). But in many ways, it is also a deeply personal event. Your friends might have experienced a miscarriage themselves, and they might not have been emotionally equipped to handle your personal demands, on your timetable and according to your specifications. Or you two might be needy, emotional vampires -- who take too much and don't give back enough.\n\nMy larger point is that you simply never know what burdens others are quietly carrying. When people who love you say they can't help you, you should respect their choice, even if you feel let down. You should understand that they may also be hurting, or flawed, and you should work harder to understand them.\n\nAnd, yes, you should reconsider their primary place in your lives. They deserve a break.\n\nDear Amy: Our daughter was employed by a family friend. We were very grateful to this friend for giving her a job. Unfortunately, our family friend turned out to be a miserable boss. This was born out by several co-workers, and our daughter.\n\nMy daughter succeeded at her job despite this and was offered several promotions and raises over the years that she worked there.\n\nI'm sorry to say that we never talked about any of this to the friend. It felt to us like the elephant in the room, but we could never figure out what to say. Not surprisingly, our personal relationship cooled a lot.\n\nOur daughter has moved on to a new job, and we frequently have social events that include our old friend.\n\nThis friend has been more solicitous of our friendship, and we are open to these efforts. Should we try to talk it out? If so, what do we say?\n\nDoes everything always have to be resolved, or are we allowed to just put some things behind us?\n\n-- Puzzled Parents\n\nPuzzled Parents: You are allowed to put this behind you. Your daughter seems to be thriving, your friend is reaching out, this isn't actually your business to start with, and so -- yes -- move on.\n\nDear Amy: \"Wondering Wife\" highly suspected her husband had \"Asperger's.\" You encouraged her to help him to get a diagnosis.\n\nWhile I appreciate your compassion and support, \"Asperger's\" is no longer considered correct. In the future, please refer to \"Autism Spectrum Disorder.\"\n\n-- Autism Advocate\n\nAutism Advocate: Several readers offered this correction. Thank you.\n\n2020 by Amy Dickinson distributed by Tribune Content Agency",

        "body": "Just because the economy has shut down for all intents and purposes, that doesn't mean the structural and mechanical problems and challenges at your own home have stopped. In fact, you may be more desperate now than you were a month ago.\n\nPerhaps you don't want strangers coming to your house. I get that. The virus we're all battling is invisible. People who have the coronavirus can infect others before they show symptoms (if they ever show them at all).\n\nYour challenge could be financial. So many are suffering. I get that. Just nine years ago, I had to face an incredible financial challenge of my own. I'm quite sensitive to this particular situation and understand the difficulty you might be experiencing.\n\nHow to avoid DIY plumbing mistakes\n\nI'm ready to step up to the plate to help you. I did a two-hour live call-in radio show for 12 years, and I was the weekly home improvement expert on the ABC and NBC TV affiliates in Cincinnati. It's time to brush off the dust from those past experiences to help you.\n\nI've decided to devote two hours a day, at a minimum, calling homeowners across the United States. You may need to know how to do a simple repair. I can help get you started over the phone.\n\nBecause money is tighter than a banjo string right now, you can't afford to buy something new, so you need to know how to protect what you have. I can help. Or, if you are buying something, perhaps you want to know what the best product is so you don't waste precious money.\n\nIn many cases, a simple, quick phone call may help you. In others, I may have to record a short video with some drawings, as I made all those years ago sitting at future customers' dining tables showing them how I was going to solve a particular issue when building an addition to their house.\n\nThe point is, it's time for me to try to share my knowledge far and wide. I intend to record each phone call, keeping your identity private. I'll then upload the recording to my website so everyone with the same problem can listen and benefit.\n\nAny video I do, I'll upload to my AsktheBuilder YouTube channel so you can watch it. It's my hope that your newspaper will allow me to use part of this column to feature the recordings and videos.\n\nI've created a form on my website that you need to fill out with some information so I can do my best to help you. Remember, your privacy is paramount. No one will know it's you who's asking for help.\n\nI don't know how many different problems a week I can solve. I do know that your problem may be shared by someone else -- so even if I don't call you, a phone call or video I create for someone else may be all the help you require.\n\nI'm wide open to ideas on how to make this work for you, as the concept is not cast in stone. We can work together to refine how to transfer the knowledge. If you have a better mousetrap that will allow me to help more people faster, I'd love to hear from you.\n\nStay safe, and I pray each day that you'll survive this crisis stronger than before.\n\nSubscribe to Tim's free newsletter and listen to his new podcasts at www.AsktheBuilder.com.\n\n7 questions to ask yourself before taking on a DIY home project",

        "body": "Residents of a migrant workers dormitory in Singapore wait to enter an on-site grocery store.\n\nShekor arrived in Singapore a decade ago at age 17, one of many low-income migrant workers who have powered the city's growth, building hospitals, subway lines and the Marina Bay Sands resort.\n\nIn his years working in aluminum production and on construction sites, the Bangladeshi national has suffered various work-related injuries. The most recent, on March 18, left him with searing pain in his left hip.\n\nThat was also the date that coronavirus infections in the city-state -- whose early response epidemiologists had lauded as the gold standard -- began soaring, from 313 then to more than 9,000 as of Tuesday, after two days of record jumps.\n\nThousands of new cases -- and almost 70 percent of Singapore's total -- are concentrated in dormitories that house migrant workers, who have been locked down in their quarters as authorities seek a solution. For Shekor, who gave only his first name for fear of retribution from his employer, it means no access to painkillers he needs just to sleep.\n\n\"Everything is so difficult for everybody here,\" he said in a phone interview from his dormitory of 25,000, where hundreds have been infected. \"It seems like they only take the most serious ones to hospital; the normal ones like me, no one takes care of us.\"\n\nThe situation highlights the vulnerability of migrant workers, who in Singapore make up one-third of the labor force. Their risks of infection are exacerbated by overcrowded living quarters, poor nutrition, limited access to health care and personal protective equipment, low wages and, in some cases, discrimination.\n\n[Sign up for our Coronavirus Updates newsletter to track the outbreak. All stories linked in the newsletter are free to access.]\n\nIn the Persian Gulf, laborers' quarters also have become infection hotspots. As in Singapore, many migrant laborers are from South Asia. Elsewhere, African migrants in China are facing discrimination and xenophobia, refused entry into restaurants or evicted from their homes. Singapore's largest Chinese-language broadsheet, Lianhe Zaobao, recently published a letter from a reader who blamed the migrants for the outbreaks, labeling their countries \"backward\" and their practices dirty.\n\nIn Singapore, critics say these events have revealed a hubris among the authorities and the wider community, who took for granted their initial success in keeping infection numbers low while failing to prepare for the possibility of an outbreak among the most downtrodden.\n\n\"For the first two months, we engaged in a lot of self-congratulation,\" said Alex Au, vice president of rights group Transient Workers Count Too (TWC2). \"If anyone had cared to look, the dangers were already there.\"\n\nAuthorities had planned for the epidemic with a focus only on citizens, he said, distributing surgical masks, hand sanitizer and reusable masks only to Singaporean households. Singaporean residents returning from the United States and Britain, meanwhile, were put up in four- and five-star hotels paid for by the government.\n\n\"This reflects the deliberate invisibilization of the foreign worker; the whole machinery of state operates as though they don't exist,\" Au said.\n\nHealthServe, a nonprofit providing subsidized health care to migrant workers, said migrants had been anxious as early as February about the virus and their level of risk in overcrowded living conditions. But a change in regulations meant volunteer doctors and nurses staffing the organization's nonprofit clinics could no longer serve part-time, forcing it to cut services by 90 percent.\n\n\"This was a situation we felt was going to come, even if we were hoping for the best,\" said Suwen Low, spokeswoman for HealthServe.\n\nA spokesman for the Ministry of Manpower responded to a request for comment from The Washington Post with a news release, issued April 14, saying that authorities are working to \"reduce the number of workers in the dormitories and also implement a medical support plan at all dormitories.\"\n\nWorkers in essential services have been moved out of dormitories, the ministry said, while officials were identifying alternative accommodations for others, such as army camps, sports halls, vacant housing blocks and shipping containers.\n\n\"Our immediate priority for the workers in the dormitories is to help them stay healthy and minimize the number that get infected,\" said Josephine Teo, Singapore's manpower minister, in a news conference last week.\n\nIn an address to the nation on Tuesday, Singapore prime minister Lee Hsien Loong began by noting that the number of new cases in the local community has \"leveled of\" before acknowledging the problematic sharp rise in total cases overwhelmingly among migrants.\n\n\"We will care for you just like we care for Singaporeans,\" he said. \"We will look after your health, your welfare and your livelihood.\"\n\nAuthorities are also working with organizations such as the Migrant Workers Center, which has a program of \"ambassadors\" who are helping their colleagues and friends understand hygiene practices, social distancing and practicalities like how to send remittances online. Yeo Guat Kwang, the group's chairman, said the focus should be on improving conditions in the future.\n\n\"In hindsight, everyone would be wiser,\" Yeo said. \"But this is really an unprecedented global pandemic.\"\n\nA second wave of coronavirus infections began taking root in Singapore in mid-March, similar to other places in Asia, like Hong Kong and Taiwan, as residents abroad flocked back to the region when outbreaks intensified in Europe and the United States. But while Hong Kong managed this spike, getting new cases down to single-digits for more than eight days straight, and Taiwan recorded several days this month with no new cases, Singapore now has among the highest number of cases per capita globally.\n\nThe migrant workers bearing the brunt of the outbreak are overwhelmingly male and employed in construction and other labor-intensive sectors that Singaporeans avoid. The typical construction worker in Singapore earns about $430 a month, while the median monthly income for Singaporeans is $3,227.\n\n\"To keep them cheap, we have to exploit,\" said Au from TWC2. \"We pack them into [trucks], we pack them into dormitories, and now, when a crisis hits, they have no buffer.\"\n\nClusters have been identified in many dormitories. More than a dozen dormitories have been placed under quarantine, meaning workers cannot leave their rooms, while nearly all dormitory residents are now barred from leaving the facilities, which are guarded by police.\n\nThe more than 200,000 dormitory residents are now anxious, bored, isolated and scared. Unable to buy their own groceries, cook for themselves or purchase phone cards to call home, they are almost completely dependent on charity and handouts.\n\nA worker in one of the worst-hit dormitories, who only wanted to be identified by his first name, Ali, was treated for a sore throat and fever before the lockdown, and placed on sick leave until April 9. He was given an \"advisory for patients with respiratory tract infection\" -- a status that means he has to isolate himself from others or be fined $7,000.\n\nThat was impossible in his 12-person room, he said. Ali's cough persisted, but under lockdown, he was unable to seek medical attention for several days.\n\n\"Who will give me any treatment or help?\" he said in an interview. \"I am so scared I will die before any help comes.\"\n\nAuthorities say that infected dormitory residents have been linked through common work sites, and through places like shopping malls, where many gather on their days off. In the dormitories, before the lockdown, men were able to socialize with each other and cook together, a distraction from their physically demanding jobs and the difficulty of being away from their families.\n\nIn an interview Thursday, Ali said he was finally able to see a doctor, who gave him cough syrup and tested him for the coronavirus. He has not heard back. His 11 roommates are trying to keep their distance from each other, but find it near impossible. On a trip to the bathroom on Thursday evening, he found that there was no hand soap.\n\nIn the evenings, he passes the time by reading engineering books and speaking to his family.\n\n\"I told my brother about my symptoms, and he explained it to my mother back in Bangladesh,\" he said. \"She just started crying.\"",

        "body": "The FDA this week gave the green light to the first coronavirus test that allows patients to collect nasal samples at home. LabCorp, a North Carolina-based company, had said on Tuesday that it was given an emergency-use authorization for its Pixel home collection kit.\n\nFDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn said Wednesday during an interview with \"CBS This Morning\" that the new at-home test kits can detect the presence of the novel coronavirus and are as effective as tests administered in a doctor's office.\n\nLatest updates on the coronavirus from around the U.S. and the world\n\nThe FDA has said patients will be able to collect nasal samples using the kit's swabs and saline. Once patients collect the specimens, they will mail them to LabCorp lab for testing.\n\nUsers can go online and answer a questionnaire about their symptoms. If the symptoms meet FDA guidelines for the virus, a package with a swab and saline solution will be sent in the mail overnight, he said. The user can mail the sample overnight and get results from LabCorp soon after, Hahn said.\n\nThe agency said the authorization involved was not for tests that are actually processed at home. LabCorp said it would initially make the tests available to health care workers and first responders who are showing symptoms of covid-19. The company plans to make the test available to consumers in the coming weeks.\n\nAllowing people to self-swab reduces the risk of transmitting the virus to others and the need for personal protective equipment, since health care providers are not involved in sample collection, the company said.\n\nWhile the new test brings much promise, Hahn said the estimated time for a vaccine is still March 2021.",

    "The pandemic at sea: How cruise ships exposed thousands on board and helped spread the virus around the world": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "On land, more than 300,000 people worldwide had contracted the deadly coronavirus, and the governor of California had just ordered all 39 million residents to stay at home. But as the Celebrity Eclipse cruise ship steamed north across the Pacific Ocean on March 21, hundreds of passengers crammed together on the ship's pool deck and overlooking gangways.\n\nAs they stood shoulder-to-shoulder and crowded around pool chairs, the captain led the ship in a special salute to health-care workers of the world, an onboard version of the nightly applause adopted by some cities to honor medical professionals battling the novel coronavirus.\n\nFive days later and thousands of miles away in the Atlantic, a group of British passengers aboard another ship, Coral Princess, likewise gathered elbow-to-elbow to cheer the United Kingdom's National Health Service.\n\nThe celebratory mood did not last long. Soon, passengers on both ships were contending with flu-like symptoms.\n\nThere have been 150 coronavirus cases and six deaths reported so far among passengers of the two vessels, which finally docked weeks after the virus was declared a global health crisis, according to a Washington Post tally. Two people died on the Coral Princess before passengers could even come ashore in Miami.\n\nThe Eclipse and Coral Princess were among scores of ships that continued voyages even after early outbreaks on other vessels, carrying thousands of international passengers to far-flung ports and helping seed the virus around the globe, health officials say.\n\nA Post review of cruise line statements, government announcements and media reports found that the coronavirus infected passengers and crew on at least 55 ships that sailed in the waters off nearly every continent, about a fifth of the total global fleet.\n\nThe industry's decision to keep sailing for weeks after the coronavirus was first detected in early February on a cruise ship off the coast of Japan, despite the efforts by top U.S. health officials to curtail voyages, was among a number of decisions that health experts and passengers say contributed to the mounting toll.\n\nAt least 65 people who traveled or worked on the ships have since died, according to The Post tally, although the full scope of deaths is unknown. A similar review by the Miami Herald also identified 65 deaths linked to ships.\n\n\"We here on land, we were seeing all the news, all the ships,\" said Jennifer Paul-Slater, whose brother Gerald, a 72-year-old retiree from Atlanta, died of covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, three days after disembarking the Celebrity Eclipse. \"They could have taken more precautions.\"\n\nPublic health experts say that a number of factors contributed to the rapid spread of the virus around the world, predominantly air travel; an estimated 4.54 billion people flew last year, compared to the 30 million passengers who traveled on cruise ships worldwide. But with hundreds of people dining, swimming and dancing together over a sustained period of time, the ships provide unique environments for disease to spread, they say.\n\n\"People on a large ship, all together, at the same time, all the time -- you couldn't ask for a better incubator for infection,\" Anthony S. Fauci, the nation's top infectious-diseases expert, said in February.\n\nFor their part, U.S. agencies struggled to manage the escalating crisis, initially deferring to the industry's own plan to manage the pandemic. Until early this month, federal health officials also allowed passengers who left infected ships but appeared healthy to board commercial airlines home.\n\nEven as the virus exploded into a global story, cruise officials failed to immediately recognize flu-like outbreaks as possible signs of the coronavirus, passengers said. In many instances, they did not immediately isolate passengers in their cabins when sickness broke out. In some cases, such as on the Celebrity Eclipse and the Coral Princess, those aboard said they were reassured by company officials there was no coronavirus infection on their ships -- even as some travelers were wracked with fevers and coughs.\n\n[Cruise ships kept sailing as coronavirus spread. Travelers and health experts question why.]\n\nDavid Nystrom, 75, said he spent the last four days of the Eclipse voyage with his wife, Susan, in the medical clinic, wiping her brow and watching the ship's crew administer her oxygen.\n\nFrom her bedside, the Boca Raton, Fla., resident said he heard regular announcements from the ship's captain, assuring passengers that the Eclipse was a \"healthy ship\" with no coronavirus on board.\n\n\"If they honestly thought that all these people who were getting sick had colds and bronchitis and pneumonia, I don't know what to say,\" Nystrom said.\n\nOfficials with the cruise industry said they took extraordinary efforts to limit outbreaks of the new virus on ships and get tens of thousands of passengers and crew home safely as the pandemic spread, going beyond measures adopted by other industries.\n\nBari Golin-Blaugrund, a spokeswoman for Cruise Lines International Association, said in a statement that there is \"no conclusive evidence as yet\" that cruise ships were responsible for bringing the coronavirus to specific destinations, such as the Caribbean. She said that the number of cases linked to ships is a \"tiny fraction\" of the global total.\n\n\"Everybody, including cruise lines, had to make difficult decisions based on the information that was available at the time, which was admittedly limited given the fact that the world was dealing with a brand new virus,\" she said. \"Still, cruise lines took immediate and aggressive action in response to this crisis.\"\n\nCarnival Corp., the world's largest cruise company and the parent company of Princess Cruises, noted that federal health officials initially issued limited warnings about the risks of cruises and that the company voluntarily paused new voyages in mid-March.\n\nOfficials with Royal Caribbean Cruises, parent company of Eclipse operator Celebrity Cruises, said the ship did not have an unusual number of passengers with flu-like symptoms, and the crew did not believe there was an outbreak on board.\n\nDespite high-profile outbreaks on several ships, industry leaders have insisted cruise ships are not more susceptible to the coronavirus than other places.\n\nArnold Donald, the chief executive of Carnival, said in an interview on \"Axios on HBO\" in mid-March that ships provided a \"less risky environment\" than being on shore and compared ships to Central Park, saying there is \"a lot of natural social distancing.\"\n\nHe insisted that cruise ships are not to blame for spreading the coronavirus.\n\n\"The illnesses aren't created by the ship, they come from people coming from communities,\" he told reporters April 16, noting that the \"vast majority\" of ships around the world remained coronavirus-free.\n\nBut top U.S. health officials said there is evidence that cruise ships have been a factor in the spread of the coronavirus, both aboard ships and through their travel.\n\n[CDC extends no-sail order for cruise ships in new directive slamming industry]\n\nA no-sail order extended for at least 100 days this month by Robert Redfield, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, found \"cruise-ship travel exacerbates the global spread of covid-19'' and \"has not been controlled sufficiently by the cruise ship industry or individual state or local health authorities.\"\n\nOne of the world's first indications of the wild infectiousness of the coronavirus came in February, when it whipped through the Diamond Princess, a 2,666-passenger ship docked at a port in Japan.\n\nA study published in March by the CDC found that the coronavirus was brought aboard by a passenger but quickly jumped to crew, including those responsible for preparing food, and spread quickly among ship workers from there.\n\nMore than 700 passengers and crew members ultimately tested positive and 13 died. Some Americans tested positive for the coronavirus only after they were aboard buses headed to government-chartered airplanes to be flown back to the United States.\n\nJames Lawler, an infectious disease expert at the University of Nebraska Medical Center who traveled to Japan to help evacuate Americans, said the Diamond Princess demonstrated the difficulty of attempting to discern sick from healthy people in a closed environment like a cruise ship.\n\n\"You just have to treat everybody like they're infected,\" he said.\n\nIt was a lesson that the cruise industry and government agencies took weeks to absorb.\n\nIn late January, cruise lines started to step up health screenings and deny boarding to people who had recently been in China. Cruise officials assured passengers that they had increased cleanings on ships. More hand sanitizer became available as the crisis went on, passengers said. On some ships, buffet meals became plated affairs.\n\nBut top U.S. health officials did not view the measures as sufficient. On March 8, Fauci warned older people and those with underlying health issues to avoid cruise ships.\n\nThe following day, another coronavirus-stricken cruise ship docked in Oakland, Calif. The Grand Princess, which had left San Francisco on Feb. 21 for a cruise to Hawaii, had idled for days before officials decided to send many of its American passengers to military bases across the country for quarantine.\n\nUltimately, more than 130 people from the ship tested positive, and at least six have died, including five passengers and one crew member, according to authorities and the cruise line.\n\nHealth experts noted that the ships' tight quarters, their communal eating and entertainment and older passenger demographics made them especially vulnerable.\n\n\"This is not to point blame,\" said Marty Cetron, director of the CDC's Division of Global Migration and Quarantine, in an interview earlier this month. \"But we have to be honest about the science and the evidence.\"\n\nHe said widespread testing of passengers on the Diamond Princess and the Grand Princess showed that the \"attack rate\" of the coronavirus on board was especially high.\n\n\"We don't see those kinds of attack rates in other settings -- even in household settings,\" he said. \"Even in cities experiencing outbreaks, this is pretty dramatic.\"\n\nGrand Princess travelers -- who had been locked in their rooms, then held on military bases and confined to their homes -- were stunned to watch people continue to board ships amid their saga.\n\n\"I'm shocked that they were still cruising out there,\" said Jackie Eilers, a 72-year-old retiree in Castle Rock, Colo., who tested positive but had only mild symptoms.\n\nTensions were running high as top officials from the Jamaican government squared off against top cruise executives in Florida for an emergency summit on March 6.\n\nThe coronavirus was spreading, and Caribbean countries worried about their citizens' exposure began to impose new rules on ships and limit access to their ports.\n\nWhen the Dominican Republic turned away a ship after reports of passengers with flu-like symptoms in late February, the ship's operator, U.K.-based Fred. Olsen Cruise Lines, issued a statement calling the government's move an \"overreaction.\"\n\nJamaica barred port entry Feb. 27 to people traveling from areas with known covid-19 outbreaks, such as Italy, and the following day denied entry to all Italian passengers who arrived on the Costa Luminosa ship. A few days later, officials put out interim guidelines that also required ships to document illness on board and conduct temperature checks.\n\nThe cruise industry expressed concern about the new rules, which upended scheduled stops for its vacationing guests, according to one Jamaican official involved in the negotiations with the cruise lines, who was not authorized to talk to the media and spoke on the condition of anonymity.\n\n\"I think cruise lines in general were challenging the whole process of the elevated protocols that were being forwarded by all destinations,\" Edmund Bartlett, Jamaica's minister of tourism, told The Post.\n\nRoger Frizzell, chief communications officer at Carnival, which owns the operator of the Costa Luminosa, said the company was \"looking for additional understanding and clarity tied to the new process, so we could plan and make decisions for our ships, guests and crew.\"\n\nJamaican officials agreed to travel to Florida -- the industry's home turf -- for negotiations. There, they met with several Carnival executives at the company's headquarters in Miami, where the walls are lined with glass cases filled with intricate models of the cruise operator's fleet. Later, the Jamaicans visited the Fort Lauderdale headquarters of MSC, another cruise line with a ship that had difficulty disembarking in Jamaica because a crew member had been diagnosed with the flu at the time. (The crew member later tested negative for the coronavirus.)\n\n\"There was clearly a view we were being too hard with our requirements. We felt that the public health interests at the time trumped the interest of the cruise lines,\" Christopher Tufton, Jamaica's minister of health and wellness, said of the meetings, which he described as \"difficult.\"\n\nFrizzell described the meeting with Jamaican officials as \"respectful, in the spirit of finding a mutually beneficial solution.\" MSC Cruises said in a statement that it was \"a productive meeting between two long-term partners,\" adding that it never raised concerns about Jamaica's guidelines and had only requested the rules be clearly defined and that the cruise lines be given advance notice of new requirements.\n\nThe standoff threatened one of the region's biggest economic drivers. Cruise companies employ thousands of people on Caribbean islands and deliver an estimated $2.5 billion in tourism dollars, according to industry estimates.\n\nTwo days after the Florida meetings, Jamaican authorities announced that after \"rigorous\" discussions, the cruise lines had accepted the country's health protocols, including the submission of medical logs for review and the quarantining on board of anyone with symptoms who had visited a country with covid-19.\n\nThe announcement made no mention of barring visitors who had been in a country with a known coronavirus outbreak during the previous two weeks. But Jamaican officials told The Post that policy remained in place. Cruise vessels continued to visit Jamaica after the meeting.\n\nThe clout of the industry was also apparent in the United States, where Carnival chairman Micky Arison is a personal friend of President Trump.\n\n[Coronavirus pandemic tests clout of cruise industry and its long-standing ties to Trump]\n\nThe major cruise lines have avoided federal income taxes and labor laws by incorporating overseas and flagging their ships in other countries. Even so, Trump has bemoaned the pandemic's effect on the industry.\n\nBy early March, several top health officials and members of the administration's coronavirus task force wanted to impose a temporary ban on Americans going on cruise ships, as The Post previously reported. They included Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Administrator Seema Verma and Surgeon General Jerome Adams.\n\nBehind the scenes, the industry scrambled to head off a no-sail order.\n\nThe day after meeting with the Jamaican officials, top cruise line executives huddled in Fort Lauderdale with Vice President Pence, the head of the White House coronavirus task force, arguing cruise lines could voluntarily contain the outbreak.\n\nOn March 10, the industry submitted a plan to the White House that proposed measures including stepped-up health screenings, monitoring of passengers and requiring a doctor's note for passengers older than 70. At the time, Adam Goldstein, global chair of the Cruise Lines International Association, told The Post that it was \"a very practical, actionable plan that makes a difference.\"\n\nDays later, under pressure from the administration, the industry abruptly went further, voluntarily suspending new voyages to and from the United States for a month.\n\nIt still wasn't enough.\n\nOn March 14, the CDC issued a no-sail order for 30 days -- and noted that there were already signs of covid-19 clusters associated with cruise ships, including in communities far from the water.\n\nIn Iowa, state health officials found that the state's first 16 confirmed coronavirus cases were all part of a group that had recently returned from a cruise on the Nile River in Egypt. Pockets of cases were linked to the same cruise voyage in Houston and Maryland.\n\nThe March CDC study found that cruise ship-linked cases accounted for 17 percent of all known cases in the United States between the key early weeks of the spread from Feb. 3 to March 13. Those cases included passengers returning from the Diamond Princess, the site of one of the biggest outbreaks in the world in mid-February.\n\nThe biggest driver of the coronavirus cases in Australia has been an outbreak on the Ruby Princess cruise ship, which docked in Sydney on March 19. Authorities have opened a criminal investigation into the ship, which has been linked to 21 deaths and more than 600 positive cases.\n\n['People just didn't care': How the Ruby Princess cruise ship became a deathtrap]\n\nAnd in France, authorities have grappled with a massive outbreak on a ship that had not yet carried any passengers.\n\nThere, the brand new Celebrity Apex -- which boasted more than two dozen restaurants, bars and lounges and a venue towering 13 stories above sea level -- had been preparing for its first sail, a four-night preview cruise scheduled to leave April 1.\n\nBy early March, 1,400 crew members were living on board the ship, preparing to welcome its first guests. A lawsuit filed by a crew member alleges that contractors continued to board the vessel, and Celebrity conducted crew drills even after signs of the coronavirus began to appear.\n\nSo far, 284 crew members have tested positive, according to French health authorities.\n\nRob Zeiger, global chief communications officer for Royal Caribbean Cruises, which owns Celebrity, said that the ship followed guidance from the French government and that in an effort to avoid the coronavirus, crew had been restricted from leaving the ship and their interactions with contractors were limited.\n\nAlong with airplanes, cruise ships also played a role in the spread of the virus in the Caribbean, a region with small island populations and a fragile health-care system. While air travelers brought the first cases to islands such as St. Lucia and Cuba, cruise passengers were the first confirmed coronavirus patients in places such as the Cayman Islands and Puerto Rico, according to local health officials.\n\nA Post analysis found that five ships -- the Costa Favolosa, Costa Magica, Costa Luminosa, MS Braemar and MSC Meraviglia -- made 18 stops in the Caribbean between Feb. 29 and March 11 while carrying someone who later tested positive for coronavirus.\n\nDozens of passengers who disembarked in their native countries in the region have since tested positive. Among former passengers from the Costa Favolosa, there have been at least 52 covid-19 cases and one death in Trinidad and Tobago, 13 cases in the Dominican Republic and two cases in the French territory of Martinique, according to local health officials.\n\n\"We knew there was an epidemic with international potential,\" said Ted Cohen, an epidemiologist at Yale School of Public Health who examined data gathered by The Post, adding: \"It was irresponsible for the industry to not be proactive in how to limit these activities in times of global crisis.\"\n\nCruise lines said they followed all international regulations to prevent the spread of disease and took voluntary measures such as temperature checks and intensive sanitation measures. And they disputed the idea that their ships brought the coronavirus into the region, saying that while Caribbean residents who sailed on their ships have tested positive, there is not proof they contracted the virus on board.\n\n\"We have no evidence of any direct link of contagion between our ships and the territories of our destinations in the Caribbean and there is no scientific or health-related evidence or background to this,\" Costa Cruises, which operates the three Costa ships, said in a statement.\n\nMSC Cruises said it \"has no reason to believe\" that the Meraviglia contributed to any local outbreak, saying it screened the health history of its passengers and has had no known cases on any ships while sailing. After a Canadian passenger who had traveled on that ship tested positive after returning home, the ship isolated seven crew members who had contact with him, the company said.\n\nFred. Olsen Cruise Lines, which operates the MS Braemar, said that once it learned that two passengers from a previous Caribbean cruise had been diagnosed with covid-19, it arranged to test those currently on board who had flu-like symptoms. When six people tested positive, it barred passengers from disembarking until the ship ended its journey in Cuba.\n\nThe emergency medical treatment of passengers placed a significant burden on the region's health-care infrastructure.\n\nMuch of a hospital in the Cayman Islands was shuttered for two weeks after a 68-year-old Italian man who suffered a stroke was evacuated from the Costa Luminosa ship on Feb. 29 and later tested positive for the coronavirus.\n\nMore than 40 health-care workers who came into contact with the man and their families were quarantined, and the nation's limited testing capabilities were used to test nurses and other patients in the hospital, according to a spokesperson for Health City Cayman Islands, where the passenger was treated. The hospital reported six positive cases connected to the passenger, including four health-care workers.\n\nOn the Costa Luminosa's next sail around the Caribbean, the ship dropped off an Italian couple in Puerto Rico on March 8 after the woman was experiencing flu-like symptoms.\n\nCarmen Cruz, who owns the ambulance company that transported her to a hospital, said the dispatcher told local medical personnel that the woman possibly had pneumonia -- but that covid-19 was not suspected.\n\n\"As soon as they described the symptoms, we said, 'This is covid-19,' \" Cruz said. \"They described it saying 'No, that this was pneumonia, and she had a history of respiratory issues.' \" At the time, Puerto Rico had no other confirmed cases of the illness.\n\nThe woman and her husband tested positive for the coronavirus on March 13. She died eight days later.\n\n\"The cruise line needed to have been more direct and transparent with us because it could put our island in danger,\" said Cruz, noting that the woman's symptoms were clearly consistent with the coronavirus. \"A rooster could not sing more loudly.\"\n\nA representative of the dispatcher said that the company facilitates communications between a ship's medical staff and the local hospital, but that those parties discuss the particulars of a medical case.\n\nCosta Cruises disputed the idea that ship officials had dismissed the possibility of the virus, saying that before the sick woman disembarked, the ship's doctor requested that she be tested for the coronavirus in Puerto Rico, even though the hospital said it was not likely a covid-19 case, according to the company.\n\n\"Costa Cruises' main concern has always been and remains to safeguard the health and safety of our guests, our crew members and the communities in the destinations we visit,\" the company said.\n\nWhile the woman was still in the hospital, Luminosa officials isolated those who were in close contact with her, and then took further measures when it got the results of her test, quarantining all guests and performing daily temperature checks, according to the company.\n\nStill, signs of sickness spread as the ship traveled across the Atlantic and into the Mediterranean, where it struggled for days to find a port that would accept its passengers.\n\nFinally, 350 Americans and Canadians disembarked March 19 in Marseille, France. The group was crowded together on buses and then an airplane to Atlanta, where the CDC allowed many to enter the terminal and then board commercial airliners home.\n\nIt would take more than two more weeks for the CDC to change its guidelines about disembarking passengers from stricken ships, barring even those without symptoms from further commercial travel.\n\n[Passengers started leaving the Coral Princess. Then the CDC changed its stance on coronavirus-stricken cruises.]\n\nCetron, the CDC's head of global migration and quarantine, said the agency shifted courses after fully realizing the implications of asymptomatic transmission.\n\n\"Not only is this virus fast moving in terms of its spread and transmission and stealth, it's also teaching us every day something new,\" he said.\n\nAs of April 20, at least 145 crew members and 48 passengers who were aboard the Luminosa have tested positive for the coronavirus, according to Costa Cruises. Former passengers who have started a Facebook page to track their experiences have reported accounts of at least seven deaths.\n\nAmong them was Tom Sheehan, 68, who flew from Atlanta to his home in Sarasota, Fla., before being hospitalized the next day. He died March 28, his four adult children barred from his hospital room, able to say goodbye only via video.\n\n\"My dad had said multiple times if the cruise had let them know there was a possible covid case, they would have just gotten off in Puerto Rico and flown home,\" said Sheehan's son, Kevin. \"They were more worried about keeping people on the boat and spending money.\"\n\nCosta Cruises said it communicated information to passengers as soon as it received it and noted that it voluntarily paused new cruises on March 13, the same day it said it received notice that the first passenger had tested positive. At that point, the ship struggled to find a port. The company said it expressed \"its deepest grief and condolences to the families of those guests who have lost their lives due to this invisible enemy.\"\n\nAboard the Celebrity Eclipse and Coral Princess, the vicious virus seemed a world away as the ships headed in early March toward Cape Horn at the tip of South America -- a bucket list trip for many cruisers.\n\n\"There were whales and penguins and glaciers. You name it, we saw it,\" said Tom Sachs, 66, a retired federal worker from Franconia, Va., who was on the Eclipse.\n\nThen countries began barring ships from docking. Off the west coast of South America, Chile prohibited the Eclipse from scheduled stops there. On the other side of the continent, Uruguay and Argentina did the same to the Coral Princess.\n\nThere was confusion on both ships, where passengers initially believed their days at sea had kept them walled-off from the coronavirus.\n\nOn the Coral Princess, passengers received a letter March 20 from the senior physician assuring them that the risk of the ship's exposure was \"near negligible.\"\n\n\"Rest assured that, relatively speaking, Coral Princess is probably one of the safest places in the world to be at this time,\" read the letter obtained by The Post.\n\nGill Morgan, 66, who works with the National Health Service in the United Kingdom, said that Coral Princess passengers continued to enjoy music, films on the deck and guest-organized tai chi classes and line dancing sessions.\n\nBy late March, both ships were headed toward the United States, where they could finally disembark -- California for the Eclipse and Florida for the Coral Princess.\n\nOn March 21, Eclipse passenger Vivian Miller, 77, said the captain gathered people around the pool to celebrate health-care workers. \"We cheered and applauded,\" she said.\n\nDays later, hundreds partied again at a special ceremony to mark the ship's passage of the equator. The ship's theater hosted daily events. \"They actually made more activities, to keep people occupied,\" Miller said.\n\nOn the Coral Princess, the March 26 celebration of health-care workers drew a large crowd.\n\n\"The ship is virus free, so we can move around as normal with no social isolation,\" British passenger Sara Roberts, who posted a video of the applause, told The Post via email on March 27.\n\nBut soon, people were getting sick on both ships. Several passengers aboard the Celebrity Eclipse, including Miller, said in interviews that they sought assistance from the onboard medical clinic for flu-like symptoms starting early in the cruise, only to be told they likely had colds or the flu.\n\nOn the Coral Princess, Long Island residents Peter and Grace Nahm went to the medical center March 28 after their health had been deteriorating. After a nose swab, both were diagnosed with the flu, said their son, Paul Nahm, 39, of Fort Lee, N.J.\n\nMeanwhile, Coral Princess passengers continued to sunbathe, swim and socialize in what was \"glorious weather,\" Roberts recalled later.\n\nAs the ship sailed toward Barbados on March 30, where a stop the next day was planned, the cruise line released a public statement at 6 p.m. Eastern that said in part: \"There remains no known risk of COVID-19 onboard.\"\n\nNearly 19 hours later, there was suddenly a different message. After a \"higher-than-normal number of people presenting influenza-like symptoms,\" all passengers were being confined to their rooms, the company announced March 31.\n\nBy then, those aboard had been freely socializing for 26 days.\n\nThat night, the Coral Princess stopped in Barbados, where a sick passenger was taken off the ship. There, the company also collected coronavirus test samples and sent them to the island.\n\nTwo days later, on April 2, ship officials said 13 people had been tested; 12 were positive for the coronavirus. That number included Peter Nahm, his son said.\n\nBy the time the ship finally reached land in Miami on April 4, two people aboard had died. Six were brought to hospitals in Florida the day the ship arrived, and a dozen more the next day, according to county officials.\n\nThe Nahms were hospitalized a day apart; both have tested positive for the coronavirus, Paul Nahm said. His mother has since recovered and returned to New York on a medical evacuation flight; his father remained in a Miami-area hospital.\n\nPaul Nahm said the trip should have been canceled before it started or should have tried to find a port to disembark passengers earlier. And, he argued, the cruise line should have better managed the situation once anyone was aware of illness.\n\n\"Once people are sick on board and there's cases of flu-like symptoms, they should have immediately locked down,\" he said.\n\nPrincess Cruises spokeswoman Alivia Owyoung Ender did not address specific questions about how the Coral Princess handled the situation, but said in an email that the company has followed the guidance and direction of health authorities, including the CDC.\n\n\"During this entire unprecedented time, Princess has done everything possible to be open, honest and transparent, and to provide for the health and well-being of our guests and crew in the most earnest and compassionate way possible,\" she said.\n\nZeiger of Royal Caribbean Cruises said the Eclipse did not experience an abnormally high number of people with flu-like symptoms for a ship carrying more than 3,000 passengers, adding that the crew did not believe the coronavirus was aboard. He noted that the ship ultimately spent five days off the coast of Chile while trying to dock and another 10 days sailing to San Diego, keeping it out at sea longer than the virus's typical incubation period.\n\nStill, he said of the cruise industry's experience with the coronavirus, \"You don't come through something like this without learning some lessons. You better be more humble than that.\"\n\nNow in San Diego, David Nystrom said he believes the Eclipse's medical staff genuinely did not believe his wife had covid-19 -- they treated her for days without masks, potentially endangering their own health, he noted.\n\nShe was the first off the ship when it docked March 30, transported from the Eclipse to a hospital by ambulance, where Nystrom said she tested positive for the coronavirus within 10 hours and then spent 22 days on a ventilator before beginning a slow recovery.\n\n\"What happened was terrible and my life might be changed forever,\" he said in an email. \"But since coronavirus was still new when we got on the cruise on March 1, did the medical staff just not realize what was happening?\"\n\nEarlier this month, after more than 14 days in quarantine, David Nystrom developed a dry cough. His test result: positive.",

        "authors": [],
        "body": "The coronavirus's U.S. death toll surged past 50,000 on Friday, marking another grim milestone in the pandemic that has upended life around the globe. Three months after the nation's first confirmed case, the highly contagious virus has killed at an alarming rate: Just 10 days ago, the number of recorded deaths stood at 25,000.\n\nExperts have warned that the number of reported fatalities likely underestimates the true toll of covid-19, the disease caused by the virus. Amid a national debate over how to count the dead, methods have varied widely from state to state. And the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention initially included only those who tested positive for the virus, even with strict limitations on testing.\n\nThe Washington Post has been analyzing data from state health agencies to track every known death in the country. Of the 50,024 fatalities confirmed as of Friday, 21,283 -- or about 42 percent -- occurred in New York. But while the state has started to see a decrease in its confirmed daily death counts, other parts of the country are beginning to see a surge.\n\nFaces of the dead: Victims of coronavirus and their stories\n\nEven as governors in multiple states eased stay-at-home orders and took other steps to restart their stymied economies, the disease's rapid spread in both urban and rural areas had led to more than 28,000 deaths outside the epicenter of New York. The second-highest death toll was being carried by New Jersey, followed by Michigan, Massachusetts and Illinois.\n\nEvery state has recorded fatalities, with clusters of cases appearing in nursing homes, correctional facilities and other settings flung across the nation.\n\nThe novel coronavirus emerged in late December as a scattering of mysterious illnesses in Wuhan, China, with symptoms ranging from coughing and fevers to cases of pneumonia, kidney failure and fluid buildup in the lungs.\n\nSign up for our Coronavirus Updates newsletter to track the outbreak. All stories linked in the newsletter are free to access.\n\nIt soon traveled the globe, triggering school closures, lockdowns and unprecedented economic disruption. Worldwide as of Friday, more than 2.7 million people had been sickened with the virus and more than 193,000 had died, according to tracking by Johns Hopkins University.\n\nIn the U.S., the first fatalities were believed to have occurred in late February in Kirkland, Wash., a Seattle suburb that became the nation's early hot spot. But this week, California health officials said that at least two people who died in early and mid-February were discovered to have contracted the coronavirus -- a revelation that suggests it may have spread undetected weeks earlier than once thought.\n\nMany victims of the virus are not known publicly: health officials in some states release a gender and age range; others release no demographic information, leaving such reporting up to counties.",

    "U.S. passes 60,000 dead as hopes rise for a promising drug therapy": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "Trump welcomed the promising early signs that an experimental antiviral drug, remdesivir, can be effective in speeding the recovery time for covid-19 patients.\n\n\"The data shows that remdesivir has a clear-cut, significant, positive effect in diminishing the time to recovery,\" Anthony S. Fauci said alongside Trump at the White House on Wednesday. \"That is really quite important.\"\n\nThe National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, which Fauci leads, is overseeing a study of more than 1,000 patients in the United States and around the world.\n\nThe study showed that patients treated with remdesivir were ready to be discharged from the hospital within 11 days, on average, compared with an average of 15 days for patients who had received a placebo.\n\nWhile not a \"knockout,\" Fauci said that shows an important and promising avenue for further study. \"What it has proven is that a drug can block this virus,\" Fauci said.\n\nSign up for our Coronavirus Updates newsletter to track the outbreak. All stories linked in the newsletter are free to access.\n\nRemdesivir can have serious side effects, according to previous trial results, including loss of kidney function and declining blood pressure. Those symptoms are caused by severe cases of covid-19, as well, making it difficult to determine which problems were caused by the drug and which by the illness.\n\nThe NIAID study is the most rigorous test to date of the potential treatment because it is a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, the gold standard for seeing whether a drug is safe and effective.\n\nThe study showed only a marginal benefit in the rate of death. Fauci said that a death rate of 8 percent for those taking the drug versus 11 percent for those taking the placebo is not statistically significant but that the results will undergo further analysis.\n\nThe drug must be given intravenously over five to 10 days, and the NIAID trial results apply only to hospitalized patients. Remdesivir is not intended for use in the majority of patients, estimated to be 80 percent or more, who are infected with the novel coronavirus but do not require hospitalization.\n\n'Second-week crash' is time of peril for some covid-19 patients\n\nThe U.S. death toll eclipses the number of American service members killed in the Vietnam War. The comparison, although imperfect, indicates the scope of the outbreak since the first death in February in the United States and its territories, according to figures compiled by The Washington Post.\n\nTrump had cited the 60,000 ceiling earlier this month, before saying Monday that the death toll could go higher, perhaps to 70,000. He also once used the figure 75,000. The eventual total appears likely to surpass either estimate.\n\n\"If we didn't do what we did, you would have had a million people die, maybe more, maybe 2 million people die,\" Trump said Wednesday. \"And if you think that we'd be at 65, or 70, or 60, or whatever the final level would be,\" Trump said, \".\u2009.\u2009. we've done it right.\"\n\nAs antsy Americans show growing signs of \"quarantine fatigue\" and officials face pressure to ease coronavirus restrictions, factories, malls and state governments in many parts of the country are taking steps toward reopening.\n\nBut Fauci also said Wednesday that a second wave of infections is \"inevitable\" in the United States, which has recorded more than 1 million confirmed cases -- nearly one-third of the global total. Fauci also warned that \"we could be in for a bad fall and a bad winter\" if the right countermeasures aren't put in place.\n\n\"It's not going to disappear from the planet,\" the nation's top epidemiologist said in a Tuesday interview with the Economic Club of Washington, D.C. \" ... In my mind, it's inevitable that we will have a return of the virus or maybe it never even went away,\" he said.\n\nMeanwhile, the economic toll of the virus became clearer.\n\nThe U.S. economy shrank by 4.8 percent from January through March as it saw the worst slowdown in growth since the Great Recession.\n\nTrump did not directly comment on that glum first-quarter result, but he gave a cheerful prediction of a quick rebound.\n\n\"I think next year is going to be an incredible year for our economy,\" he said at a White House event later Wednesday. \"I think the fourth quarter is going to be really, really good.\"\n\nThe Dow Jones industrial average closed up 532 points, about 2.2 percent, to 24,634 after positive reports about the remdesivir treatment. Stocks are on pace for a strong month.\n\nFederal Reserve pledges support after U.S. economy shrinks 4.8% in first quarter\n\nThe tension between scientific recommendations of caution in the lifting of restrictions and the economic and political imperatives to get people back to work were on display at the White House event, which took place with some social distancing measures but without the use of face masks.\n\nTrump invited business leaders from Hilton, Toyota, Waffle House and others to present their plans for resuming regular business. He announced he will travel to Arizona next week for a virus-related economic event and said he is looking forward to political rallies ahead of the November election.\n\n\"I think there's a tremendous pent-up demand,\" Trump said, rebutting polling that suggests many Americans are wary of resuming practices such as eating in restaurants, staying in hotels and attending sports events.\n\n\"I think we want to go back to where it was. When I look at a baseball game, I want to see people right next to each other,\" Trump said.\n\n\"I don't want to see four seats in between every person, so the stadium becomes 25 percent of its original size. No, I want to see the NFL with a packed house. I don't want to see NFL with three seats in between people. No, I don't want to.\"\n\nThe White House announced Wednesday that Trump will participate in a live town hall question-and-answer session on Sunday evening, broadcast by Fox News from the grounds of the Lincoln Memorial. The president will \"answer your questions about safely returning to work,\" press secretary Kayleigh McEnany tweeted.\n\nWhite House senior adviser and presidential son-in-law Jared Kushner derided the \"eternal lockdown crowd\" as he claimed during a morning television interview that \"extraordinary\" strides have been made in developing coronavirus testing capacity.\n\nAppearing on Fox News's \"Fox & Friends,\" Kushner offered an optimistic scenario about the expansion of testing, which health experts say remains among the greatest challenges in reopening the economy safely in the coming months.\n\n\"The goal here is to get people back to work,\" he added. \"The eternal lockdown crowd can make jokes on late-night television, but the reality is that the data is on our side, and President Trump has created a pathway to safely open up our country and make sure that we can get our economy going and get Americans back to a place where it will be even stronger than it was.\"\n\nThat prompted a sharp rejoinder from Rep. Bobby L. Rush (D-Ill.).\n\n\"There is no 'eternal lockdown crowd,'\u2009\" Rush wrote on Twitter. \"There are people who put human health over the health of our economy, and then there are people like you.\"\n\nNearly half of the world's workforce is at risk of losing their incomes as the pandemic continues to disrupt lives and economies around the globe, a U.N. agency warned.\n\nThe Geneva-based International Labour Organization (ILO) estimated that workers in informal economies account for nearly half of the global workforce, or 1.6 billion people. Those people, already among the most vulnerable in labor markets, now \"stand in immediate danger of having their livelihoods destroyed,\" the ILO said in a statement.\n\n\"The first month of the crisis is estimated to have resulted in a drop of 60 per cent in the income of informal workers globally,\" according to the ILO. \"This translates into a drop of 81 per cent in Africa and the Americas, 21.6 per cent in Asia and the Pacific, and 70 per cent in Europe and Central Asia.\"\n\nThe labor rights organization estimated 68 percent of workers live in countries with recommended or required workplace closures, down from 81 percent two weeks ago. The ILO attributed the decline primarily to China's lifting of much of its lockdown.\n\nSignaling confidence that it has contained the virus, China scheduled its big legislative meetings for late May. The \"Two Sessions\" meetings had been postponed at the height of the outbreak.\n\nBut Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe warned that holding the Tokyo Olympics in 2021 will be \"impossible\" if the pandemic is not contained. Originally slated to take place this summer, the Olympic Games have been postponed until July 2021. A growing chorus of Japanese scientists have warned that even a one-year delay might not be enough, and Abe on Wednesday became the most prominent voice to echo those concerns.\n\nSeveral top government officials have tested positive for the novel coronavirus in the West African nation of Guinea-Bissau, including Prime Minister Nuno Gomes Nabiam, the Health Ministry confirmed Wednesday.\n\nInterior Minister Botche Cande and two other cabinet members are among those who also tested positive. Health Minister Antonio Deuna said they are in quarantine at a hotel in Bissau, the capital, Reuters reported. The small country, home to about 1.8 million people, has confirmed at least 73 cases of the virus, according to a Johns Hopkins University database. The first two cases were diagnosed in March.\n\nIndia will permit workers, students and tourists stuck across the country to return to their homes after five weeks of nationwide lockdown, although national restrictions remain in place, the government said Wednesday.\n\nThe change represents a significant shift in India's restrictions on movement. On March 25, the government shut down all long-distance transportation -- including flights, trains and buses -- in this country of more than 1.3 billion to combat the spread of the coronavirus.\n\nThe abrupt lockdown stranded millions of laborers in Indian cities without jobs and with no means to leave. In desperation, thousands set off on foot.\n\nThe country has roughly 32,000 confirmed coronavirus cases and about 1,000 deaths.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) warned Wednesday of a potential \"second pandemic\" -- of lawsuits -- if his idea of shielding businesses from liability is not included in the next round of legislation crafted by Congress in response to the coronavirus outbreak.\n\nMcConnell's description came during a radio interview as he and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) continued to jockey over the scope of the legislation. Democrats are insisting that it include hundreds of billions of dollars in additional aid to states and localities to make up for lost tax revenue during the pandemic.\n\n\"Well, look, there's no question that all governors regardless of party would like to have more money, and I'm open to discussing that,\" McConnell said on Fox News Radio's \"The Brian Kilmeade Show.\" \"But what [Pelosi is] ignoring is the second pandemic, which is going to be lawsuits against doctors, nurses, hospitals and brave business people.\"\n\nMcConnell suggested this week that any legislation that provides state and local aid should also include some sort of \"liability shield\" that would prevent businesses from being sued by customers and perhaps employees who contract the coronavirus, an idea that has been under consideration at the White House.\n\n\"I mean, this is the best way to protect the brave people who have been taking care of covid-19 patients, and it will take a good deal of bravery to open up their business,\" McConnell said.\n\nJohn Wagner, Tony Romm, Mark Berman, Siobh\u00e1n O'Grady, Miriam Berger and Lateshia Beachum in Washington, and Joanna Slater and Niha Masih in New Delhi, contributed to this report.",

It said all necessary measures have been taken and the patient was transferred to the government-run Rafik Hariri Hospital in Beirut, adding that the agency will cover the entire cost of her treatment.\n\nLebanon is home to more than 1 million Syrian refugees and other Syrians who are residents. It is also host to tens of thousands of Palestinian refugees and their descendants, most of them living in squalid camps with no access to public services, with limited employment opportunities and no rights to ownership.\n\nThe tiny country has recorded 21 deaths from among 677 confirmed cases of COVID-19, the illness caused by the virus. They include one Palestinian who lives outside a camp, and three Syrian residents who have tested positive. Wednesday's announcement was the first involving a refugee living inside a camp.\n\nLack of testing has stoked fears among millions of displaced people around the world packed into refugee camps and informal settlements.\n\nMost people who become infected experience mild to moderate symptoms. But the virus can cause severe illness and lead to death, particularly among older people and those with underlying health problems. It is highly contagious and can be spread by those who appear healthy.\n\nUNRWA said it will take a team from the Rafik Hariri hospital to the Wavel camp in the Bekaa's Baalbek region, to carry out tests.\n\n\"The agency is doing everything necessary to provide the required assistance to the patient's family to allow them to isolate themselves with all the arrangements required and to secure the necessary needs,\" the statement said.\n\nHealth Minister Hamad Hassan told reporters that two teams from the ministry headed on Wednesday morning to the Bekaa Valley, one to the Baalbek General Hospital and another to Wavel camp where they will take test samples.\n\nThe Baalbek region is one of the least infected districts in Lebanon, with less than five cases, according to government statistics.\n\nCopyright 2020 The Associated Press.

        "body": "But some are demanding that the state begin the process of re-opening, including the owner of a Roanoke fitness center who was charged with a misdemeanor Sunday after he defied the closing order undertaken against the global pandemic.\n\nThomas Milton, the owner of Titan Fit in Roanoke, plans to keep his gym open, even though he faces up to a year in jail and a fine of up to $2,500 for allegedly violating the governor's executive order.\n\nMilton's lawyer, Greg Phillips, said Milton has followed sanitation and social distancing guidelines that have allowed other businesses to remain open in Virginia. Phillips said that Milton feels strongly that his fitness center should remain open as a place for its members to exercise. He said about a third of the gym's 150 members are first responders, including police and firefighters.\n\n\"Why will the governor trust a cashier at the ABC (state liquor) store or a clerk at Walmart to practice social distancing, but not (Milton) or other gym owners?\" Phillips said.\n\nNortham's order to close non-essential businesses is in effect until May 8, while his stay-at-home order for Virginia residents remains in effect until June 10. That order directs residents to stay home except to meet essential needs such as buying groceries or going to a medical appointment.\n\nVirginia Public Safety Secretary Brian Moran said the low number of citations is a reflection of the public's general willingness to follow guidelines set by health officials to help blunt the outbreak. He said police have used conversation and education to encourage people to adhere to the orders.\n\n\"There is no heavy-handedness. We really seek compliance,\" he said.\n\nJohn Jones, executive director of the Virginia Sheriffs' Association, said his survey showed that many sheriffs were using verbal warnings rather than citations to get people to comply.\n\n\"A lot of folks are calling in to the sheriffs' offices to see what they need to do so they won't violate the orders,\" James said. \"People are genuinely trying to comply. They don't want to have a situation where they get sick or their family gets sick.\"\n\nThe surveys completed on April 10 and April 15 asked law enforcement agencies statewide how many citations they have been issued since Northam's March 23 order closing restaurant dining areas, gyms, hair salons, museums and other non-essential businesses and his March 30 stay-at-home order.\n\nThe police chiefs association said its survey showed just six citations, while the sheriffs association said its survey reported three citations.\n\nChincoteague police cited three people for organizing a party of about 18 people at a closed restaurant and the pastor of a local church where officers observed at least 12 or 13 people gathered. Northam's order bans gatherings of 10 or more people.\n\nThe Pittsylvania County Sheriff's Office cited the operator of a gaming parlor and a woman who hosted a house party of about 35 people the day before Easter, said Sheriff Mike Taylor. In Northampton County, citations were issued to a resident and two guests at a house party attended by at least 20 people.\n\nSome Virginia residents and business owners are urging Northam to begin lifting the restrictions, which have slammed the state's economy.\n\nLast week, several dozen people protested at Virginia's Capitol Square. Another \"ReOpen Virginia\" rally is planned for Wednesday, when the General Assembly is scheduled to hold a one-day session to take up the governor's vetoes and proposed amendments.\n\nFor most people, the new coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up within weeks. For some, especially older adults and those with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness or death.\n\n___\n\nFollow AP coverage of the virus outbreak at https://apnews.com/VirusOutbreak and https://apnews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak.\n\nCopyright 2020 The Associated Press.

        "authors": [],
        "body": "Thursday's report from the U.S. Department of Labor showed more than 74,000 Virginians filed unemployment claims last week. That marks the third straight week totals have dipped since weekly claims reached a record-setting nearly 150,000 in the week ending April 4.\n\nStill, it's far higher than before the crisis. In the month prior to impact from the coronavirus, jobless claims in Virginia averaged around 2,600.\n\nAltogether, in the six weeks since March 15 for which data is available, about 570,000 people have filed for jobless benefits in Virginia. That's about 13% of the 4.46 million people the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates make up the state's workforce.\n\nNationally, more than 3.8 million workers applied for unemployment benefits last week as the U.S. economy slid further into a crisis that is becoming the most devastating since the 1930s. Roughly 30.3 million people have now filed for jobless aid over the past six weeks, more than one in six American workers.\n\nVirginia Gov. Ralph Northam issued an executive order in late March that was later extended closing recreation, entertainment, and personal care businesses and limiting restaurants to offering only takeout and delivery services in order to help slow the spread of the virus.\n\nNortham said Wednesday that he's continuing to look at data on testing, hospitalization and other information before deciding whether to extend that order past May 8, when it is set to expire. He reiterated that he's is open to the idea of opening businesses on a regional basis.\n\n\"We're going to do it as soon as we can, as soon as it can be safely,\" Northam said.\n\nAn executive order directing Virginians to stay home unless they must leave for essential services, remains in effect until June 10.\n\nThe Virginia Department of Health reported over 15,800 cases of COVID-19 as of Thursday, and the death toll stood at 552. The number of infections is thought to be far higher because many people have not been tested, and studies suggest people can be infected with the virus without feeling sick.\n\nMillions of people around the world have been infected.\n\nFor mot people, the coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up within weeks. For some, especially older adults and those with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness and death. The majority of people recover.\n\n___\n\nFollow AP coverage of the pandemic at https://apnews.com/VirusOutbreak and https://apnews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak.\n\nCopyright 2020 The Associated Press.

    "With 15 new covid-19 deaths in hard-hit D.C., Bowser urges more testing": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "Ten of the dead were from wards 5, 7 and 8, the poorest and most heavily African American parts of the city, mirroring a national trend where that community has been disproportionately affected. There was a 100-year-old woman and a 98-year-old woman. Nine of the dead were older than 80.\n\nThe District's tally of covid-19 deaths is 127, a per capita rate of 18.6 per 100,000 residents that, according to a Washington Post analysis, is the highest in the region.\n\nBowser (D) is urging older residents to get tested if they feel ill, already have underlying health problems or live in long-term care facilities or group homes. Although tests are in short supply nationally, the District currently has more available than people requesting them.\n\n\"We are concerned about people who have underlying conditions who could possibly not have very good outcomes with this virus, so people who have high blood pressure and asthma and diabetes, and everybody especially who falls in those categories who is over the age of 65,\" the mayor said. \"And that is why you see us asking those people to be very aware of how they feel, to reach out to their providers and to get tested.\"\n\nThe overall tally of known coronavirus infections in the District, Maryland and Virginia climbed to 27,659 on Wednesday, a total that did not include new figures from Virginia, which was delayed in reporting its latest numbers. There were a total of 1,159 known deaths.\n\nSign up for our Coronavirus Updates newsletter to track the outbreak. All stories linked in the newsletter are free to access.\n\nNearly a month into a general shutdown of schools, business and normal life, officials are still watching for signs that the pandemic is slowing down.\n\nOfficials have benchmarks for easing restrictions in the DMV. We're far from meeting them.\n\nThe District's latest numbers underscore the city's typical geographic health disparities, with 29 deaths in Ward 8 in far Southeast Washington and only one death in wealthy, Ward 2, which includes Georgetown, Foggy Bottom and Dupont Circle.\n\nThe District has also had a host of fatalities at institutions serving the vulnerable, including 14 at nursing homes and long-term care facilities, eight homeless residents, eight disabled people, six patients at St. Elizabeths psychiatric hospital and one inmate at the D.C. jail. Some of the dead could fall into multiple categories.\n\nBowser said the city is trying to address the disparities with outreach to Medicaid patients who are older or have underlying conditions that place them at greater risk of infection. D.C. officials are also expanding the criteria for testing to include people without symptoms but who are in high-risk groups and likely to have been exposed.\n\nAnd the District is adding a walk-through, drive-through testing site at the University of the District of Columbia Community College's Bertie Backus campus across from the Fort Totten Metro station in Northeast Washington, officials said Wednesday. The site will be appointment-only and open on Tuesdays and Thursdays.\n\nAbout a dozen newly acquired rapid-testing machines will be used at homeless shelters, corrections facilities and care center starting later this week, officials said.\n\nAnd the city plans to begin antibody testing next month to detect people who have already been exposed and have some level of immunity -- a key factor in knowing how far the virus has spread.\n\nBoth Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan (R) and Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam (D) have announced similar plans to ramp up testing as part of what they say will be a collective decision in the region on when to lift the closures and stay-at-home restrictions that have crippled the local economy.\n\nHogan, Trump spar over test purchases from South Korea\n\nAs part of that goal, a Hampton Roads, Va., hospital system has joined the federal effort to use the blood plasma of people who have recovered from a coronavirus infection to treat other covid-19 patients.\n\nBon Secours, which has several hospitals in Virginia's eastern peninsula and the Richmond area, announced that it is collecting samples from recovered patients that will be sent to the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota, where scientists will extract the plasma and antibodies that developed to fight the virus during the patient's illness.\n\nA single plasma donation has the potential to help as many as four covid-19 patients recover from the disease more rapidly, the hospital system said in a news release\n\nOfficials are under growing pressure to find a way to control the virus and ease restrictions. The frustration some feel about the pandemic was on display again Wednesday in Richmond, where protesters in honking cars and trucks circled the streets around Capitol Square calling for the economy to reopen.\n\nThe demonstration was aimed at Northam and the Virginia General Assembly, which was meeting for its annual veto session with extraordinary social distancing measures in place.\n\nAmong other things, the Senate and House of Delegates were working to pare down the state budget in response to handle the loss of revenue resulting from the pandemic.\n\nKnown coronavirus cases and deaths in the District, Maryland and Virginia\n\nEarlier in the day, two Virginia Republican lawmakers filed a lawsuit on behalf of a group of Gold's Gym franchises seeking to force Northam to allow those businesses to open.\n\nThe lawsuit -- filed in Culpeper County's circuit court by state Sens. William M. Stanley, Jr (Franklin) and Ryan T. McDougle (Hanover) -- argued that Northam did not have the authority to close down fitness clubs under an executive order barring nonessential businesses from operating that is set to expire on May 8.\n\n\"The doors of these health clubs should no longer remain shuttered,\" Stanley said in a statement. \"They ... should be a part of the immediate solution as we move forward in overcoming this virus together.\"\n\nA judge in southwest Virginia earlier this month rejected a lawsuit arguing the order's ban on religious gatherings was discriminatory.\n\nMaryland reported 46 new covid-19 fatalities on Wednesday, bringing its total to 705. Prince George's County, which has the most cases in Maryland, accounted for 14 of the deaths, its highest one-day tally so far. Neighboring Montgomery County reported 10 new fatalities.\n\nPrince George's County executive Angela D. Alsobrooks urged residents to hold steady and be patient -- despite the fact that more than 30,000 local residents who have filed jobless claims since the crisis started. She said there had been 141 deaths in the county as of Wednesday, and that the mortality rate among men has been especially high.\n\n\"I know this is a lot to ask, but we are still in the thick of it,\" Alsobrooks (D) said at a news conference, asking people again to practice social distancing.\n\nErnest Carter, the county health officer, said a peak in cases does not appear likely to happen soon.\n\nArea hospitals are scaling up staff, while the county is helping to set up extra medical tents to accommodate a surge in new patients, he said.\n\nMeeting that demand \"will be a constant challenge,\" Carter said.\n\nRachel Weiner, Rachel Chason and Gregory S. Schneider contributed to this report.\n\nBenchmarks for reopening the DMV: We're not close to reaching them\n\nMissouri is suing China over the pandemic. It's the latest conservative gambit",

    "With help of robots, Maryland medical school to vastly expand state's testing for coronavirus  --  if swabs can be found": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "They could retool the machinery and significantly increase Maryland's capacity to test people for covid-19 -- testing that will be critical to any plan to eventually \"reopen\" the state.\n\nThe robots can significantly expedite the complex process of analyzing samples taken from Marylanders who get a prescription to be swabbed. The machines can search for the virus' genetic material in many samples at once.\n\n\"We knew we could do a lot of tests very quickly,\" said Jacques Ravel, associate director of the Institute for Genome Sciences at the University of Maryland School of Medicine.\n\nThe state -- which is currently testing about 3,000 people a day -- jumped on the offer. The university lab will begin adding tests in coming weeks that eventually could add roughly 20,000 to the daily total.\n\nBut for all the scientific firepower, there's a hitch. In Maryland and elsewhere, there aren't enough basic cotton swabs to take samples from people's noses and throats. The lack of these supplies may already be limiting the number of tests performed at other labs in Maryland, including one at Johns Hopkins Hospital, and across the country.\n\nSign up for our Coronavirus Updates newsletter to track the outbreak. All stories linked in the newsletter are free to access.\n\nThere are other problems mucking up the works, including lack of other supplies such as the agents used to transport and process samples. More lab capacity is needed, too, and more money to pay for it all.\n\nBut the dearth of swabs is causing states to scramble, and last week led the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to seek an accord with private firms and foundations to produce a \u00adpolyester-based Q-Tip-type swab in bulk.\n\nThis week, Gov. Larry Hogan (R) is expected to begin to outline the steps in his plan to eventually end some of the restrictions he's imposed over the past 5 / weeks to limit the spread of the deadly virus. It is sure to involve stepped-up testing.\n\nHogan has said the state needs to test more than 10,000 people a day for the coronavirus before he can consider lifting restrictions on businesses or gatherings.\n\nThat's more than three times the current rate.\n\nIn live-streamed remarks Friday to the pro-business Economic Club of Washington, Hogan said testing needs to show two weeks of decline in the number of serious cases before restrictions could begin to be lifted. Cases in Maryland were still increasing last week.\n\n\"We slowed the growth,\" Hogan said. \"We blunted the curve but we are unfortunately going up.\u00ad .\u2009.\u2009. We believe we're getting close to the peak in the next week or so.\"\n\nHogan said officials would be specifically watching the number of deaths and hospitalizations to know whether the state is getting the virus under control. They want to see 14 days of lower deaths and hospitalizations -- not necessarily overall cases, which will rise as testing increases.\n\nOnce those numbers decrease, the lifting of restrictions would need to be done gradually.\n\n\"None of the governors believe you can just flip a switch,\" Hogan said. \"I think we'll gradually start easing things off when we believe it's safe to do so.\"\n\nState Sen. James C. Rosapepe, a Democrat who represents Anne Arundel and Prince George's counties, said the Hogan administration is right to try to ramp up testing and tracing capabilities quickly.\n\n\"We're likely to have vaccines in 2021,\" Rosapepe said. \"That's a long way away. We don't want to wait. The faster we can scale up testing, tracing and quarantining, the faster we can get Marylanders back to work. What nobody knows is: How fast can we do it?\"\n\nRosapepe has been researching the cost of such a testing and tracing operation and believes the state can put in place a robust tracing program tracking down the people who have been in contact with an infected person -- relatively cheaply. He worries, however, about whether the costs of widespread testing are affordable without federal funds.\n\n\"I'm very confident we can get to the levels of testing we need,\" Rosapepe said. \"But we really need a massive federal investment to scale up testing if we're going to get Maryland and the country back to work.\"\n\nTo lift restrictions, and keep a handle on new cases after people begin to return to their normal lives, researchers at Johns Hopkins University say there need to be 750,000 tests nationally a day. The nation is now performing about 125,000 to 150,000 a day.\n\nThat means gathering samples when people seek care in hospitals or even doctor's offices, the researchers said in a report released Friday by the Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. Testing will also have to expand to people who don't have symptoms.\n\nMost testing now is being done only on patients with respiratory symptoms such as coughing or trouble breathing and fever, as well as on medical staff members and first responders.\n\nHospitals are collecting most samples, and the diagnostic testing in Maryland is being done by the state health lab, private labs including Quest Diagnostics and LabCorp, plus the University of Maryland Medical Center and other hospitals.\n\nHopkins has been a testing leader with 350 to 650 tests a day. Officials say they could test up to 1,000 a day but are not getting that many samples.\n\n\"We are testing what we receive,\" said Karen Carroll, director of the division of medical microbiology at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. \"We suspect that current volumes will likely increase, especially from our hospitals near the D.C. area.\"\n\nHopkins is receiving samples from outpatient tents run by hospitals in its system, as well as from other hospitals in the greater Baltimore area. The daily count varies because the tents aren't open on weekends.\n\nBut the lab is also facing shortages in supplies, including testing agents and swabs.\n\n\"Swabs are now an issue nationally,\" Carroll said. \"Manufacturers have promised more inventory. The need for high-\n\nvolume testing will continue.\"\n\nAt the University of Maryland, robotic equipment and other testing supplies will be coming in for the next four weeks and staff is being added, partially funded with $2.5 million from the state.\n\nThe lab in February bought the covid-19 test developed by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and began the process of seeking federal approval to perform such tests.\n\nIt began recalibrating equipment, training staff and developing a process to take in and return the results, which still must be ordered by a doctor. Ravel expects that will change as testing becomes more widespread.\n\nThe lab plans to use more than one kind of test so that if there are shortages with one it can substitute another. It's been working with the School of Medicine's Department of Pathology and is just beginning to process some samples.\n\nThese tests will be on top of the samples already processed by the affiliated University of Maryland Medical System and its 13 hospitals.\n\n\"The big shortage is still the sampling device, the swab,\" Ravel said. \"There just are not that many on the market. It's limiting testing.\"",
