        "body": "A flight from Zante where nearly 200 people were told to self-isolate was a \"debacle\" with many travellers not wearing masks, a passenger has said.\n\nStephanie Whitfield told the BBC the Tui flight was full of \"covidiots\" who appeared to disregard the rules.\n\nSixteen passengers on flight TOM6215 from the Greek island to Cardiff have now tested positive, Public Health Wales (PHW) said.\n\nTui said safety was a priority and it was concerned by Ms Whitfield's claims.\n\n\"A full investigation is now under way as these concerns weren't reported during the flight or before today,\" Tui added.\n\nThe 193 passengers and crew who were on board the flight on 25 August are being asked to self-isolate for a fortnight.\n\nHealth officials said seven people from three different parties are believed to have been potentially infectious on board the aircraft.\n\nPHW's Dr Giri Shankar told BBC Radio Wales people returning from Zante in particular are \"picking up the infection and are coming to our attention\".\n\nGreece and its islands remain on the UK government's list of quarantine exempt countries meaning travellers do not need to self-isolate on their return.\n\nMs Whitfield said she and her husband had decided to self-isolate before they had even learned about the positive cases.\n\n\"This flight was a debacle. The chap next to me had his mask around his neck. Not only did the airline not pull him up on it, they gave him a free drink when he said he knew a member of the crew,\" Ms Whitfield said.\n\n\"Loads of people were taking their masks off and wandering up and down the aisles to talk to others.\n\n\"As soon as the flight landed, a load of people took their masks off immediately. The flight was full of selfish 'covidiots' and an inept crew who couldn't care less.\"\n\nMs Whitfield told BBC Radio 4's Today programme she noticed a crew member ask one woman to put her mask on.\n\n\"But the vast majority of people weren't being spoken to, and there was a chap sat next to me who had his mask around his chin for the full flight, and the stewardess was talking to him and she didn't say anything to him [about the mask],\" she said.\n\nThe couple have now sent off for a test as they are experiencing mild symptoms, she added.\n\nTui said in a statement on Monday that its crew \"are trained to the highest standards\".\n\n\"Passengers are informed prior to travel and via PA announcements on the flight that they have to wear masks throughout and are not allowed to move around the cabin,\" the airline added.\n\n\"Masks can only be removed when consuming food and drink.\"\n\nDr Shankar, PHW's Covid-19 incident director, told BBC Breakfast that public health officials initially identified seven people who had tested positive and were potentially infectious on the flight.\n\nHe said since they began alerting passengers, the number of confirmed cases has risen to 16, but it was unclear where they had contracted the virus.\n\nHe said that any of the 187 passengers and six crew on board the three-and-a-half hour flight from Zakynthos to Cardiff Airport on Tuesday that had symptoms \"should book a test without delay\".\n\nIt comes as a group of people from Plymouth tested positive for the virus after returning from Zante last Monday.\n\nThere were 1,715 new coronavirus cases - and one death - reported in the UK on Sunday - the highest number of daily infections recorded since 4 June.\n\nCardiff Airport, which is owned by the Welsh Government, said it was working closely with airlines to \"facilitate passenger travel throughout this challenging time for the industry\".\n\n\"Tui is taking every necessary measure following today's report,\" said Spencer Birns, Cardiff Airport's interim chief executive.\n\n\"Cardiff Airport is closely following guidelines set out by Public Health Wales, FCO (Foreign Office) and UK government and has already taken a number of measures to ensure the safety and security of our team and customers, which is our number one priority.\"\n\nWere you on Tui flight TOM6215 from Zante to Cardiff on Tuesday?\n\nPlease include a contact number if you are willing to speak to a BBC journalist.

They are:\n\nThe list also includes Aboyne, Deeside and Hazlehead golf clubs, and the Banks O'Dee Football Club.\n\nAnyone who had visited any of these premises should be \"extra vigilant for symptoms\" - even if they had not been contacted by specialist tracers.\n\nThe lockdown restrictions which have been reimposed for the city's 228,000 residents include:\n\nThe restrictions will be reviewed next Wednesday and may be extended further if required.",

        "body": "When Jennifer Duddy was admitted to hospital with coronavirus, she said goodbye to her young family wondering if she would ever see them again.\n\nThe 32-year-old accountant, who has asthma, first experienced symptoms of the virus in March, but says she was refused tests on several occasions.\n\nInitially, most people with symptoms were told to stay at home and self-isolate.\n\nHer husband, Jamie, also had symptoms, but while his symptoms slowly started to lessen, Jennifer's got worse and eventually she was admitted to Belfast's Mater Hospital with breathing difficulties.\n\nShe spent seven days there being treated for coronavirus.\n\nWhen she was discharged, she knew it would take time to recover fully, but was optimistic and excited to again cuddle her eight-year-old daughter, Chloe, and one-year-old son Ryan.\n\n\"A lot of tears were shed in those first two months,\" Jennifer told BBC News NI.\n\n\"I was on so much medication when I was in hospital that you start to feel a lot better but whenever you get out, you obviously can't have that level of medication home with you, so you just crash back down.\"\n\nMonths later, she is still experiencing heart palpitations, breathlessness, brain fog, dizziness and extreme fatigue.\n\n\"You're not living a life, you're just existing,\" she said.\n\n\"It goes from one day to another and nothing happens, you just want to go to bed.\"\n\nThankfully, Jamie's mother had moved in to help but Jennifer says that it is \"awful, knowing that you are potentially putting someone else's life at risk\".\n\n\"I went two months without even holding Chloe or Ryan and it broke my heart, but then I didn't even have the energy to talk to them.\n\n\"I was so sick I couldn't even listen to them, I was just exhausted.\n\n\"We were one of those families who rarely had a free Saturday and now I don't even have the energy for a conversation.\"\n\nAside from her other symptoms, Jennifer has continued to lose weight due to regular waves of sickness and loss of appetite.\n\nDoctors suspect she has developed ME, also known as chronic fatigue syndrome, as a result of the virus.\n\n\"It has been an actual living nightmare,\" said Jennifer.\n\nShe has joined online support groups and met many people who are experiencing similar after effects.\n\n\"Our lives are completely on hold - we can't do anything.\n\n\"If I'm able to go to the park with the children alone for 15 minutes then it's been an outstanding day.\n\n\"My husband has essentially become a single parent. He does everything. It's so much stress, mentally and physically.\"\n\nAs for the future, Jennifer admits that she is worried, especially if people refuse to wear face coverings to try to limit the spread of Covid-19.\n\nOn Thursday, the NI Executive announced that face masks would become mandatory in shops and other enclosed spaces from August 10.\n\nShe said: \"We can't afford to get coronavirus again.\n\n\"It has already caused so much upset to our family, but if people aren't going to wear masks then we can't go out.\n\n\"I'm asthmatic and my breathing is still not great and I can wear a mask - so for the majority of people, they can too.\n\n\"I wish people would see that coronavirus is still out there. Everyone can't just forget about it and relax.\n\n\"If you have the side effects that I have had, your life will be completely on hold.\"\n\nDr Michael Head, senior research fellow in global health at the University of Southampton, told the BBC that while little is known at this stage about long-term effects of the virus, stories like Jennifer's are becoming increasingly common.\n\nHe said that \"a lot of people have reported feeling terrible even months later, so it is going to be a big problem for policy makers and the health service going forward\".\n\n\"There is evidence emerging that there are lots of longer side effects,\" said Dr Head.\n\n\"It can pretty much affect every organ in the body, it is a nasty virus and there is still a lot to learn about it.\"\n\nIn a bid to limit the spread of Covid-19 in Northern Ireland, the Department of Health encouraged people to download its new contact tracing app.",

        "body": "Sickle cell disease is a life-threatening condition affecting about 15,000 people in the UK, predominantly those from African and Caribbean backgrounds. Four women with experience of the condition explain how coronavirus is making life even more challenging.\n\n\"The pain is indescribable - it's like someone's hammering your bones,\" says Elaine Tappin.\n\nSickle cell disease brings a further fear for Ms Tappin and other sufferers. Since it can damage the lungs and spleen, it puts them at higher risk of serious illness - or even death - from Covid-19.\n\nThat is why, despite people in England, Scotland and Northern Ireland no longer having to shield against coronavirus, she is continuing to do so.\n\n\"We are in the group that could become seriously ill. I'm not going out to see anybody and nobody's coming to my home,\" said Ms Tappin, of Ipswich, a member of support group Sickle Cell Suffolk.\n\nDuring one recent \"crisis\" episode, she went for a bath because hot water eases the worst of the symptoms. But just getting there proved a struggle.\n\n\"For me to get up the stairs was a major, major, painful incident. It took me about 20 minutes to get up there because [of] the pain, every time I put my foot down,\" she said.\n\nShe ended up taking morphine and had to remain upstairs because it was too painful to go downstairs.\n\nVivica, 10, lives elsewhere in Suffolk with her older sister Chelsea, 20, and her mother Caroline.\n\nSince lockdown began in March, Vivica has spent more than eight weeks in hospital - not for Covid-19, but for sickle cell-related illnesses.\n\n\"We are literally continuing with the lockdown,\" said Caroline.\n\n\"Right now, people think the virus has gone but the virus is still as strong as it was in April and May.\"\n\nTo ease the impact sickle cell disease can have on mental health, patients are offered a psychologist as part of their treatment.\n\n\"Right now, my daughter is really scared,\" said Caroline.\n\n\"Even if she hears somebody knocking at the door, she thinks that person is coming to infect her. And therefore, genuinely, she does not want to get out of the house.\"\n\nIt remains unclear whether Vivica will return to school in September.\n\nHer mother desperately wants her to be able to go back as long as she is safe which, in Vivica's case, would mean being given near one-to-one tutoring away from other children.\n\nSource: NHS England/Sickle Cell Society/Sickle Cell Suffolk\n\nIt is a concern shared by Jemima, whose daughter also has sickle cell.\n\nJemima is contemplating continuing with home-schooling next term.\n\n\"My days are taken up with being the teacher, the cook, the entertainer, the headmaster, and then my work is done in the middle of the night and at the weekends, and then I push everything through by Monday morning.\n\n\"We just have to roll with the punches, really.\"\n\nSomething as seemingly simple as online grocery shopping becomes a complex ritual with sickle cell families, who have to take extra steps to prevent infection from Covid-19.\n\nWhen her delivery arrives, Jemima asks the driver to leave the items in bags outside.\n\n\"And then I have to go and spray them, leave them for a few hours before taking them to the disinfectants portion of the back garden and wash them down with disinfectant before taking them indoors,\" she said.\n\nAnnetta's 17-year-old son has sickle cell disease. He has not seen his cousins since before the lockdown.\n\nSeeing the impact of isolation on him had been \"heartbreaking\", she said.\n\n\"He's very, very nervous about starting college; going into the college environment and being around other people that don't understand,\" she said.\n\n\"He wants to further his life and get on, but at the same time he knows the risk that he's taken with his health.\"\n\nFor Annetta and her son, even going for a simple walk has been an all-too-elusive enjoyment.\n\nWalking round the block is \"not an option\" because there are too many people and Annetta cannot be certain they will social-distance from her or her son.\n\nInstead, she drives out to more remote rural locations where they will encounter few, if any, other people.\n\nShe and the other mothers who spoke about the condition hope to promote greater awareness of sickle cell disease.\n\n\"The important thing, really, is just to get the awareness about sickle cell and the impact of sickle cell on the lives of sufferers but that, more importantly, it's what you can do to help and assist a sickle cell sufferer to live a normal life,\" she said.",

    "'Lockdown made my miscarriage far more traumatic'": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "Pregnant women are often now attending hospital appointments on their own. Covid-19 safety measures in hospitals mean loved ones must sit in the car or pace outside. It means some are being given the heartbreaking news of miscarriages on their own. Four women tell their stories of miscarriage during the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nWhen Helen Bosher, 40, discovered she was pregnant at the end of March, she was anxious - she had lost three babies already, and was under the care of the recurrent miscarriage unit at St Mary's Hospital, in London. She urgently needed to get hold of some blood test results, but when she rang up she was told her consultant was self-isolating. The unit was closed.\n\nPlanned services had been paused and staff re-deployed to urgent and emergency care services. \"My whole support network, everyone who was there to help me, just vanished,\" says Helen. \"They disappeared overnight.\"\n\nShe frantically rang and emailed her local hospital, her GP and 111, but nobody could help her get hold of the results. \"My anxiety went through the roof. I remember crying and crying on the phone, because no-one knew what was going on. It was chaos.\"\n\nEventually she was booked in for an early scan at Pembury Hospital, in Tunbridge Wells, but because of the new coronavirus restrictions her partner, Dan, was not allowed in with her. It was not good news.\n\n\"It was highly distressing to find out my baby had no heartbeat, when my partner had to sit in the car park and wait. I then had to come out and tell him the sad news myself.\"\n\nTwo weeks later they were back to discuss treatment. Dan stayed in the car while Helen made her way to the early pregnancy unit. She asked a nurse for directions, and when she explained she was miscarrying, the nurse had tears in her eyes. \"If only I could put my arm around you,\" she told her.\n\nDan sat in the car, wondering what Helen was going through. It felt strange to see people out shopping and chatting when he couldn't be with her.\n\nInside, Helen's worst fears were being realised. She was given drugs to speed up the miscarriage and the doctors suggested she stay in hospital. But she wasn't taking in what they were saying - she just wanted to get back to Dan. \"I was so overwhelmed and I didn't have that second set of eyes and ears I needed,\" she says.\n\nFive hours later, Helen finally came out. They drove home and waited for the drugs to take effect, but they weren't prepared for what that involved.\n\n\"I ended up having terrible contractions, projectile vomiting, nearly blacking out because of the pain. It was a really terrifying experience,\" says Helen.\n\nDan didn't know what to do and was desperately searching for advice online. \"I was emailing, I messaged people on Instagram,\" he says. \"Having to Google what's going to happen rather than speaking to a professional has to be dangerous.\"\n\nAfter four hours the pain and bleeding subsided, but Helen now thinks it was a mistake to go home and that if Dan had been with her she might have chosen to stay in hospital.\n\nThe experience was so traumatic they can't face going through it again. They have decided to adopt instead.\n\nMaidstone and Tunbridge Wells NHS Trust said that partners are not currently able to attend scan or antenatal appointments, in line with national and regional NHS guidance.\n\n\"We understand the concerns this may cause for those who are expecting but we would like to reassure them that the restrictions are in place for everyone's safety and thank them for their patience and understanding.\"\n\nJust before lockdown, on 16 March, Fatma Reid found out she was pregnant again. The 25-year-old lost a baby the year before, but this time there was no sign anything was wrong. \"I had a bump, I was craving Revels, I was definitely 100% pregnant,\" she says.\n\nHer six-year-old daughter noticed the bump and kept asking if she was pregnant, and just before the 12-week scan Fatma finally told her she was. But the scan revealed a large sac and no baby. Sometimes called a blighted ovum, or anembryonic pregnancy, this can happen when the foetus dies early in the pregnancy and is reabsorbed, while the sac continues to develop.\n\n\"It was very confusing because I've never in my life heard of someone having a sac but no baby,\" says Fatma. \"I was crying loads.\"\n\nHer husband Zach was called in from the car park to discuss the options. Fatma wanted to have surgery to \"get it over with\" but operations were being kept to a minimum at the time. She agreed to go home and let nature take its course.\n\nShe had to explain to her daughter that she was not going to be a big sister after all - and she waited to miscarry. But nothing happened and three weeks later, she still tested pregnant.\n\nNext, doctors administered tablets to speed up the process. At home, Fatma bled profusely and was in a lot of pain. She hoped that was the end of it, but on 29 June she had another positive pregnancy test.\n\nBack at Salisbury District Hospital a scan showed there was a significant amount of pregnancy tissue left, and surgery was the way forward. Fatma was booked in to have a procedure called manual vacuum aspiration (MVA), under local anaesthetic.\n\nThree days later Fatma was in a lot of pain. \"I turned to my husband and said, 'Oh my God, something's wrong. This isn't normal.'\" Zach took her to A&E and was initially told to wait outside, until Fatma protested.\n\nA scan showed abnormal cells, but the doctor was adamant that it couldn't be pregnancy tissue. \"You believe doctors, don't you?\" says Fatma.\n\nTwo days later she woke up in agony, bleeding heavily, but she was reluctant to go back to hospital. \"You feel, 'am I overreacting?' I felt like I was wasting people's time,\" she says.\n\nShe rang 111 and they called an ambulance. This time a scan revealed what Fatma suspected - that there was still pregnancy tissue left. She was booked in for emergency surgery on 17 July to make sure nothing was left behind.\n\nHad it not been for Covid, Fatma would have had surgery soon after her 12-week scan. Instead, the process took two months and many hospital visits, all the time trying to hide her distress from her young daughter.\n\nA spokesperson for Salisbury District Hospital explained many services had to be altered to protect patients and staff from the virus, and that they are very sorry for any distress caused.\n\n\"Throughout the pandemic our staff have sought to do their jobs with care, compassion and commitment especially when helping patients in stressful and upsetting circumstances.\"\n\nIt is now allowing partners to accompany expectant mothers to their 20-week scan and are keeping all other restrictions under review.\n\nLauren, 33, a teacher from Glasgow, hangs on to the moments of humanity she experienced during an otherwise bleak time. Having first lost a baby last year, she had two further miscarriages during lockdown.\n\nShe suspected something was wrong when she started bleeding. A six-week scan in March was inconclusive. But because scans were being kept to a minimum, she was told she couldn't have another until her 12-week appointment.\n\n\"I was pretty sure I was miscarrying again and nobody would confirm it. I was so worried, I was so anxious,\" she says.\n\nHer midwife was able to arrange a scan at nine weeks which confirmed her fears. Lauren begged to have surgery. \"I had already had a natural miscarriage at home and was petrified of having another,\" she says.\n\nBecause of Covid, surgery was not an option. She was booked in for an MVA nine days later, but within days she miscarried at home.\n\n\"I had the fright of my life because it sent me into labour,\" she says. \"Nobody warned me that although my foetus had stopped growing at six weeks, my sac and placenta had continued to grow.\"\n\nTo ease the pain, she got into a warm bath. Afterwards, she and her husband Michael had to sift through the water to collect the pregnancy tissues. \"That was probably one of the most traumatic parts of it.\"\n\nThey did it because she had been promised the tissues would be sent for genetic testing, in the hope of finding out why she had been miscarrying. But when she took them to hospital the following day, she was told testing had been stopped.\n\n\"For us, it was traumatising to find out that after all that, we wouldn't get any answers,\" she says.\n\nLauren says the worst part of it all was not having Michael with her. She hated having to give him bad news. \"I felt like I was disappointing him every time,\" she says.\n\nAnd Michael felt helpless. Instead of getting the facts from a medical professional, he had to piece things together when an emotional Lauren got back in the car. \"I've got questions that I've never been able to ask,\" he says. \"I'm involved as well. I've just been cast out, cast aside.\"\n\nAt the start of June, Lauren found out she was pregnant again. When she arrived at the hospital she was overcome by a sense of foreboding.\n\n\"I started crying and didn't want to go out of the car,\" she says. \"I was worried about going into the building on my own, but my husband wasn't allowed in.\"\n\nSadly this pregnancy was not viable. Lauren began to miscarry alone at home and made her way to hospital in agony.\n\n\"What the midwife did changed everything: she gave me a cuddle,\" she says. \"She shouldn't have done that, due to Covid, but it was the right thing to do. It was one of those life-changing moments.\"\n\nLauren now has a supportive consultant and is sharing her experience on Instagram.\n\nFor Lucy McLeod, 33, the experience of losing a baby during lockdown felt \"a world away\" from her previous miscarriage, when her husband Ben was with her.\n\nShe was on her own at the 12-week scan when the sonographer could not find a heartbeat.\n\n\"I burst into tears, and she put on a pair of gloves to pat me on my knee - I think even that kindness was against protocol,\" she says.\n\n\"I was sent to a different room to talk to a midwife who, after asking me to sanitise my hands, cautiously put a box of tissues between herself and me. She said they would usually offer a hug right now, but she wasn't allowed to.\"\n\nLucy was offered options that would not require surgery, but she rejected them. \"I couldn't face going through labour to birth a baby that was dead. It felt like a second blow that I would have to give birth to her and clean her up myself in order to bury her,\" she says.\n\nIt was agreed that she could have surgery, but she had to accept the risk of catching the virus while in hospital. \"Even so, I much preferred this option,\" she says.\n\nLucy was swabbed for Covid before being wheeled into theatre. She was still crying when she came round. \"The sister in recovery stroked my hair and held my hand tightly. I was so grateful for her soothing me,\" she says. \"I couldn't believe that I had to face this day alone.\"\n\nBen and Lucy have named their baby Chloe. They will collect her body this week. But Lucy is worried about the effect Covid measures will have had on the mental health of people who have lost a baby.\n\n\"Miscarriages are devastating,\" says Birte Harlev-Lam from the Royal College of Midwives. \"We know that this pandemic has made the experience even more difficult due to restrictions on having partners at scans and other appointments.\"\n\nThe miscarriage charity Tommy's saw a huge spike in helpline queries during the pandemic is urging women to seek medical help if they have symptoms such as changes in their baby's movements, severe pain or heavy bleeding.\n\nAccording to Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists guidance, scans should still be offered if someone is worried about retained pregnancy tissue, if they're bleeding heavily, or if they're in pain, and women should then be monitored for signs of infection.\n\nConsultant gynaecologist Prof Tom Bourne, speaking for the RCOG, says a study is being done on the impact of the pandemic on the care of women with complications in early pregnancy, including miscarriage, and that those experiences will inform future guidance.",

        "authors": [],
        "body": "Parents should be \"reassured\" Covid-19 has not caused the deaths of any otherwise healthy schoolchildren in the UK, researchers say.\n\nChildren's risk of needing hospital treatment for coronavirus is \"tiny\" and critical care \"even tinier\", they say.\n\nHowever, black children, those who are obese and very young babies have a slightly higher risk.\n\nThe BMJ study looked at 651 children with coronavirus in hospitals in England, Wales and Scotland.\n\nIt covers two-thirds of all children's admissions in the UK due to Covid-19 between January and July and confirms what is already known about the minimal effects of the virus on children.\n\nA \"strikingly low\" 1% of these 651 children and young people - six in total - had died in hospital with Covid-19 compared with 27% across all other age groups, the study found.\n\nOnly 18% had needed intensive care.\n\nAnd the six who had died had had \"profound\" underlying health conditions that had often been complex and themselves life-limiting.\n\nChildren with such conditions remained vulnerable to the virus and must take precautions, the researchers said.\n\nBut for others, the risk was extremely low.\n\n\"There have been no deaths in otherwise healthy school-age children,\" said study author Prof Calum Semple, from the University of Liverpool.\n\n\"There is no direct harm from children going back to school,\" he added.\n\nCo-author Dr Olivia Swann, from the Royal Hospital for Sick Children, in Edinburgh, said she hoped the findings would be \"extremely reassuring for parents across the UK\".\n\nThe most common symptoms in children admitted to hospital were a fever, cough, nausea or vomiting and shortness of breath.\n\nOlder children were more likely to have stomach pain, headache and a sore throat.\n\nOf the 651 children in the study, 42% had an underlying health condition - the most common ones being illnesses affecting the brain and nervous system (11%), cancer (8%) and asthma (7%).\n\nBut having asthma - unlike being obese - had not made the children more likely to need intensive care.\n\nOf the 651 children, 52 were also diagnosed with a multisystem inflammatory syndrome linked to coronavirus, with the first case seen by doctors in mid-March.\n\nThese 52 - none of whom died - were more likely than the others to be older, about 10, and from ethnic minorities.\n\nAnd they were five times more likely to be admitted to intensive care, where they responded well to treatment.\n\nBased on their study, the definition of this syndrome could now be broadened to include symptoms such as fatigue, headache, sore throat and muscle pain, the researchers said, on top of the symptoms already listed by the World Health Organization.\n\nDr Liz Whittaker, of Imperial College London, said the findings echoed other studies of Covid-19 in children.\n\n\"Very low numbers of children have been admitted to critical care and the researchers reported a very low death rate - particularly in comparison to adults but also in comparison to the death rate due to other infections, influenza, chicken pox, meningitis, group-A-strep[tococcus] sepsis et cetera, and other causes of childhood death - for example, road traffic accidents),\" she said.\n\nThe fact black children were more commonly affected by the very rare inflammatory syndrome \"reflects the higher incidence of coronavirus infection in these communities\", Dr Whittaker added.",

    "'Scotland jumped the gun on Greece quarantine'": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "UK Transport Secretary Grant Shapps has claimed Scotland \"jumped the gun\" by adding Greece to the quarantine list.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Scottish government moved Greece to the list of countries from where returning travellers have to self isolate for 14 days.\n\nThe Scottish government said its decisions on quarantine measures for travellers were based on the scientific evidence available.\n\nIt said judgements were made on how best to keep people in Scotland safe.\n\nMr Shapps also said that adding Portugal to the list had caused \"confusion\" and that Scotland and Wales had not taken the latest data into consideration.\n\nQuarantine for travellers coming from Portugal begins at 04:00 on Saturday.\n\nFrench Polynesia was also added to the list from 04:00 the same day.\n\nSpeaking on the BBC's Today programme, Mr Shapps said: \"On Wednesday the Scots - without using the joint bio-security centre data for this particular decision - decided that people from Greece would be excluded, and jumped the gun on that.\n\n\"It is their right to do it but it doesn't make the overall message any clearer.\"\n\nThe quarantine rule for travellers coming to Scotland from Greece came into force at 04:00 on Thursday.\n\nThe ruling also affects those coming in to English airports from those countries on the list, before travelling to Scotland.\n\nMr Shapps said \"ideally\" the UK government would try to co-ordinate with the other administrations on travel announcements but that this week \"it didn't work out\".\n\nThe UK is now split on its rules for Portugal. Quarantine for Welsh travellers began at 04:00 on Friday, Scots have to self-isolate from 04:00 on Saturday and English returners are not subject to any requirements to self isolate.\n\nPortugal, Greece and French Polynesia are still on England and Northern Ireland's lists of travel corridors.\n\nMr Shapps also claimed that the Scottish and Welsh governments may have made decisions on Portugal without seeing all the data.\n\nHe said: \"The Welsh administration had not noticed or not seen a second figure which is the percentage number of cases which test positive. That is really important because what we don't want to do is exclude countries for doing the right thing in carrying out lots of tests.\n\n\"When we brought Portugal into the travel corridor they had a test positivity rate of 1.8% but this week it was 1.6%, so the number had fallen.\"\n\nHe described Portugal as being on a \"borderline\", adding that \"the opinion of England and Northern Ireland is that it did not justify quarantine this week\".\n\nWhen Derek Burt's mother was diagnosed with MND six weeks ago, she asked for \"one more trip\" - a holiday with her family.\n\nWith trips to Florida and Croatia already cancelled, when quarantine restrictions were lifted two weeks ago they settled on Portugal.\n\nAlthough the virus rates seemed on the high-side, he \"assumed the government knew what they were doing\" and would not return the country to the quarantine list.\n\n\"How stupid was I to show any faith in our countries' decision-makers?\" he said.\n\nThey have had an amazing week, and his mother was able to fulfil her wish to watch her grandchildren playing in the pool of their villa.\n\nBut now the family from Dunfermline in Fife is racing to get home to beat the new restrictions that come into force at 04:00 on Saturday.\n\nMr Burt said he is \"incredibly frustrated\" by the decision of the Scottish and Welsh governments, describing it as a \"complete shambles\".\n\nThe seven-day infection rate in Portugal has increased from 15.3 to 23 per 100,000 people.\n\nWhere are the world's coronavirus hotspots?\n\nA seven-day rate of 20 per 100,000 is the threshold above which the UK government generally considers triggering quarantine conditions.\n\nHolidaymakers have only been able to travel from Scotland to Portugal without quarantine restrictions since 22 August, when it was added to the government \"exemptions\" list.\n\nThe Scottish government said that sometimes its decisions differed from those made by the other three governments.\n\nA spokeswoman said: \"In the case of Greece, we had a worrying number of people in Scotland who tested positive for Covid-19 and who had returned from Greece within seven days of the onset of symptoms. We could not afford to ignore that growing threat to public health.\n\n\"In the case of Portugal, it was unfortunate that the UK government announced their decision yesterday before ministers from England, Scotland and Northern Ireland met and before considering the latest Joint Biosecurity Centre data. This indicated a significant rise in both the prevalence of the virus in Portugal and in test positivity.\"\n\nThe quarantine developments have been criticised by leading figures in the aviation industry, who have compared job losses in the industry to the demise of the coal industry in the 1980s.\n\nMike Tibbert, vice president of Scottish Passenger Agents' Association (SPAA) accused the Scottish government of playing games, with its \"half announcements and teasers\"\n\nHe said: \"The entire travel sector and the travelling public need consistency and clear, well timed messaging.\n\n\"But the toing and froing on the safe list versus quarantine is actually distracting from the main issue which is the total lack of immediate support for the travel sector and the complete absence of a strategic plan to save future travel.\n\n\"Once lost, our connectivity to the rest of the world - and consequently theirs to us - will disappear.\"",

But experience has shown that Covid-19 is different.\n\n\"Breathlessness can occur but many people who are becoming seriously unwell don't become breathless, despite their blood oxygen levels falling as they struggle to absorb oxygen in their lungs.\"\n\nClinical advice was updated in June, Mr Gething said, so doctors know to look for the symptoms.\n\nAdditional pulse oximeters are being distributed to GPs' practices, and Dr Atherton stressed \"a greater emphasis on measuring\" blood oxygen levels in assessments.\n\nIn a virtual Senedd meeting on Wednesday held during the Welsh Parliament's recess, Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price asked Mark Drakeford if \"hundreds of lives could have been saved, potentially, if this had happened sooner\".\n\nPlaid health spokesman Rhun ap Iorwerth wrote to Mr Gething in March and April urging the consideration of more early intervention, such as CPAP machines for oxygenation.\n\nMr Gething wrote back in March acknowledging CPAP had \"an important role in treating Covid-19\".\n\nMr ap Iorwerth said the Welsh Government had been \"frighteningly slow in reacting, leading to months of inaction between the correspondence and the change in approach and a further 2 month delay in informing the Senedd and the public\", he said, referring to the June update.\n\nIn response to Mr Price in the Senedd, Mr Drakeford said Mr Price's suggestion that the speed of response led to deaths was \"unhelpful speculation\".\n\nHe said Wales had a lower rate of excess death than England or Scotland.\n\nDuring March and April \"the health service was flat out\", Mr Drakeford said, \"dealing with the peak of the coronavirus crisis, with many hundreds of people coming through hospital, doors, requiring already requiring critical care beds\".\n\n\"The focus of our system was not being overwhelmed by the demand which was already generated by the circulation of the disease,\" he added.",

        "body": "How do you prepare for an FA Cup tie when opponents will not play against you for fear you will give them coronavirus?\n\nAccording to Nirvana's chairman Zak Hajat, two clubs pulled out of friendlies leading up to Tuesday's FA Cup extra preliminary round home tie with Oadby Town because they \"didn't want to travel to Leicester or play a team from Leicester\".\n\nHe said both matches - one to be played at a neutral venue in Leicester with the other outside the city - were verbally agreed after restrictions in Leicester were eased.\n\n\"In one case both managers agreed the match but the chairman of the other team said 'no, we're not having a team from Leicester come to our ground',\" said Hajat.\n\n\"I've got an email from another team that says 'our management and committee don't want to come to play in Leicester because of local lockdown and Covid-19 reasons'.\n\n\"We tried to explain lockdown restrictions have been eased.\n\n\"I don't want to name the two clubs but they must think we have all got Covid-19.\n\n\"It's disappointing when you have organised the games, put things in place and at a drop of a hat they say 'we're not playing you'.\"\n\nNirvana, from the ninth-tier United Counties League Premier Division, is a community club based in the Hamilton district of the East Midlands city with players from more than 40 nationalities representing them through their many youth teams to the first team.\n\nThey have played four friendlies since being allowed to return to training last month, with no positive tests for coronavirus among the team, said Hajat.\n\nWith 182 ties due to take place in front of spectators this week, Nirvana are not the only non-league team who have encountered problems before the start of FA Cup qualifying.\n\nWhen one of their players announced on 12 August - three weeks before the start of FA Cup qualifying - he had tested positive for coronavirus, Charnock Richard went into lockdown.\n\nHaving only recently returned to training after four months of inactivity, the Lancashire club, a thriving community hub near Chorley, ceased all football activity.\n\nThree friendlies aimed at shaking off rustiness before their cup trip to South Yorkshire to face Athersley Recreation were scrapped and players told to train on their own.\n\n\"The last few months have been a complete pain in the backside,\" Shaun Tootell, chairman of ninth-tier Charnock Richard, said.\n\nThe North West Counties League Premier Division club have not named the player who announced he had tested positive the day after a pre-season friendly with Chorley.\n\n\"He had taken a test on the day of the match, which we didn't know about, and then played the full 90 minutes,\" added Tootell.\n\n\"It was only the next day he discovered the result of the test. He was shocked because he had no symptoms and had only taken the test for work reasons.\n\n\"We didn't know what surfaces he touched in the dressing room. We couldn't risk bringing the squad back together in case others picked up the virus.\n\n\"We're not the first club this has happened to and we won't be the last.\"\n\nThe town has been subject to stricter new measures designed to stop the spread of coronavirus but Avro's home tie with Bootle on Wednesday is going ahead with a limited capacity of 300.\n\n\"I'm excited but also nervous,\" said chairman Rob Fuller. \"Will everyone follow the guidelines?\n\n\"You drive past one pub and everyone seems to be adhering to the guidelines then you drive to the next one and there appears to be no guidelines in place.\n\n\"As quickly as they are allowing fans back into grounds, we're being told it can stop straight away if people don't follow the guidelines.\n\n\"We have to accept this is how it's going to be. The alternative is to knock it on the head and don't have any sport. That would end lots of clubs.\"\n\nThere are 368 teams taking part in the FA Cup extra preliminary round - the first of 13 hurdles before the final on 15 May 2021.\n\nWith social distancing rules and special measures in place to welcome back fans, it will be a different experience for players and supporters.\n\nAt Leicester Nirvana, the managers will conduct their pre-match and half-time team talks on the pitch.\n\n\"If you have 20 people in a changing room for a team talk you cannot socially distance,\" added Hajat.\n\n\"We might have to hide around the corner so Oadby Town's players can't hear our team talk!\"\n\nOver at Charnock Richard, post-match food for players is off the menu for the foreseeable future.\n\n\"We make an effort with our food and spend anywhere between \u00a350 and \u00a3100 each home game on things like pies, chips and pasta for both teams,\" added Tootell.\n\n\"The reason we're not doing it right now is we're trying to discourage 20 or 30 people descending on the clubhouse all at once due to social distancing.\"\n\nAvro, who play at the 1,500-capacity Vestacare Stadium, will cut seating in their stand from 200 to around 135, while only six players will be allowed in each dressing room at any one time.\n\n\"It's going to be strange,\" added Fuller.\n\n\"The camaraderie is one of the best things about non-league, meeting other directors and having a pint with them.",

This list was not shared to assign blame to any individual premises.\n\n\"We now consider that all licensed premises in Aberdeen are likely affected in some way. This is because physical distancing - or the lack of it - has come up repeatedly in our investigation. I would stress again that we must all take personal responsibility for physical distancing.\"",

But that was just the tip of the iceberg.\n\nIt has since been estimated there were perhaps as many as 100,000 infections a day at the end of March.\n\nOf course, the system is still not detecting all the cases even with the extra testing in place.\n\nThe Office for National Statistics surveillance programme suggests the true level of infection may be about twice what is being recorded currently. But that's still a fraction of the cases seen in the spring.\n\nAnd while there is evidence of cases increasing, that has not translated into an increase in people being admitted to hospital.\n\nDeaths are also low - down to under 10 a day on average.\n\nThere is no guarantee it will stay like this, of course.\n\nMany of the new cases are being seen in young adults who are now out more, either working or socialising.\n\nThey are at very low risk of complications so this may not seem too concerning - after all, society has to function - but the fear remains that this could lead to the frail and vulnerable catching the virus.\n\nThat said, those who fall into the more vulnerable groups will naturally be taking more precautions.\n\nBut the problem, says Edinburgh University infectious diseases expert Prof Mark Woolhouse, comes if the levels of infection rise substantially from the level being seen at the moment.\n\n\"Spillover into the high-risk population could become very hard to avoid.\"\n\nThe international effort to find a vaccine is unprecedented.\n\nThere are about 150 initiatives in development, including more than 20 that have begun human trials.\n\nOne of the most promising is being developed by Oxford University - and early results suggest it can trigger an immune response.\n\nA deal has been signed to supply 100 million doses in the UK alone.\n\nBut even with the rapid progress that is being made, a vaccine is very unlikely to be available until the middle of next year at the earliest.\n\nAnd there are, of course, no guarantees it will work or just how long the protection it offers us will last.\n\nLeading immunologist Prof Sir John Bell, of the University of Oxford, believes the likeliest scenario will be a vaccine like the one for flu that offers some protection for a limited period.\n\nA smallpox scenario whereby a jab can wipe out the disease is only considered to be a remote possibility.\n\nReal progress has been made in the past few months on how best to treat patients who fall seriously ill with coronavirus - for the overwhelming majority it only causes a mild illness.\n\nA cheap and widely available, low-dose steroid treatment - dexamethasone - has been found to reduce the risk of death in seriously ill patients (those who require intensive care) by a third and is now being routinely used on the front line.\n\nIt was research carried out in the UK that helped to make this breakthrough, which came in June.\n\nSince then trials have found another steroid, hydrocortisone, is equally effective.\n\nOther breakthroughs will no doubt come.\n\nDifferent treatments are being tested on patients around the world, including the use of blood plasma from people who have been infected and recovered from the virus.\n\nIt is going to be a major challenge.\n\nThe virus is stealthy. It can be passed on before symptoms develop and, significantly, some people never even know they are infectious. This is what makes it so difficult to contain.\n\nInfections are almost certainly going to rise. But the key question is by how much and among which groups.\n\nCrucial to the success will be the testing and tracing regime.\n\nEach UK nation runs its own contact tracing system, but they work on the same principles - the details of positive cases are passed on to contact tracers who then try to identify their close contacts and ask them to isolate.\n\nHuge strides have been made to set up an effective system. The UK is now carrying out more tests per head of population than Spain, France and Germany.\n\nBut problems still remain. A backlog has developed in processing tests at the three mega labs, which means it is taking longer to give people results - the average turnaround time is now more than 24 hours. The problems have prompted testing to be prioritised in high infection areas, meaning in some areas people are struggling to book tests at local centres.\n\nAnd demand continues to grow all the time. Scotland saw a big rise in tests being requested for children after schools went back in August.\n\nContact tracing is also still a work in progress. England's service, for example, is still not quite reaching the 80% of positive cases and close contacts it is aiming to - although it is not that far short.\n\nBut for all the difficulties that remain, the pattern of infections, the infrastructure now in place and the improvement in treatment all do offer hope.",

        "body": "A grammar school is making it mandatory for pupils and staff to wear face coverings when they return to school.\n\nBelfast Royal Academy (BRA) announced its plans in an email to parents.\n\nIt said that if a pupil arrived without a face mask, \"they will not be permitted to enter the classroom\".\n\nOn Monday it became compulsory to wear a mask in shops and other enclosed public spaces in NI but Education Minister Peter Weir said the executive was not recommending it for pupils.\n\nHowever NI's Chief Scientific Adviser Prof Ian Young later said he believed it would be of benefit for older children.\n\nIn the email sent to parents and guardians, BRA said that \"due to our large pupil and staff population, it will be extremely difficult to maintain strict social distancing requirements\".\n\n\"Therefore, in order to protect all members of the school community, including those who are vulnerable, all pupils, staff and visitors MUST wear a face covering within the school buildings.\"\n\nThe school said it planned to provide all pupils with a washable face covering in school colours, which should be marked with the pupil's initials.\n\nPupils are encouraged to purchase at least one additional mask \"to facilitate frequent washing\" and disposable masks are prohibited for environmental reasons.\n\nIn the Republic of Ireland, ministers have recommended that secondary school students and teachers should wear face coverings when a distance of two metres cannot be maintained.\n\nWorld Health Organization (WHO) advice says non-medical face coverings should be worn in public where social distancing is not possible.\n\nCoronavirus is spread when droplets are sprayed into the air when infected people talk, cough or sneeze. Those droplets can then fall on surfaces.\n\nThe WHO says there is also emerging evidence of airborne transmission of the virus, with tiny particles hanging in aerosol form in the air.\n\nHomemade cloth face-coverings can help reduce the spread from people who are contagious but have no symptoms or are yet to develop symptoms.\n\nTaking a face covering on and off can also risk contamination, the WHO says.\n\nSeventy-six new cases of coronavirus were diagnosed in NI over the weekend, according to the Department of Health's latest update.\n\nOne more death has been recorded, which happened on 8 August.\n\nThe figures, which mostly record fatalities in a hospital setting, show the number of deaths now stands at 557. The total number of confirmed cases of Covid-19 is now 6,140.\n\nHealth Minister Robin Swann said news of the death was \"very distressing\" and urged people in NI \"to do everything they can to keep themselves and others safe\".",

        "authors": [],
        "body": "Birmingham has been added to a watchlist as an \"area of enhanced support\", amid growing concerns about a rise in coronavirus cases in the city.\n\nBirmingham will see more testing and the health secretary is meeting city leaders to discuss further steps.\n\nCases of Covid-19 are rising quickly, with 31 cases per 100,000 last week. More than half of these cases were people aged 18 to 34.\n\nBirmingham council leader Ian Ward said it was a \"wake-up call for everyone\".\n\nThe Labour leader said the council would announce \"as soon as possible\" what this meant for people in the city.\n\n\"If our previous warnings to keep doing the basics haven't been enough, this has to be the wake-up call for everyone,\" he said.\n\n\"Wash your hands, wear face coverings wherever possible, keep two metres apart from others and get tested if you have Covid-19 symptoms.\"\n\nWest Midlands Mayor Andy Street, who is taking part in the meeting with Matt Hancock, said some people \"had not been strict enough\" in keeping up the basic steps.\n\n\"People across the region have made an enormous sacrifice since the start of lockdown to keep the virus at bay, but the virus is now returning and recent efforts to counter that have been insufficient,\" he said, urging people to \"re-double their efforts\".\n\nIt comes a week after statistics showed the rate of infection had more than doubled.\n\nThe infection rate is below levels in Leicester and parts of northern England when measures were introduced there.\n\nFigures published on Friday showed a rate of 25.5 new cases per 100,000 people in Birmingham in the seven days to 18 August, down from 29.2.\n\nBusinesses in the city must enforce government advice to prevent a local lockdown, the council said.\n\nIt stated they must ensure bookings were not taken for over six people and for parties from more than two households, as well as other measures including social distancing.\n\nNew coronavirus cases in Birmingham have been increasing for a few weeks. Some 351 were recorded in the week to 16 August, up from 256 the week before and 144 the week before that.\n\nAnd as a city of more than a million people, that worked out at just under 31 per 100,000 residents last week.\n\nWhile cases are rising, the figures are well below areas such as Northampton, where the rate of infection stands at 116.6 cases per 100,000 people, and Oldham, where the rate is 86.9.\n\nAcross the whole of England, the rate was 12 per 100,000.\n\nBirmingham is within the top 20 of the 315 local authority areas in England for new cases.\n\nThe breakdown of cases in Birmingham shows 15 recorded last week in Handsworth South, with Birchfield West, Rotton Park and Bordesley also recording more than 10 each.\n\nDr Ron Daniels, an intensive care consultant in the West Midlands, said that despite the increase \"our hospitals are relatively empty of patients with this condition\".\n\n\"We're seeing very few patients admitted to hospital let alone requiring intensive care,\" he said, adding: \"It's true that testing at the moment is identifying a younger population who don't tend to become as seriously ill.\"\n\nEvery week, PHE publishes a list of areas it is concerned about based on new coronavirus infection rates and other local intelligence.\n\nThese places are categorised as either \"areas of concern\", \"areas of enhanced support\" or \"areas of intervention\", and measures range from increased testing to stricter lockdowns.\n\nIn parts of the country in \"intervention\", such as Greater Manchester, restrictions have had to be imposed that are different to the rest of England, such as banning households from meeting indoors.\n\nOne rung down from this is an \"area of enhanced support\". Councils in this category are given more resources such as epidemiological experts or mobile testing stations, but there are no additional restrictions to people's day-to-day lives.\n\nThe lowest rung is an \"area of concern\", which involves taking \"targeted\" action to reduce the spread, such as more testing in care homes or more communication with at-risk groups.\n\nBirmingham City Council has already made some decisions in the past few days, including a ban on non-essential visits to care homes and a \"drop and collect\" trial for virus tests to help limit the rising number of cases.\n\nThe authority has also warned that unless the situation is brought under control, lockdown restrictions from \"the dark days of spring... could all happen again\".\n\nSandwell, which borders Birmingham, was placed on the PHE watchlist as an \"area of concern\" in July.\n\nThe authority did not close shops or restaurants, instead urging those who were shielding to continue doing so, and strongly advising residents not to go inside other people's homes.\n\nAt its peak, Sandwell's rate of infection was 28.1 per 100,000 people. As of last week, it was still on the watchlist but its rate had come to down to about 23 per 100,000, despite a recent outbreak at a DPD depot in Oldbury.\n\nOn Thursday, council leader Ian Ward said the city was \"at a crossroads\".\n\n\"If we don't follow the basic health advice... we will face more tragedy in the weeks and months ahead,\" he said.\n\n\"More people will fall seriously ill, there will be more deaths and our economy will face another hammer blow.\"\n\nThe authority's cabinet member for health and social care, Paulette Hamilton, also said this week that she believed \"at some point between now and Christmas we will be in a local lockdown\".\n\nWest Midlands Police has joined the authority in calling for residents to follow guidelines following weeks of shutting down hundreds of illegal gatherings.\n\n\"If new cases rise we will undoubtedly face the potential of stepping back into those restrictions,\" Supt Gareth Morris said in a personal appeal.\n\n\"We all must do what we can to avoid another lockdown.\"",

When should you keep children home from school and what role do schools play in the demand for testing? We consulted the latest Scottish government guidance.\n\nMy child has cold symptoms - do I send them to school or not?\n\nThis is all down to what the symptoms are.\n\nIf your child has any of the coronavirus symptoms which indicate that they need a test then they, and everyone else in the household, including siblings, should isolate straight away.\n\nYou should book a test for the child with symptoms via www.nhsinform.scot or, if you can't get online, by calling 0800 028 2816.\n\nA runny nose, blocked nose or a sore throat are currently not recognised symptoms that would require a test.\n\nYou should also book a test if you have been instructed to by Test and Protect as a contact of someone who has tested positive.\n\nCan my child be sent home from school with a cold and ordered to have a test before returning?\n\nAll schools are on the lookout for potential outbreaks.\n\nChildren will be sent home from school if they are showing symptoms of coronavirus.\n\nThis means you should book a test immediately. Your family must also follow self-isolation guidelines.\n\nAll schools have plans in place if there is an outbreak. In an outbreak Public Health Scotland will co-ordinate activity with Test and Protect.\n\nIf your child is feeling unwell with different symptoms, you should treat those as you normally would.\n\nCan a school insist my child is tested for coronavirus?\n\nSomeone should be tested for coronavirus if they are symptomatic or if they have been instructed to by a contact tracer. If someone develops symptoms while in school they will be asked to return home and arrange a test.\n\nIf your child has a cold or another illness with different symptoms, those should be treated as normal and seek medical assistance if necessary.\n\nBut a test should only be arranged if one of the recognised Covid-19 symptoms is present or a contact tracer asks you to.\n\nA school cannot insist on seeing evidence of a negative test.\n\nWhat do we do after a test? And if my child is asked to self-isolate, does the rest of the family have to?\n\nEveryone in the household should continue to isolate until the test results come through.\n\nIf the test result for your child is negative, and your child is not already isolating as a \"close contact\" of a confirmed case, they can end isolation and return to school when they are well enough and have not had a fever for 48 hours.\n\nThe rest of their household can end isolation straight away.\n\nIf the test is positive, the symptomatic child should remain in isolation until 10 days from symptoms starting, or longer if they still have a fever.\n\nThe rest of the household should remain in isolation for 14 days from when the person who tested positive showed symptoms, even if they don't have symptoms themselves.\n\nYou will also be put in touch with the local contact tracing team so that other close contacts of your child can be identified. These close contacts will also be asked to self-isolate for 14 days.\n\nThe Test and Protect process is confidential, and your close contacts will not be told that it was you that they were in contact with unless you give permission.\n\nShould the whole family be tested?\n\nOnly family members who have symptoms should be tested.\n\nIf you do not have symptoms yourself and are self-isolating as a close contact of someone with coronavirus, other people in your own household and extended household (if you have one) will not be asked to isolate along with you - unless they have also been in close contact with a person who is a confirmed case, in which case they will be informed by the NHS.",

        "body": "A carer who was unable to be tested for coronavirus until July said she feared she may have spread the disease into care homes despite showing no symptoms.\n\nAlison Taylor, from Sheffield, recently tested positive for antibodies indicating she once had coronavirus.\n\nShe now fears she may have worked while contagious and even visited her mother, who later died with suspected Covid-19.\n\nThe Department of Health and Social Care said protecting staff and residents at homes was a top priority.\n\nMiss Taylor, 51, said: \"I find it really hard to think that I might have passed it to care homes, to residents, to my family.\n\n\"I could be responsible for other people's deaths without knowing.\"\n\nAs a health care assistant, she has looked after vulnerable people throughout the pandemic.\n\nMiss Taylor, who is employed by an agency, worked at four different homes before regular testing was introduced for care workers and residents without symptoms.\n\nShe said she was first tested for coronavirus about a month ago and has since had two tests in the past two weeks.\n\nLast week, Miss Taylor had an antibody test that returned a positive result which, according to NHS England, meant she has had the virus.\n\nShe said if she had any idea she had been infected then she would have stayed at home rather than going to work.\n\nMiss Taylor said: \"I've continued working throughout with no symptoms so I don't know if I've passed it on or not.\n\n\"I'm really uncomfortable that I could have gone into care homes, worked with however many residents and staff without knowing that I've got Covid.\"\n\nDuring the period when she might have been self-isolating, Miss Taylor went to the supermarket and visited her vulnerable parents.\n\nShe said she last saw her 82-year-old mother, who had Alzheimer's disease, just before mother's day, in March.\n\nMiss Taylor said her mother was \"really good\" at the time but died less than a month later on 16 April.\n\nShe was never tested so there was no way of knowing whether she had coronavirus.\n\nMiss Taylor said she was told coronavirus started in the home after a resident was treated in hospital for a fall.\n\nShe added: \"Now I know that I've had it and I saw my mum, I've got some sort of guilt maybe, because I just don't know.\n\n\"I've got a fear that I've passed it on to my mum maybe, to people that I've been caring for in my work place, with no idea whatsoever that I've been positive.\"\n\nAt the start of the pandemic, health care workers reported difficulties with getting tested for coronavirus.\n\nRoutine testing for care home workers and residents was announced on 3 July.\n\nHowever, the government has admitted regular testing would only reach all homes for over-65s and those with dementia by 7 September.\n\nMiss Taylor said: \"We need to know that staff are safe and that residents are as safe as they can be.\n\n\"If we're not tested and we don't know who's got it, who's had it, it's just going to continue, it's just going to roll on.\"\n\nLast week, the Department of Health and Social Care said a \"combination of issues\" had limited the number of testing kits available for care homes and as a result it had been unable \"do as much asymptomatic testing as we want\".\n\nA spokesperson has now added: \"Protecting care home residents and staff has been one of our top priorities throughout this unprecedented pandemic.\n\n\"We are doing all we can to ensure tests are available to everyone who needs one. We are issuing at least 50,000 tests every day to care homes across the country, while working around the clock to minimise any disruption to routine retesting.\"",

        "body": "Cheap steroids can save the lives of patients who are critically ill with Covid-19, studies show.\n\nThe findings confirm the results of an earlier trial, which has already led to steroids being used widely for Covid patients in intensive care.\n\nThe new results, published in JAMA, show eight lives would be saved for every 100 patients treated.\n\nThe researchers said the findings were impressive, but stressed steroids were not a coronavirus cure.\n\nIn June, the UK's Recovery trial found the first drug - a steroid called dexamethasone - that could save the lives of people with severe Covid.\n\nThe latest study brings together all clinical trials involving steroids on coronavirus patients around the world.\n\nIt confirms dexamethasone works and that another steroid, hydrocortisone, is equally effective.\n\n\"At the beginning of the year, at times it felt almost hopeless knowing that we had no specific treatments,\" said Prof Andrew Gordon, from Imperial College London.\n\n\"It was a very worrying time, yet less than six months later we've found clear, reliable evidence in high quality clinical trials of how we can tackle this devastating disease.\"\n\nThe results on 1,703 critically ill patients showed:\n\nThe studies were on only the sickest hospital patients. Most people recover having only experienced mild symptoms.\n\nSteroids calm down inflammation and the immune system, which is why they are already used in conditions like arthritis and asthma, as well as in some severe infections.\n\nThe drugs are not thought to be helpful in the early stages of a coronavirus infection - when symptoms include a cough, fever or a sudden loss of taste or smell.\n\nBut as the disease develops, the immune system can go into overdrive, damaging the lungs and other organs.\n\nIt is this stage of Covid that steroids are thought to help with.\n\n\"At the point at which you reach for an oxygen cylinder for a patient with Covid, you probably should be reaching for the prescription for corticosteroids,\" said Prof Martin Landray, from the University of Oxford.\n\n\"These results are instantly useable; they are widely available, cheap, well-understood drugs that reduce mortality.\"\n\nDoctors are already using dexamethasone after the results earlier in the year, but the hope is that having the choice of different drugs will increase access to the treatment around the world.\n\nThe drugs can either be swallowed as tablets or given via intravenous drip.\n\nThe research so far has focused on low doses of steroids. There is no evidence that higher doses would be more effective.\n\nNew guidelines for doctors are expected to be released by the World Health Organization and in the UK by the chief medical advisor.",

    "Child type 1 diabetes fears amid drop in diagnoses": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "Parents have been urged to be alert to type 1 diabetes after the number of children presenting with symptoms fell by almost a third during the pandemic.\n\nBetween the end of March and middle of June, official figures show 33 children were diagnosed in Wales, compared to 48 during the same period last year.\n\nIf left untreated, children can develop life-threatening diabetic ketoacidosis.\n\nOne mother said she felt \"so lucky\" her eight-year-old son was diagnosed after she suspected a urine infection.\n\nTrudi, from Chepstow, Monmouthshire, said she initially put changes in Harrison's behaviour down to the coronavirus pandemic and lockdown.\n\nType 1 diabetes is an auto-immune condition which causes the level of glucose in the blood to become too high.\n\nIt happens when a person is unable to produce enough of the insulin hormone, which controls blood glucose.\n\nUnlike type 2 diabetes, it is not linked to age or weight. It can be treated by giving insulin injections.\n\n\"Type 1 diabetes can affect anyone,\" said Dai Williams, director of Diabetes UK Cymru.\n\n\"It's an auto-immune condition and it's just down to bad luck.\"\n\nExperts have warned that children who are not diagnosed may develop diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), a condition where harmful substances called ketones build up in the blood.\n\nThe condition is life-threatening if undiagnosed or untreated, although deaths among children are extremely rare.\n\nSymptoms of type 1 diabetes include increased thirst, use of the toilet, tiredness and weight loss.\n\nHarrison, who was diagnosed in May, would get upset easily but Trudi thought it was because he missed his father and school friends during lockdown.\n\nHe also started to wet the bed at night, something he had not done since he was a toddler.\n\n\"He was drinking more, going to the toilet more, but it was hot weather and so I didn't think any more about that,\" said Trudi.\n\n\"But then the accidents happened more frequently. I thought it was a urine infection so I rang the GP.\"\n\nTrudi was asked to take a urine sample at the surgery. Within minutes, the GP called her back and told her to take Harrison in urgently.\n\nA simple blood test confirmed he had type 1 diabetes and he was taken to hospital the same day.\n\nTrudi added: \"We were so lucky. Harrison was diagnosed about a week before most children, when the symptoms get a lot worse.\"\n\nFigures from the Children and Young People's Wales Diabetes Network show a 31.25% drop in diagnoses compared to the same period last year.\n\nDoctors are worried it is because parents did not know the symptoms or were afraid to access medical services during the pandemic.\n\nIt might be too early to tell whether this is the case, according to Davida Hawkes, who chairs the network and is a consultant paediatrician at the Royal Gwent Hospital in Newport.\n\n\"It seemed that there was a lull in the number of children presenting, but when we look at the figures overall, perhaps they will be equitable when we analyse them at the end of the year,\" Dr Hawkes said.\n\n\"We believe that families have been nervous about making contact with the medical profession, either via the GP or coming to a hospital, for fear of the widespread nature of the coronavirus, particularly at the beginning of the lockdown period.\n\n\"We were concerned that families were not presenting their children who might have symptoms of diabetes.\"",

    "Children's role in virus spread puzzles scientists": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "Children can carry coronavirus in their noses for up to three weeks, according to a study from South Korea.\n\nEarlier studies have found the vast majority of children with the virus have mild or no symptoms.\n\nBut these findings shed light on the unresolved question of how likely children are to spread the virus to others.\n\nThe study emphasises the continuing role of social distancing and good hygiene as children go back to school.\n\nThe president of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, Prof Russell Viner explains there are three separate, but linked questions about children and Covid-19:\n\nWhile we know for sure that children can catch the virus, Prof Viner says data from antibody blood tests suggest they may be less susceptible to catching it than adults - particularly children under the age of 12.\n\nAnd scientists are very confident that children are less likely to become ill than adults even if they do catch it, with many not showing any symptoms at all. That's what the British study, published on Friday, confirms.\n\nThe third question is the one we know least about, and it's this the South Korean study attempts to address.\n\nThe study, based on 91 children, found that even among those with few or no symptoms, virus could be found in their swabs as much as three weeks later.\n\nThe fact they had detectable virus in their noses, the authors concluded, suggested they were capable of passing it on.\n\nBecause of the way South Korea tested, traced and isolated cases, even those without symptoms, it is uniquely placed to look at this group.\n\nOnce they had identified and isolated cases, the patients were repeatedly tested until the virus had cleared.\n\nThe study was therefore able to give us some new information about children as carriers of the virus, and their potential capacity to be spreading it onwards.\n\nLike other studies, though, it still leaves a missing piece of the puzzle.\n\nJust because virus is found in a child's nose does not definitively prove they are transmitting it at the same rate as adults.\n\nDr Roberta DeBiasi, chief of the paediatric diseases division at the Children's National Hospital in Washington DC, said it would be \"illogical to think children have no role in transmission\" given they do carry the virus.\n\nBut professor of child health at the University of Liverpool, Prof Calum Semple said: \"The presence of the virus genetic material in swabs in the respiratory tract need not equate with transmission, particularly in people who do not have important symptoms such as cough and sneeze.\"\n\nLogic dictates that in both children and adults, people with no or few symptoms - who aren't coughing and projecting the virus into the air - are likely to be less infectious, and children generally get milder cases of the disease.\n\nBut significant numbers of asymptomatic people could still have a noticeable effect on the infection rate.\n\nAnd, as Prof Viner points out, keeping schools closed is not neutral either but poses its own set of risks - to children's development, education and mental health.\n\nWhile the exact risk children pose remains an open question for the moment, answering it will be vital to controlling future outbreaks.\n\nDr DeBiasi believes that while the \"vast majority of infected children have mild or unrecognised disease,\" they may play an \"important\" role in enabling the spread of infection through communities.",

Another claimed there \"wasn't much\" policing of rules, including making sure customers wore their masks properly.\n\nTravellers returning to the UK from Greece are currently exempt from quarantining.\n\nWhile the four nations can make different decisions about quarantine restrictions, one of the measures taken into consideration is what share of the population are infected every week.\n\nThe decision to add a country to the quarantine list is generally made when 20 or more people out of every 100,000 in a country are infected over seven days. But other factors are also considered.\n\nWhile Greece saw an increase in cases in recent weeks, this has stabilised with a rate of 13.7.\n\nPassengers returning from certain countries do not have to quarantine, but those returning from others will be asked to self-isolate for 14 days.\n\nThe Scottish government announced on Tuesday that more contact tracers will be recruited to support quarantine efforts.\n\nThe \u00a31m funding will pay for 25 additional members of staff who will be contacting passengers returning from places that are not exempt from quarantine.\n\nHealth Secretary Jeane Freeman said: \"Contacting people is vital to ensure those who are required to quarantine for 14 days are doing so.\"\n\nShe said the original plan was to make contact with about 20% of travellers, up to a maximum of 450 per week.\n\n\"At the time this was considered to be a robust sample size given the number of flights and passengers affected,\" she said. But as the number of flights into Scotland has increased, so has the number of passengers contacted - up to about 600 returning passengers per week.",

    "Coronavirus smell loss 'different from bad cold'": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "The loss of smell that can accompany coronavirus is unique and different from that experienced by someone with a bad cold or flu, say European researchers who have studied the experiences of patients.\n\nWhen Covid-19 patients have smell loss it tends to be sudden and severe.\n\nAnd they usually don't have a blocked, stuffy or runny nose - most people with coronavirus can still breathe freely.\n\nAnother thing that sets them apart is their \"true\" loss of taste.\n\nIt's not that their taste is somewhat impaired because their sense of smell is out of action, say the researchers in the journal Rhinology. Coronavirus patients with loss of taste really cannot tell the difference between bitter or sweet.\n\nExperts suspect this is because the pandemic virus affects the nerve cells directly involved with smell and taste sensation.\n\nThe main symptoms of coronavirus are:\n\nAnyone with these symptoms should self-isolate and arrange to have a swab test to check if they have the virus. Members of their household should isolate too to prevent possible spread.\n\nLead investigator Prof Carl Philpott, from the University of East Anglia, carried out smell and taste tests on 30 volunteers: 10 with Covid-19, 10 with bad colds and 10 healthy people with no cold or flu symptoms.\n\nSmell loss was much more profound in the Covid-19 patents. They were less able to identify smells, and they were not able to discern bitter or sweet tastes at all.\n\nProf Philpott, who works with the charity Fifth Sense, which was set up to help with people with smell and taste disorders, said: \"There really do appear to be distinguishing features that set the coronavirus apart from other respiratory viruses.\n\n\"This is very exciting because it means that smell and taste tests could be used to discriminate between Covid-19 patients and people with a regular cold or flu.\"\n\nHe said people could do their own smell and taste tests at home using products like coffee, garlic, oranges or lemons and sugar.\n\nHe stressed that diagnostic throat and nose swab tests were still essential if someone thought they might have coronavirus.\n\nThe senses of smell and taste return within a few weeks in most people who recover from coronavirus, he added.\n\nProf Andrew Lane is an expert in nose and sinus problems at Johns Hopkins University in the US.\n\nHe and his team have been studying tissue samples from the back of the nose to understand how coronavirus might cause loss of smell and have published the findings in the European Respiratory Journal.\n\nThey identified extremely high levels of an enzyme which were present only in the area of the nose responsible for smelling.\n\nThis enzyme, called ACE-2 (angiotensin converting enzyme II), is thought to be the \"entry point\" that allows coronavirus to get into the cells of the body and cause an infection.\n\nThe nose is one of the places where Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19, enters the body.\n\nProf Lane said: \"We are now doing more experiments in the lab to see whether the virus is indeed using these cells to access and infect the body.\n\n\"If that's the case, we may be able to tackle the infection with antiviral therapies delivered directly though the nose.\"",

        "authors": [],
        "body": "Health officials and government ministers - both in Wales and UK-wide - have been clear on one thing during the coronavirus pandemic: Testing for the virus is important.\n\nIt is the key pillar in the efforts to track and trace those with Covid-19.\n\nBut just how well - or perhaps more importantly - how fast are those test results being turned around in Wales?\n\nLast week, 56% of 18,000 tests taken to Welsh laboratories were being processed within a day.\n\nMore than half of the tests were part of the routine surveillance to check care home workers who might have the virus, but were not showing symptoms.\n\nJust over a third of those results came back within 24 hours.\n\nSo-called on-demand tests, where swabs are taken at drive-through centres or community hubs, hit the 24-hour target in 70% of cases, while it was 88% for hospital-based tests.\n\nPerformance on these tests, unlike the care home tests, has been gradually improving over the past couple of months.\n\nThe Welsh government said it wanted to increase the operating hours of Welsh laboratories as they are not open 24 hours a day.\n\nIt is also trying to speed up the transportation of samples and the time taken to process tests in the labs.\n\nHow fast should tests be processed?\n\nThe Welsh government wants tests to be processed within 24 hours, but the statistics have consistently shown that in many cases it isn't happening.\n\nWhere are coronavirus test samples sent to be processed?\n\nAfter the swab is taken, a sample is either sent to an NHS Wales laboratory or a Lighthouse Lab, a network of specialist covid laboratories in England and Scotland.\n\nWales has mainly been using the ones in Milton Keynes and Manchester, but a Lighthouse Lab is due to open in Newport soon.\n\nSo far, more than 440,000 tests have been carried out on people in Wales.\n\nMost have been processed at NHS Wales labs, but nearly 150,000 have been processed in Lighthouse Labs.\n\nHow many are being turned around in 24 hours?\n\nThe statistics measure the time from a sample being collected, when someone has a swab taken, to the moment the result is confirmed in the lab and becomes available for contact tracing.\n\nThe length of time it takes for people to then be notified of their result is not recorded in the data.\n\nFifty per cent of the NHS Wales lab tests have been turned around in 24 hours, while it is 53% for the Lighthouse Labs.\n\nHowever, a closer look at the figures shows there are big variations, depending on where the sample was taken.\n\nFor Lighthouse Labs, tests gathered at testing centres (the drive-through ones or smaller community test centres) are nearly always processed within 24 hours - 95% of more than 20,000 tests done this way met the target.\n\nWhere the Lighthouse Labs are slower is on tests done at home and tests ordered by care homes and sent in batches to the labs.\n\nHome tests are slower because they are posted, rather than couriered, to the labs.\n\nCare home tests are slower because they are sent in a batch once a certain number of staff have been tested.\n\nFirst Minister Mark Drakeford feels the 24-hour measure is less important for these tests, because unlike those done at the testing centres and in hospitals, they are mainly of asymptomatic people and only a very small proportion are positive.\n\nNHS Wales labs have appeared to be significantly slower at turning round results from the drive-through and community test centres.\n\nData up to last week showed only 42% of drive-through tests came back within 24 hours and just 39% of those from community testing units. In some weeks the figures have been as low as 25%\n\nHowever, the way the data was recorded meant many routine tests of asymptomatic care home workers were included in those figures.\n\nNow government statisticians have separated out the routine care home tests.\n\nThis first week of new data shows that over the past seven weeks, NHS Wales labs have processed 56% of \"on-demand\" tests done at drive-through and community testing sites, and last week the figure was 70%\n\nPerformance here is broadly improving but is still some way off the speed of the Lighthouse Labs.\n\nHow can the tests get quicker?\n\nMr Drakeford said he wanted to \"simplify and accelerate\" the system.\n\nSamples done at test centres are couriered to the labs and he number of courier collections has been increased, but there is still work being done to try to make the system more efficient.\n\nThe timing of sample delivery is being looked at because if lots of tests arrive at once, that creates a backlog.\n\nMr Drakeford previously pointed out that the way samples were time-stamped was problematic because even if a test arrives late in the day it is simply recorded as arriving on that calendar day, rather than the exact time it arrived, so has little chance of meeting the 24-hour target.\n\nAre samples tested around the clock?\n\nGovernment officials also want to improve machinery at the labs.\n\nUnlike the Lighthouse Labs, NHS Wales labs are not operational 24 hours a day.\n\nRecruitment and training may need to happen to move to a 24-hour operation to cope with any increase in cases in the winter.\n\nDuring the recent outbreak in Wrexham, a regional lab in north Wales was put onto a 24-hour operation. Mr Drakeford has said more than 95% of samples from the community testing programme in Wrexham were processed within 24 hours.",

The government is facing mounting criticism over its handling of the exams process, after almost 40% of all grades were marked down from teachers' predictions. Neither A-level nor GCSE students were able to sit public exams this year because of the pandemic.\n\nWith schools due to reopen in September, the government is trying to persuade parents in England that it will be safe for their children to return to the classroom. Under the #backtoschoolsafely slogan, the new campaign will highlight the various measures being implicated to minimise the risk of coronavirus transmission. It comes after Boris Johnson said there was a \"moral duty\" to get pupils back to the classroom. So, will pupils do a full school day next term?\n\nRestaurants and pubs have seen a surge in demand because of the Treasury's discounts of up to \u00a310 on meals out - but in some places, owners say it has led to staff being shouted at, and \"physical and mental stress\". Some venues in tourist-heavy areas have pulled out of the scheme, saying the demand has made it hard to manage social distancing and prompted \"unwelcome behaviour\" from disappointed customers.\n\nCoronavirus patients who have lived with symptoms for up to five months have spoken about the huge impact it has had on their lives.\n\nYou can't stop the music, as one old disco song says - but one way or another, coronavirus has come pretty close. Record shops shut, labels struggled and the flow of new album releases slowed to a trickle at the height of the pandemic. However, in lockdown we have learnt to order more albums online and the way we use music streaming services has changed as well.

Meanwhile for Aberdeen's hospitality workers, the latest localised lockdown measures have made the pandemic feel \"never ending\".\n\nAll school pupils in Northern Ireland will return to the classroom full-time next month, ministers have announced. Rules will also be introduced requiring the wearing of face coverings in shops, bringing the region in line with England and Scotland. It comes as the reopening of pubs that only sell drinks in Northern Ireland is delayed until at least 1 September.\n\nThe London Marathon usually takes place in April but this year's race was postponed until October. But today organisers have announced the event will only involve elite athletes - with the event cancelled for the 45,000 other runners. Next year's event will also take place in October, rather than a date in April.\n\nWith kids off school and lockdown easing, childcare has become a summer issue for many parents returning to work.

        "authors": [],
        "body": "The latest Covid-19 reproduction number (R) in Northern Ireland has been estimated at between 1.2 and 2.0.\n\nThe Department of Health said this means R is likely to be about 1.6 at present.\n\nR represents the number of individuals who, on average, will be infected by a single person with coronavirus.\n\nIt does not have a fixed value but varies with time, and is likely to be different every day.\n\nThe department also said the seven-day rolling average for new cases has more than doubled in the past week.\n\nNew figures from the Public Health Agency (PHA) show there have been 31 Covid-19 clusters so far in Northern Ireland since the start of contact tracing on 24 May.\n\nA total of 11 clusters have been identified involving five or more people, while in addition there have been 20 clusters with fewer than five.\n\nThe PHA data identifies for the first time the number of clusters.\n\nCouncil areas are also named, highlighting the areas affected:\n\nA cluster is defined as two or more laboratory-confirmed cases of Covid-19 among individuals, associated with a key setting and with illness occurring within 14 days.\n\nThe PHA said its contact tracing scheme was \"continuing to engage successfully with the vast majority of identified contacts.\"\n\nSince July, the average number of close contacts linked to cases has more than doubled.\n\nIt is thought the rise is due to the gradual easing of lockdown restrictions and also attitudes towards social distancing becoming more relaxed.\n\nThe head of health protection at the PHA, Gerry Waldron, said: \"This is an important reminder that we must not become complacent - coronavirus remains in circulation, so each of us has a responsibility to take steps to help keep ourselves and those around us safe.\n\n\"Everyone should act on the basis that it might potentially be in your neighbourhood right now, rather than waiting for it to emerge in your local area or for rumours to circulate before taking steps to help protect yourself and others.\n\n\"That's why following the public health advice remains vitally important. You can spread the virus even if you don't have symptoms, so taking these steps and exercising good hygiene practices will help prevent cases and reduce the number of clusters.\n\n\"Our analysis of clusters to date has shown that they have been associated with both workplaces and in the community, such as domestic gatherings and in hospitality and sporting settings.\"\n\nOver the past seven days the number of positive tests reported to the contact tracing scheme was 223 - the number of positive cases requiring contact tracing was 196.\n\nThere were 186 positive cases that completed contact tracing and in total 713 contacts identified. Of those, 695 were successfully contacted and advised.\n\nAccording to separate data produced by the Department of Health, three care homes are currently affected by a Covid outbreak.\n\nResidents in care homes who test positive are not included in the contact tracing data,. Those who test positive are followed up under separate health protection information.\n\nThe figures were updated at 17:00 BST on 12 August.\n\nDr Waldron added: \"Clusters are managed through the contact tracing programme, and where we need to advise or inform the public of any increased risk to public health we will do so in a timely manner.\"",

        "body": "Premises are being contacted over claims holidaymakers - who have suspected coronavirus symptoms - came home from Zante and mixed with others.\n\nPeople who went out in Maesteg, Bridgend county, at the weekend have been urged to be alert to the symptoms.\n\nA local councillor claimed someone had returned from Zakynthos and had been socialising before testing positive.\n\nBridgend council said it was liaising with \"establishments where it is alleged these individuals were out\".\n\nThe authority's leader, Huw David, said: \"We need to be very clear with people - they are risking other people's health and other people's lives, if they're asymptomatic and going out and mixing in the local community.\n\n\"They could be putting their family members and friends at risk. We are urging them to be careful and think about other members of the community.\"\n\nTravellers arriving to Wales from the Greek island have since been asked to self-isolate after a cluster of cases.\n\nHealth Minister Vaughan Gething said tracing could not reach everyone because of people providing false information.\n\nIt comes after criticism that some passengers returning to Cardiff from Zante were not informed for a week that they had to self-isolate.\n\nA Bridgend council spokesman said: \"We have been made aware of social media stories circulating of individuals in the Maesteg area who have returned from Zante and who are potentially showing Covid-19 symptoms.\n\n\"Anyone who may believe they have come into contact with individuals who have returned from Zante must be alert to the signs of symptoms of Covid-19.\"\n\nPublic Health Wales said its investigations into cases of coronavirus in Wales \"have indicated that a lack of social distancing, in particular by a minority of the 20-30 year age group, has resulted in the spread of the virus to other groups of people\".\n\n\"We would make a direct appeal to young people to remember that even if they feel that they would not be badly affected by Covid-19 were they to test positive, should they pass it on to older or more vulnerable family members, friends or colleagues it could be extremely serious, and even fatal,\" a statement said.\n\nMaesteg East councillor Keith Edwards said he had been told one holidaymaker had returned \"but before waiting for the result, he socialised in and around the town, then was notified he was positive\".\n\n\"Some pubs have had companies in to clean - staff being tested,\" he added.\n\nKelly John, who owns a beauty salon in the town, has decided to close temporarily after one of her clients was with a man who tested positive after returning from Zante.\n\nShe said: \"Yesterday, I had my afternoon client here and she received a message while having her nails done basically saying a boy she was with on the weekend had tested positive for coronavirus but he did land from Zante on Thursday. I had to close instantly then.\n\n\"Only a month ago I opened, so I'm back to square one again now.\n\n\"I've just had my coronavirus test done and they've told me I have to wait 72 hours for the results so I'll have to remain closed until then.\"\n\nMaesteg Harelquins cancelled Tuesday's session as a result of the concerns that people who had tested positive may have mixed with players over the weekend.\n\nAnd Maesteg Celtic rugby club tweeted to say it was bringing in a cleaning company due to the \"current situation\" and following advice from the council.\n\nOgmore MP Chris Elmore and Member of the Senedd Huw Irranca-Davies issued a joint statement saying they were pleased the council was \"contacting various local establishments where it is alleged that individuals were out over the weekend and are also providing clear advice and support\".\n\nTravel company Tui has cancelled all holidays to the resort of Laganas on the Greek island, because of customers failing to follow coronavirus safety measures.\n\nTravellers arriving into Wales from Zante are being asked to self-isolate for 14 days following six clusters of cases, amounting to 30 infections, linked to flights from there.\n\nThey will also be offered two Covid-19 tests - one in 48 hours and another in eight days.\n\nTesting passengers at Cardiff Airport is now being considered.\n\nSome passengers on board a Zante to Cardiff flight last week have complained they were not told to self-isolate straight away.\n\nLee Evans said \"someone needs to be held to account\" after an email telling him and his family to self-isolate came almost a week after the flight.\n\nAnother passenger, Victoria Webb, said she only became aware of the outbreak when her mother sent her a link to the BBC News story as she travelled home to London from Cardiff.\n\nMr Gething said the contact tracing system was reaching more than 90% of people.\n\n\"The reason we're never going to have 100% contact tracing over the whole service is because some people don't want to be contacted and have given deliberately misleading information to the service,\" he said.\n\n\"The contact tracing service does rely on people being responsible and giving honest information.\n\n\"If they don't, then those people are risking their health and the health of those around them and in their community.\n\n\"There is a back-stop and anyone we don't speak to on the phone within a couple of days is written to. But people need to do the right thing if we're going to avoid another big wave as we saw in the spring.\"\n\nWelsh Conservative Senedd member Andrew RT Davies called for the health minister to \"get his act together\" and introduce testing for arriving passengers at Cardiff Airport.\n\nThe airport's chief executive, Spencer Birns, has asked the UK government for clarity on testing and backed calls for a \"robust testing system... to help give airline passengers confidence to travel again\".\n\nThe health minister said he had not ruled out further travel restrictions on Greece with the Scottish government imposing quarantine restrictions on people arriving from the country from Thursday.\n\nMr Gething said he was expecting a report from the UK government's Joint Biosecurity Centre on Greece later on Wednesday and he had sought a meeting with other UK ministers to discuss possible quarantine rules.\n\nHe added: \"Anyone who is going abroad needs to accept they are taking a risk, and the rules could change whilst they're abroad or whilst they're in the air.\"\n\nHowever the Welsh Government's approach of targeting specific outbreak areas, rather than blanket bans on entire countries, has been praised.\n\nTravel expert Simon Calder said the policy could set the benchmark for the rest of the UK.\n\n\"The Welsh health minister has done exactly what the travel industry has been calling for and that's to have targeted measures aimed at specific hot spots rather than whole countries being written off over-night,\" he said.\n\n\"It's extraordinarily confusing for travellers because we have the bizarre situation where everything is fragmented between the four home nations.\n\n\"The UK government has been trying to hold things together but the move by Wales last night took everyone by surprise and could become the model of what we see in the future.\"\n\nLucy Griffiths, of Cardiff, had just arrived in Zante with her children when the announcement was made.\n\n\"We discovered that [the rules had changed] when we landed and turned our phones on, and discovered that everyone had sent us messages,\" she said.\n\n\"Covid is everywhere, so I could contract it going to the supermarket at home. I don't see the difference being in another country.\n\n\"Sadly I was made redundant during the lockdown, so I haven't actually got a job to go home to, but my children are going to miss more of school than we had originally planned.\"\n\nEllis and Jennifer Roberts, from Anglesey, are due to fly back to Liverpool on Thursday but said they felt safe on holiday.\n\n\"Laganas is the area they are most concerned about, that's where all the young people go. But we're staying in a small village, Alykes, and it's possibly safer than on Anglesey,\" said Mrs Roberts.\n\n\"We don't regret going on holiday. We cancelled going to Skiathos last month and found things were getting better so decided to come. I'll have to ask the boss if I can work from home for another two weeks.\"",

    "Covid-19 smell loss 'made meat taste like petrol'": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "Losing the ability to smell or taste are two of the symptoms associated with Covid-19. But while many have regained their senses, for others it has turned into a phenomenon called parosmia, leaving them trapped in a world of distorted scents.\n\nFor Kate McHenry, simple tap water triggers an awful stench. That, along with the horrible smell she experiences from body wash, means taking a shower is something to be endured.\n\n\"My Aussie shampoo used to be my favourite, but now it's the most disgusting smell in the world,\" she says.\n\nAfter falling mildly ill in March with suspected coronavirus, the 37-year-old, from Widnes in Cheshire, was unable to smell anything at all for four weeks before the sense slowly returned. But by mid-June things \"started to taste really weird\" with odours being replaced by a \"horrible, chemical\" stench.\n\nIt has had a life-changing effect on Kate - she has lost weight, struggles with anxiety and is starved of the pleasures of eating, drinking and socialising. The problem is so bad that even in places where food is being cooked, she is overwhelmed by the apparent stench.\n\nShe is scared she will be left without her sense of smell forever.\n\n\"I love nice meals, going out to restaurants, having a drink with friends but now all that has gone. Meat tastes like petrol and prosecco tastes like rotting apples. If my partner, Craig, has a curry the smell is awful. It even comes out of his pores so I struggle to go anywhere near him.\n\n\"I get upset in the evenings when I cook. Craig will say 'what do you fancy to eat?' and I feel really bad because there's nothing I want - I know everything is going to taste horrendous. The implications it's had on my life are huge and I am so scared I'll be stuck like this forever.\"\n\nPeople with Covid-19 lose their sense of smell - known as anosmia - because the virus damages the tissue and nerve endings in their nose. It is when those nerves are regrowing that parosmia can happen and the brain is unable to properly identify an odour's real smell.\n\nThe condition is normally linked to common colds, sinus problems and head injuries. Sufferers describe being able to smell burning, cigarette smoke or rotting meat. In severe cases, the smell is vomit-inducing.\n\nAlthough professionals are hopeful parosmia is a sign of recovery to restored smell, for some people it can take years to pass.\n\nFor Pasquale Hester, from Leeds, toothpaste is one of the worst culprits. The chemical taste makes her retch so much so she has resorted to brushing her teeth with salt, which tastes normal to her. Like many affected by Covid-19, it was weeks before she had an improved sense of smell after being ill with the suspected virus. But then when she ate a curry for her birthday in June, she realised her scent was distorted.\n\n\"I had a poppadum but spat it out straightaway because it tasted like paint. Some things are more bearable than others,\" said Pasquale, 34. \"Coffee, onion and garlic are the absolute worst. All I can manage to get down me some days are sugar snap peas and cheese.\n\n\"Losing my smell was mentally a struggle, but this has completely blown me away. I wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy.\"\n\nLaw student Brooke Jones began getting symptoms in April and tested positive for Covid-19 a week later. She describes almost everything she smells as like \"rotting meat mixed with something off a farm\". The 20-year-old, from Bradford, has a list of \"safe foods\" that she can just about tolerate - toaster waffles, cucumber and tomatoes. Anything else and she just puts up with the unpleasantness.\n\n\"I think now I can imagine what things taste like. So when I'm eating a Chinese [takeaway], even though it's not particularly nice, I can convince myself that it isn't too bad.\"\n\nWhile the numbers of Covid patients experiencing parosmia is not known, it is estimated hundreds of thousands have suffered anosmia.\n\nProf Claire Hopkins, president of the British Rhinological Society (BRS), said there is \"widely-held incorrect belief\" that smell blindness from the virus is short-lived.\n\n\"Yes, there is a good chance of recovery but there are huge amounts of people who will lose their smell for a long period of time and the impact of that has been completely overlooked.\"\n\nSmell plays an important role in memory, mood and emotion and those suffering dysfunction describe feeling isolated, said Prof Hopkins.\n\nWhile anosmia is bewildering, parosmia can be unbearable and only in very extreme circumstances can medicine, in the form of an antiepileptic drug, be prescribed.\n\nProf Hopkins said patients were finding it difficult to access help for smell problems and she is working with the NHS to change that.\n\n\"GPs are playing catch-up and probably most doctors have not come across a patient with anosmia before. There aren't many silver linings from the pandemic but if we can use it to educate health professionals better about smell loss and better understand the mental and physical impact, then that is a huge step forward.\"\n\nIn the absence of a cure, sufferers are getting help and support from smell loss charity AbScent, which has set up a Facebook group for those affected through the pandemic. With input from the BRS, the charity has produced an information guide for people experiencing Covid-related smell loss, including details of which foods to eat and how to go about smell training.\n\nIts founder, Chrissi Kelly, said: \"The most important thing for people is to see that others are in the same boat and to be able to share openly and have this big conversation.\"\n\nThe Facebook group also serves as platform for anosmia and parosmia sufferers who are fighting to get their condition understood.\n\nBrooke added: \"When I try and explain it, some people think it's funny and make a joke - that at least I can't smell bad stuff. I know the effects of Covid could have been much worse, but it does get to me and it's scary that no-one seems to be able to tell you when or if it will ever get any better.\"",

Five passengers have so far tested positive out of 387 who have travelled on the ship since 17 July.\n\n\"We expect that more infections will be found in connection to this outbreak,\" Line Vold, a health official, told Reuters news agency.\n\nThe MS Roald Amundsen had been on a week-long voyage to Svalbard in the Arctic, and was also reportedly scheduled to visit ports in England and Scotland in September.\n\nBut all future journeys are uncertain as the cruise industry finds itself affected by the coronavirus pandemic once again. Thousands of passengers were stranded at sea earlier this year as ships were hit by outbreaks of the virus.\n\nThese included passengers on the MS Roald Amundsen, which was stranded for several days in March after Chile refused it entry because it had confirmed Covid-19 cases on board.\n\nAnd while the industry has restarted in recent weeks, there have already been setbacks.\n\nA crew member on a ship in the Pacific tested positive for the virus on Sunday. The Paul Gauguin was forced to suspend its journey when the case was detected by the ship's doctor, local media report.\n\nPassengers were told to stay in their cabins as the ship turned back to Papeete on the island of Tahiti, where all on board are being tested.\n\nAhead of resuming operations, Ponant, the company that runs the Paul Gauguin, had reassured customers in a blog post that it had strict regulations in place that \"go further than the international standards for the sector\".",

        "authors": [],
        "body": "England's revamped coronavirus contact-tracing app is set to begin public trials on Thursday.\n\nThe software will be based on Apple and Google's privacy-centric method of one smartphone detecting another.\n\nEngineers are still trying to reduce how often the Bluetooth-based tech wrongly flags people as being within 2m (6.6ft) of each other.\n\nOfficials are concerned about people going into quarantine as a consequence.\n\nThe Isle of Wight will be involved again. The government intends to launch the experiment without much fanfare, because it is still not clear when a national rollout will occur.\n\nThe idea behind the app is to use people's phones to log when they have been close to another person for so long, that there is a high risk of contagion.\n\nIf one user is later diagnosed with the disease, the other person can be alerted to the fact before they begin exhibiting symptoms.\n\nIn addition, users will also be asked to scan a QR barcode when they enter a property, to provide a means to later alert them to the fact that they visited a location linked to multiple infections.\n\n\"We need the app to help stop transmission by tracing close-proximity contacts as quickly and as comprehensively as possible, capturing those contacts we don't know or don't remember meeting,\" Prof Christophe Fraser, a scientific advisor to the Department of Health from Oxford University, told the BBC.\n\n\"The app should enable us to return to more normal daily activities with the reassurance that our contacts can be rapidly and anonymously notified if we get infected.\"\n\nBaroness Dido Harding - who heads up the wider Test and Trace programme - cancelled an earlier trial on the Isle of Wight in June.\n\nThis was because an app based on an alternative system spearheaded by NHSX - the health service's digital innovation unit - had to deal with restrictions Apple imposes on how Bluetooth is used by third-party apps.\n\nAs a result, it only detected 4% of iPhones in cases where the app had gone to sleep because the two handsets involved had not been in recent active use.\n\nThis prompted a switch to the Apple-Google solution, which does not have this problem.\n\nBut at the time, Baroness Harding said the US tech giant's alternative had a different issue.\n\nShe said it could not measure distance well enough to be trusted to direct people to self-isolate for a fortnight.\n\nThis has not prevented other places - including Northern Ireland - launching apps based on the technology.\n\nBut ongoing tests indicate that England's new app is still worse at determining distance than the original NHS Covid-19 product.\n\nConfusingly, there have even been cases when the further two handsets are spaced apart beyond 2m from each other, the more likely the software is to indicate that they are too close.\n\nPart of the problem with the Apple-Google framework is that the tech firms have decided that developers should not get access to raw attenuation data - a measure of changes in Bluetooth signal strength.\n\nInstead, it provides a more basic set of readings that an app can use to calculate its own risk scores - the idea being that this helps preserve users' anonymity.\n\nBut one consequence of this, is that engineers have not been able to take advantage of a technique developed by researchers at the UK's Turing Institute and the University of Oxford. It filters the data to give a better indication of proximity.\n\nSeveral countries have asked the two tech firms to relax their restrictions, although they are cautious about discussing the matter in public. Many of those involved have signed non-disclosure agreements with Apple and Google.\n\nA possible compromise would be for Apple and Google to incorporate the filter into their own tool. But they have yet to give a commitment to do so.\n\nThe team behind England's app hopes it can still improve the accuracy rate to a high enough - but not perfect - level by the end of the year.\n\nThis would give the Test and Trace team the confidence to include an alert directing users to stay at home when required.\n\nBut those involved believe there is still a \"significant risk\" this will not be achievable.\n\nIn the meantime, the new Isle of Wight trial will allow them to see how the software behaves in real-world situations, to help further their endeavours.",

        "body": "A fifth Lanarkshire school pupil has tested positive for Covid-19 amid concern the virus is being transmitted at indoor social gatherings.\n\nThe pupil at Caldervale High School in Airdrie attended school on Thursday.\n\nHowever officials say there is no evidence to suggest the virus is being spread at the school and it will reopen as normal on Monday.\n\nThe latest positive case is linked to seven others in Lanarkshire, including pupils from two other schools.\n\nAn investigation is under way into the outbreak, which also includes:\n\nDr David Cromie, NHS Lanarkshire consultant in public health, said: \"There is evidence that mixing socially in the community, particularly around social gatherings in houses, without maintaining physical distancing measures can transmit the virus and is a factor in this investigation.\"\n\nHe said contact tracers were getting in touch with people who have been in close contact with the latest positive case.\n\n\"NHS Lanarkshire is working closely with North Lanarkshire Council and the school to identify all close contacts of the case who are being given public health advice and being told to self-isolate,\" he added.\n\n\"With the route of transmission likely to be through indoor social gatherings, I would urge all parents and young people to stick to the Scottish government rules in order to avoid future cases within the community resulting in cases in the local schools.\"\n\nNo more than eight people from a maximum of three households are allowed to gather indoors.\n\nSocial distancing applies to anyone from separate households, unless they are under the age of 12.\n\nNHS Lanarkshire said the Caldervale High School pupil was isolating at home with their family.\n\nIt said all parents of pupils at the school had been notified of the development.\n\nDr Cromie added: \"We are aware that there will still be concern both for pupils and their parents/carers at this time and I wanted to reassure them that all settings which the individual has attended during their infectious period are being identified and assessed.\"\n\nHe urged people to wash their hands thoroughly and regularly and he reminded them they should stay off school or work if they experience any Covid symptoms, even if they are mild.\n\nDerek Brown, of North Lanarkshire Council, said the local authority was supporting the incident management team led by NHS Lanarkshire.\n\n\"We will continue to respond to advice from NHS Lanarkshire and provide information and reassurance to parents and carers, pupils and staff,\" he added.\n\n\"We fully understand that parents and pupils will be anxious. No blame is attached to anyone who is interviewed by Test and Protect but it is important that as much information as possible is given.\n\n\"In addition, pupil support within schools is available to any pupil who is anxious or has concerns.\"\n\nThe development emerged as the number of coronavirus cases in Scotland rose by 43 in the last 24 hours.\n\nIt included one new case in Orkney, which has been linked to an outbreak among the crew of a fishing vessel.\n\nThere have been no deaths of people who have tested positive for the virus since 15 July.\n\nMeanwhile, the Victoria Bar in Edinburgh has temporarily closed after a customer confirmed overnight they had tested positive for Covid-19 following a recent holiday in Malta.\n\nOwners Boda Bars said the pub, on Leith Walk, will be shut until Friday and all staff that were on duty when the customer visited will self-isolate for the next 14 days.\n\nIt confirmed the customer visited the bar between 16:45 and 18:00 on Friday.",

        "body": "A Florida sheriff has banned staff from wearing face masks at work.\n\nMarion County Sheriff Billy Woods's order also includes visitors to the office. It is thought to be the first such mask ban for US law enforcement.\n\nSheriff Woods said it was vital that officers' orders were clearly understood and that anyone coming to the station be identifiable.\n\nFlorida is one of the states hardest hit by the coronavirus pandemic, with over 550,000 cases and 8,700 deaths.\n\nSherriff Woods' order, issued on Tuesday, has some exemptions, including for those working in jails where the infection risk is higher, or at the county courthouse, hospitals or schools.\n\nMore than 200 inmates at the county's jail have tested positive, according to the Ocala-Star Banner, which first reported on the mask ban.\n\nAt least 36 jail employees have also tested positive, and an infected nurse who worked there has died, the newspaper reported.\n\nSheriff Woods, whose jurisdiction is about 80 miles north of Orlando (130km), also said visitors must remove their masks before entering the lobby of the station, linking his decision to recent protests against police brutality and racism.\n\n\"In light of the current events when it comes to the sentiment and/or hatred toward law enforcement in our country today, this is being done to ensure there is clear communication and for identification purposes of any individual walking into a lobby,\" he wrote in an email to employees.\n\nIn his email, Mr Woods says he has carefully studied the issue and has found the evidence for wearing a mask to be inconclusive.\n\nGlobal health experts universally agree that wearing a mask over your face and nose is necessary to prevent the spread of moisture droplets that can carry the virus. Infected individuals may not experience symptoms of illness, making it necessary for everyone to wear a mask - in addition to social distancing and hand washing.\n\nThe US currently has 5.2m infections - far more than any other country - and over 166,000 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University.\n\nThe wearing of masks has been fiercely debated along political lines in the US, with President Donald Trump refusing to wear one in public for months.\n\n\"I'm getting used to wearing a mask,\" he told reporters in July. He had previously mocked political opponents and journalists for wearing them.\n\nWearing a mask in the US has often acquired political connotations - Republican supporters of Mr Trump are less likely to don masks than Democrats.\n\nAccording to a New York Times analysis of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data, there have been around 200,000 so-called \"excess deaths\" in the US during the pandemic - meaning some 60,000 more deaths have to be added to the existing toll.",

    "Flu vaccination rates prompt complacency warning": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "Complacency over the flu jab risks overwhelming the NHS, experts warn, as data reveals the scale of the challenge in expanding the vaccination programme.\n\nLast month, the government announced plans to double the number of people who receive the influenza jab.\n\nBut BBC analysis has found the take-up rate among people in vulnerable groups eligible for a free jab has declined.\n\nHealth Secretary Matt Hancock said he did not want a flu outbreak \"at the same time as dealing with coronavirus\".\n\nThe government wants to increase the number of people vaccinated from 15 million to 30 million amid fears coronavirus cases will rise again in the autumn.\n\nLocal authorities in England saw an average 45% of people with serious health conditions under 65 take up the offer of a free vaccine last winter, data shows. That represents a drop from 50% in 2015.\n\nThe UK government has an ambition to vaccinate 55% of people in vulnerable groups, which includes people with multiple sclerosis (MS), diabetes or chronic asthma.\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) has previously said countries should vaccinate 75% of people in \"vulnerable\" categories.\n\nPublic Health England says the jab - which in recent years has been freely available to over 65s, those with long running health conditions and pregnant women, among others - is the most effective way to reduce pressures on intensive care units.\n\nMr Hancock told BBC Breakfast the government was expanding its flu vaccination programme this year because \"we don't want a flu outbreak at the same time as dealing with coronavirus\".\n\n\"We have bought more flu vaccine than ever before,\" he said.\n\n\"In fact we have changed the law so that more people can administer the jab. We want pharmacists, nurses and GPs to be able to administer the jab.\"\n\nThe prospect of a surge in flu cases over winter is also of concern to many people still suffering from what has been dubbed \"long Covid\".\n\nThat is where coronavirus patients experience symptoms such as extreme fatigue and breathlessness long after two weeks.\n\nJeanne Jarvis-Gibson, a digital culture and communications student at the University of Liverpool, is one of many long Covid sufferers to join a growing online community.\n\nThe 27-year-old, from Washington in the United States, used to be a keen runner - but now has to take a steroid inhaler and struggles to walk up stairs at her university halls.\n\nShe said: \"I think getting the flu vaccine is vital now more than ever with the possible co-mingling of Covid and flu.\n\n\"I would think about it in the same way as wearing a mask when you go out. It's about mutual respect for people.\n\n\"It's more than just your own health - we have to think about everyone in our society.\"\n\nDr Tonia Thomas, project manager at the Vaccine Knowledge Trust, which is part of the University of Oxford, said: \"People think the flu is not that bad, that is even for people who are in the risk groups.\n\n\"They are leading healthy lives in terms of day-to-day living. I have spoken to patients who say they forgot they are in a risk group.\n\n\"It is only when they contract an infection that they realise their body responds differently to other people's.\"\n\nThe uptake rate among over-65s has remained consistent in recent years, however. Last winter, 73% took up the offer.\n\nBy BBC Health Correspondent Smitha Mundasad\n\nHealth officials are ramping up efforts to ensure everyone who needs a flu vaccine gets one this year - with around 30 million people being offered them in the UK's largest ever flu immunisation programme.\n\nBut how will it work? And will things be worse this year?\n\nContinue reading here.\n\nFlu, which can be deadly or need hospital treatment, poses additional threats during this year - as a big flu season combined with a fresh surge of coronavirus cases could overwhelm hospitals.\n\nBetween September 2019 and February this year, almost 8,000 people died from flu in England alone.\n\nBut the number has varied. In 2017 and 2018, more than 22,000 people died from the virus.\n\nDuring the 2019-20 flu season, 3.16 million people under the age of 65 with a serious health condition were vaccinated, 130,000 more than there were five years before.\n\nBut taking into account factors such as population growth, the proportion of vulnerable people receiving the jab has fallen.\n\nFigures from the last winter flu season show local authorities in England averaged just 45%. In Scotland it was 43%, Northern Ireland 52% and Wales 44%.\n\nLondon and the east of England are suffering from particularly low uptake rates among vulnerable patients and in schools.\n\nOnly 29% of people under the age of 65 with a serious health condition took up the jab in Hammersmith and Fulham last winter.\n\nWhile the government is aiming for a \"universal\" uptake of the flu vaccine among health workers, it has also remained historically low in some parts of the NHS and, in particular, mental health care providers.\n\nAt West London NHS Trust, which looks after mental health patients in Hammersmith and Ealing, some 1,471 of its 2,880 front-line staff took the jab last winter.\n\n\"Our current position remains unacceptably low,\" said Stephanie Bridger, director of nursing and patient experience.\n\n\"This year - in the context of Covid-19 - we are redoubling our efforts to promote the critical importance of having the flu vaccination as early as possible.\"\n\nProf Heidi Larson, from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, is a world-leading expert on attitudes towards immunisation and a director of the International Vaccine Confidence Project.\n\nWhile many fear the jab or nasal spray can cause illness, she believes most underestimate the severity of flu.\n\n\"I find there is almost a complacency around the vaccine in the UK,\" she said.\n\n\"It doesn't have the same aggressive 'anti' sentiment we see against some of the childhood vaccines.\"\n\nEarly surveys carried out by the Vaccine Confidence Project show that, in Europe, there is growing support for the flu vaccine as people are concerned about a second Covid-19 wave.\n\nHowever, Prof Larson said many did not take the vaccine for legitimate reasons, particularly as the nasal spray given to children contains porcine gelatine.\n\nIt is not suitable for vegetarians and, last year, the Muslim Council of Britain said it was not permitted in Islam except under exceptional health circumstances.\n\n\"There are also people that say it doesn't work enough, it's not effective enough,\" Prof Larson added.\n\n\"Some years it really isn't that effective against all strains.\n\n\"But I would certainly urge people to take it anyway as you wouldn't want the strains that it does protect against.\n\n\"It's also so important to limit the stress on the system.\n\n\"Two or three years ago the Red Cross had to come in to handle a bad flu season on its own.\"\n\nPrevious government flu campaigns have also failed to address the \"myth\" that the vaccine can cause illness, according to leading virologist Prof Wendy Barclay, head of the department of infectious diseases at Imperial College London.\n\nShe believes this puts many parents off allowing their children to take the nasal spray.\n\nIn the capital, only 50% of eligible schoolchildren had the free vaccine last winter.\n\nProf Barclay said: \"My issue with Public Health England is if they don't make the message strong enough - so parents think: 'It's only the flu, my kids will be fine'.\"\n\nMeanwhile, there will be a renewed push to persuade health and care workers to have the vaccine. Last year, 74% of staff were immunised.\n\nPaulette Hamilton, from the Local Government Association, said: \"It is absolutely critical that all our health and care workers get themselves vaccinated, to protect both themselves and the people they look after, including our elderly and most vulnerable, from a potentially devastating second wave of infections.\"\n\nA spokeswoman for the Department for Health and Social Care said the UK had some of the best flu vaccine uptake rates across Europe.\n\nShe said: \"Flu vaccine uptake rates in Europe and the flu vaccination programme will be supported with a major new public facing marketing campaign to encourage take up amongst eligible groups for the free flu vaccine.\n\n\"With Covid-19 still likely to be circulating during flu season, it is more important than ever to have the flu vaccination and we urge anyone who is eligible to take up the offer of vaccination to help relieve pressure on the NHS and save lives.\"\n\nAdditional reporting by Anna Khoo and Daniel Wainwright.\n\nThe Shared Data Unit makes data journalism available to news organisations across the media industry, as part of a partnership between the BBC and the News Media Association.",

    "Flu: Why we still need to worry about it": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "Health officials are ramping up efforts to ensure everyone who needs a flu vaccine has one.\n\nThe UK's largest flu-immunisation programme so far will see 30 million people offered the vaccine.\n\nThe idea is to prepare for a winter that could see the annual flu season coincide with a surge in coronavirus.\n\nBut how will it work? And will things be worse this year?\n\nThe flu - or influenza - is a very common, highly infectious disease, caused by a virus.\n\nIt can be dangerous - particularly for older adults, very young children, and people with underlying health conditions.\n\nThe average number of estimated deaths in England for the past five annual flu seasons is more than 11,000.\n\nThis ranges from almost 4,000 deaths in the season spanning 2018-19 to more than 22,000 in 2017-18.\n\nThe problem is certain groups of people, such as older people, pregnant women and people with long-term conditions are at high risk of becoming seriously ill from both coronavirus and flu.\n\nAnd while many healthy people can fight off the flu, sometimes things are more complicated.\n\nThe most common complication is a bacterial chest infection, which can develop into pneumonia.\n\nOther life-threatening complications include meningitis and septic shock.\n\nThere is some evidence a double infection with coronavirus and flu is more deadly than either alone.\n\nBut others believe being infected with one virus could potentially help prevent another virus from making someone ill at the same time. This hasn't been proven in this case.\n\nWhat is clear is a big flu season combined with coronavirus could overwhelm hospitals.\n\nFor example, if lots of NHS or care-home staff are sick with flu, it may not be possible to respond to Covid-19 in the same way as during the peak in spring.\n\nBut social distancing, masks and other hygiene measures in place to stop coronavirus should, in theory, also have an impact on the amount of flu going around.\n\nExperts say these measures may have helped in countries like Australia where the flu season has been milder than expected this year.\n\nCould things actually be better this year?\n\nOther countries in the southern hemisphere, including South Africa, have also reported lower levels of flu than expected at this time of year.\n\nScientists say this could be partly because lockdown measures and extra hand-washing all work to reduce the spread of flu too.\n\nThe World Health Organization points out that while this is encouraging there needs to be a degree of caution when interpreting the trends.\n\nIn some countries reduced staffing levels during the pandemic could mean cases of flu are not recorded in the same way as before, for example.\n\nWe don't know yet how the flu season will pan out in the UK.\n\nSchools will soon be back in full-force and primary school aged children can be super-spreaders of flu.\n\nAnd national lockdown measures have eased since the height of the pandemic.\n\nThat is why officials will be urging people to get their flu vaccines if they can.\n\nBoth flu and coronavirus can cause a fever, cough, tiredness, muscle aches and headaches.\n\nSome people - mostly children - have other symptoms such as diarrhoea and vomiting.\n\nSome of these symptoms are also seen when people are ill with other common winter viruses.\n\nAnd both flu and coronavirus can be spread before people have any symptoms or by people who do not get symptoms at all.\n\nThis could make things difficult this winter.\n\nAnd that is why the flu vaccine is being offered more widely and testing and tracing facilities for coronavirus are increasing.\n\nIn England, it will be offered free to:\n\nHealth officials in Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales are planning to expand their vaccination programmes to cover similar groups.\n\nThe NHS wants to ensure the highest-risk patients are at the front of the queue when the immunisation programme starts, in September.\n\nThe aim is for people aged 50-64 to be offered the jab later, in November or December, if there are enough supplies.\n\nOfficials also say it is essential to increase vaccination levels among people in the most deprived areas and for people belonging to ethnic minorities at high risk of both Covid-19 and flu .\n\nThe vaccine will also be available privately in pharmacies and some supermarkets to adults ineligible for an NHS jab.\n\nIt usually costs about \u00a320.\n\nDoctors and nurses are being asked to put new measures in place to allow the vaccine to be given safely during the pandemic.\n\nThis will include careful appointment times to minimise waiting.\n\nExtra staff may be brought in to help.\n\nSome GP surgeries may ask people to use their cars as waiting rooms.\n\nOthers will consider drive-through clinics.\n\nFor the most vulnerable, there are suggestions nurses could visit them at home.\n\nAnd some pregnant women may be offered jabs during antenatal appointments.\n\nMeanwhile, people isolating because they or someone they have been in contact with have coronavirus will be asked to postpone their vaccinations until they are better.\n\nThe Department of Health and Social Care says it has additional national supply of the adult vaccine to ensure demand does not outstrip supply.\n\nEvery year, the World Health Organization studies circulating flu strains to make recommendations for the next season's vaccines.\n\nThis can only ever be a prediction, as vaccines have to be made in advance - often six months before the virus starts circulating in a country.\n\nWhile experts agree this is not always 100% accurate, they say it is better to be vaccinated against some strains of flu than none at all - particularly during a pandemic.",

    "French virus cases spike to 4,700 in a day": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "France has reported a sharp rise in the number of coronavirus cases - 4,771 - up a thousand on Wednesday's figure.\n\nIt is the first time more than 4,000 daily cases have been seen since May.\n\nMeanwhile Spain, Germany and Italy have also recorded their highest numbers of cases since late April or May.\n\nMany of the new Spanish cases are reportedly among the young, while German cases are said to be driven by a lack of social distancing and travellers returning from abroad.\n\nThe UK - which has Europe's highest coronavirus death toll - registered a further 1,182 cases on Thursday.\n\nThe number of confirmed cases has been accelerating since mid-August.\n\nFrance has increased its testing capacity and carried out 664,000 tests over the past week, the health ministry said, but the rate of positive cases has also been increasing. It stood at 3.3% for the week between 11-17 August, up from 2.1% previously and more than double the 1.5% rate seen at the end of July.\n\nOfficials say the virus is now mostly circulating in major cities among the young, who typically do not have serious symptoms, and this is why the number of people being treated in hospital has not changed much.\n\nNevertheless three more cities - St Etienne, Nice and Toulouse - have made wearing a mask mandatory in their city centres. Mask-wearing is already required in busy areas of the capital Paris.\n\nEducation Minister Jean-Michel Blanquer has ruled out any postponement of the new school year, which begins on 1 September, although he conceded there \"could be local exceptions\".\n\nPupils aged 11 and above will be required to wear masks when they are moving around schools in confined spaces and in classrooms when they are face to face and separated by less than a metre (3ft).\n\nSpain reported 3,349 new cases on Thursday, with the health ministry's emergencies coordinator Fernando Sim\u00f3n saying that no-one in the country should be in any doubt that \"things are not going well\".\n\n\"Although the epidemic is not out of control at a national level, it is [out of control] in certain concrete ways,\" he added, quoted by El Pa\u00eds newspaper.\n\nIf cases continue to rise there would be \"many hospitalisations, many people in intensive care and many deaths\", he said. The country has seen 131 deaths over the past week, more than ten times the level seen a month ago.\n\nThe average age of those confirmed to have the virus was now 39 for men and 37 for women - far lower than at the height of the epidemic in the country, when the average age of those infected was over 60.\n\nMr Sim\u00f3n appealed to social media influencers for help in containing the epidemic, asking them to emphasise to their followers that young people could end up infecting older members of their families.\n\n\"I understand that people want to go partying, but there are ways and ways of doing that,\" he said. \"Those with influence over the population must raise awareness about what needs to be done.\"\n\nThe country reported 1,707 new cases, with much of the rise blamed on returning holidaymakers as well as parties and family gatherings.\n\nThe Robert-Koch Institute said the highest rates of infection were among those returning from Kosovo, Turkey and Croatia.\n\nIn the most populous state of North Rhine-Westphalia, more than a third of returnees who tested positive were coming from Kosovo and nearly 20% were coming from Turkey. However, those returning from Spain and Greece made up just 2.5% and 0.5% of positive cases in the state.\n\nGermany has now designated two Croatian regions - Sibenik-Knin and Split-Dalmatia - as virus risk regions and warned against travel there. Arrivals in Germany from those areas will face mandatory tests for coronavirus.\n\nTourist Cheyenne Maschkewitz in Split told Reuters she had seen less social distancing than at home.\n\n\"We arrived here 10 days ago, it's quite different here than in Germany, like the masks - when you go to shopping they don't take it seriously, I think,\" she said.\n\nThe UK and neighbouring Slovenia have also added Croatia - which recorded 255 new infections on Thursday - to their quarantine lists. Slovenia says it has recorded dozens of cases among people returning from Croatian party destinations.\n\nHowever Croatia's Interior Minister Davor Bozinovic insisted that \"less than 1% of tourists got infected in Croatia\" and said a ban on nightclubs opening beyond midnight would probably be extended\n\nItaly has also reported a sharp rise in infections, with 845 new cases in its latest daily count. The number is not as high as some other European countries but it is a rate of infection that has not been seen there since late May.\n\n\"We are not in as bad a position as France and Spain, but the current situation is not satisfactory,\" said Professor Massimo Galli, head of infectious diseases at Milan's Sacco hospital.\n\nThe highest number of cases were reported in Veneto with 159 cases and Lombardy with 154 in Italy's north, and in Rome's Lazio region with 115.\n\n\"The end of confinement has resulted in an excessive feeling of false security,\" Prof Galli added, quoted by La Repubblica newspaper.\n\nHe also pointed to young people returning from summer holidays, citing the example of nine people with the virus coming back from Croatia.\n\n\"I don't want to look like the one blaming young people,\" Prof Galli said, but \"every day we receive reports of this type\".",

        "authors": [],
        "body": "Hong Kong scientists are reporting the case of a healthy man in his 30s who became reinfected with coronavirus four and a half months after his first bout.\n\nThey say genome sequencing shows the two strains of the virus are \"clearly different\", making it the world's first proven case of reinfection.\n\nThe World Health Organization warns it is important not to jump to conclusions based on the case of one patient.\n\nAnd experts say reinfections may be rare and not necessarily serious.\n\nThere have been more than 23 million cases of coronavirus infection around the world.\n\nThose infected develop an immune response as their bodies fight off the virus which helps to protect them against it returning.\n\nThe strongest immune response has been found in the most seriously ill patients.\n\nBut it is still not clear how strong this protection or immunity is - or how long it lasts.\n\nAnd the World Health Organization said larger studies over time of people who had previously had coronavirus were needed to find out more.\n\nThis report, by the University of Hong Kong, due to be published in Clinical Infectious Diseases, says the man spent 14 days in hospital before recovering from the virus but then, despite having no further symptoms, tested positive for the virus a second time, following a saliva test during airport screening.\n\n\"This is a very rare example of reinfection,\" said Brendan Wren, professor of microbial pathogenesis, at London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.\n\n\"And it should not negate the global drive to develop Covid-19 vaccines.\n\n\"It is to be expected that the virus will naturally mutate over time.\"\n\nDr Jeffrey Barrett, senior scientific consultant for the Covid-19 genome project at the Wellcome Sanger Institute, said: \"Given the number of global infections to date, seeing one case of reinfection is not that surprising even if it is a very rare occurrence.\n\n\"It may be that second infections, when they do occur, are not serious - though we don't know whether this person was infectious during their second episode.\"\n\nProf Paul Hunter, from the University of East Anglia, said more information about this and other cases of reinfection was needed \"before we can really understand the implications\".",

    "How is Scotland tackling local Covid clusters?": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "Scotland's Test and Protect system is a key part of the efforts to control coronavirus clusters. As First Minister Nicola Sturgeon announced that lockdown measures are to be re-introduced in Aberdeen to deal with an outbreak in the city, we look at how the system has been working.\n\nScotland has favoured a \"boots on the ground\" approach when it comes to Test and Protect.\n\nAs soon as a cluster is detected, local NHS health protection teams take charge of the incident. The belief is that local knowledge is the best way to break a cluster down.\n\nIt is about that basic principle of person, place and time, and local teams do the detective work. Where has the initial positive case been? Who have they been in contact with?\n\nThey need to build up a picture of risk from where transmission started.\n\nTeams will look at things like the ventilation in a building, the toilets, the communal areas. They can decide whether a whole workplace should be tested.\n\nThe demographic is also important. Young people, for example, are more mobile and that may mean more contacts need to be traced.\n\nThen contact tracers get on the phone, visit premises and continue to assess the risk of spread and whether additional testing is required.\n\nSpeed is of course critical. That means getting test results within 24 hours, and about 80% of contacts being traced within a further 24 hours - but the quicker the better.\n\nSo far, I'm told people have been largely compliant when asked to isolate because they have been in contact with a positive case.\n\nScotland's National Test and Protect Centre is the start of the system.\n\nIt's a virtual call centre where about 100 trained contact tracers triage calls and manage the most straightforward positive cases.\n\nThey regularly liaise with NHS 24 on the look out for early warnings signs.\n\nThey will also do some checking on people arriving back from destinations where quarantine rules are in place to make sure returning travellers are not displaying symptoms.\n\nBut the National Test and Protect Centre can be scaled up quickly.\n\nThere are 800 bank staff who can be called on if a public health team in part of Scotland needs back-up to trace contacts and make those all-important calls.\n\nIf there are multiple outbreaks or connections between outbreaks, Public Health Scotland will direct efforts to break those chains of transmission. Again, more staff with public health expertise can be called on if required.\n\nThere is no magic number of cases that will see a reintroduction of measures. That will depend on whether the public health teams believe they can still break the chains of transmission.\n\nIn Aberdeen, some businesses had already voluntarily decided to close for a period.\n\nBut with the number of cases in the \"significant\" outbreak rising to 54 by Wednesday - and with evidence that it has started to spread in the community - lockdown restrictions have been reimposed.\n\nPubs and restaurants will be closed as part of the measures, with people told not to travel to the city and locals urged not to go into each others' homes or travel more than five miles for leisure purposes.\n\nHowever, levels of the virus in Scotland continue to be low and while we might be seeing a spike in Aberdeen, public health teams are confident the flexible system they have in place is robust.\n\nThe Aberdeen cluster is the fourth we have had in Scotland, after Dumfries and Galloway, Lanarkshire and Inverclyde (although a link was established between Lanarkshire and Inverclyde).\n\nEvery time that lockdown restrictions are eased, more outbreaks are expected.\n\nRestarting the hospitality sector with the opening of pubs and restaurants has been the biggest test so far, with the next big test expected when pupils return to school next week.",

        "authors": [],
        "body": "Iran has experienced a significant surge in the number of infections. Cases spiked in mid-May and have remained high despite a re-imposition of some restrictions on movement.\n\nThe severity of the outbreak has been difficult to evaluate and there are concerns that the situation has been significantly worse than the government has revealed.\n\nDocuments obtained by the BBC, believed to be unpublished Iranian official records, suggest a much higher death toll.\n\nSo, what do we know about the numbers, and reasons behind this surge in Iran?\n\nPublished data on new cases suggests that following a second peak at the start of June, the reported number of new cases has remained persistently high at well over 2,000 per day.\n\nHowever, this may well be a significant underestimate judging by the latest documents obtained which indicate that Iran has been withholding the true scale of the outbreak.\n\nAccording to these figures the pandemic may have killed as many as 42,000 Iranians by July 21 compared with some 14,000 deaths reported by the Health Ministry by that time.\n\nIn April, Iran began to ease its restrictions as daily infections fell:\n\nCity transport systems across Iran, as well as banks and offices, have been packed with people.\n\nThe epidemic was initially concentrated in Qom and the capital, Tehran. But now, a flare-up has been reported in the south-west, notably in Khuzestan province which borders Iraq.\n\nOfficials have suggested the renewed surge in new cases could be down to more testing, and President Hassan Rouhani has said this means you will find more cases.\n\nIran's chief epidemiologist at the country's health ministry, Mohammad-Mehdi Gouya, explained: \"The main reason for the rising numbers is that we have started identifying [infected people] who have no or mild symptoms.\"\n\nIran has been increasing its testing, and had tested about one in every 38 people by 22 July, considerably more than it did at the start of the pandemic.\n\nBut that's still less than the US or countries in Europe that have been hit by the virus.\n\nThe proportion of tests in Iran that return a positive result began to rise in late May and early June, reaching 14%. But since then it's stayed between nine and 10%.\n\nThat's about ten tests for each positive case.\n\nThe WHO has suggested at least 10 to 30 tests per positive case as a general benchmark for adequate testing, according to Our World in Data, which compiles coronavirus testing statistics.\n\nThat means that at the moment, Iran may not be doing quite enough testing to find all cases.\n\nHealth Minister Saeed Namaki said people were ignoring social distancing rules.\n\n\"People have become completely careless regarding this disease,\" he told the Iranian news agency.\n\nAnd a health ministry poll in June suggested only:\n\nWhat options do the authorities have?\n\nDuring the initial outbreak, the Iranian authorities were criticised for their hesitation in closing down mosques and key religious sites, and for not moving quicker to introduce restrictions.\n\nThe leadership in Iran cannot afford to continue restrictions because of the state of the economy, according to BBC Persian's Rana Rahimpour.\n\nShe adds that it faces multiple challenges such as US sanctions, corruption and mismanagement.\n\nHowever, President Rouhani has now told Iranians they must wear face masks on public transport and in crowded areas, and said where necessary, the police and security forces will enforce the rules.\n\nAnd Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has called for action to stop the rising level of new infections, and criticised those who don't wear face masks.\n\nOn 18 July, the authorities in the capital, Tehran, announced restrictions were being temporarily re-imposed on some businesses and public gatherings, including wedding halls, coffee shops, tea houses, amusement parks and zoos.",

    "Is India meeting its testing targets?": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "India's Prime Minister, Narendra Modi, has pledged to ramp up testing to one million per day over the next few weeks to tackle one of the world's worst outbreaks of the coronavirus.\n\nBut can he achieve this, and are the tests being used reliable?\n\nAt the start of August, around half a million tests were being carried out each day across India on a week's average, according to the international comparison site, Our World in Data. Daily figures released by the Indian government are slightly higher than this.\n\nThis is a large number but should be put in the context of the size of India's population.\n\nIt carries out around 36 tests each day for every 100,000 people. In comparison, the figure for South Africa is 69, for Pakistan it's eight, and for the United Kingdom it's 192.\n\nPrime Minister Modi's ambition is to double this number to achieve a million tests each day for a country with a population of more than 1.3 billion.\n\nWhile boosting testing is regarded as a key part of the battle against the coronavirus, it's the type of testing which experts say is causing concern.\n\nThe one that's been most commonly used globally is a PCR (polymerase chain reaction) test, which isolates genetic material from a swab sample.\n\nChemicals are used to remove proteins and fats from the genetic material, and the sample is put through machine analysis.\n\nThese are regarded as the gold standard of testing, but they're the most expensive in India and take up to eight hours to process the samples. To produce a result may take up to a day, depending on the time taken to transport samples to labs.\n\nIn order to increase its testing capacity, the Indian authorities have been switching over to a cheaper and quicker method called a rapid antigen test, more globally known as diagnostic or rapid tests.\n\nThese isolate proteins called antigens that are unique to the virus, and can give a result in 15 to 20 minutes.\n\nBut these tests are less reliable, with an accuracy rate in some cases as low as 50%, and were originally meant to be used in virus hotspots and healthcare settings.\n\nIt is worth noting that these tests only tell you if you are currently infected and are different from antibody tests that tell you if you were infected in the past.\n\nIndia's top medical research body, the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), has approved the use of three antigen tests developed in South Korea, India and Belgium.\n\nBut one of these was independently evaluated by the ICMR and the All Indian Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), which found that their accuracy in giving a true negative result ranged between 50% and 84%.\n\n\"The antigen test will miss more than half of truly infected cases,\" Professor K Srinath Reddy, of the Public Health Foundation of India told the BBC.\n\nThis can be for various reasons like the swab sample wasn't good enough, the viral load in the person or even the quality of the testing kit.\n\nThe ICMR had issued guidelines saying those with negative results from an antigen test should also get a PCR test if they show symptoms, to rule out a false negative.\n\nRapid or diagnostic tests may or may not use antigens in detecting the virus.\n\nIn the UK, the most common type of rapid test has an error margin of 20% for giving false negative results.\n\nBut the rapid test kits developed by Oxford Nanopore are said to pick up 98% positive cases, although that needs independent checking by researchers and health experts.\n\nBoth these rapid tests use genetic material, not antigens, hence are more reliable.\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) and the US Food and Drugs administration have also advised getting a PCR test if you test negative in a rapid test.\n\nThe United States is vying to develop such diagnostic kits you could buy at a store, swab your nose or saliva and get the results within minutes, like pregnancy test kits.\n\nBut the FDA guidelines for approval of such kits say that their performance has to be nearly as good as lab tests.\n\nThe US is already using antigen test kits by BD and Quidel which have a sensitivity of 71% and 81% respectively, higher than those used in India.\n\nMany Indian states, which decide their own testing protocols, have been increasingly turning to the rapid antigen test.\n\nICMR announced on 4 August that up to 30% of the total tests conducted in the country were antigen tests.\n\nDelhi was the first state to begin antigen-based testing in June, and many other states followed suit. It began using them on 18 June, although there is no data publicly available until 29 June.\n\nWe've looked at data from 29 June to 28 July, which shows Delhi conducted a total of 587,590 tests, of which 63% were antigen tests.\n\nBut the available data shows that less than 1% of those who tested negative in an antigen test went on to have a PCR test, and 18% of those who did tested positive.\n\nThe recorded infection rate in the capital has fallen in recent weeks, but experts suggest that could be because many cases have been missed.\n\nThe authorities have now asked testing centres to conduct more PCR tests.\n\nBut data shows that more than 50% of the tests conducted are still antigen tests, despite the Delhi High Court's order that it should be used only in hotspots and healthcare settings.\n\nThe southern state of Karnataka started using antigen tests in July, aiming for 35,000 a day across 30 districts. Although they haven't been able to achieve the target, the number of antigen tests has been going up, and the number of PCR tests coming down.\n\nAvailable data suggests that in the last week of July, 38% of those who initially tested negative but had symptoms and then took a PCR test, came out positive.\n\nAlthough the state does not provide daily data on how many PCR and antigen tests are conducted, there are currently only 31 government and private labs equipped to do PCR tests, as against 320 government facilities for antigen tests.\n\nIndia's worst affected state, Maharashtra, first began antigen tests in Mumbai. The city's municipal corporation reported that 65% of those who had symptoms of Covid-19 tested negative in the antigen test, but went on to be positive in a PCR test.\n\nDr Anupam Singh, a public health expert, says there are some advantages to the rapid tests: \"It allows a faster detection process and means you can quickly detect highly infectious individuals with a high viral load who might be so-called super-spreaders.\"\n\nBut he also has concerns about this strategy, which can potentially miss many infections.\n\n\"As PCR testing requires higher investment and resources, the authorities have switched to a focus on reducing deaths, and catching highly infectious people - the low-hanging fruits,\" says Dr Singh.\n\nSo the switch to rapid antigen testing may satisfy performance targets and meet public demand for more testing.\n\nBut it runs a real risk of not revealing the true extent of the outbreak - unless it's backed up by continued PCR testing.",

    "Is the world winning the pandemic fight?": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "It is little more than six months since the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the arrival of a new virus a global emergency.\n\nOn that day, at the end of January, there had been almost 10,000 reported cases of coronavirus and more than 200 people had died. None of those cases were outside of China.\n\nSince then the world, and our lives, have changed profoundly. So how are we faring in this battle between the human race and the coronavirus?\n\nIf we take the planet as a whole, the picture is looking rough.\n\nThere have been more than 19 million confirmed cases and 700,000 deaths. At the start of the pandemic it was taking weeks to clock up each 100,000 infections, now those milestones are measured in hours.\n\n\"We're still in the midst of an accelerating, intense and very serious pandemic,\" Dr Margaret Harris, from the WHO, told me. \"It's there in every community in the world.\"\n\nWhile this is a single pandemic, it is not one single story. The impact of Covid-19 is different around the world and it is easy to blind yourself to the reality beyond your own country.\n\nBut one fact unites everyone, whether they make their home in the Amazon rainforest, the skyscrapers of Singapore or the late-summer streets of the UK: this is a virus that thrives on close human contact. The more we come together, the easier it will spread. That is as true today as when the virus first emerged in China.\n\nThis central tenet explains the situation wherever you are in the world and dictates what the future will look like.\n\nIt is driving the high volume of cases in Latin America - the current epicentre of the pandemic - and the surge in India. It explains why Hong Kong is keeping people in quarantine facilities or the South Korean authorities are monitoring people's bank accounts and phones. It illustrates why Europe and Australia are struggling to balance lifting lockdowns and containing the disease. And why we are trying to find a \"new normal\" rather than the old one.\n\n\"This is a virus circulating all over the planet. It affects every single one of us. It goes from human to human, and highlights that we are all connected,\" said Dr Elisabetta Groppelli, from St George's, University of London. \"It's not just about travel, it's speaking and spending time together - that's what humans do.\"\n\nEven the simple act of singing together spreads the virus.\n\nIt has also proven to be an exceptionally tricky virus to track, causing mild or no symptoms for many, but deadly enough to others to overwhelm hospitals.\n\n\"It's the perfect pandemic virus of our time. We are now living in the time of coronavirus,\" said Dr Harris.\n\nWhere there has been success, it is through breaking the ability of the virus to spread from one person to the next. New Zealand gets the most attention. They acted early, while there were still few cases in the country: locked down, sealed their borders and now have barely any cases. Life is largely back to normal.\n\nGetting the basics right has helped in poorer countries too. Mongolia has the longest shared border with China, where the pandemic began. The country could have been badly impacted. However, not a single case requiring intensive care occurred until July. To date they have only had 293 diagnoses and no deaths.\n\n\"Mongolia has done a good job with very limited resources. They did 'shoe-leather epidemiology' isolating cases, identifying contacts and isolating those contacts,\" said Prof David Heymann, of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.\n\nThey also rapidly closed schools, restricted international travel and were early promoters of face masks and hand-washing.\n\nOn the other hand, Prof Heymann argues, a \"lack of political leadership\" has hampered many countries where \"public health leaders and political leaders have difficulty speaking together\". In such a climate, the virus has flourished. US president Donald Trump and the country's top infectious disease doctor, Anthony Fauci, have clearly been on different pages, if not completely different books, during the pandemic. Brazil's president, Jair Bolsonaro joined anti-lockdown rallies, described the virus as \"a little flu\" and said the pandemic was nearly over in March.\n\nInstead, in Brazil alone, 2.8 million people have been infected and nearly 100,000 have died.\n\nBut countries that have got on top of the virus - mostly through painful, society-crippling lockdowns - are finding it has not gone away, will spread again if we relax our guard and that normality is still elusively distant.\n\n\"They're discovering it's more challenging coming out of lockdown than going in,\" said Dr Groppelli. \"They haven't thought about how we can co-exist with the virus.\"\n\nAustralia is one of the countries trying to chart a path out of lockdown, but the state of Victoria is now in \"disaster\" mode. Melbourne went back into lockdown in early July, but - as contagion continues - has since imposed even stricter rules. Now there is a night-time curfew and people are expected to exercise within 5km of their homes.\n\nEurope too is opening up, but Spain, France and Greece have all reported their highest number of cases in weeks. Germany has reported more than 1,000 cases a day for the first time in three months.\n\nWearing face masks, once an oddity, is now commonplace in Europe, with even some beach resorts insisting upon it.\n\nAnd - in a warning to us all - past success is no guarantee for the future. Hong Kong was widely praised for resisting the first wave of coronavirus - now bars and gyms have been closed again, while its Disneyland resort managed to keep the gates open for less than a month.\n\n\"Leaving lockdown does not mean back to the old ways. It's a new normal. People have not got that message at all,\" Dr Harris said.\n\nAfrica's position in the fight against coronavirus remains an open question. There have been more than one million cases; after a successful start, South Africa looks to be in a bad place, with the majority of cases on the continent. But relatively little testing means a crystal clear picture is difficult.\n\nAnd there is the enigma of Africa's notably lower death rate compared with the rest of the world. Here are some of the suggestions as to why:\n\nCountries are innovating in response. Rwanda has been using drones to deliver supplies to hospitals and broadcast coronavirus restrictions. They are even being used to catch those flouting the rules, as one church-bound pastor found out.\n\nBut as with parts of India, south east Asia and beyond, access to clean water and sanitation undermines the simplest hand-washing messages.\n\n\"There are people that have water to wash their hands and those that do not,\" Dr Groppelli said. \"This is a major difference, we can pretty much break the world in two. And there is a big question mark about how they control the virus unless there is a vaccine.\"\n\nSo when will all this be over?\n\nAlready there are drug treatments. Dexamethasone - a cheap steroid - has been shown to save some of the sickest patients. But it is not enough to stop all Covid-19 patients dying or to lift the need for all restrictions. Close attention will be paid to Sweden in the coming months to see whether its strategy is rewarded in the longer term. It didn't lock down, but so far has had a significantly higher death rate than its neighbours, after failing to protect people in care homes.\n\nGenerally, the world's hopes of getting life back to normal are pinned on a vaccine. Immunising people breaks the virus's ability to spread.\n\nThere are six vaccines now entering phase three clinical trials. This is the critical stage when we will discover if the vaccines that appear promising actually work. The final hurdle is also the point where many a medicine has stumbled. Health officials say the emphasis should remain on \"if\" we get a vaccine not \"when\".\n\nDr Margaret Harris, of WHO, said: \"People have this Hollywood-esque belief in a vaccine; that scientists are just going to fix it. In a two-hour film the end comes pretty quickly, but scientists aren't Brad Pitt, injecting themselves and saying 'we're all going to be saved'.\"",

        "body": "Jesper Olsen was just two days into his inaugural attempt to run around the world when he found himself on the verge of quitting.\n\nThe Dane was camping in a sodden field on the outskirts of the English port of Dover, having started his audacious overland odyssey with Russian companion Alexander Korotkov in London on 1 January 2004.\n\nDuring an unexpectedly eventful opening 48 hours, Olsen and Korotkov had endured a restless night in a leaking tent, a dressing down from police for jogging on the side of the M2 motorway, and several punctures to the wheels of the repurposed baby stroller the pair was using to carry their camping and food supplies. But it was the feeling of fatigue that was really getting Olsen down.\n\n\"We were cold, wet and we just couldn't understand how it was taking us eight or nine hours [rather than the planned five to six hours] to run just 40km each day,\" Olsen said. \"We were tired like you wouldn't imagine.\"\n\nBut, thankfully, that evening Olsen made a discovery that all but saved the fledgling venture.\n\n\"We'd forgotten UK road signs use miles [unlike the rest of Europe]. We'd been running 40 miles [roughly 60km] each day, not 40km,\" he said. \"Things started to get a lot easier from then on.\"\n\nAfter a further 26,000km or so, which included Korotkov calling it a day somewhere in Siberia due to injury and a particularly harrowing encounter with a \"dinner-plate-sized\" spider in the Australian outback, Olsen arrived back in London 22 months later, having successfully run around the world.\n\nNot content at that landmark achievement, he repeated the feat three years later, this time traversing the planet north to south.\n\nIt is probably one of the most eccentric selections of people that you can find\n\nIt was after this journey, upon returning to his native Denmark, that Olsen co-founded the World Runners Club; a curious coterie that remains arguably the most exclusive travel club in existence, and certainly the hardest to join.\n\nThe club grew as an arm of the World Runners Association (WRA), a small-scale operation that functions as a de facto governing body of the extremely niche sport of world running (that is, running around the planet). Its website, overseen by president Phil Essam, documents an official ruleset for the sport, along with other useful resources for enthusiasts.\n\nTo be eligible to gain membership to the World Runners Club, you have to have completed a fully documented run around the Earth - but it's not quite as straightforward as that.\n\n\"You have to cross four continents from one major ocean to another; cover [at least] 26,232km in total; pass through antipodal (opposite) points of the Earth; and start and finish at the same point. They're the main rules,\" explained Tom Denniss, who co-founded the club with Olsen after completing his own world circumnavigation between 2011 and 2013.\n\nYou may also be interested in:\n\n* From Africa to tea with the Queen\n\n* A town that sold mountains to the world\n\n* A crazy sport created by isolation\n\nThere is no time limit for would-be members to complete the mammoth feat (so long as it is undertaken in one continuous journey), but athletes have to actively run (as opposed to walk) more than half of the total distance covered to qualify.\n\nCurrently the World Runners Club only has six members: Olsen, Denniss, Kevin Carr, Serge Girard, Tony Mangan and Rosie Swale Pope, who holds honorary membership due to her run taking place before the official ruleset was agreed upon.\n\nOlsen admits the group, which spans several time zones and has only managed to get together in person once (in Florida for a marathon, naturally), is quite an unconventional bunch.\n\n\"My friends would say it is probably one of the most eccentric selections of people that you can find,\" he said.\n\nWhen you're out running you see, hear and smell everything about a place\n\nThere is certainly a touch of the whimsical about the World Runners Club, but in reality, the quirky travel style that the group champions couldn't be more intrinsically human. Circumnavigating the globe has long captivated our collective imagination, with the first reputed attempt to traverse the world on foot, according to Guinness World Records, dating as far back as 1897. For thousands of years before that, pilgrims - perhaps the original world travellers - wandered across vast deserts and along meandering country-spanning pathways in search of enlightenment.\n\nAnd it seems the philosophical aspect of traversing our home planet on two feet still forms a large part of the enjoyment for world runners today.\n\n\"When you're running, you get to experience the world as it is, in a scale of one to one,\" said Olsen. \"If you go by train, then Siberia feels fairly long, it takes maybe a week [to cross], but that's not how long Siberia is. Siberia takes seven and a half months to run across.\"\n\nBoth Olsen and Denniss also cite the luxury of time afforded and freedom from modern routines (namely, \"meetings, television and Facebook\") as other positives of this travel style, along with the genuine interactions with local people that come about when you jog into their town or village.\n\n\"You tend to visit places normal tourists would just be passing through on a freeway,\" said Denniss, \"But when you're out running you see, hear and smell everything about a place.\"\n\nIntriguingly, it might be a very modern problem that could rekindle an appetite for this primordial style of travel. With coronavirus wreaking havoc on established tourist infrastructure - and a lingering anxiety around large crowds - more people may be tempted to shun the busy beachside holiday resort for a sturdy pair of hiking boots or running shoes, with camping gear in tow.\n\nSuch a trend would be welcomed by Dr Kathleen Martin Ginis, a professor in the School of Health and Exercise Sciences at the University of British Columbia and co-author of The Psychology of Exercise. While running or walking holidays may be embraced by travellers as a novel way to see lesser-visited parts of the world, Dr Martin Ginis notes the importance of exercise on our mental wellbeing and the beneficial role active holidays can play in forming healthy habits.\n\nWhen you're running, you get to experience the world as it is, in a scale of one to one\n\n\"Routine exercise can reduce the risk for, and the symptoms of, depression and anxiety. It can also improve self-perceptions (body image, self-esteem), cognitive functioning and mood, and reduce stress,\" she said.\n\n\"For people who can't manage to fit exercise into their usual schedules, an active holiday is a way to kick-start better exercise habits when they get home,\" Dr Martin Ginis added.\n\nWhether or not the enduring impacts of coronavirus has us all boldly heading out into the wilderness for holidays in future, the members of the World Runners Club are certain their small band of adventurous athletes will not remain so exclusive for long.\n\n\"It's going to get bigger,\" Denniss said. \"Increasingly people are contacting [the WRA] for advice and guidance.\"\n\nAccording to Denniss, at least two athletes (an English man and French woman) are in the process of conducting a world run in accordance with the rules set out by the WRA, with a handful more actively planning attempts.\n\nSo, what's the current advice for anyone thinking of joining this exclusive club?\n\n\"Prepare well. And do it. You won't regret it,\" said Olsen. \"But remember, the UK uses miles not kilometres. Don't forget that.\"\n\nJoin more than three million BBC Travel fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter and Instagram.",

        "body": "In the Western world, you would mark a student receiving a diploma, a couple announcing their engagement, a family moving to a new home or a relative falling ill in very different ways. Some of these events might involve your entire family or community, but likely not all of them.\n\nIt's a different story in Laos where each of these moments in a person's life - particularly when it comes to illness - calls for the presence of as many friends and relatives as possible, who gather at a \"soul-calling\" ceremony to express their care and even help one another heal.\n\nThe ceremony is about calling the spirits back to your body to protect you\n\nThe ritual, called a baci or su khuan, incorporates practices from Theravada Buddhism, Brahmanism and animism, and is based on the belief that there are several souls or khuan (vital essences) in the body, which must all be kept inside for someone to be well. The number of souls varies depending on which of Laos' many ethnic groups the person is part of, but the majority group - the Lao - believe there are 32. If you have any kind of traumatic life event, such as being frightened or getting sick, it's thought your souls can escape from your body, which can result in physical symptoms such as feeling tired or losing your appetite.\n\nEssentially, the baci ceremony is the Lao way of re-establishing balance within the body, but the ritual can also be used as a preventative measure against illness - or to ensure good fortune, for example, if someone was going off to university or about to get married.\n\nSengdeuane \"Ning\" Inthilad has taken part in many of these ceremonies in his lifetime. \"If you're going to travel somewhere for a long time, you have a ceremony; if you have a new house, there's also a ceremony; if you get sick or have an operation, they also do the ceremony for you,\" he said. \"If you're sick or have just come back from an operation or have had an accident, the ceremony is about calling the spirits back to your body to protect you.\"\n\nThe ceremony usually takes place inside the home of the person who is ill or undergoing a major life event and is presided over by a village elder. In the middle of the room, family members place a flower montage made of banana leaves and French marigolds to which white cotton strings are attached. Once the ceremony starts, the elder calls back the souls that have departed by chanting sacred words, and wishes the person good health and good luck. Then, the rest of the participants take turns wishing the person well while tying the cotton strings around his or her wrists to keep their newly returned souls inside the body. These strings also represent the connection between the person who's having the life event and the person who gave them well wishes, and they must be worn for three days to seal the bond.\n\nYou may also be interested in:\n\n* Asia's centuries-old healing technique\n\n* The birthplace of traditional Thai massage\n\n* The berry that keeps Asia looking young\n\nElizabeth Elliott, a medical anthropologist studying healing traditions in the southern lowlands of Laos at University College London, says that the baci ceremony is perhaps the most tangible representation of wellness and wellbeing in Laos, which has a broader meaning than just being healthy in a purely physical sense. Here, emotional, spiritual and social wellbeing are also necessary for a Lao person to be well. \"It's something that's really bound up with a person's whole state - with their emotional balance, their relationships with their family and other people, and with the spirit world,\" she said. \"What's really pertinent about the baci ceremony is that people are literally bound together.\"\n\nThe ceremony is also said to bring about kamlang jai (a powerful heart), which refers to the warm feelings you get from being together and experiencing care from others, especially if you're unwell. \"Having that warm sense is something people describe as really important from an emotional as well as a practical point of view,\" Elliott explained.\n\nAnd while being surrounded by family and friends is considered essential to wellbeing, Lao people consider the state of poudiao (being alone) to be the most vulnerable. This belief, according to Elliott, comes from past fears rooted in both real physical dangers and traditional spiritual beliefs. \"In the past, there were a lot of wild animals in the forest; there were genuinely a lot of dangers,\" she said. \"But people also have still quite prevalent beliefs - particularly in rural areas - in the existence of the spirit world. It's connected with the idea of being attacked by dangerous spirits, or even sorcery, if you don't have methods of protecting yourself.\"\n\nLaos-based ethnomusicologist Marie-Pierre Lissoir, who is curating an exhibition on the interaction between humans and spirits at the Traditional Arts & Ethnology Centre (TAEC) in Luang Prabang, says that her colleagues often ask her if she's afraid to sleep alone in her house. \"Being alone somewhere is very scary because, 'what about the spirits that are around?',\" she said. \"They ask me 'aren't you afraid that they will come and catch you?'\"\n\nLiving alone also goes against the local custom of community\n\nFor the Lao people, living alone also goes against the local custom of community, where everyone has a role and family and neighbours are there to help if you have a problem. \"Even if you decide to live a little bit outside of the village, it's seen as a little bit strange that you want to isolate yourself,\" Lissoir said.\n\nIn more remote locations, community is considered even more important. Giulio Ongaro, an anthropologist based at the London School of Economics, focused his PhD on the medical system of the Akha people, who live in the north-western highlands of Laos. \"The Akha have a kinship-based society without any state or political structure,\" he said. \"Having a kinship network around is of the utmost importance to wellbeing because many of their ceremonies require the presence of particular relatives.\"\n\nAs well as a soul-calling ceremony, the Akha have a range of sacrificial rituals. They believe serious illness can occur when a particular spirit afflicts someone, so during one of their more complex rituals, a shaman enters a trance and ventures into the spirit world to retrieve the person's soul from that spirit. When she returns (the Akha's shamans are all women), animals are sacrificed to the spirit inside the house of the person who is sick in exchange for their soul.\n\n\"These rituals are very dramatic and expensive. They start in the evening and might finish in the afternoon the day after without sleeping,\" said Ongaro. \"In order for the ritual to take place, all family members need to be present. For example, if the daughter falls sick, the son who is studying elsewhere would have to come and stay in the house while the ritual takes place. An affliction to an individual is an affliction to the household.\"\n\nFor Ongaro, the key reason for the ceremony's continued popularity is that rituals tackle an aspect of wellbeing that is not touched by modern medicine. \"[The Akha people] believe modern medicine can be effective against organic illnesses of the body but can do very little or nothing about spiritual illness or illness of the soul,\" he said.\n\nIt's common for people in most Laos communities today to use a mix of modern and traditional healthcare approaches. As Lissoir explained, \"If someone is sick, they might do the ceremony first and then go to the hospital. Then to be really sure, sometimes they'd do the ceremony again.\" That's because the ceremony has a specific practical purpose: to extend the responsibility of healing to the whole family and community. \"By involving the family or others in close social connection, and by focusing on this idea of the wandering souls,\" said Elliott, \"it's a way to help the person feel better without putting a lot of pressure on them as an individual to deal with their own psychological problems.\"\n\nIt's also just not very pleasant to handle everything - or in Lao people's case anything - on your own. Popular jokes and sayings here revolve around the fact that spending time alone is not fun; food is considered more delicious when eaten together, and Lao people prefer not to sleep alone.\n\n\"Lao people are very fun-loving, very warm people,\" said Elliott. \"And it's such a strong social norm - the idea of not being alone and being stronger with others.\"\n\nInthilad is the only member of his family who has travelled alone to other countries. \"Some of my family members thought I was crazy,\" he said. \"They said if you travel alone, you're going to feel lonely; you won't have any one to talk to.\"\n\nThings changed in Laos a bit during coronavirus lockdown, as people may have had contact with their immediate family members but less social contact beyond that. Large New Year celebrations were cancelled, and there were reports of whole villages barring the entry of outsiders and repurposing traditional protective measures like \"taleo\", a small bamboo talisman used to signal that a special event like a ceremony is taking place. People also employed self-quarantine practices such as sleeping in rice field huts.\n\nHowever, some smaller celebrations did take place. \"We did the New Year ceremony but just for family members because we knew we were safe,\" Inthilad said. \"Being with your family members is part of being healthy. If you don't have family members around to make you happy, it sometimes links to your physical health and you feel weak.\"\n\nHe added: \"I believe if you think positive and do positive things for others, many good things are going to come to you even though you did not expect it.\n\nBBC Travel's Well World is a global take on wellness that explores different ways that cultures the world over strive for a healthy lifestyle.\n\nJoin more than three million BBC Travel fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter and Instagram.",

        "body": "There is little evidence of coronavirus being transmitted in schools, Education Secretary Gavin Williamson has said.\n\nMr Williamson said the government was being guided by the best science as it accelerated plans to reopen schools to all pupils in England next month.\n\nGovernment advisers have warned the nation may have reached the limit of what can be reopened in society safely.\n\nBut Mr Williamson suggested an upcoming study would support the government's position on reopening schools.\n\nHis comments came after Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the reopening of schools, after months without in-person education, was the \"national priority\" of the government.\n\nThe prime minister, who is expected to visit a school later, is understood to have made it clear that schools should shut last in any future local lockdowns, after businesses including shops and pubs.\n\nThe Association of School and College Leaders has said there is an absence of clear guidance from the government, and schools are making their own contingency plans.\n\nBut the education secretary maintained that there was \"growing confidence among parents about their children returning\" to the classroom.\n\nIn a statement issued on Sunday evening, he said: \"This is down to the hard work of school staff across the country who are putting in place a range of protective measures to prepare to welcome back all pupils at the start of term.\"\n\nMr Williamson also referred to the \"latest research, which is expected to be published later this year - one of the largest studies on the coronavirus in schools in the world\", saying it \"makes it clear there is little evidence that the virus is transmitted at school\".\n\nHe is believed to be referring to a forthcoming report to be released by Public Health England.\n\nThe children's commissioner for England, Anne Longfield, has called for regular coronavirus testing in schools.\n\nAnd the National Education Union deputy general secretary Avis Gilmore said: \"Robust track, trace and test alongside health and safety checks in schools and colleges are necessary.\"\n\nHowever, schools minister Nick Gibb rejected the idea, telling Times Radio on Sunday that he did not support routine testing for teachers and pupils who did not have symptoms.\n\nSchools across the UK closed on 20 March, except to children of key workers or vulnerable children. On 1 June, they began a limited reopening for early years pupils, Reception, Year 1 and Year 6.\n\nThe current plan is for most children across the country to be back in class by next month.\n\nGuidance on reopening has been published for England. There are also separate plans for Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland, where schools are scheduled to return from Tuesday.\n\nSome government scientific advisers are calling for improvements in the test-and-trace system before schools reopen.\n\nOne, Prof Sir Jeremy Farrar, the director of the Wellcome Trust, said a \"brief window\" before schools reopen must be \"used wisely\". Writing in the Observer he said: \"Most urgently, we need to ramp up testing\".\n\nMeanwhile, Labour is calling for a \"rapid reform\" of the test and trace system, suggesting local health protection teams are more effective than the national call centres.\n\nFigures released last week by the Department of Health and Social Care showed local teams continued to be more successful than call centre workers when it came to reaching close contacts of people who tested positive for coronavirus.\n\nIn a letter to Health Secretary Matt Hancock, shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth and shadow cabinet office minister Rachel Reeves raised concerns that the current model is \"not fit for purpose\".\n\nOn Sunday, the UK reported a further eight people had died after testing positive for coronavirus, taking the total to 46,574. A further 1,062 people tested positive for Covid-19.\n\nIn another development, gyms, swimming pools, leisure centres and children's play centres are being allowed to reopen in Wales on Monday, in a further easing of the lockdown restrictions.\n\nAre you a parent of a child due to return to school in the autumn?

        "body": "Young people in Preston are being urged \"Don't kill Granny\" as new lockdown measures come into force.\n\nExtra restrictions were imposed after Covid-19 infections rose in the city.\n\nAdrian Phillips, chief executive of Preston City Council, said it was \"alarming to see that the under-30s are contracting it at a significant rate\".\n\n\"I know our director of public health has said 'Don't kill Granny' to young people to try and focus the message,'\" he said.\n\nSince midnight, residents in the Lancashire city are banned from mixing with people from outside their social bubble in homes, gardens, and indoor venues, such as pubs.\n\nThey can meet in groups of up to six - or more than six if they are from two households - in outdoor areas such as parks and beer gardens.\n\nThe restrictions will be reviewed next week, with any changes due to be announced by Friday.\n\nIt comes after similar rules banning residents from visiting people's homes and gardens in Greater Manchester, East Lancashire and parts of West Yorkshire came into force on 31 July.\n\nSocialising between people from different households in pubs and homes had been seen as the main cause for the spike, local authorities said.\n\nDr Sakthi Karunanithi, Lancashire's director of public health, told BBC Breakfast that \"47% of positive cases are in younger people - 30 years and below\".\n\n\"Contrary to the common myth that this affects the south Asian groups the most, we have found that it's roughly affecting white ethnic backgrounds as well as south Asian groups in Preston almost equally,\" he said.\n\nLocal officials said the spike was particularly among those living in poor socio-economic conditions, including inner city and rural areas.\n\nThere were 61 new cases in Preston in the seven days to 4 August. This is the equivalent of 42.6 cases per 100,000 people - up from 21.7 per 100,000 in the previous seven days.\n\nMr Phillips said younger people \"often have less symptoms but they do take it back to their household\".\n\nHe said local authorities were working with community groups who were doing \"peer-to-peer communications\".\n\n\"It's just trying so many different ways to get the message to all communities, to all areas of our city that the virus is still something to be really wary of,\" he added.\n\nNadeem Ashfaq, from inter-faith group the Light Foundation, said parts of the city had been \"really quiet\" overnight and on Saturday morning.\n\n\"Everywhere I have been, I see people with masks,\" he said.\n\nThe announcement of new lockdown restrictions had not been a shock, he said, as people had been made aware of the city's rising infection rate in recent weeks by local authorities.\n\n\"If you look at other towns and places, you can sense there was an upheaval. I think in Preston there seems to be a calm understanding,\" he added.\n\nHannah Heaton, 28, said she thought the new restrictions were confusing.\n\n\"It doesn't make sense that you can't go to houses but you can meet people outside or go to pubs,\" she said.\n\n\"My grandparents rely on me to help them and now going to see them has been taken away from me.\n\n\"There's nothing I can do about it. I think certain people haven't been taking it seriously because they don't think it will affect them.\"\n\nCharlene Gardner, 38, said: \"The pubs around us were still 30 or 40-deep outside last night.\n\n\"It won't mean any changes for us because we haven't been seeing family anyway, but I saw some reaction online last night and I think a lot of people aren't going to listen to it.\"\n\nMany people in the main Fishergate shopping street were wearing masks, and a face mask seller, who did not want to be named, said the city was less busy than the previous weekend.\n\n\"You see the older people wearing masks but the younger ones don't. The problem is in the pubs and they don't wear masks there,\" he said.",

Either there is a killer virus on the loose or there isn't. (Spoiler alert: There isn't).\"\n\nMr McFadzean married Ms Smith, a minister in the Cabinet Office, in 2013.\n\nThe MP's local newspaper, the Eastern Daily Press, which first reported the story, said Mr McFadzean's Twitter account had been deleted on Wednesday.\n\nMs Smith told the paper: \"My husband's a private citizen. Everyone's entitled to their own view, and to debate. I take a different view.\"\n\nMs Smith's own Twitter account carries the hashtag #stayalertsavelives, an abbreviated version of the government's coronavirus slogan \"Stay alert, control the virus, save lives\".\n\nCredit Suisse declined to comment, but Clive Lewis, Labour MP for Norwich South, said: \"There's absolutely no way I'd hold anyone responsible for the views of their partner.\n\n\"However, if my partner was spouting forth Covid conspiracy, anti-vaccination nonsense, it is very likely the subject might come up for discussion at some point over tea.\"",

    "Missing school is 'worse than virus for children'": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "Children are more likely to be harmed by not returning to school next month than if they catch coronavirus, the UK's chief medical adviser says.\n\nProf Chris Whitty said \"the chances of children dying from Covid-19 are incredibly small\" - but missing lessons \"damages children in the long run\".\n\nMillions of pupils in England, Wales and Northern Ireland are due to return to school within weeks.\n\nProf Whitty also said Covid-19 would be a challenge for at least nine months.\n\nHe said it was unlikely there would be a vaccine in 2020 but there was a \"reasonable chance\" of a successful jab being ready for the following winter in 2021-22.\n\nThe government has said all pupils, in all year groups, in England will be expected to return to class full-time in September. Schools have already reopened in Scotland.\n\nProf Whitty, who is also England's chief medical officer, said \"many more [children] were likely to be harmed by not going than harmed by going\" to school.\n\n\"There's also very clear evidence from the UK and around the world that children much less commonly get a severe illness and end up having to be hospitalised if they get symptomatic Covid,\" he added.\n\nHis interview came as chief and deputy chief medical officers for all four UK nations said there were \"no risk-free options\" and it was important for parents and teachers to understand both the risks and benefits as schools reopen.\n\nLabour MP Lucy Powell told BBC Breakfast her party was concerned that the \"chaos\" brought on by a heavily criticised grading system for A-level and GCSE results had led schools to lose \"two valuable weeks that could have been spent preparing\" for the safe return to the classroom.\n\nThe shadow business minister said schools could open with greater confidence if the Department for Education provided \"more clarity\" for parents and teachers, improved the coronavirus contact tracing programme, and offered more widespread testing - such as to people without symptoms.\n\nProf Whitty used his interview to highlight \"overwhelming\" evidence that in not going to school, children are more likely to have \"mental and physical ill health in the long run\".\n\nHe added that the vast majority of children who died with the virus had \"very serious\" pre-existing health conditions.\n\nAccording to the Office for National Statistics' latest data on ages, there were 10 deaths recorded as \"due to Covid-19\" among those aged 19 and under in England and Wales between March and June - and 46,725 deaths among those aged 20 and over.\n\nProf Chris Whitty was speaking officially on behalf of all the chief medical officers of the UK's nations. But this rare interview reveals a lot more about his own views on how the virus is developing.\n\nMore parents going back to work with schools reopening will probably, he believes, increase virus transmission and that may require restrictions in other areas.\n\nHe says people need to accept that, with autumn and winter, the pressures will increase.\n\nHe refers to \"an incredibly narrow path\" to be walked to protect people from the virus without further damage to the economy, meaning there is \"not very much room for manoeuvre\".\n\nIf the virus picks up among younger adults, he argues, that can spread to older and more vulnerable age groups. His conclusion is that there is a really serious challenge for at least another nine months.\n\nThis is a chief medical officer who seems unlikely to back further easing of restrictions and to be ready to propose tightening if that is the price which has to be paid for the vitally important goal of getting children back to school.\n\nProf Whitty said it looked as if \"there is much less transmission from children to adults than adults to adults\".\n\nHe said reopening schools would connect households in other ways - for example by parents meeting at school gates, or mixing with others as a result of being able to return to work.\n\n\"The fact of schools being open will probably lead to some increase in transmission but much of that is indirect,\" he said.\n\nThe World Health Organization has said children aged 12 and over should wear masks in line with national recommendations citing evidence suggesting teenagers can infect others in the same way as adults.\n\nAnd a school in Edinburgh has told pupils and staff to wear face coverings while moving around between lessons.\n\nData shows that staff spreading the virus to other members of staff is \"maybe actually more important than staff members catching it from pupils\", Prof Whitty said.\n\nHe said that - much like other workplaces - \"it is staff coming together and spreading it to one another\" that can drive infections.\n\n\"Even with the best actions, you cannot take that [risk of transmission] down to zero and we're really clear about that and we don't want to pretend otherwise.\"\n\nEpidemiologist Prof Sian Griffiths told BBC Breakfast that returning school staff - and parents who can therefore go back to their workplace - should remember the \"simple messages\" around hygiene, such as washing hands regularly and covering sneezes.\n\n\"Some of the times when people forget about transmission are for example in the staff room, or in the work canteen or in the coffee room at work... that's how the disease is spread in situations outside homes,\" she said.\n\nIn Scotland, where pupils returned to classrooms this month, there has been criticism from pupils and parents about safety measures and the ability to maintain social distancing.\n\nProf Whitty said the risks could be minimised by having hygiene and cleaning measures in place, but warned that as with any workplace, \"we cannot say the risk will be taken down to zero\".\n\nThe NASUWT teachers' union said the \"critical importance\" of social distancing and hygiene had been reinforced by the chief medical officers' statement.\n\nHelen Carter, deputy head teacher at Burnage Academy for Boys in Manchester, told BBC Breakfast that school would look \"very different\" for her pupils.\n\nShe said the school will have five separate entrances for each of its \"year group bubbles\", and that children will only move to different classrooms for specific subjects such as PE and design and technology.\n\nMs Carter said she expected to have to persuade some parents that the site \"is as secure as we can make it, and children do need to come back to school\".\n\n\"It's been a long time, they need to re-engage with their learning - and it's also the issue of mental health. Children need to be back in the classroom where teachers are best placed to look after them and help them make the progress they need for their learning,\" she said.\n\nThe latest government estimate saw the R number - the rate at which an infected person passes on the virus to someone else - rise to 0.9-1.1, meaning infections may be growing.\n\nOn Saturday, the government said there had been 1,288 newly-confirmed cases.\n\nProf Whitty said he would be \"quite surprised if we had a highly effective vaccine ready for mass use in a large percentage of the population before the end of winter, certainly before this side of Christmas\".\n\nHe said while people were developing a vaccine at extraordinarily fast speed\", the virus would continue to pose a \"really serious challenge\" for at least the next nine months.",

        "body": "A mother with lung cancer has died after twice being told her persistent cough was probably due to coronavirus.\n\nBeth Pattison, who had recovered from breast cancer twice before, spoke to a GP in March and an oncologist in May.\n\nShe died in June leaving behind a five year-old son, Finn. Her family is now urging the NHS to check for cancer as a priority if a patient has ever been diagnosed with the disease.\n\nNewcastle Hospitals NHS Trust has been approached for comment.\n\nBridge End Surgery has offered the family its condolences.\n\nMs Pattison was first diagnosed with breast cancer in 2016 and underwent a mastectomy and courses of chemotherapy and radiotherapy.\n\nIn 2017 she had further chemotherapy after discovering another lump.\n\nIn March 2020 the 27-year-old visited Bridge End Surgery in Chester-le-Street because of a persistent cough and was told her symptoms were likely to be the result of Covid-19 which had begun spreading across the country.\n\nDuring a telephone appointment with an oncologist at Newcastle's Royal Victoria Infirmary two months later, she was again told her illness was probably the virus, according to her father, Craig.\n\nMs Pattison was admitted to hospital on 8 June and was initially treated for possible pneumonia. A coronavirus test prior to her admission came back negative, as did two further tests taken while she was in hospital.\n\nHer father said it took more than week until doctors investigated and found she had ovarian cancer, breast cancer and lung cancer.\n\nMs Pattison worked as a housing officer and died on 27 June in Newcastle's Freeman Hospital after suffering a cardiac arrest while medics tried to place her in an induced coma.\n\n\"If there's one thing Beth can leave as her legacy it's that people who have had a previous diagnosis of cancer are checked for it first before other causes are looked at,\" Mr Pattison said.\n\n\"Let's make sure the horrible disease hasn't come back. Get tested now. That's all we're asking.\n\n\"We're not looking to blame any health professional because the care and support she received over four years was second to none and we think what the NHS has done, especially since March when the pandemic came along, has been superb.\n\n\"Beth wasn't a victim of Covid, she was a victim of the circumstances caused by Covid.\"\n\nBridge End Surgery said: \"As always, we would reiterate to people that if you're experiencing potential cancer symptoms, please get in touch with your GP practice.\"",

    "NHS staff sickness highest on record amid pandemic": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "NHS Wales' staff sickness in the early stages of the coronavirus pandemic was the highest on record.\n\nThe sickness rate in the three months to March was 6% - up 0.4% on the same time in 2019 - the highest since data began being collected in 2008.\n\nThose self-isolating were not counted in the figures, which cover the period just before April's coronavirus peak.\n\nThe Welsh Government said it took NHS staff wellbeing \"extremely seriously\" and offered help to reduce sick rates.\n\nIn a report, it said March saw the highest-recorded monthly rate, adding that given the timing it was \"more than likely attributed to Covid-19\".\n\nDespite being only one of two areas of the NHS to show a decrease in sickness, the Welsh Ambulance Services NHS Trust still had the highest rate - 7.1% compared to the Wales average of 6%.\n\nThe absence rate is calculated by taking the number of sick days and dividing it by the total number of days available for each area of the NHS.\n\nHealthcare assistants and support workers had the highest absence rate in any one staff group at 8%, followed by ambulance workers (7.5%) and nurses, midwives and health visitors (7.2%).\n\nSickness rates have never fallen below 5% for this quarter in the past decade and climbed in recent years from 5.1% in 2016 to 5.6% in 2019.\n\n'We feel guilty being off'\n\nAlison Magor, 56, is a district nursing sister who manages a team in Cwmbran. She caught coronavirus in March and was off work for the best part of five weeks.\n\n\"It's quite frightening having Covid,\" she said.\n\n\"We all think that we know what it's like to have flu and to have viruses, but to be so very, very short of breath and to be so fatigued, to be so tired [and] not want to eat, not want to drink.\"\n\nMs Magor said the health board and her colleagues had done everything possible to ensure \"stringent\" safeguards had been in place at the time she caught the virus, and praised them for their support.\n\nBut being away from work made her feel bad about not being able to help.\n\n\"All you do is think about your team. How are they doing? How are they coping?\n\n\"We all feel guilty in the NHS if we're off, because that's one man down. That's another person who's not there to help carry the load. It is it what it is - you know you can't help it.\"\n\nMs Magor said she currently has a member of staff off waiting for the result of a Covid-19 test and she was emailing in every day, anxious about being absent.\n\n\"I said 'don't worry about it, you'll know when you get the test back. Just look after yourself',\" she added.\n\n\"I'm very proud of my team because the minute that everybody is well enough to come back in, they've been back in work.\"\n\nNicky Hughes, of the Royal College of Nursing (RCN), said she expected to see the sickness rate get worse when the figures for the next quarter are released - which will include the peak of the virus in April.\n\nShe said: \"I would imagine we would see a spike in those weeks before testing came in and we had huge circulation in the community.\"\n\nMs Hughes, the RCN's associate director of nursing for employment relations, said the one change that would have made the biggest difference to managing staff sickness would have been an earlier rollout of testing of NHS staff.\n\nWales' health minister announced front-line NHS staff would be screened from 18 March.\n\n\"We called for testing to be brought in at an earlier stage, we had staff who had symptoms - it could have been coronavirus, it could have been a common cold,\" said Ms Hughes.\n\n\"We had members saying: 'If I could have a test, I could get back to my workplace.'\n\n\"If we had testing sooner, we may have been able to help get people back to work quicker.\"\n\nWhile the ambulance service had the highest sickness absence rate of any trust (7.1%), this fell by 0.4% for the equivalent period in 2019.\n\nHelen Watkins, the Welsh Ambulance Service's deputy director of workforce and organisational development, said: \"The very nature of ambulance work means that the wellbeing of our staff is pushed to the limit, physically and emotionally.\n\n\"Our sickness absence figures are not where we want them to be, but we're one of two organisations across NHS Wales that have actually improved compared to the same period last year, and are encouraged that they're moving in the right direction.\"\n\nThe union Unison said health services would need to wait until later in the year for a \"much clearer picture of the impact of Covid on the NHS Wales\".\n\nRegional secretary Tanya Palmer added: \"Looking after very sick patients during the Covid public health emergency placed an unimaginable mental and physical toll on Welsh healthcare workers and their social care colleagues.\n\n\"Many became ill and devastatingly, some paid with their lives helping others.\n\n\"The challenge was unprecedented in their careers. Dealing with the scale of death when patients' families could not be present is likely to leave a lasting impact and we know many will suffer post-traumatic stress disorder.\n\n\"There is a duty on their employer and government to provide these workers with every support they need.\"\n\nA Welsh Government spokesman said: \"We take NHS staff health and wellbeing extremely seriously and support NHS Wales to reduce sickness rates.\n\n\"This includes the Corporate Health Standard for staff and providing a range of extra support during the pandemic, including over \u00a31m for mental health support.\n\n\"We expect some variance from year to year in sickness levels. We prioritised NHS staff testing as soon as the tests became available and moved quickly to increase testing capacity.\"",

        "authors": [],
        "body": "Millions of pupils in England, Wales and Northern Ireland are due to return to school within weeks, after months of disrupted education as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. Parents and teachers where schools have already reopened tells us what they've learned from their children returning to the classroom.\n\nMike Corbett was happy to return to face-to-face teaching at his secondary school in East Dunbartonshire earlier this month.\n\n\"Just that buzz of classroom discussion that you get - that's completely impossible online - is a delight to have and one of the best things that we like about teaching,\" the English teacher tells Radio 5 Live.\n\nMike, who is national executive member for the NASUWT Scotland teaching union, thinks the pupils are \"very happy to be back\" too - but there's plenty of pandemic protocols for them to get used to such as regularly using hand sanitiser, not doing group work, and wiping down their desks before leaving the room.\n\nMike also has things to adapt to. He's frustrated by a line marking out two metres to keep him a safe distance from pupils, because it means he cannot approach individuals who are struggling with understanding his lesson.\n\nBut it's \"just as well\" the line is there, Mike says. On Thursday, his entire classroom had to be evacuated and cleaned as a result of a pupil displaying coronavirus symptoms.\n\n\"The only reason I was able to sleep soundly on Thursday night was because I did not cross that two-metre line,\" he says.\n\nDespite comments from the UK's chief medical adviser, Prof Chris Whitty, attempting to reassure parents, pupils and teachers that schools are safe, Mike says \"staff out there are very anxious still about the situation\".\n\nHe said the recent increase in cases in Scotland means the virus will \"inevitably\" get into the classroom - \"and then the fear is that there's a spread in schools\".\n\nAlex Nunn lives in Berlin, where her 15-year-old step-children have been back to school for two weeks.\n\n\"There was no extra spacing or anything like that going on in the school,\" she says, but that's because teachers and pupils there must wear masks everywhere around the school, apart from once they're seated at their desks.\n\n\"As soon as they get up to move around the school, go to the loo, go in the playground, they're wearing masks the whole time,\" she says.\n\nAlex, 50, tells Radio 5 Live she struggles to understand why some people in the UK see wearing a mask as \"such a big problem\", and hopes some anxious parents will learn lessons from her sister, who she has been visiting in London.\n\n\"My five-year-old nephew is wearing one here when he's going on public transport. Somehow my sister's managed to make it a bit of an adventure, and fun, and he understands why he's wearing it - and I simply don't get why it's being perceived as being a big deal to wear a mask here,\" she says.\n\nThe World Health Organization has said children aged 12 and over should wear masks in line with national recommendations, citing evidence suggesting teenagers can infect others in the same way as adults.\n\nMasks are also a big talking point in Scotland.\n\nColette Reilly says since her daughters, aged 12 and 14, returned to the classroom, a teacher has told them the current lack of rules about wearing masks is \"likely to change\" at the school in Paisley.\n\nIt comes after criticism from some pupils saying \"it's not possible to social distance\" inside schools. One high school in Edinburgh has already chosen to tell pupils and staff to wear face coverings while moving around between lessons.\n\n\"I've not got an issue with [my children wearing masks],\" Colette tells Radio 5 Live.\n\n\"Even if it's [for a] year, in terms of a life span, it's a very short-term issue. At the end of the day, this isn't about individual families, this is about the collective. We all need to look after each other.\"\n\nShe says the \"significant changes\" her daughters have noticed about the return to school life include using hand sanitiser at stations throughout school, social distancing from other students inside classrooms, and being given digital-only homework.\n\nLiz Silverman from Northwood, London, wants face coverings to be made mandatory at the school gates of her grandchildren's primary school.\n\n\"At collection time all the mums, dads and grandparents have to wait outside the classroom as the teacher will not release a child until they see the parent or grandparent. Social distancing is not possible... I don't feel safe,\" she says.\n\nLiz says her daughter and daughter-in-law would not be able to return to work if she does not pick the children up from school twice a week - so they have \"no alternative\" but to ask her for help.\n\nBut she is concerned that, as her husband has been shielding, \"if I bring anything home to him, it could be devastating\".",

        "body": "New \"life-saving\" 90-minute tests which can detect coronavirus and flu will be rolled out in care homes and laboratories from next week.\n\nThe \"on-the-spot\" swab and DNA tests will help distinguish between Covid-19 and other seasonal illnesses, the government said.\n\nThe health secretary said this would be \"hugely beneficial\" over the winter.\n\nCurrently, three quarters of test results are returned within 24 hours and a quarter can take up to two days.\n\nThe announcement comes as the government pushed back a July target to regularly test care home staff and residents, saying the number of testing kits had become more limited.\n\nAlmost half a million of the new rapid swab tests will be available from next week in adult care settings and labs, with millions more due to be rolled out later in the year.\n\nAdditionally, thousands of DNA test machines, which have already been used in eight London hospitals and can analyse nose swabs, will be rolled out across NHS hospitals from September.\n\nAround 5,000 machines will provide 5.8 million tests in the coming months, the department said.\n\nHealth Secretary Matt Hancock described these latest innovations in coronavirus testing as \"life-saving\".\n\nHe added: \"Millions of new rapid coronavirus tests will provide on-the-spot results in under 90 minutes, helping us to break chains of transmission quickly.\n\n\"The fact these tests can detect flu as well as Covid-19 will be hugely beneficial as we head into winter, so patients can follow the right advice to protect themselves and others.\"\n\nBy Lauren Moss, health correspondent\n\nThere's been a lot of focus on how long Covid test results can take to come back and the impact that has on halting the spread of the virus.\n\nOverall, three quarters of results are now returned within 24 hours but some can still take up to two days.\n\nThe news rapid tests that can analyse swabs in pop up mobile labs and provide results in 90 minutes is hugely significant.\n\nNo data on the accuracy of these tests has been made publicly available yet but those behind them say there are controls in place to check for false negatives.\n\nAnd another major benefit sees the tests able to detect other winter illnesses, such as the flu, so doctors will know whether someone presenting with coronavirus symptoms has the virus or something else.\n\nIt comes as authorities in Greater Manchester insisted people should not be alarmed by a decision to declare a \"major incident\" on Sunday evening in response to rising rates of Covid-19 there.\n\nManchester City Council said the move was to help various agencies work together and draw on extra resources.\n\nScotland's national clinical director warned of going \"backwards\" over easing lockdown after a cluster of coronavirus cases were linked to a pub in Aberdeen.\n\nMeanwhile, Leicester - the first UK city to have a localised lockdown - will see pubs and restaurants reopen from Monday as a number of restrictions are lifted.\n\nAnd a government scheme to encourage people to visit restaurants, cafes and pubs, customers across the UK has now launched - giving customers of 72,000 establishments 50% off meals bought Monday to Wednesday in August.\n\nCoronavirus tests are currently carried out at drive-through or walk-in sites as well as at hospitals for patients and some NHS workers.\n\nHome test kits can also be delivered to someone's door so people can test themselves. Swab samples are analysed at a laboratory before the result being passed on to the individual.\n\nUnlike other seasonal illnesses, those infected with Covid-19 are required to self-isolate for 10 days.\n\nProf Chris Toumazou, co-founder of DnaNudge, which supplied the machines providing the tests, said the \"rapid\" and \"highly accurate\" Covid-19 test can be deployed anywhere \"with a direct sample-to-result\".\n\nGordon Sanghera, chief executive of Oxford Nanopore, which supplied the tests, said they have the potential to provide an \"accessible global testing solution\".\n\nRegular testing of care home residents and staff was meant to have started on 6 July but officials said this might not be in place until the end of the first week of September.\n\nA spokeswoman for the Department of Health said: \"A combination of factors have meant that a more limited number of testing kits, predominantly used in care homes, are currently available for asymptomatic re-testing and we are working round the clock with providers to restore capacity.\"\n\nLast month, the government withdrew one brand of home-testing kits used in care homes over safety concerns.\n\nMeanwhile, researchers are urgently appealing for recovered patients to donate their blood plasma - in a bid to help the NHS treat people who fall ill in the coming months.\n\nA major trial is ongoing, looking at how effective transfusing blood plasma into patients who are struggling to develop their own immune response could be as a potential treatment for Covid-19.\n\nA further eight deaths were reported in the UK on Sunday, taking the total number of people who have died after testing positive for the virus to 46,201. However figures tend to be lower at the weekend due to reporting delays.\n\nThe latest government statistics also showed 744 new cases had been confirmed in the 24 hours to 09:00 on Sunday.",

        "body": "You've heard of the \"new normal\" around things like going back to work or shopping.\n\nBut it also applies to sex, according to a sexual health charity.\n\nThe Terrence Higgins Trust has published advice suggesting people avoid kissing, wear a face covering and choose positions that aren't face-to-face during sex.\n\nIt may sound tough, but people need to find a way \"to balance our need for sex and intimacy with the risks of the spread of COVID-19\", the Trust says.\n\nThe best sexual partner during the pandemic is yourself or someone you live with, the Trust says.\n\nMasturbation, using sex toys or participating in phone or online sex are recommended as the safest options.\n\nThat's not to say sex is off the table, but it should ideally be with people who are part of your household.\n\nWe should still be socially distancing, but after months of lockdown the charity says it is unrealistic to expect people to stop having sex indefinitely. If you are having sex with people outside of your household, it's important to limit the number of partners, it says.\n\nLike with everything at the moment, be aware of any Covid-19 symptoms you or your partner might have - and isolate if you have them.\n\nIf you are meeting someone new, the charity says to ask if they or anyone in their household have had symptoms or tested positive.\n\nThe virus can spread through saliva, mucus or the breath of those who have it, along with contact with hard surfaces.\n\n\"If you are going to touch each other's genitals it's likely that you will potentially be kissing at the same time - and we know the virus is passed through saliva,\" Dr Alex George told Radio 1 Newsbeat in March.\n\nDr Alex is an A&E doctor and former Love Island contestant and says \"any possibility of transfer of coronavirus - from your mouth to your hands, to genitals, to someone else's nose or mouth\" increases the risk of passing on coronavirus.\n\nThat's why the Trust recommends not kissing, wearing a face mask during sex and favouring positions where you're not face-to-face.\n\nIt adds the virus has been found in semen and poo, which is why you should use condoms and dams for oral sex to minimise risk.\n\nAnd given we're supposed to be doing it after most things - washing your hands for more than 20 seconds or using hand sanitiser before and after sex is recommended.\n\nAll of this is not to say you should forget about your sexual health in general.\n\nThe charity says it's important to get tested for sexually transmitted infections before starting to have sex again.\n\n\"Lockdown has meant that most people have had fewer sexual partners, if any at all, and now is the perfect time to be sure you don't have an STI and to know what your HIV status is,\" it says.",

Numbers then rose again in late April.\n\nThere was little impact on uptake of other vaccines, and further analysis by PHE suggests children were vaccinated at normal levels in May and June.\n\nDr Mary Ramsay, head of immunisation at PHE, said it was \"vital\" that parents knew that routine vaccinations were still available and made sure their children attended appointments.\n\nShe said this was particularly the case for diseases such as measles, where high vaccination rates were needed to prevent outbreaks.\n\nThe LGA said a \"national effort\" to vaccinate children and young people was required to relieve pressure on the health service and avoid preventable diseases.\n\nJudith Blake, chairwoman of the LGA's Children and Young People Board, said: \"Vaccines are an absolutely essential part of our children's health and wellbeing, so if you or any member of your household are not displaying symptoms of coronavirus and are not self-isolating, vaccinations should happen as normal.\n\n\"Local services are working hard to ensure that people including babies, children and pregnant women still receive their routine vaccinations - they provide essential protection against potentially life-threatening diseases.\"",

        "authors": [],
        "body": "Prioritising coronavirus testing in high-risk areas has led to shortages in other places, leading to some people with symptoms being asked to drive more than 100 miles for a swab.\n\nThe government says areas with fewer Covid-19 cases have had their testing capacity reduced to cope with outbreaks elsewhere.\n\nBut public health experts warn this could miss the start of new spikes.\n\nMeanwhile, a \u00a3500m fund to trial a 20-minute saliva test has been unveiled.\n\nHealth Secretary Matt Hancock told the BBC that testing was being focused on areas with outbreaks where case numbers were much higher, but the \"vast majority\" of people could get a test \"close to home\".\n\nHe admitted there were \"operational challenges\", adding that the trial of new rapid tests could \"solve the problem\".\n\nGroups of people including staff and students at the University of Southampton and four schools in the Hampshire city will take part in the trial.\n\nThere will also be a trial in Salford of the benefits of repeatedly testing a population.\n\n\"Short of a vaccine, this is the best chance we have of reducing social distancing whilst controlling the virus, especially with winter coming and all the challenges that brings,\" the health secretary told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.\n\nWhen David Llewellyn tried to book a test on Sunday he was directed to a test centre near Blackburn - 250 miles from his home in Stowmarket, Suffolk.\n\n\"I thought I'd entered my home location incorrectly so went through the booking process again, only to get the same location for testing.\n\n\"Needless to say I have subsequently ordered a home testing kit, which despite three automated email reminders to take the test has yet to arrive. I'd do the test if I had it.\n\n\"I think it's ridiculous. The idea that the test centres near me in rural Suffolk are at capacity is unlikely and whilst I accept that Covid is unpredictable and the science is changing all the time, I don't think the government have got their act together.\n\n\"The fact I've been directed 250 miles away in order to get a test shows they haven't got it right yet.\"\n\nIt came as a postcode search of the government's coronavirus test booking service revealed:\n\nThese distances are the ones that are given on the government website, but they appear to have been calculated as the crow flies, rather than being a true reflection of how long it would take to drive - for example, the Devon to Carmarthen route was actually a 206-mile drive according to Google Maps.\n\nDr Zoe Norris, a GP in Yorkshire, told BBC Breakfast such journeys would be a \"huge undertaking\" for those with coronavirus symptoms, which include a fever and persistent cough.\n\n\"I've certainly got patients who would not manage to drive those distances,\" she added.\n\nNational testing capacity has not reduced, but it's already being outstripped by rising applications for tests.\n\nThe Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) has responded by rationing testing slots, with fewer tests available in areas with fewer cases.\n\nDr Stephen Baker at the University of Cambridge, who has been conducting testing for the area's hospital staff, said this was a \"pragmatic move from the government to focus resources where they are most needed\", but the strategy could become a problem if more cases developed outside the current areas of concern.\n\nPeople with symptoms and essential workers can still apply for home kits, although these take longer to return a result.\n\nIt has also been taking longer for people who do go to a drive-through testing centre to receive their results.\n\nNHS Test and Trace figures show in the week of 13-19 August, 41% of in-person tests at mobile testing units and drive-through centres gave results within 24 hours. That's down from 61% the week before.\n\nFor all routes combined, including home kits, 20% of tests had results back within 24 hours, compared with 29% the week before.\n\nRegular mass testing of people without symptoms is seen by ministers as the best passport to further easing of lockdown restrictions until a vaccine is developed.\n\nSimple kits with rapid results, used weekly, can give assurances people don't have coronavirus. That's what the new funding for trials and pilot schemes is all about - but that's a long-term goal.\n\nThe reality right now is capacity shortages and long-distance drives for some people needing tests.\n\nDemand seems to be outstripping supply even after a big expansion in testing sites and laboratories.\n\nPublic health experts have warned these issues need to be urgently addressed to ensure that local outbreaks can be properly monitored and tackled as winter approaches.\n\nPaul Hunter, a public health expert and professor of medicine at the University of East Anglia, said these issues could act as \"big disincentive to being tested\" and result in missing local increases \"early enough to maybe stop more widespread infection\".\n\nA DHSC spokesperson said: \"There is a high demand for tests and our laboratories continue to turn test results around as quickly as possible.\n\n\"To make sure we stay in control of this virus we are targeting our testing capacity at the areas that need it most, including those where there is an outbreak, as well as prioritising at-risk groups.\"\n\nBut virologist Prof Nicola Stonehouse at the University of Leeds said: \"Although cases are low we need to remember that the pandemic started from a single case and that only a small number of people entering the UK (mainly from Italy) resulted in the large number of cases earlier this year.\"\n\n\"The key to controlling the pandemic has to be through testing. And this needs to be made as accessible as possible,\" she added.\n\nThe government has pledged to increase its capacity to 500,000 tests a day by the end of October.\n\nCurrently, it says, testing capacity is about 350,000 a day - but only just over half of that is being used.\n\nDaily testing has only broken 200,000 on one day, despite the government hailing reaching its target of having that level of capacity at the end of May.\n\nThe DHSC stressed that booking slots were added in the evening for morning appointments and in the morning for afternoon appointments, so more local slots might become available through the day.\n\nThe website states: \"This service is currently very busy. If you are unable to book a test now or the location and time is not convenient for you, please try again in a few hours when more tests should be available.\n\n\"If no tests are available online, do not call helplines to get a test. You will not be able to get a test through the helplines.\"\n\nFollow Rachel on Twitter\n\nHave you been asked to travel long distances to get a test?

It comes as the government says areas with fewer cases will reduce testing capacity.\n\nTrials in Southampton and Hampshire will also be expanded and demand for testing is expected to rise with the return to schools and work places.\n\n\"Over the past six months we have built one of the biggest testing systems in the world,\" Mr Hancock said.\n\n\"We need to use every new innovation at our disposal to expand the use of testing, and build the mass testing capability that can help suppress the virus.\n\n\"We are backing innovative new tests that are fast, accurate and easier to use [that] will maximise the impact and scale of testing, helping us to get back to a more normal way of life.\"\n\nSalford City Council and other local partners will be involved in the saliva-based testing, the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) said.\n\nSelected participants will be invited for a weekly test in the pilot, with up to 250 tests conducted a day.\n\nIt will start in high footfall areas such as retail areas, public services, transport and faith spaces.\n\nThe test aims to identify positive cases early on, including asymptomatic patients or those with minor symptoms, so that people can self-isolate promptly.\n\nIt will also indicate how regular repeat community testing could be scaled up across the country.\n\nIn Southampton, the second phase of a no-swab saliva test pilot is due to begin this week with a weekly testing model trialled of more than 2,100 pupils and staff across four schools, as well as students and staff at the University of Southampton which is leading the project in partnership with Southampton City Council and the NHS.\n\nThe DHSC said the pilot of a rapid 20-minute coronavirus test in Hampshire would be expanded \"to further explore... mobile testing in different settings\".\n\nThe investment will also be used to extend capacity for existing polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing.\n\nBaroness Dido Harding, interim executive chair of the National Institute for Health Protection said: \"New testing technologies and methods are vital to keep the system evolving and improving, especially as we assess how routine testing could help pick up cases of the virus earlier.\"",

    "Schools furious at 'last-minute' virus guidance": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "Head teachers and teachers have criticised the government for \"last-minute\" guidance on what to do during virus outbreaks and local lockdowns.\n\nThe guidance for England was published on Friday evening, just days before many schools begin term.\n\nThe NAHT school leaders' union said the timing was \"reprehensible\".\n\nIn local lockdowns, secondary pupils could be kept home every other fortnight and, in an outbreak, large groups could be told to self-isolate.\n\nPaul Whiteman, general secretary of the NAHT, said the decision to publish the guidance on a Friday evening before a bank holiday was \"nothing short of reprehensible and demonstrates a complete lack of regard for the well-being of school leaders and their teams\".\n\nHe said: \"It was obvious weeks ago that lockdown advice was necessary.\"\n\nIn areas where additional coronavirus restrictions have been introduced because of rising cases, secondary schools have been told they might have to limit the number of students and bring in a rota system, with each pupil spending a fortnight at school then a fortnight learning remotely so as to break the chain of Covid-19 transmission.\n\nThe guidance says this would only happen after \"all other measures have been exhausted\" - but that if cases continued to increase, all students might have to move to remote learning apart from those in vulnerable groups or whose parents were key workers.\n\nEducation Secretary Gavin Williamson said the document was a contingency plan for a \"worst-case scenario\", which he hoped would not need to be implemented.\n\nThere are four stages of response, depending on the level of virus cases in the area:\n\nTier 1: All pupils attend as normal.\n\nTier 2: Secondary schools and colleges move to rotas, with students alternating a fortnight attending and a fortnight at home. Primary schools remain open to all.\n\nTier 3: Most secondary pupils learn from home as secondary schools and colleges are only open to vulnerable children, the children of key workers and selected year groups.\n\nTier 4: All schools switch to remote learning, except for vulnerable children and the children of key workers, and students at alternative provision and special schools.\n\nThe guidance also sets out what to do when a school confirms a case of coronavirus. Health protection teams will advise the school how many pupils need to be sent home to isolate for 14 days.\n\nIf a case occurs where the \"bubbles\" used to limit pupils' contacts in schools are smaller, such as a single class, all those in the bubble might have to be sent home to isolate.\n\nIn bigger bubbles, such as an entire year group, health protection teams could send home all the other pupils, or limit self-isolation to those who were in direct contact or close proximity or who had travelled with a pupil with the virus.\n\nPatrick Roach, of teachers' union NASUWT, said the government needed to give schools the resources to cope with the potential disruption, including support for remote learning and cover for staff absence due to self-isolation.\n\n\"The availability of staff where there is a local lockdown or outbreak may mean that schools have to limit provision if they cannot be staffed safely,\" he added.\n\nGeoff Barton, leader of the ASCL head teachers' union, said he felt a \"weary, resigned sense of inevitability\" to receive the guidance at the last minute, after head teachers had been accused of \"treachery\" for asking for contingency planning for outbreaks.\n\nHe said more needed to be done to support students in exam years who might find their teaching disrupted, including ensuring they had access to laptops to study at home.\n\n\"We have to do better than previously,\" he said. \"We simply cannot have those young people being left at home without clear guidance on what they're going to do.\"\n\nMary Bousted, joint general-secretary of the National Education Union, said the guidance should have been ready \"months ago\".\n\nLabour's shadow education secretary Kate Green told Sky News the guidelines were \"long overdue\" and it was \"unfair\" to school and college leaders to release them so close to the start of term.\n\nThe guidelines on introducing rotas only apply to secondary schools. Prof Neil Ferguson, a former advisor to the government on the pandemic, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme primary schools often only had \"the odd case\" without evidence of wider transmission, so there was less need for the measures.\n\nBut he said schools also needed \"very rapid testing\" of students and staff to control outbreaks.\n\nProf Carl Heneghan, a Oxford University epidemiologist and practising GP, said cold and flu cases meant many pupils would have to self-isolate until they could be tested, so schools and families faced \"significant disruption\".\n\n\"If your child has any symptoms they're going to have to stay off school. In the past there's been a tendency to say, you can have some Calpol, maybe you can go in. But there's going to have to be a sea-change in how parents behave with their children,\" he said.\n\nBy Dan Johnson, BBC News\n\nHead teachers had asked for a Plan B and here it is - but there's frustration it came just days before more children are due back in the classroom across England.\n\nA suggestion of entire year groups or classes - \"bubbles\" - having to automatically self-isolate was deleted, but not before it added confusion.\n\nThe Department for Education is now pointing to more nuanced guidance about head teachers and public health officials needing to establish who's been in \"close contact\" with anyone who tests positive.\n\nThere's recognition that schools won't be immune from outbreaks in local communities and, while the intention will be to stay open and keep children in class, there's an acknowledgement that further interruptions to learning are possible.\n\nPrimary school pupils are the clear priority. Secondary schools will first adopt a rota system before more prolonged disruption, meaning remote learning will still be a reality for some children.\n\nMeanwhile, Health Secretary Matt Hancock has not ruled out nationwide restrictions should England see a spike in coronavirus cases this winter.\n\nHe told The Times a second wave was \"a very serious threat\" and that, under a \"reasonable worst-case scenario\", Britain could be faced with a spike in Covid-19 cases and a bad outbreak of seasonal flu as people spent more time indoors.",

This week, researchers in Hong Kong reported the first documented case of re-infection.\n\nProf Paul Moss, UK-CIC principal investigator from the University of Birmingham, said: \"It's the first case out of millions, so we have to keep it in proportion.\"\n\nHe said it was a concern that the immune response to coronavirus seemed to wane over time.\n\nBut he said the fact that the man had no symptoms during his second infection suggested the immune system could be effective at halting the disease.\n\nThe consortium will also be studying whether some people have pre-existing immunity to the virus, even though they have never been exposed to it.\n\nSeveral studies have shown that an earlier encounter with some of the coronaviruses that cause the common cold enables the immune system to recognise the new coronavirus.\n\nProf Moss said a key question was to find out whether infection with other mild coronaviruses could protect you from catching Covid-19 or make you more ill.",

        "authors": [],
        "body": "Scotland will join the UK's coronavirus monitoring survey for the first time in September, creating a better picture of how the virus is spreading.\n\nThe ONS Infection Survey has been released weekly since May.\n\nBy testing thousands of people in households representative of the population, regardless of symptoms, it is the most accurate indicator of infection levels in the community.\n\nThis helps the government identify emerging outbreaks and respond to them.\n\nThe number of people taking part in the survey had been going up by about 5,000 each week, but the latest announcement increases this massively - from 28,000 to 150,000 people in England, and 15,000 people in Scotland when the survey launches there.\n\nHealth secretary Jeane Freeman said: \"We know that meeting this challenge requires a comprehensive set of public health measures to drive the number of cases down - intelligence, anticipation, prevention, mitigation and response and clearly testing has a crucial role - it allows us to get ahead of the curve and track down and contain the virus as far as possible.\"\n\nThe ONS selects a random sample of households with the aim of being as representative of the country at large as possible.\n\nBut you will only be selected if you or someone in your household has taken part in an ONS survey before and agreed to be contacted.\n\nIf selected, you will receive a letter from IQVIA, a data company who are collecting the data on behalf of the ONS and Oxford University.\n\nIf you want to take part, you call the number on the letter to register.\n\nA survey healthcare worker will visit your house and ask everyone there if they want to take part.\n\nAnyone over the age of two can participate.\n\nSwab tests will be self-administered under the supervision of the healthcare worker. Children under the age of 11 will be swabbed by a parent or carer.\n\nThe healthcare worker will also ask questions about your gender, ethnicity, date of birth, occupation and who your GP is.\n\nIf you are aged-16 or over, you may be asked when you call to register if you want to have an antibody test as well as the swab.\n\nAn antibody test can show if you have previously had the coronavirus infection by analysing a blood sample. A swab test will only show if you currently have the infection.\n\nIf you are asked for an antibody test and agree, a nurse will come to your house instead. They will take the blood, but the swab tests will still be self-administered.\n\nOnly 20% of adults will be invited to take an antibody test.\n\nThe visit takes 15 to 30 minutes.\n\nYour GP will be informed that you are participating in the study and the result of your swab test will be shared with them.\n\nThey can discuss the result with you.\n\nAntibody test results, however, will not be shared with you.\n\nThe ONS says this is because the results of these tests are currently only used in research and not yet approved by the regulator. The blood sample will be tested by scientists at the University of Oxford, looking for levels of antibodies against Covid-19 in your blood.\n\nYou will be asked if you want to repeat the tests at a later date.\n\nThis is useful to see how exposure to coronavirus changes over time.\n\nRandom, large-scale testing of people regardless of whether they are displaying symptoms is thought to be the best way of tracking how the virus is spreading in the community.\n\nThe bigger the survey, the easier it is to make predictions based on the data collected.\n\nProf sir Ian Diamond, the UK's National Statistician, said: \"Vigilance is key to containing this pandemic and the extra data on the spread of infections and antibodies at local level will be invaluable to the planning of effective local responses.\"\n\nHe added: \"Following this expansion, the ONS-led COVID-19 Infection Survey will be the biggest of its kind in this country.\"",

        "body": "Scotland has recorded its second highest daily jump in coronavirus cases since the end of May.\n\nA further 88 people have tested positive for coronavirus in Scotland in the last 24 hours.\n\nFirst Minister Nicola Sturgeon tweeted there was \"no need for alarm\" and the rise was partly due to increased testing.\n\nThere were no new deaths reported in the past 24 hours.\n\nFive people were being treated in intensive care on Friday evening, up two on the previous day.\n\nThe largest recent rise in cases was just over a week ago on 22 August when 123 new cases were registered. Before that the next largest increase was on 22 May, when 113 new cases were confirmed.\n\nIn its daily update, the Scottish government said 0.7% of newly-tested individuals were found to have the virus.\n\nNHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde saw a rise of 36 positive cases. The health board later said it was contact tracing in connection with Gilmour & Dean Eurostampa, a printing firm based in Whiteinch.\n\nNHS Ayrshire and Arran saw 10 new cases. On Friday the health board said it was contact tracing with a small number of pupils in a South Ayrshire Council secondary school who have had contact with a confirmed case of Covid-19.\n\nTest and Protect staff were also tracing contacts of a separate small number of positive cases.\n\nCases in NHS Tayside and Grampian where there have been outbreaks rose by 11 and six respectively.\n\nScotland's national clinical director, Jason Leitch, told the BBC: \"It's up from yesterday. But it is down from last Saturday. It has been about this level, 50-100, for about three or four weeks.\"\n\nHe said there was no indication that there was a new major outbreak of the nature of Aberdeen or Coupar Angus.\n\nBut he noted the rise in the number of people being treated in intensive care units.\n\nHe said: \"People should not take this lightly - everybody needs to do their bit to keep these numbers low.\"\n\nMr Leitch added that he felt the outbreak in Coupar Angus, linked to the 2Sisters food plant, had been contained \"really well\".\n\nHe said: \"The incident management team are doing a really fantastic job. I am actually a little surprised that we have been able to contain it. It was a lot of people dispersed across Tayside and they have behaved really well.\n\n\"They have been contacted by the local authority with lots of home visits and whole-house self-isolation and we have seen pretty much no community transmission from that outbreak.\"\n\nFirst Minister Nicola Sturgeon tweeted that there was \"no need for alarm\" over the rise in cases.\n\nShe said the leap was due to an increase in testing, and the proportion of people tested returning positive results remained below 1%.\n\n\"The increase in cases just now partly reflects a greater volume of testing. Crucially, our positivity rate remains low (below 1% again today). So no need for alarm. But there is a need to be very careful & cautious - it is all very delicately balanced just now,\" she said.\n\nJason Leitch revealed that he will be writing to parents in the coming week to reinforce the guidance on when a test for the virus is required.\n\nAlmost 17,500 children were tested in the week after schools returned, putting pressure on the testing system.\n\nHe said that he wanted to reassure parents on what to do in scenarios where cold and flu symptoms were present.\n\nHe added that the Scottish government wanted to get the guidance across as simply as possible to make sure everyone stayed safe.",

    "Secondaries to teach by rota if virus cases rise": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "Secondary schools in areas with significant rises in Covid-19 cases could be put on a rota system limiting the number of pupils attending.\n\nNew guidance for England said the measure is intended to reduce the number of people students are in contact with and limit transmission.\n\nThe education secretary said the changes are an \"absolute last resort\".\n\nThe guidance, published on Friday night, comes just days before millions of pupils go back to school.\n\nEducation Secretary Gavin Williamson said the measures were contingency plans for a \"worst-case scenario\".\n\n\"We hope that we won't have to implement the guidance set out today,\" said Mr Williamson.\n\n\"Changes to school attendance will only be an absolute last resort.\"\n\nPaul Whiteman, leader of the National Association of Head Teachers, said: \"Keeping schools open has to be the priority, but you don't need a crystal ball to see that there will almost inevitably be some disruption in some areas in the coming weeks.\"\n\nHe said that heads had been asking for weeks for this \"Plan B\" for what happens in the event of an outbreak - and \"another late-night publication is fairly typical of what we've become used to\".\n\nMeanwhile, Health Secretary Matt Hancock has not ruled out nationwide restrictions should England see a spike in coronavirus cases this winter.\n\nMr Hancock told The Times that a second wave was \"a very serious threat\" and that, under a \"reasonable worst-case scenario\", Britain could be faced with a spike in Covid-19 cases and a bad outbreak of seasonal flu as people spend more time indoors.\n\nFor schools to respond to changing levels of coronavirus cases, there will be a four-stage set of responses - which will all prioritise keeping primary school pupils in school full-time.\n\nThe default setting will be Tier 1, where all pupils will attend full-time.\n\nIf local public health and education officials decide levels of infection are too high, schools could move to a Tier 2 response, in which secondary pupils would go on to a part-time rota. They would be in school for two weeks and then study online at home for two weeks.\n\nThe guidance says schools would only be affected in this way after \"all other measures have been exhausted\" - but it says this would help to break the chain of Covid-19 transmission.\n\nA more severe response would be Tier 3, in which most secondary pupils would study from home, and then Tier 4, in which all types of school would switch to studying from home, except for the children of key workers and vulnerable children.\n\nIf anyone in school tests positive, the guidance says health protection teams will carry out a rapid risk assessment to confirm who has been in close contact with the person and ask them to self-isolate for 14 days.\n\nTwo or more cases in two weeks is deemed an outbreak, which could result in further action, such as a mobile testing unit being dispatched to the school.\n\nIn some cases, health protection teams may recommend that a year group or even the whole school is asked to self-isolate at home.\n\nProf Carl Heneghan, a Oxford University epidemiologist and practising GP, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme schools and families faced \"significant disruption\", with cold and flu cases meaning more pupils will have to self-isolate until they can be tested.\n\n\"If your child has any symptoms they're going to have to stay off school. In the past there's been a tendency to say, you can have some Calpol, maybe you can go in. But there's going to have to be a sea-change in how parents behave with their children,\" he said.\n\nGeoff Barton, leader of the ASCL head teachers' union welcomed the contingency planning but criticised its last-minute publication.\n\n\"To wait until the Friday night before most schools return isn't the government's finest moment. Obviously, schools haven't had any chance whatsoever to incorporate this into their planning and will now have to revisit the plans they have put in place,\" he said.\n\n\"In any event, it is a step in the right direction. Obviously, everybody will be hoping that these back-up plans aren't needed and that schools are able to remain fully open.\"\n\nThe Department for Education also amended its announcement of the guidance shortly after publication, removing a passage which said that if a case in school or college is confirmed an entire year group or \"bubble\" might be asked to isolate for 14 days.\n\nIt said this was \"out of date with the latest guidance at the time of publication\".\n\nEducation staff and parents took to Twitter to express irritation at the timing of the publication.\n\n\"The timing of this shows total disregard for schools, leaders and teachers. It is utterly breathtaking that this is how we are repeatedly treated,\" said deputy head Daniel Sabato.\n\nClaire Sheehan said: \"Our school waited until late this week to send guidance in case stuff changed.\"\n\nIt felt like the government was \"full of the same people [who] wd send redundancy emails 530 fri\", she said.\n\nSeveral teachers raised concerns about the guidance on whole year groups isolating, which was later removed.\n\nHead of geography Mark Enser asked: \"Staff in most secondaries are teaching across year group bubbles - who would be in school to teach the rest?\"\n\n\"I'm a dinner lady, and the lunch hall is a communal area that face masks can't be worn in,\" said Trudi Gard.\n\n\"The dinner ladies come into contact with all children from all bubbles. If a child infects us, we infect everyone else.\"",

The whole group are now self-isolating.\n\nMr Leitch told BBC Scotland that the increase of 60 cases was \"not unexpected\" but \"still worries us\".\n\nHe said it was difficult to be sure how many of the 39 new cases in NHS Grampian were linked to the Aberdeen cluster.\n\n\"We know that at 15:30 yesterday we had 110 cases connected to this outbreak,\" he said.\n\n\"We allow test and protect to do its work, rather than be constantly sending us hourly updates and that's the way it should be. I would expect a number of those positives to be connected.\"\n\nMr Leitch said the Scottish government was working to prevent community transmission outside the Aberdeen outbreak.\n\n\"We want to find each of these cases, break the chain, self-isolate the people so that we can get those numbers down again and Grampian can go back to normal - or semi-normal - like the rest of the country,\" he told the BBC.\n\nBut the clinical director added that the effects of the local lockdown in Aberdeen may not be seen for \"days, even weeks\".\n\nAberdeen has seen a total of 112 new coronavirus cases in the seven days up to 7 August - a rate of 49 infections per 100,000 people.\n\nThis compares to a rate of 80.6 in Blackburn with Darwen in Lancashire, which is currently top of Public Health England's local authority watchlist.\n\nNHS Grampian said it was investigating 643 \"close contacts\" from cases in the area.\n\nSusan Webb, director of public health for NHS Grampian, said: \"There has been a substantial rise in the number of close contacts which is not entirely unexpected.\n\n\"We speak to detected cases more than once, as we know they will recall different details as they reflect on what they have been doing and where, and who they have met.\"\n\nMs Webb said people who developed any of the recognised symptoms of Covid-19 should isolate at home and arrange a test.\n\nOn Friday, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said it was \"unacceptable\" the Aberdeen footballers had gone to the Soul Bar last Saturday.\n\nImages were shared on social media showing queues of people gathered outside the bar, which is one of about 30 venues now linked to the cluster.\n\nThe players concerned have now released a statement apologising for their actions, saying they never \"could have foreseen the escalation of Covid-19 cases in the Grampian area\".\n\nThey also deny deliberately attempting to \"flaunt or disobey government guidelines\".\n\n\"As a player group, we once again apologise unreservedly to the fans, the manager, the board and all the staff at the club,\" the statement adds.\n\nThe lockdown restrictions which have been reintroduced for the city's 228,000 residents include:\n\nThe restrictions will be reviewed next Wednesday and may be extended further if required.",

    "Spanish region bans smoking over Covid-19 risk": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "The Spanish region of Galicia has effectively banned smoking in public places over concerns it increases the risk of Covid-19 transmission.\n\nIt has issued a blanket ban on smoking in the street and in public places, such as restaurants and bars, if social distancing is not possible.\n\nThe north-western region is the first to introduce such a measure, although others are considering following suit.\n\nIt comes as Spain faces the worst infection rate in western Europe.\n\nDaily cases have risen from fewer than 150 in June to more than 1,500 throughout August. It recorded 1,690 new cases in the latest daily count on Wednesday, bringing the country's total to almost 330,000.\n\nGalicia's smoking ban was announced in a press conference on Wednesday after experts recommended the measure to the regional government.\n\nThe move is supported by health ministry research, published last month, that outlined the link between smoking and the increased spread of coronavirus.\n\nIt said the risk was heightened due to smokers not wearing masks. It also said people project droplets when they exhale smoke, and risk infection by touching the cigarette before bringing it to their mouth.\n\n\"Smoking with no limits... with people close by and without any social distancing [poses] a high risk of infection,\" regional President Alberto N\u00fa\u00f1ez Feij\u00f3o told the press conference.\n\n\"We know that this is an unpopular measure for smokers,\" added Alberto Fern\u00e1ndez Villar, a member of the clinical committee advising government, according to the El Pa\u00eds newspaper. \"But I believe we are in an exceptional situation.\"\n\nSimilar measures have been imposed elsewhere, such as in South Africa where the sale of tobacco was banned at the end of March.\n\nIt justified the ban on health grounds based on advice from its own medical experts as well as from the World Health Organization (WHO).\n\nAnd in the UK, a survey showed that more than one million people had given up smoking since the Covid-19 pandemic hit. UK government advice says smokers may be at risk of more severe Covid-19 symptoms.",

    "Still ill with coronavirus six months later": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "Monique Jackson caught Covid-19 early in the pandemic and nearly six months later she's still unwell. One of thousands in this position, she has been keeping an illustrated diary about her symptoms and her vain attempts to get treatment.\n\nAbout a year ago, Monique Jackson watched a Ted talk about mushrooms and was enthralled. Fungi, the speaker said, are the original world wide web, they have a network that runs under entire forests; it enables trees to help each other if they get into trouble.\n\nThese days, as she battles the coronavirus for the 24th week in a row, it's something she thinks about often.\n\nShe has suspected \"long-tail Covid\" a distinct reaction to the virus that doctors are just beginning to study. She got sick in March and at first it seemed to be a mild version of the disease but her symptoms have never gone away. Five months later, she is struggling to understand what is happening to her body.\n\nMonique is an extrovert, almost hyperactive she says. In normal times, she practises Thai boxing and jiu-jitsu and cycles 12 miles a day to and from her job in an art gallery in central London.\n\nBut the past few months have profoundly changed her life. Now, she has a list on her bedroom wall reminding her to save enough energy each day to brush her teeth.\n\n\"I'm not a lazy person,\" she says. Some days, though, it's all she can do to get down the stairs.\n\nWhile her body refuses to co-operate she's found an outlet for her restlessness in Instagram, where she's started an illustrated diary of her symptoms.\n\nShe's using the diary to tell people about this new condition and to connect with others in the same position, the \"long-haulers\".\n\nMuch about coronavirus is confounding doctors but \"long-tail\" Covid is one of the most puzzling features of the pandemic. Why are some people getting a version of the virus that just isn't going away - often those who were only mildly affected in the first place?\n\nMonique got sick at the same time as a friend, after they took a train journey together. At the beginning they would keep in touch, their symptoms mirrored each other almost perfectly but then they broke off contact for a while.\n\n\"I had to stop, it was too freaky,\" Monique says.\n\nFor the first two weeks she felt fluey - she was so tired she could barely get out of bed. It was still cold in London yet she was barely dressed and held a bag of ice to her head to keep cool. Thermometers were sold out but she thinks she must have had a temperature.\n\n\"It's weird saying 'I think'. So much of this is just, you think - but you just don't know.\"\n\nBy week two she was struggling to breathe. An ambulance came but said her oxygen levels were OK. \"They told me I was having a panic attack, potentially off the back of symptoms.\" She wasn't tested for Covid-19 then because in March the UK was reserving the small number of test kits it had for the most extreme cases.\n\nShe tried to treat herself with natural remedies. When eating raw garlic and whole chilli peppers, she remembers thinking it was weird that she couldn't taste anything. And she was tired. \"I didn't have energy to text more than two people a day,\" she says.\n\nAfter two weeks, some of the symptoms lifted but they just seemed to be replaced with new ones. \"I had this pinch in the centre of my chest. And that pinch turned into what felt like a sort of fire,\" she says. \"It was like teeth-gritting pain on the left side. I thought I was having a heart attack.\"\n\nShe called 111 and they advised taking paracetamol. They said it seemed to make the pain disappear for some people though they didn't fully understand why.\n\nThe paracetamol worked but almost as soon as that pain went her stomach and throat began to burn \"like fire\" when she ate. Doctors thought she had an ulcer. It wasn't until later that gastric problems were recognised as a symptom of the virus.\n\nAbout six weeks in, Monique started having burning sensations when she urinated and pain in her lower back. The doctor put her on three different rounds of antibiotics before deciding it wasn't a bacterial infection.\n\n\"It was just agony,\" she says. \"And then it just went.\"\n\nMonique cut herself off from social media. Even listening to podcasts was difficult because any mention of Covid would make her anxious and affect her breathing. A self-confessed news junkie, now she couldn't face it.\n\nShe was afraid that if she went on social media she would see post after post of dead bodies. She found solace in online shopping but even entering a dress size in the search tab brought up horror stories about new symptoms of the disease. \"I was actually scared of going on Google,\" she says\n\nAfter a while she asked a friend to fill her in on what had been happening in the world. One of the first things she learned was that a higher proportion of people from black and minority ethnic backgrounds were dying. Monique is mixed-race and she was scared.\n\n\"It felt like a horror film where all the black people died off,\" she says.\n\nOne day she was lying in the bath listening to a podcast when the two white hosts casually mentioned that a lot of African-Americans were dying from Covid-19.\n\nShe sat bolt upright and immediately grabbed her phone to email black relatives in the US.\n\nAnd she reflected on the fact that the majority of people she had relied on lately had been members of minorities - the Uber drivers who took her to appointments, the hospital workers, the people in the corner shop where her food came from. \"Everyone who I was seeing on my Covid journey,\" she says.\n\nIn her regular day-to-day life, it wasn't like that.\n\nAs weeks went by, some symptoms swapped out for others, getting more and more bizarre. A pain in her neck was accompanied by a strange sensation in her ear, like a packet of crisps being crushed in someone's hand. Her hands went blue and she had to rush to a warm tap to try to bring the blood back into them. The doctor later asked if she had taken a picture, but it had been the last thing on her mind.\n\n\"I kept calling about new symptoms and I would be asked, 'How's your mental health doing?'\" she says. \"The implication being that these symptoms weren't treatable or weren't real pain.\"\n\nShe got strange rashes all over her body or her toes would go bright red, sometimes she would wake up with stabbing pains in different parts of her torso.\n\nOne night, as she was talking to her friend on the phone she felt the right side of her face drop. She went straight to the mirror but her face looked normal. She was worried she was having a stroke but the doctors found no evidence of one.\n\nShe's had strange sensations all over her body too. Sometimes it feels like someone is grabbing her leg with their hands or hairs are being dragged across her face - even inside her mouth.\n\nShe spent a lot of time trying to explain what was happening to doctors. Often she only had a five or 10-minute call in which to try to relay everything that was happening in her body and it wasn't enough.\n\n\"If they'd said to me, 'Look, you've got Covid, and we have no idea how to treat this,' then that'd be fine,\" she says.\n\nShe squirms as she tries to summarise how she was treated. She's reluctant to criticise staff of the NHS, many of whom have given her excellent care but she says the system isn't working for people in her position.\n\nIt was nine weeks before Monique could get a test for coronavirus. During that time, she was terrified of passing the virus to someone else.\n\nGovernment advice said to isolate for seven days or until symptoms went away - but what if they never went away, she thought.\n\nHer flatmates devised a system to avoid contact in the house - they each had a spot on the fridge they'd use to pull it open.\n\nThen they would go to their rooms to eat alone.\n\nOne day she went to get some fresh air at a park near her house with a friend when a small child ran up close to her. Monique jumped up to get away from the toddler. The mother was indignant. \"The child was nowhere near you!\" she said. Monique tried to explain, she wasn't afraid of getting infected, she was afraid of passing the virus on. Sick people should stay at home, the mother told her.\n\nShe hopes that her diary will help people to understand that it's not always that simple.\n\nWhile friends went out of their way to help her, Monique could tell that others were getting fed up. None of what was happening to her made sense to anyone. \"One person said I was becoming obsessed with having Covid,\" she says.\n\nFinally the UK government opened up testing to anyone showing symptoms. She was thrilled but there was a catch - the only centre she could find was a drive-in and she didn't have a car. \"Most of my friends can't even drive,\" she says.\n\nOne friend did step up and give her a lift, and the fact that he put himself at risk in the process isn't lost on her.\n\nAt the testing centre she expected to be reassured by nurses and doctors but instead it was staffed by soldiers, their khakis soaked on a sweaty day in June. As she stuck a cotton swab up her nose it struck her how young they were.\n\nThe results came back negative. It was a huge relief because she'd been told this meant she couldn't infect her friends and family. But she felt strange. \"The feeling of being contagious is psychologically very hard to move on from,\" she wrote in her diary later. It was also confusing because she wasn't feeling any better.\n\nFour months after she first got sick, she decided to move out of her house-share in East London. Keeping up with simple things like cleaning was difficult and she wanted to be around family who could help her.\n\nHer breathing had improved, whereas at the beginning she couldn't make it up the stairs without stopping to catch her breath by July she could do it one go.\n\nBut after picking up the hoover for about four minutes to try to clean her room she collapsed from breathlessness. She was in bed for three weeks after that.\n\nMonique has no idea how to get better.\n\n\"A lot of people tell me, 'Monique, you will be able to cycle again and you will be able to box and you can come around to my house when you're feeling better.' But for me, that's not really that helpful.\"\n\nDoctors still don't know how to help people with these symptoms that won't go away.\n\n\"It's been about acceptance of what I can and can't do and just being flexible because sometimes you'll have plans for the day and your body just doesn't care about those plans,\" Monique says.\n\n\"The thing is, I would get stuck into doing emails or talking to doctors, and then I'd speak to my friends and then I'd be exhausted and I wouldn't brush my teeth.\"\n\nShe has managed to get mental health therapy which gives her tools to manage the new reality of her ill-health and she's campaigning for this support to be available to everyone on the NHS.\n\nOne thing she never expected was that her illness would connect her to other mushroom enthusiasts.\n\nMushrooms have antiviral properties, she explains in one of her posts. But they're also part of something bigger and more beautiful.\n\nThey're the fruit of the mycelium - a network of underground threads, which are in contact with the roots of nearby trees. The mycelium swaps nutrients with these roots. Many fungi experts believe they also help trees to communicate with each other, taking nutrients from one healthy tree to another that is struggling.\n\nIt reminds her of the friends that brought food to her door, month after month. The people that she has relied on so much since she got sick.\n\n\"Isolated in my room,\" she posted on her Instagram diary, \"I felt more connected than ever.\"",

        "body": "People with symptomless Covid-19 can carry as much of the virus as those with symptoms, a South Korean study has suggested.\n\nSouth Korea was able to identify and isolate asymptomatic cases through mass testing as early as the start of March.\n\nThere is mounting evidence these cases represent a considerable proportion of coronavirus infections.\n\nBut the researchers weren't able to say how much these people actually passed the virus on.\n\nPeople with a positive coronavirus test were monitored in a community treatment centre, allowing scientists to look at how much of the virus was detectable in their nose and throat swabs.\n\nThey were given regular tests, and only released once they were negative.\n\nResults of 1,886 tests suggest people with no symptoms at the time of the test, including those who never go on to develop symptoms, have the same amount of viral material in their nose and throat as people with symptoms.\n\nThe study also showed the virus could be detected in asymptomatic people for significant periods of time - although they appeared to clear it from their systems slightly faster than people with symptoms.\n\nThe median time (the number where half of cases were higher and half were lower) from being diagnosed to receiving a negative test was 17 days in asymptomatic patients and 19.5 days in symptomatic patients.\n\nBecause of the nature of the isolation centre, the study didn't include people with severe cases of the disease. They were also younger and healthier than average.\n\nMost coronavirus testing, including in the UK, focuses on people with symptoms, so there is little data on asymptomatic cases.\n\nThis study gives us some more information about what they look like in the body.\n\nThe researchers acknowledge their study could not \"determine the role\" that the presence of the virus in asymptomatic patients played in transmission, however.\n\nIn theory, having the same amount of virus in your nose and throat means you have just as much to pass on.\n\nBut people without symptoms are less likely to have a hacking cough that will send infected droplets further into the air.\n\nThere is \"as much virus in their respiratory mucus as someone who has the disease\", says Dr Simon Clarke, a cellular microbiologist at the University of Reading.\n\nBut, he added, \"that doesn't mean they're spraying as much into the environment\".\n\nWhile there was still a risk from people without symptoms, someone with symptoms who was \"coughing and spraying out the virus\" was likely to be a higher risk, he said.\n\nThe risks of catching coronavirus from anyone depended on a number of factors, said infection biologist Dr Andrew Preston from the University of Bath.\n\nThat included how deeply and quickly the infected person was breathing, how close you were to them for how long, and whether or not you were in a closed environment, he added.",

    "Tanks on the streets! And four other virus hoaxes debunked": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "Remember those panicky viral messages you were forwarded on WhatsApp at the start of the pandemic?\n\nThey may have come as a text, voice note or blurry picture forwarded by a \"friend of a friend\" - and most of them were scarcely credible. Here's the truth behind a few of the most heart-stopping coronavirus rumours that we debunked at the time.\n\nWhat did the message say? In the middle of March, grainy pictures of military vehicles on highways began cropping up in WhatsApp chats and Facebook groups. They had captions like \"On the M25!\" and \"Tanks expected in Newcastle tomorrow\". They were shared with warnings about mass civil unrest that would, ostensibly, prompt a military crackdown.\n\nHow viral was it? The biggest platform for these rumours was WhatsApp. Because it's private and encrypted, it's impossible to know exactly how many people saw such messages - but we can conservatively estimate they were received by tens of thousands. Weeks later, people who run local Facebook groups told the BBC that they were still seeing mentions of alleged military plans for tanks on the streets.\n\nHow did we debunk it? This was initially difficult to tackle. We knew there were no tanks rolling along high streets. But we also knew the army might be deployed. And it's not uncommon to see military vehicles on public roads near army bases. However, some of the most popular photos circulating were clearly not showing scenes from the UK. The convoys were on the wrong side of the road, or the vehicles had foreign number plates.\n\nWe also used reverse image searches - that's where you plug a photo into a search engine to find other copies of it online. This revealed that many of the photos had been taken long before the pandemic. In the end, the British Army did deploy during the lockdown - but to provide logistical support to the NHS, not patrol the streets in armed vehicles amid scenes of mass unrest.\n\nWhat did the message say? The news in the voice note was grim. Hundreds of healthy children would die every day. Ambulances wouldn't be dispatched even to severe Covid-19 cases. Bodies would be sent to \"every ice-skating rink\" as mortuaries filled up. The woman speaking claimed to work for the South East Coast Ambulance Service. The service was quick to dismiss the voice note as incorrect - however, it's never said whether or not the woman actually was an employee.\n\nHow viral was it? Viral enough to really scare people. Hundreds of people got in touch with BBC News asking about the voice note. Many were distressed by its contents. One woman told us the message had her daughter in a total frenzy - and that neither of them knew whether it was true. It spread so widely that Public Health England made a statement calling it \"fake news\".\n\nHow did we debunk it? There's a lot we still don't know about Covid-19, but even given the limited information available in the spring, the claims in the message were clearly preposterous. There were concerns that healthy, young people could also fall seriously ill with the virus - but the voice note suggested that a huge proportion of people dying from coronavirus would be children with no underlying conditions. Temporary mortuaries were planned, and one ice rink in Widnes, Cheshire, was briefly used to store a small number of bodies. But facilities were not overwhelmed, and the claims in the note were just not backed up by science.\n\nWhat did the message say? It would happen in the middle of the night - a secret operation to deliver disinfectant from the air. The person behind the viral message which spread in March on Facebook and WhatsApp never explained how aerial bombardment would eliminate the virus where it spreads most of all - indoors. But still the warning came: stay inside, and close all doors and windows.\n\nHow viral was it? This one wasn't just shared in the UK. It spread on social media to hundreds of thousands of people in countries across the world: Colombia, Pakistan, Spain, the Netherlands and more. Yet the time of night and number of helicopters usually stayed the same.\n\nHow did we debunk it? This one was easy. Not only was the alleged plan rather useless, no formation of spraying helicopters emerged that night or any other night. In fact, this was the latest version of a persistent genre of conspiracy theories. For years, people have claimed that secret government programmes are delivering deadly chemicals from above.\n\nWhat did the message say? Spain's Gran Canaria island was the somewhat unlikely starting point of a WhatsApp voice note that claimed to contain insider information. The woman speaking (in English) said she picked up the tips by talking to \"a colleague who has a friend\" working at a hospital. She gave a very specific story about how the disease progresses, and urged people to \"take a sip of warm water every twenty minutes because this... washes any of the virus that's entered your mouth into your stomach where the gastric juices will neutralise it.\"\n\nHow viral was it? The voice note circulated around the world on apps like Whatsapp and Instagram. Dozens of readers and listeners sent it to us, asking if it was true.\n\nHow did we debunk it? This one required breaking down the specific claims and comparing them to what scientists knew at the time. For one thing, coronavirus symptoms and severity are highly variable, and there did not seem to be one exact progression pattern. That's become even clearer as the pandemic has progressed, as different people have been affected in vastly different ways. There's no scientific evidence that water kills the virus - and while it certainly won't hurt, there's no success story of someone curing or preventing coronavirus by sipping liquids.\n\nWhat did the message say? One popular voice note that parodied other viral messages suggested the government was using Wembley Stadium as a gigantic oven. Billy McLean, a 29-year-old Londoner, laid on the sarcasm thicker than b\u00e9chamel sauce as he joked about hearing of the lasagne plan from his \"sister's boyfriend's brother\" who \"works for the Ministry of Defence\". A few people may have been taken in. But more to the point, the prank was a sign of just how much the \"friend of a friend with dodgy information\" viral voice note had become a panicky part of pandemic culture.\n\nHow viral was it? This one went so viral that it sparked copycat voice notes making similar jokes - from garlic bread being baked in the Channel Tunnel to a salad being tossed in Rome's Coliseum.",

    "Ten African innovations to help tackle Covid-19": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "As Africa passes more than a million confirmed Covid-19 cases, innovators on the continent have responded to the challenges of the pandemic with a wide range of creative inventions. Here are 10 we've picked out.\n\n1. 'Doctor Car' robot\n\nStudents from the Dakar Polytechnic School in Senegal have built a multifunctional robot designed to lower the risk of Covid-19 contamination from patients to caregivers.\n\nThe device is equipped with cameras and is remotely controlled via an app. The designers say it can move around the rooms of quarantined patients to take their temperatures and deliver drugs and food.\n\n2. Automatic hand-washing machine\n\nNine-year-old Kenyan schoolboy Stephen Wamukota invented a wooden hand-washing machine to help curb the spread of coronavirus.\n\nThe machine allows users to tip a bucket of water to wash their hands by using a foot pedal. This helps users avoid touching surfaces to reduce the risk of infection.\n\nAmid a shortage of ventilators on Covid-19 wards in Nigeria, 20-year-old engineering student Usman Dalhatu attempted to help meet the shortfall.\n\nDalhatu built the portable automatic ventilator to help people with respiratory problems - often a symptom of a severe coronavirus infection. He now plans to build up to 20 ventilators.\n\n4. 3D mask printing\n\nNatalie Raphil is the founder of Artificial Intelligence company Robots Can Think South Africa.\n\nShe's using 3D printers to produce 100 masks a day for use in some of Johannesburg's major hospitals. South Africa accounts for around half of all reported coronavirus cases in Africa.\n\n5. Solar-powered hand-washing sink\n\nAmid a lockdown in Ghana aimed at curbing the spread of Covid-19, shoemaker Richard Kwarteng and his brother Jude Osei decided to design a solar-powered hand-washing basin.\n\nWhen hands come into contact with a sensor on the device, soapy water is automatically released. An alarm goes off after 25 seconds of hand-washing - within the timescale recommended by the World Health Organization.\n\n6. Web-based X-ray lung scans\n\nEngineers in Tunisia have created an online platform that scans lung X-rays to try to determine if a person could be suffering from coronavirus.\n\nWhen an X-ray is uploaded onto the platform, it runs a test to detect signs of a possible coronavirus infection. Researchers at the National Institute of Applied Science and Technology in Tunis say the tool is 90% effective in indicating the probability of infection.\n\nThe platform is still in development, but thousands of lung X-rays have been fed into the system to enable it to recognise the impact of Covid-19 on lungs.\n\n7. Police robots on lockdown patrol\n\nAuthorities in Tunisia deployed police robots on the streets of the capital Tunis in April to enforce lockdown measures.\n\nThe surveillance robots, called PGuards, spied on people walking on the street and approached them to ask why they were out.\n\nOffenders then had to show their ID and other documents to the cameras attached to the robots. The four-wheeled devices are equipped with thermal-imaging cameras and light detection and ranging technology.\n\n8. Wooden money sanitiser\n\nKenyan mobile money agent Danson Wanjohi has built a wooden device that sanitises cash notes that are passed through a slot in the machine.\n\nWanjohi constructed the mechanism using a motor, a rubber band and gears which enable notes to pass through the machine.\n\nAs the notes pass through the device, they are cleaned with a sanitising solution.\n\n9. Rapid 65-minute Covid-19 testing kit\n\nSouth African tech entrepreneurs Daniel Ndima and Dineo Lioma have created a Covid-19 testing kit which provides results in just 65 minutes.\n\nTypically, it can take up to three days for Covid-19 tests to produce results.\n\nThe testing kit is known as qPCR, and features a technology used to measure DNA. The testing kit needs to undergo regulatory approval before it can be rolled out.\n\n10. Socially distanced haircuts\n\nIn Ethiopia, barbers have come up with a way to continue cutting hair for clients while minimising the risk of Covid-19 transmission.\n\nThe barbers stand in a specially constructed booth which acts as a partition separating them from clients, minimising person-to-person contact.",

    "Test, trace and the curse of the 0300 phone number": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "The system for tracking down people who may be infected with coronavirus changed this week in England, with a central pool of contact tracers, who rely on phone calls and texting, making way for local teams with neighbourhood knowledge.\n\nContact-tracing systems across the UK roughly work like this: people with symptoms isolate and get tested. Those who test positive are phoned by someone in a tracing team who tries to establish their recent contacts. And those contacts will, assuming they can be reached, be asked to isolate for 14 days - whether they have symptoms or not.\n\nIn England, the call comes from a centralised national team on an \"0300\" phone number, which councils say many people don't want to pick up. It could also be an email or a text.\n\nBut as of this week, local authorities will step in if people can't be reached by the national service.\n\nThis role for council teams was announced on Monday. It comes as the national team has been struggling to reach a third of people on its list. And the change has been interpreted by some as a quiet admission that the system hadn't been as \"world-beating\" as Prime Minister Boris Johnson has claimed.\n\nUntil now, most local authorities have dealt with \"complex\" outbreaks - those in places like care homes, factories and schools. Ironically, these so-called complex cases have been much easier to trace and contain, as national figures show. While they might require more immediate and dramatic action, they happen in controlled settings where people can easily be tracked down.\n\nThe problems have been tracing infected individuals in the wider community - the so-called \"non-complex\" cases. These cases are when a single person - who might have been going out to eat, going to work, using transport or mixing with a number of other households - tests positive.\n\nIt has so far proved more tricky to get those infected people to remember who they've been in contact with, or to persuade them to hand over their details to a centralised team.\n\nAnd potential contacts, who could be spreading coronavirus, leak out of the system at every stage. Figures for England show 80% of people who test positive are reached by test and trace teams. Of that number, about 80% provide contacts. And of those contacts, roughly two-thirds will be reached.\n\nBut before this even starts, you lose the biggest chunk of potential contacts in people who never get tested. Only about 30% of infections are picked up through a test, Office for National Statistics estimates suggest.\n\nIn Wales, which has taken a different tack, contact-tracing teams were formed by redeploying local council staff on furlough. They live and work in the area, and so know the nightlife hotspots, the transport routes and the big local employers, explains Dr Giri Shankar, who has been leading the contact-tracing programme for Public Health Wales.\n\nThat \"richness of local knowledge\" can help to identify where clusters are coming from, he says. For example, local tracers were able to establish a cluster of cases in a factory came from the community, not the factory - it was just there that they were being spotted. Local tracers knew workers at this particular factory mostly lived in one area, in buildings containing lots of different households, and many shared cars into work.\n\nIn England, the concern is that a test and trace caller who is ringing from their bedroom in Portsmouth, to find out about the contacts of a person in Oldham, won't be able to pick up these finer details, spot patterns in transmission and intervene to stop them.\n\nCalderdale in West Yorkshire - currently subject to extra restrictions because of rising cases - has established its own local test and trace system, fearing the national system was failing to pick up enough cases. Council leader Cllr Tim Swift said the national system worked for people who \"answer their phone, are fairly clear who their contacts are and don't have an issue self-isolating\".\n\nBut that excluded a lot of younger people who were less likely to pick up a call, people working in public-facing jobs - such as in shops or as cab drivers - and those not entitled to paid sick days. People were more likely to engage with someone with a local accent, he said, calling from a local number, than pick up a 0300 number they don't recognise that might be \"a hoax\" or \"someone trying to sell them something\".\n\nSo, if someone doesn't respond to a call from the national team, a local team first tries to phone and then will follow them up in other ways, including knocking on their door or using local community contacts.\n\nBeing based in the relevant area means local teams can spot more \"diffuse\" connections, like clusters around a particular takeaway people hang out at - and they can physically go and talk to people. But crucially, his teams also put people in touch with local services to help them get food or other types of support while they isolate.\n\nIn Blackburn, which has similarly brought in a local tracing system, the council says it is \"already seeing its benefits\" as a local team is managing to contact people \"the national system couldn't\".\n\nBut a contact-tracing system will never reach 100% of people, especially when, in so many cases, infected people don't show symptoms. Only countries that conduct mass population testing, like South Korea, have been able to trace and isolate asymptomatic people and their contacts.\n\nThe question is whether enough people can be reached, and enough chains of transmission broken, to stop the virus from spiralling out of control once again.",

    "The UK's virus status may be better than we think": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "Another day, another worrying coronavirus headline.\n\nOn Tuesday it was reported the UK's testing and tracing system was not good enough to prevent a second wave once schools reopen.\n\nIt came after Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced last week the brakes were being applied on the lifting of further restrictions.\n\nAnd that was off the back of the announcement that parts of northern England were to have some of the lockdown restrictions reimposed on them.\n\nThe problem, ministers and their advisers warned, was that infections were on the rise.\n\nWe had, concluded chief medical adviser Prof Chris Witty, reached the limits of lifting lockdown.\n\nIt prompted a weekend of debate, with people urging pubs to close so schools could open.\n\nBut is the situation really as bad as it seems?\n\nIt was one of the more curious aspects of last week's warnings that the government seemed so ready to embrace the concept that infection rates were on the up.\n\nThis is a government that all along the way has been trying to mount a vigorous defence of its record.\n\nThe surveillance programme - run by the Office for National Statistics - did suggest they were rising.\n\nBut there has to be heavy caveats around these findings - they are based on just 24 positive cases among nearly 30,000 people over the course of two weeks. Drawing conclusions from such smaller numbers is fraught with difficulties.\n\nThe other key source of data - the cases found by testing - shows numbers have started going up. They are now more than 40% higher than they were in the second week of July on a rolling-seven day average.\n\nBut that masks the fact the number of tests being carried out is increasing and being targeted at areas where infection rates are highest.\n\nIf you test more, you are likely to find more.\n\nSo if you look at the percentage of tests that are positive, the rise is marginal once you iron out the daily fluctuations.\n\nThis is a point made by Prof Carl Heneghan, who heads the centre for evidence-based medicine at Oxford University.\n\nHe says it is essential to adjust for tests being done and is concerned about what he calls \"poor interpretation\" of data.\n\nCovid cases, he says, simply aren't rising in any meaningful sense.\n\nA source of much criticism recently has been NHS Test and Trace.\n\nIt is the system that has been set up in England to trace the close contacts of those who are infected to encourage them to self-isolate.\n\nScotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have their own systems.\n\nNHS Test and Trace - run by a private firm - employs more than 20,000 call handlers and contact tracers.\n\nA figure often quoted in recent weeks to highlight its failings is the fact it fails to reach nearly half of contacts.\n\nThis certainly seems to be poor, but once you include the so-called complex cases passed on to local teams, incorporating council staff and regional Public Health England teams, performance rises to over three-quarters.\n\nThat is not far off what government experts said was needed to make the system effective.\n\nWhat is more, the irony with the term \"complex cases\" is that they are actually often easier to contact because they are the ones based in prisons, care homes and schools.\n\nThe term complex refers to the fact that they represent potential clusters that will require more containing than simply asking an individual to isolate, which is what the national team does.\n\nThis is not to say the service should be above criticism.\n\nLocal directors of public health have been understandably annoyed that they have not always been given enough data quickly enough (it was only recently that they started getting postcode-level data on positive tests, allowing them to target their efforts at neighbourhood level).\n\nBut most people agree it is unrealistic to expect a service that was put together in a matter of weeks to be perfect from day one (the issue of whether the UK should have been better prepared is another debate altogether).\n\nWhat is more, the biggest gain, in terms of containing the virus, would be if more people with symptoms came forward.\n\nThe ONS programme shows there are likely to be many people who are not getting a test when they are infected.\n\nLast week data suggested perhaps only a fifth of new cases were being diagnosed.\n\nSome will not have symptoms - and therefore not know they need to come forward for a test. But others no doubt will.\n\nNHS Test and Trace can certainly do more to engage people - its boss, Baroness Dido Harding, has admitted as much herself.\n\nBut part of it comes down to the people.\n\nIt is a message made consistently by Nottingham University infectious disease expert Prof Keith Neal.\n\nThe government, he says, \"can't do everything\".\n\nAnother tendency in recent weeks has been to view the need for local action as a sign of failure.\n\nFirst Leicester was placed into local lockdown and then restrictions were introduced in other areas before last week's announcement that vast swathes of northern England were - to quote some headlines - \"back in lockdown\".\n\nIt gives the impression the infection is raging in these areas when what is really happening - with the exception of Leicester - is that action is being taken early to prevent the virus spiralling out of control.\n\nBlackburn currently has the highest level of infection by some way, but even there, fewer than one in 1,000 people has contracted the virus over the past week.\n\nThe steps taken in northern England were targeted - households have been discouraged from mixing - but shops, restaurants and bars remain open.\n\nAgain, this does not mean questions should not be asked. When lockdown restrictions started being lifted in May senior officials in the north west questioned whether it was too soon for the region, which looked to be a few weeks behind where the south east was in terms of progression of the epidemic.\n\nBut all too often these nuances get lost in the frenzied debate that takes place.\n\nComplex issues get reduced to soundbites. People want to look for someone to blame.\n\nBut what if we take a step back?\n\nIn an interview with the BBC on Tuesday, the World Health Organization's special envoy on Covid, David Nabarro, gave a very different perspective from the one we are used to.\n\nHe said there will of course be a \"post-mortem\" (it goes without saying mistakes have been made).\n\nBut he was also full of hope, saying he thinks the UK is \"going to do really well\".\n\nWhy? He said it was showing the country was able to identify where the virus was, and he could see signs that different parts of society were \"pulling together and saying 'we are going to get on top of this'.\"\n\nMaybe things are not quite as bad as they sometimes seem.",

        "body": "Ceri is bilingual, clued-up on coronavirus and can tell what mood you are in.\n\nShe also happens to be a robot.\n\nThe next generation of artificial intelligence is helping people in the Cwm Taf Morgannwg University Health Board area get to grips with Covid-19.\n\nIt provides information on symptoms and the latest Welsh government advice, and continuously teaches itself based on the conversations it has.\n\nThe digital assistant, which could go on to be rolled out across Wales, can detect users' mood from a set of seven emotions.\n\nIt has been adapted from RiTTa, an existing system already being pioneered before lockdown to help people going through cancer treatment at Velindre Hospital.\n\nDr Philip Webb, head of Vales Based Healthcare, said: \"CERi can detect whether you are agitated, embarrassed, frightened or depressed and will tailor its responses to help calm or reassure the user.\n\n\"So if you're hacked-off about not being able to get a GP appointment, or terrified about juggling a young child and elderly parent, CERi will not only give you the facts you need, but can actually empathise with why you are asking in the first place.\"\n\nThe system has been developed in conjunction with IBM and Meridian IT and was first used to provide support to NHS staff at the Royal Marsden Hospital in London\n\nIn its CERi form, it can respond to queries in Welsh and English and is available on computers, tablets and smart phones.\n\nIf CERi has not been taught the answer to a specific question, it searches trusted sources on the internet to teach itself and will flag the gap in its knowledge to the health board's data analysts.\n\nDr Webb said: \"In the first weeks we're running and testing CERi with operators behind the scenes, checking that it's doing what it should, but we're astonished with how it's able to adapt, and in the future we're hopeful it can run without our input.\n\n\"It's picking up things which we never thought about putting into the original model.\n\n\"Of course, like all virtual assistants in early stages, CERi breaks and gets things wrong, but user feedback is critical to her development and breaking her only makes her stronger.\"\n\nDr Webb says that, in its RiTTa form, users found it incredibly helpful.\n\n\"When you're going through something as life-changing as cancer, and now covid, there's a million questions milling around your brain, and not always at times when experts are available to answer them.\n\n\"Plus, there's things, like the implications for your sex life, which people are too embarrassed to ask their doctor, but which they can confide in a robot.\"\n\nHe said this is why the emotional aspect of RiTTa and CERi is so important: \"When you're talking about your inner-most fears and dilemmas, you don't want a computer blurting out soulless platitudes, we had to come up with an app which could 'feel' what people are going through.\n\n\"It's no substitute for a human, but it is an alternative and an addition when actual people aren't appropriate or available.\"\n\nDebbie Murphey, 38, used RiTTa last year, and said it helped her through some of the darkest moments during treatment for breast cancer.\n\n\"There's things you'd just feel stupid wasting a human's time on at three o'clock in the morning, but nevertheless they're important to you, and having someone, something, to listen to you was a massive help.\n\n\"I found RiTTa became a sort of friend to me. Her responses were so natural that I had to keep reminding myself that she wasn't 'real', but she was a comfort and something I could turn to, even if it was to answer a question I already knew the answer to in my heart of hearts.\"\n\nDr Webb is hoping that after a successful trial in Cwm Taf Morgannwg, CERi could be rolled out across Wales.",

    "The fake news about schools that's misleading parents": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "Just as children are about to return to school, a video in Urdu has been widely shared in Bradford, and possibly elsewhere, falsely claiming that sick pupils could be removed their families without parental consent. Dr John Wright of Bradford Royal Infirmary is joining efforts to debunk the idea - and says the reopening of schools is important for children, and parents.\n\nThis week the schools are going back and everyone is nervous. We have grown accustomed to home working and social distancing, so the idea of hundreds of thousands of children and young people suddenly coming together in confined environments for long periods of time is hard to comprehend - a throwback to the pre-Covid-19 era.\n\nFrom the start, Covid-19 created fertile ground for the spread of fake news, as I wrote in April.\n\nThe ban on hospital visiting at the peak of the pandemic led to a disconnect between patients and staff and relatives. We struggled to counter the rumours in different communities that we were harming patients or that coronavirus was a cunning attempt by the Home Office to lure in people to repatriate them. We had sick patients who refused to be admitted for fear of what we were going to do to them.\n\nNow the anxiety about returning to school has caused a new round of false rumours. This time the claim is that if children fall sick they will be removed from their families and taken into care. Head teachers, school governors and parents who have heard the story have approached Bradford City Council seeking reassurance that it isn't true. I myself was contacted by the chair of governors of a local school, who told me that despite her efforts to dispel the rumours she was \"concerned that accurate information may not be getting through\".\n\nProf John Wright, a doctor and epidemiologist, is head of the Bradford Institute for Health Research, and a veteran of cholera, HIV and Ebola epidemics in sub-Saharan Africa. He is writing this diary for BBC News and recording from the hospital wards for BBC Radio.\n\nIn an attempt to understand why people are falling for the conspiracy theories, my colleague, consultant anaesthetist Fozia Hayat, spoke to one father of three, Arshid Siddique, who told her he disbelieved a lot of what he had been told about Covid-19. He accepted that Covid-19 existed, but didn't believe people had died from it.\n\n\"They've committed suicide and Covid-19 has been written on the death certificates,\" he said. \"Doctors are being paid to put Covid-19 down for anyone who dies in the hospital.\"\n\nThis is a myth that Fozia and I have heard many times.\n\nArshid said the video of a woman warning that children could be quarantined by the state and not allowed home had been sent to his wife, and that they believed her, so would not be sending their children back to school. The speaker, whom he described as \"a very well-spoken lady\", says she is a tabeeba, an Urdu word for doctor, and uses the title \"doctor\" in English, though her website describes her as \"a qualified practitioner of prophetic medicine\". She clearly doesn't have a degree in medical science and isn't a doctor in the usual sense of the word.\n\nSo why did Arshid believe this person who had popped up on social media, while rejecting information from the government and the NHS?\n\n\"The government isn't telling the truth and everyone in power keeps changing their minds,\" he replied.\n\n\"First there's no Covid for kids and then there is, and then it's no masks for kids and now that's changing.\n\n\"No-one believes the officials. People aren't telling the truth in government. There was that Dominic whatever-it-is and he got caught red-handed. So if it's real, and if it's dangerous, and if it's life-threatening, then why are these people acting like this?\"\n\nI've heard other reasons for scepticism, too. The additional lockdown restrictions in West Yorkshire and Manchester were announced with poor timing on the evening before Eid al-Adha, when the food had already been prepared. And the contrast of being able to visit the pub but not your own family comes across to some as insensitive and unfair. There has been a loss of trust in authority, which makes people more receptive to fake news.\n\nWest Bradford MP Naz Shah, who says people started questioning her about the video a few days ago, says it's always a difficult decision to debunk fake news, because by doing so you give it the oxygen of publicity.\n\nBut Bradford City Council clearly thinks the story has already spread so far that it needs tackling head on. Education safeguarding officer Shaqib Juneja and deputy leader Imran Khan have recorded videos assuring people that there is no truth in the story, and that if children are unwell parents will be asked to take them home.\n\nZahabia Naveed, 15, is nervous about going back to school for another reason. During lockdown she has been learning how to grow vegetables from 73-year-old Alan Wainwright, and wants to continue after the start of term. Alan has only had contact with two other people throughout the period of lockdown, his wife and her daughter. The last thing Zahabia wants to do is to catch the virus from one of the 1,400 pupils at her school and accidentally bring it into Alan's bubble.\n\nA Bradford rapper, Faisal, is also spreading the message and there is a plan to ask GPs to send a text message to their patients, assuring them that there is no question of separating sick children from their families. I've been asked to record a video myself, which I am very glad to do.\n\nThere is much we know about Covid-19 and much we don't, and this partly explains why advice on masks - as noted by Arshid Siddique - has changed over time.\n\nImportantly, the evidence is becoming clearer about the risk of Covid-19 in schools. Children have lower rates of infection and generally much milder disease. Child-to-child transmission in schools is rare and serious outbreaks in schools are unusual. Evidence from other countries suggests that re-opening schools does not increase community transmission.\n\nOf course, parents will be worried about their children bringing the virus home, and in Bradford, where there are many multi-generational households, the risk to older family members is real.\n\nBut there is nothing more important than a safe return to school. The loss of education during lockdown will have lasting effects. Our children and young people need to reclaim their youth and their friends, while parents need to be freed from the challenges of home-schooling and allowed to return to work.\n\nHealth and education are so closely linked, yet schools are historically isolated from health services. This is the time to link arms and we have been working closely with public health colleagues to support head teachers as they face the sleepless nights that we experienced in hospitals in the spring.\n\nWe have produced webinars and guidance on how to prepare the schools for opening, how to use face masks, what to do when a child gets symptoms, how to manage an outbreak, and how to provide mental health support.\n\nWe will also be helping to reduce uncertainty by teaming up with leading scientists from across the UK to help understand children's immunity in the coming months.\n\nA couple of days after Fozia's conversation with Arshid Siddique there was some good news - his wife had received an encouraging call from an Urdu-speaking teacher at his daughter's school.\n\n\"She told my wife that it would never happen, that they can't take children away. She's been reassuring people, and I've told my wife that we won't let them test the children,\" he said.\n\nThere is still a lively debate about the video going on among parents of pupils at the school, according to Arshid, but he and his wife are now planning to send their children back.\n\nThen, on Saturday, Fozia managed to speak to the woman who made the video that has caused so much havoc. Her name is Alia Syed and she is based in Derby. She told Fozia she had made a huge mistake and that she had now removed the video from her website and put out a retraction, in English and in Urdu.\n\n\"I am hoping you will be able to put your mind at rest now. Please send your children to school, it's very important they continue with their education,\" her new video says.\n\nIt seems, though, that the original video is still circulating on social media and messaging apps.\n\nIf some of Bradford's Asian children stay at home this week, rather than returning to school, we will be able to guess how much harm it has done.",

        "body": "A father says he was asked to travel more than 200 miles to get a Covid-19 test for his unwell toddler.\n\nTV presenter Will Millard used the UK government website on 27 August after his daughter Grace, two, developed a high temperature.\n\nMr Millard, from Sully, Vale of Glamorgan, was offered a test in Blackburn, Lancashire, before his health board booked a test in Cardiff.\n\nThe UK government has said areas with outbreaks are being made a priority.\n\nThe 37-year-old said: \"I didn't think she had coronavirus but the rules are dead clear - if someone has a temperature then you get a test.\"\n\nHe added he was keen for her to be tested as his father, who had been shielding, was due to visit and health visitors were also due to visit his new baby son.\n\nHe was surprised when told the closest available test was so far away: \"I thought it was a mistake,\" he said.\n\n\"I assumed there was something wrong with the website so I rang 111, who directed me to 119 but they said they were getting the same.\n\n\"I said 'can you post me one' and they said there were no postal tests available.\"\n\nHe decided to tweet Public Health Wales about his predicament.\n\n\"I noticed on Twitter there were people from Bristol complaining they had been sent to Cardiff for their test,\" he said.\n\nHe continued searching and at 17:00 was offered a test in Nottingham, and at about 20:00 he found a test in Weston-Super-Mare in Somerset, which he booked.\n\nThen Fiona Kinghorn, executive director of Cardiff and Vale health board, contacted him on Twitter and arranged for him to go to one of the community testing centres in Cardiff the next day.\n\n\"We turned up at 09:05 and had test result by 16:50 that night. It couldn't have been easier.\"\n\nHis daughter's test came back negative.\n\n\"The government are putting a lot of pressure on people to follow the rules,\" he said.\n\n\"People can go to do the right thing but if the government aren't keeping up their end of the bargain - you can't expect people to get in the car with a sick child and drive to Manchester.\"\n\nA Welsh Government spokesperson said: \"The UK government experienced a spike in demand for testing through their lighthouse labs over the weekend, which led to reduced capacity for processing tests across the UK.\n\n\"The UK government has assured us they are working on increasing capacity and expect these issues to be resolved shortly.\"\n\nThe UK government has said prioritising coronavirus testing in high-risk areas has led to shortages in other places, leading to some people with symptoms being asked to drive more than 100 miles for a swab.\n\nIt said areas with fewer Covid-19 cases have had their testing capacity reduced to cope with outbreaks elsewhere.\n\nBut Paul Hunter, a public health expert at the University of East Anglia, said these issues could act as \"big disincentive to being tested\" and result in missing local increases \"early enough to maybe stop more widespread infection\".\n\nPeople in Wales, like the rest of the UK, can make a booking for a coronavirus test at a drive-through centre or a mobile unit.\n\nWales also has community testing units, which are operated by the local health boards, where health care workers have priority\n\nThere are also eight mobile units in Wales operated by the military.",

    "UK 'made serious mistake' over virus border policy": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "The spread of coronavirus in the UK could have been slowed with earlier quarantine restrictions on arrivals, a group of MPs has said.\n\nThe Home Affairs committee said a lack of border measures earlier in the pandemic was a \"serious mistake\".\n\nIt added ministers had underestimated the threat of importing the virus from Europe as opposed to Asia.\n\nBut a Home Office spokeswoman said the committee were \"incorrect in their assertions\".\n\nShe added: \"All of our decisions throughout the pandemic have been guided by the science, with appropriate measures introduced at the right time to keep us all safe.\"\n\nIn their report, the committee backed a decision not to close the UK's borders in the early stages of the crisis, given the \"large number\" of returning British nationals.\n\nBut it added that a requirement for people arriving from certain countries to quarantine, introduced in early June, should have come in earlier.\n\nSince then, those arriving in the UK have to self-isolate for 14 days or face the threat of fines, with each of the UK's four nations compiling a lists of exempted countries where this does not apply.\n\nDuring February and early March, all passengers from China, Iran, South Korea and later Italy were asked to self-isolate for 14 days on arrival.\n\nThe MPs criticised a decision not to include Spain on this early list, adding that government advice had initially focused on Asian countries and did not \"recognise soon enough\" the risk of importing the virus from Europe.\n\nThey added that a later decision - on 13 March - to end self-isolation advice for international arrivals not displaying symptoms had been \"inexplicable\".\n\nCiting evidence from scientific studies, they said it was likely that thousands of infected people then arrived in the UK before full lockdown came in 10 days later.\n\n\"It is highly likely that this contributed to the rapid increase in the spread of the virus in mid-March and to the overall scale of the outbreak in the UK,\" they added.\n\n\"The failure properly to consider the possibility of imposing stricter requirements on those arriving - such as mandatory self-isolation, increased screening, targeted testing or enforceable quarantine - was a serious error.\"\n\nThis is the second Parliamentary report in a week that's accused the government of serious errors. Last week's criticised how hospital patients were discharged to care homes without a Covid test.\n\nThat and today's report amount to the same accusation - poor or inexplicable decisions that didn't help slow the march of the pandemic.\n\nThe MPs cite examples from around the world where countries were requiring passengers arriving in that country to comply with stringent quarantine or monitoring measures.\n\nThe government insists that its general message from 13 March to the public to stay at home, if they had symptoms, worked.\n\nBut that recommendation was not the same as clear guidance, or an absolute legal requirement, for passengers to self-isolate even if they were feeling perfectly well.\n\nAnd that, say the MPs, meant travellers in March were able to arrive and move about much more freely at a critical moment in the spread of the virus across the UK.\n\nThe committee added that the decision to withdraw self-isolation advice was \"very different from countries in similar circumstances\".\n\nIt concluded that countries that instead introduced tougher border measures, such as Singapore, had been \"proved justified in doing so\".\n\nIt said an official estimate used to justify the UK's approach - stating that only 0.5% of domestic infections had been imported from overseas - was not calculated until late March.\n\nBut the MPs point out that the proportion of cases was likely to have been \"substantially higher\" when blanket quarantine advice was lifted earlier that month.\n\nThey backed the mandatory quarantine rules introduced in June, and said ministers should consider greater testing of arrivals at the UK's borders.\n\nLabour MP Yvette Cooper, who chairs the committee - and is both a former shadow home secretary and former shadow home secretary - said that not introducing quarantine rules in March had meant the virus \"spread faster and reached more people\".\n\n\"The UK was almost unique in having no border checks or quarantine arrangements at that time,\" she added.\n\n\"We are concerned that border measures just weren't taken seriously enough at the beginning of the crisis, either in the discussions among scientific advisers or in ministerial decision making\".\n\nBut a Home Office spokeswoman said the government had followed the scientific advice.\n\n\"And with passengers numbers significantly reduced, the scientific advice was clear that quarantine measures for those entering the country from abroad would be most effective when the UK has a lower level of infection,\" she added.\n\n\"Therefore, as the virus was brought under control here, border measures were introduced on 8 June to protect public health and help avoid a second peak that would overwhelm the NHS.\"",

        "body": "Coronavirus tests are to be carried out on more people to get a better idea of how many are infected at any one time.\n\nThe Office for National Statistics' Infection Survey will test 150,000 people a fortnight in England by October, up from 28,000 now.\n\nThe survey is separate from the mass testing programme of people with symptoms, as it aims to take a random sample of the general population.\n\nMore data will also be gathered in Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland.\n\nThe survey aims to help the government identify emerging outbreaks and stamp them out.\n\nThe infection survey is the most accurate indicator of infection levels in the community.\n\nHealth Secretary Matt Hancock said the survey was the \"single most important tool\" the government had for making policy decisions around coronavirus because it helped it understand how the disease was spreading.\n\nSpeaking on BBC Breakfast, Mr Hancock said expanding the ONS survey would allow the government to be \"more accurate and more localised\" in its response.\n\nHe added that it would help the government with its \"biggest challenge\", which was finding people who were asymptomatic but could still pass the virus on.\n\nIt tests thousands of people in households representative of the population, whether or not they have coronavirus symptoms.\n\nThe results help experts estimate the weekly reproduction (R) number and growth rate of the virus - which tells us if new coronavirus infections are rising or shrinking.\n\nThe survey also provides important information about the socio-demographic characteristics of the people and households who have Covid-19.\n\nAccording to last week's results, coronavirus cases across England appear to be levelling off, with an estimated one in 1,900, or 28,300 people currently infected.\n\nAt the start of the pilot study, led by the ONS and the University of Oxford in partnership with the Department for Health and Social Care, around 20,000 households were invited to take part, with the aim of achieving data from around 10,000 households.\n\nSince the end of May, additional households have been invited to take part in the survey each week (roughly 5,000 a week), with an additional 15,000 households contacted in July.\n\nBy beefing up the numbers participating, the ONS will be able to assess what is going on in much greater detail, at a city-wide level instead of the broad national picture that can currently be achieved. It will also provide scientists with a more accurate picture of the number of people that have developed antibodies to the virus. This will enable them to calculate with greater certainty the total number of people in the country that have had Covid-19.\n\nProfessor Sir Ian Diamond, the UK's National Statistician, said that the survey would be the biggest of its kind in this country.\n\n\"Vigilance is key to containing this pandemic and the extra data on the spread of infections and antibodies at local level will be invaluable to the planning of effective local responses.\"\n\nThe extended survey should be up and running by October when government experts are expecting there to be surges in infection.\n\nPeople who take part have routine nose or throat swabs to see if they currently have coronavirus.\n\nAntibody blood tests can also tell if they are likely to have had the disease in the past.\n\nThe survey currently has 60,000 people enrolled. The aim is to increase this to 400,000 people across the entire project in England, and there will be proportionate increases in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.\n\nFollow Pallab on Twitter\n\nHave you carried out a test for Covid-19 at home?

        "authors": [],
        "body": "British holidaymakers who wish to avoid 14 days' quarantine face a race to get back to the UK before new coronavirus travel rules kick in.\n\nTransport Secretary Grant Shapps said on Thursday that those arriving in the UK from Croatia, Austria and Trinidad and Tobago will need to self-isolate.\n\nIt is thought around 20,000 British tourists are currently in Croatia.\n\nThe changes apply to anyone arriving after 04:00 BST on Saturday.\n\nBut UK tourists returning from Portugal will no longer need to self-isolate after the country was added to the UK's list of travel corridors.\n\nMeanwhile, the Scottish government has added Switzerland to its list of countries requiring quarantine.\n\nThe Portuguese government welcomed the changes as \"useful for all those who travel between Portugal and the United Kingdom\".\n\nIt said the move was \"proof of the good outcome of intense bilateral work\" and \"allowed for an understanding that the situation in the country has always been under control\".\n\nSpeaking about the latest additions to the quarantine list, Mr Shapps said: \"I completely get the inconvenience involved in all of this, but it is just a fact of this summer.\"\n\nMr Shapps said testing for coronavirus at airports to help reduce quarantine time was \"something we're really interested in\" and was \"under active review\".\n\nBut he told Radio 4's Today programme: \"I don't want to offer false hope by saying 'it's just as simple as a test at the airport'... because it won't tell you what you need to know.\"\n\nAirport tests on arrival would only pick up \"a very small proportion\" of people who had the virus without symptoms, he said, and a follow-up test would be needed around a week later. In the meantime, people would still have to quarantine.\n\nThere were also issues around ensuring the second test was actually taken by the quarantining person, Mr Shapps said.\n\nThe latest updates to the quarantine list come after thousands of British holidaymakers made a last-minute dash to get home from France last weekend, before the measures came into force.\n\nThe consumer group Which? said the change in rules for Portugal was \"likely to come too late to help many struggling holiday companies\" and called for support for the travel industry.\n\nWhich? Travel editor Rory Boland said the policy made it \"too risky\" for those who are unable to quarantine to travel.\n\nHe added that holidaymakers who want to follow government advice and avoid non-essential travel to specified countries are finding it \"increasingly difficult to claim a refund\".\n\nOver a two-week period, the UK recorded 20.9 coronavirus cases per 100,000 people, according to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.\n\nIn comparison, Croatia had 41.7 cases per 100,000, Austria had 30.8 and Portugal 27.8.\n\nIgor Pokaz, the Croatian ambassador to the UK, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme he has urged the UK government to take a \"more nuanced approach\" to travel quarantines.\n\nHe said the virus spikes in Croatia were concentrated in certain regions such as the capital Zagreb, but there were \"very, very few cases\" in other destinations popular with holidaying Britons, such as Dubrovnik and its nearby islands.\n\nMr Shapps said \"there is a case for regionalisation\" and the government was looking at how to do it effectively, including by having different rules for a country's islands.\n\nBut the transport secretary said there were concerns about how detailed the regional data was on other countries' individual islands.\n\nHe also said a regional approach would be harder to implement on the mainland where people could potentially travel between areas with differing quarantine rules.\n\nThe Tucker family, from Cambridge, were at a waterfront caf\u00e9 on the Croatian island of Solta, off the coast of Split, when they heard they would have to quarantine on their return to the UK.\n\n\"We already cancelled a holiday in Barcelona because of quarantine rules,\" said mum Luzita, 50, a childminder.\n\n\"We've always wanted to come to Croatia so we looked at the infection rates and they seemed very low.\"\n\nShe said it was good the government had acted decisively, but suggested there were other options.\n\n\"Why not [carry out] virus testing at the airport when we arrive back in the UK? And surely using public transport to get home could be a risk.\"\n\nDiane Barwick was in the Croatian town of Zadar visiting her daughter - having cancelled a planned trip to France when that country was removed from the exemption list.\n\nShe told BBC News: \"My daughter should have been married here in May. I've not seen her for nearly a year and have had three flights cancelled this year.\"\n\nUnlike many other British visitors to Croatia, she had responded to rumours that the country was set to be removed from the exemption list by booking an alternative early flight home.\n\nThat means she should be able to get home before the deadline and back to her job in retail.\n\n\"If you're in France you can get the boat or Eurostar. Here it's a flight only. I've got to travel three hours tomorrow to get to the airport in Croatia,\" she said.\n\nThe Department of Transport has advised people in Croatia, Trinidad and Tobago and Austria to follow local rules and check the Foreign Office website for further information.\n\nIn a statement, it urged employers to be \"understanding of those returning from these destinations who now will need to self-isolate\".\n\nBut children currently on holiday in those three countries will now miss the start of the new school term in England, Wales and Northern Ireland - unless their parents can get them home before 04:00 BST on Saturday.\n\nPeople who do not self-isolate when required can be fined up to \u00a31,000 in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland. In Scotland the fine is \u00a3480, and up to \u00a35,000 for persistent offenders.\n\nBBC Balkans correspondent Guy De Launey said only a small number of direct flights from Croatia were due to reach the UK before the deadline of 04:00 BST on Saturday.\n\nThe UK introduced the compulsory 14-day quarantine for arrivals from overseas in early June.\n\nBut the following month, the four UK nations unveiled lists of \"travel corridors\", detailing countries that were exempt from the rule.\n\nSince then it has periodically updated that list, adding and removing countries based on their coronavirus infection rates and how they compare with the UK's.\n\nThe UK provides the largest number of overseas tourists to Portugal, with more than two million tourists visiting every year.\n\nTravel expert Simon Calder tweeted that the cost of flights from Manchester to Faro on Saturday morning had risen from \u00a350 to \u00a398 in 30 minutes.\n\nAccording to the Department for Transport, weekly coronavirus cases are on the rise in Croatia, Austria, Trinidad and Tobago as follows:\n\nHave you been affected by the new quarantine measures?

    "UK virus-tracing app switches to Apple-Google model": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "In a major U-turn, the UK is ditching the way its current coronavirus-tracing app works and shifting to a model based on technology provided by Apple and Google.\n\nThe Apple-Google design has been promoted as being more privacy-focused.\n\nHowever, it means epidemiologists will have access to less data.\n\nThe government now intends to launch an app in the autumn, however it says the product may not involve contact tracing at that point.\n\nInstead the software may be limited to enabling users to report their symptoms and order a test.\n\nBaroness Dido Harding - who heads up the wider Test and Trace programme - will only give the green light to actually deploying the Apple-Google technology if she judges it to be fit for purpose, which she does not believe is the case at present. It is possible this may never happen.\n\nGermany, Italy and Denmark are among other countries to have switched from a so-called \"centralised\" approach to a \"decentralised\" one.\n\nThe NHS has been testing both systems against each other, over the course of the past month.\n\nThe centralised version trialled on the Isle of Wight worked well at assessing the distance between two users, but was poor at recognising Apple's iPhones.\n\nSpecifically, the software registered about 75% of nearby Android handsets but only 4% of iPhones.\n\nBy contrast, the Apple-Google model logged 99% of both Android mobiles and iPhones. But its distance calculations were weaker.\n\nIn some instances, it could not differentiate between a phone in a user's pocket 1m (3.3ft) away and a phone in a user's hand 3m (9.8ft) away.\n\nExperiments in Ireland have flagged a similar issue.\n\nAt the Downing Street briefing, Health Secretary Matt Hancock suggested the original plan might have worked had it not been for Apple's restrictions on third-party apps' use of Bluetooth.\n\n\"Apple software prevents iPhones being used effectively for contact tracing unless you're using Apple's own technology,\" he said.\n\n\"Our app won't work because Apple won't change that system... and their app can't measure distance well enough to a standard that we are satisfied with.\n\n\"What matters is what works. Because what works will save lives.\"\n\nBaroness Harding added: \"What we've done in really rigorously testing both our own Covid-19 app and the Google-Apple version is demonstrate that none of them are working sufficiently well enough to be actually reliable to determine whether any of us should self-isolate for two weeks [and] that's true across the world.\"\n\nIn response, Google noted that it and Apple had developed an application programming interface - a set of functions and procedures for others to build on - rather than a fully-fledged app.\n\n\"We have developed an Exposure Notification API with Apple based on consultation with public health experts around the world, including in the UK, to ensure that our efforts are useful to authorities as they build their own apps to limit the spread of Covid-19, while ensuring privacy and security are central to the design,\" added a spokeswoman.\n\nThe latest developments come a day after the BBC revealed that a former Apple executive, Simon Thompson, was taking charge of the late-running project as part of Baroness Harding's team.\n\nContact-tracing apps are designed to help prevent a second wave of the coronavirus.\n\nThey work by logging when two people have been in close proximity to each other for a substantial period of time.\n\nIf one of the users is later diagnosed as having the disease, an alert can be sent to others they have recently been close to, telling them that they should also get tested and/or self-isolate.\n\nThe UK's previous \"centralised\" design carried out the contact-matches on a remote server.\n\nThe Apple-Google model carries the process out on the handsets themselves, making it more difficult for the authorities or potentially hackers to de-anonymise the records and use them for other means.\n\nOne advantage of the switch - if deployed - is that the NHS Covid-19 app would be able to overcome a limitation of iPhones and carry out Bluetooth \"handshakes\" when the software is running in the background.\n\nAnother is that it should be easier to make the app compatible with other countries' counterparts, which are based on the same system - including the Republic of Ireland and Germany.\n\nEarlier in the week, the European Commission said that France - which had adopted a centralised app - would face challenges in this regard.\n\n\"This is a welcome, if a heavily and unnecessarily delayed, move,\" commented Dr Michael Veale from the DP3T group, which promotes the decentralised model.\n\n\"The Google-Apple system in a way is home-grown: originating with research at a large consortium of universities led by Switzerland and including UCL in the UK.\"\n\nHe added that developers should be able to adapt code already being used by Germany and Switzerland if required.\n\nIf Baroness Harding decides the Apple-Google tech is never good enough to roll out, then another alternative might be a system based on wearable tech.\n\nSingapore recently ordered 300,000 dongles to test as an alternative. Rather than uploading data over the internet, users will physically hand them over if they test positive for the virus, allowing recent contacts to be flagged.\n\nBaroness Harding's team is monitoring it and other innovations, but for now intends to focus on manual contact tracing carried out by humans.\n\nWhile the government is still set to launch an app of some kind across England, health is a devolved issue.\n\nAs a consequence, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales have still to commit to the initiative.\n\n\"We will continue to work with the UK government to gather the information we need on data integration, technical information and overall timescales before making any decisions on whether or not to support its use,\" a spokesman for the Scottish government told the BBC.\n\nA spokeswoman for the Northern Ireland Executive added: \"People in Northern Ireland already have access to a symptom checker and advice app called Covid-19 NI, which more than 50,000 have downloaded and use regularly. This helps people to improve access to information, particularly when they have been advised to self-isolate.\"",

The city's pubs and restaurants are now preparing for their first weekend open in months.\n\nThe latest R number for the UK was also published on Friday. It is now estimated to be between 0.8 and 1.0, suggesting coronavirus cases in the UK are either stable or shrinking slightly.\n\nThe number relates to how many people each infected person is passing the virus on to.

    "When the virus came to our hospital": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "As the Covid-19 pandemic loomed, the staff at one hospital in the English Midlands braced themselves. Quickly they found themselves at the centre of a coronavirus hotspot - and nothing turned out as they anticipated.\n\nLiz Rees sat down at her dining room table to take the call. It was a Sunday in early March and, from down the line, a voice was telling her about some test results that had just come back from the lab.\n\nThis wasn't a normal diagnosis.\n\nDudley, the town where Liz has worked for 20 years as a consultant microbiologist, had its first case of Covid-19. That, in itself, wasn't a surprise. She'd watched on TV as the virus had spread from Asia to continental Europe before reaching the south of England; it had already been detected in nearby Birmingham and Wolverhampton. \"The was an inevitability about it,\" she says. \"But the first one makes it real.\"\n\nLiz's was the doctor in charge of infection prevention and control at Russells Hall Hospital in Dudley. She'd spent her career anticipating what to do in the event of a pandemic. And she knew the town - a one-time industrial powerhouse, the capital of the Black Country - intimately. Her husband joked she was attached to an elastic band that wouldn't stretch more than 10 miles out of Quinton, the nearby Birmingham suburb where she was brought up.\n\nStill sitting in her dining room, Liz hastily convened an incident meeting over the phone with hospital staff. There was a list of things to check: That the patient was receiving the best possible care. That the staff on the ward were comfortable with what they were doing. Which infection precautions needed to be put in place.\n\nThe mood was calm. Everyone had a plan to follow. But this was uncharted territory. \"I think we were aware that we would probably be getting more cases within days,\" says Liz.\n\nFor some time now, a Yorkshireman named Paul Hudson had also been anticipating that the outbreak would reach Dudley - and thinking hard about how to respond. But the first case came as a shock: \"It wasn't from somewhere we expected.\"\n\nPaul's job was divided in two. He spent half his time as consultant anaesthetist at the hospital, a role he'd occupied since 2009, and the other half as deputy medical director of the trust that runs it.\n\nAs the virus approached, he'd been closely involved in planning what to do - drawing up new guidelines; working out how to \"zone\" new arrivals at the front door into Covid and non-Covid streams; setting up a respiratory emergency department; and making sure there was enough stuff - oxygen, personal protective equipment, ventilators, drugs and people.\n\n\"We had, I think, quite a good plan in place,\" Paul says. It was just a question of waiting for patients with severe respiratory symptoms to start showing up at the door.\n\nBut that wasn't what happened, at least not at first.\n\n\"All of a sudden, we had a patient - an in-patient - test positive,\" says Paul.\n\nThis individual was being treated for something else entirely, having been admitted before they started showing symptoms. There were protocols in place for dealing with a situation like this to stop the virus spreading - but it was a difficult start all the same.\n\n\"I think that set the tone for a lot of the next few weeks and months,\" says Paul. \"That has been, I think, one of the themes of this illness - that it has been unpredictable.\"\n\nQadar Zada sat in his office at the hospital. He'd been born less than a mile away and never lived anywhere other than Dudley. And yet everything around felt new to him.\n\nIn January 2020, Qadar had started as deputy head of operations at the trust. Part of his job involved making sure medical staff had all the support they need to do theirs. He'd spent his career working in NHS management and felt he had a good idea of what had to be done. There was a problem, though - most of his colleagues were strangers to him.\n\n\"For me, I think the biggest challenge personally was that I didn't know people in the organisation,\" he says. The plan to give him a structured induction fell away. As the workload increased, no-one had time for a getting-to-know-you chat: \"So at the point that we were talking to people about planning things, I was having to introduce myself.\"\n\nThere was also the duty he, a local councillor, felt towards his community. \"I was worried, obviously, for those people in Dudley, family that I have in Dudley,\" he says. \"I was worried for colleagues in the trust as well. But I was also aware of everybody's responsibility, including my own.\"\n\nOn 8 March, the day Tesco began restricting sales due to stockpiling and the UK Foreign Office advised against travelling to northern Italy, Dudley's first Covid-19 case was diagnosed. Three days later, the first fatality in the town attributed to the virus was reported in the local press. By 15 March the death toll stood at two, then rose to five by 18 March, then seven by the following day. On 20 March, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the government was looking at why there was a \"hotspot\" across the West Midlands region.\n\nAccording to Liz, the patients who died in the early days of the outbreak in Dudley were already very ill with underlying conditions. Typically, these deaths came rapidly after diagnosis. \"By the time the result was back, possibly within 24 hours, they had died,\" she says. \"It was clear at that point that this can be a really difficult disease to deal with.\"\n\nFor everyone at the hospital, all this was new. \"People were learning what these patients look like when they came through the front door,\" says Liz. \"The severity of the illness, and the breadth of people it could affect, was a bit of an eye-opener.\"\n\nOn the top floor of the administration block, a large office suite normally used for hosting seminars had been transformed. There were information boards around the walls and blinking computer monitors. A screen was tuned to the BBC News channel around the clock.\n\nThis was the trust's Covid incident room - a hub for all data coming in and going out of the trust.\n\n\"We were man-marking every single swab,\" says Qadar. The incident room received contact tracing information and produced situation reports throughout the day. There was also a PPE line for staff who needed personal protective equipment.\n\nAs well as carrying out its own modelling of how the virus might spread in Dudley, the trust was receiving projections from Public Health England, the local authority and other NHS agencies.\n\nThey warned how bad the impending peak could get. \"At one point, the worst-case scenario, we were trying to plan for receiving up to 20 critically ill patients an hour for a number of days,\" says Paul. Back then, the hospital had just nine ventilated beds and another eight that offered advanced respiratory support. \"That just doesn't work, do you know what I mean?\"\n\nOn 23 March, the prime minister told the UK: \"You must stay at home.\" Dudley joined the rest of the country in lockdown. At the same time, the surge in patient numbers everyone had been expecting was beginning.\n\nTypically, \"the people here are stoical and tend to present late - a salt-of-the-earth type thing\", says Liz - but that wasn't the case any more. Covid patients were starting to turn up at the doors in large numbers, and a significant proportion of them were incredibly sick. According to Paul, those that weren't already acutely unwell when they arrived would typically deteriorate rapidly within days.\n\nBetween 23 and 25 March, the number of confirmed cases in the town jumped from 26 to 40. By 27 March, the number of Covid-related deaths stood at 17; four days later, that figure had nearly doubled to 30.\n\nAround this time, a workaround for the concerns about ventilator capacity presented itself.\n\nThe trust had received guidance that a form of non-invasive ventilation called Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) could be useful for Covid patients - either as a bridge to the usual mechanical ventilation techniques or as an alternative to them.\n\nThe Army had been drafted in to deliver essential supplies like PPE and oxygen to hospitals, and Paul recalls telling an officer - \"I kid you not, his name was Major Tom\" - that he worried the hospital was under-resourced when it came to CPAP machines. Soon afterwards a lorry turned up with 25 of them.\n\n\"And at that point, you could feel the mood around the place change a little bit,\" says Paul: it gave medical staff the confidence that they could take treatment decisions on the basis of patient need, not hospital capacity.\n\nTen operating theatres and a recovery area were transformed into a massive critical care facility, and the respiratory and high-dependency wards had been converted into a Covid-only CPAP unit ward.\n\nIt wasn't a moment too soon. The peak arrived in early April.\n\nThe parts of the hospital reserved for routine treatment were eerily quiet. According to Paul, \"Our non-Covid work just fell off the edge of the cliff.\" But in the Covid zones, the pace was becoming frenetic.\n\nBy Sunday 5 April - the day the prime minister was admitted to hospital in London having already tested positive - the number of confirmed cases in the borough of Dudley had soared to 283. Three days later, it was announced that the number of hospital deaths stood at 106.\n\nLiz recalls a single day in early April during which 58 new positive test results from the hospital came through, and not feeling particularly surprised by the number.\n\nFor most of that month, anaesthetic and critical care medics worked an intensive shift pattern - three long days, three days off, three nights, three more days off. Staff worked outside their comfort zones, carrying out tasks and working in departments that weren't part of their day jobs. Keeping rotas fully staffed became a huge challenge, not just for doctors and nurses but in every part of the hospital - at one point hundreds of employees were absent, either because they had fallen ill themselves or they were following advice to self-isolate.\n\nThe pressure faced by these front-line workers was unprecedented, says Paul.\n\n\"Trying to shout through the mask at people you barely recognise because you can only see the strip of their eyes - while the patients were incredibly sick and prone to very acute deterioration,\" he says. \"You think you're making progress - and all of a sudden, they'd have these surges of deterioration where for the next four to six hours you're just trying to hold the tide back.\"\n\nThe prohibition on visiting made the task even harder, he adds: \"Not having the relatives there to communicate with properly, and having to do everything shouted through a mask down the phone - I think it made it very, very, very difficult for a lot of our staff.\"\n\n\"All your decisions are a little bit more demanding,\" recalls Liz. \"Your life has become a very narrow spectrum because the world's shut down around you. So either you're at home, or you're at work, and when your work is like mine.... I got to the point where I stopped listening to the news because I'd been dealing with it all day.\" To add to the breakdown in boundaries between her home and professional lives, Liz's daughter was working on a Covid ward in Sheffield as a junior doctor. \"It's been a family business,\" she adds dryly.\n\nThe hospital never ran out of PPE - the trust, aided by the dedicated phone line in the incident room, did its job. But the local community played a crucial role, too, in preventing stocks from running out. \"At one point, volunteers were making visors because we couldn't get any,\" says Qadar. One consultant surgeon helped source acetate for the front of them with the help of his daughter, a teacher, who regularly ordered it for classroom supplies.\n\n\"At one point I was wearing a pair of goggles donated to us by the chemistry department at a local school,\" says Paul. \"One of my colleagues had a welder's mask, which looked really great - it was a kind of a mirrored black lens that was slightly less helpful when trying to look after people, because you couldn't see through it.\"\n\nOne evening, Paul turned up for a nightshift to discover there were no new Covid patients. Then the following night, there wasn't another patient either. And then a few days passed without any more.\n\nThe hospital staff could start to believe that the peak had passed.\n\nPlanning the recovery stage would be the next challenge. The non-emergency workload began to climb again, too. And everyone was well aware they needed to prepare for the possibility of subsequent spikes in infections.\n\nBut as the regular Thursday night clapping ritual drew to an end, they were able to take satisfaction in what they had achieved.\n\n\"You can look back and actually see that while what was done was really, on reflection, quite amazing actually,\" says Liz. \"I think there's still a little bit of fear in the background about a second wave. But I think having done it once before, I think we know what we need to do.\"\n\nEarly in the Covid-19 outbreak, the Shetland Islands were one of the worst-hit areas of the UK by head of population. Now, no new cases have been detected there for six weeks. Some experts say it offers the rest of the country a route map out of lockdown - but for the first family on the islands to test positive, it hasn't been easy.",

    "Why Spain is seeing second Covid wave": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "Spain saw one of the most draconian Covid-19 lockdowns in Europe, but two months after it was lifted, the virus is spreading faster than in any neighbouring nation.\n\nIt now has Europe's fastest-rising caseload, with 142 positive cases per 100,000 inhabitants over the past two weeks.\n\nBy the time the state of emergency ended on 21 June, Spain was registering 100 to 150 cases per day. That number has risen to more than 3,000.\n\nBut the number of deaths over the past week stood at 122 on Thursday, a far cry from the 950 registered on 2 April alone, the blackest day in Europe's deadliest per capita coronavirus epidemic.\n\nMost of the transmission is now between young people, and around three-quarters of positives are in patients who show no symptoms.\n\nSpain's government admits the numbers are \"not what we want to see\", but points to key differences compared to the spring.\n\nOnly around 3% of current cases require hospital treatment, less than 0.5% need intensive care and the current death rate is as low as 0.3%.\n\n\"Mortality is very low, as is the hospitalisation rate. Something has changed big time, although the rise is still worrying,\" says Ildefonso Hern\u00e1ndez, a professor in public health from Miguel Hern\u00e1ndez University in Alicante.\n\n\"As long as cases are rising, we have to think that a second wave is on the way. We don't have much time to react before September's return to routines.\"\n\nSpain's tourism season has ended up as little more than a damp squib, as most countries moved to blacklist this key destination within weeks of the country opening up at the end of June.\n\nThat means beach areas have so far avoided the highest rates of infection, although Catalonia's infection rate is slightly above the national average on 145 cases per 100,000 inhabitants.\n\nHealthcare is a competence of Spain's 17 regions, and some are looking much better prepared than others. At the good end of the scale, the northern region of Asturias has an infection rate of 32, while Arag\u00f3n in the north-east is topping 500.\n\nArag\u00f3n's capital, Zaragoza, has become a hotspot for community transmission over recent weeks, but the problems began in the early summer when thousands of seasonal workers, many of them wandering migrants, began to travel to orchards in the region.\n\nGrowers and packing companies have been criticised for not providing accommodation for migrant workers, leading them to travel between shelters and fields or subsist in insanitary shanties.\n\n\"Everything happening in Arag\u00f3n is very much connected to outbreaks among the seasonal fruit-pickers. There should have been more anticipation of the problems that could arise due to the accommodation situation of these workers,\" explains Juan Gonz\u00e1lez Armengol, president of the Spanish Society of Emergency Medicine (Semes).\n\nWorst of all, more than 55 care homes for the elderly in Arag\u00f3n have registered cases since the end of the state of emergency.\n\nThere is a risk that areas that escaped the worst ravages of the spring pandemic could be hit by a second wave as autumn nears.\n\nIn June, Arag\u00f3n estimated around 760 deaths in residences, 10 times fewer than in Madrid.\n\nSpanish politics has lacked any consensus or spirit of collaboration in managing the coronavirus crisis.\n\nWhile the national government of Socialist Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez has faced accusations from rivals of lying about death rates, the regional government in Madrid run by the conservative Popular Party has attracted equally fierce criticism.\n\nDespite a shocking collapse of Madrid's public hospital system in the spring, and with 50% more deaths than the more populous region of Catalonia, the capital is now seeing cases double week after week.\n\nMadrid had fewer than 200 contact tracers by the end of July. Double that number had been promised, and even that was half the figure recommended by the medical community.\n\n\"Among the factors for the high infection numbers we are seeing, the quality of Spain's democracy is playing a part. Were accountability stricter, it would not be acceptable that some regions - and not just Madrid - are taking so long to put measures in place,\" says Prof Hern\u00e1ndez.\n\nFor three months, Spaniards were under lockdown. That meant many young people were stuck in their family homes.\n\nPerhaps unsurprisingly, street parties and night life are now being signalled as the biggest catalysts of new outbreaks along with family gatherings.\n\nTown and city festivals have all been cancelled. That did not stop crowds gathering in Navarre's capital of Pamplona for the 7 July start date of the world-famous San Ferm\u00edn bull-running fiesta.\n\nLast Friday 400 young revellers paraded the streets of nearby Tafalla, marking the town's \"non-festival\".\n\nIn the neighbouring Basque Country, which is just ahead of Navarre as Spain's third worst-affected region this month, youthful gatherings have also been linked to outbreaks.\n\nOf the 350 people called to turn up for testing after a busy night at Bilbao's Back&Stage nightclub last month, at least 34 proved positive, the kind of result that has prompted an agreement between Spain's authorities to close down all nightlife after 01:00.\n\n\"It was like any other night at the club and many people were not wearing a face mask even when dancing. I was among the first to take mine off,\" 18-year-old Arkaitz Serrano told newspaper El Pa\u00eds.\n\n\"Spaniards were extremely fastidious about following the rules during the lockdown, but there has been a massive relaxation now we have returned to a kind of normality,\" notes Prof Hern\u00e1ndez.\n\nUnder new emergency powers, the Basque government this week banned so-called botell\u00f3n parties, alcohol-fuelled outdoor gatherings of young people.\n\nBut the botell\u00f3n is a national problem.\n\nIn Madrid the regional government has asked for police reinforcements to seek out and break up such parties, whose numbers are rising as restrictions on nightclubs and bars take effect.",

In recent months, the idea of introducing digital immunity passports has begun to circulate as a potential lifeline to jumpstart international leisure travel.\n\n\"An immunity passport is a presentable proof of immunity to Covid-19,\" said Husayn Kassai, co-founder and CEO of Onfido, a London-based technology company specialising in facial biometric certification. \"It is designed to help an individual prove that they have been tested and that their test result belongs to them, but without having to share any personal information.\"\n\nImmunity passports are currently being examined primarily for the benefit of frontline medical workers, allowing them to continue working safely with reduced risk of an outbreak in hospitals.\n\nAn immunity passport is a presentable proof of immunity to Covid-19\n\nIn April, Onfido was invited to submit a proposal for digital health certificates to the UK Parliament's Science and Technology Committee. In their proposal, Onfido casts immunity passports as \"the linchpin of a new normality\". They would allow users to create a digital identity by uploading an official document (such as a passport or driver's licence) along with a selfie taken on their phone, which would be verified using AI technology. The identity would then be paired with a certificate of immunity issued by a national health service. The end result would be a code on their phone that could be scanned to enter workplaces, public buildings or even airports. Onfido would provide the technology to verify users' identities, but it would be up to the UK government to securely manage the health data and introduce a system of testing for immunity.\n\nConsideration of immunity passports in the UK is still in its early stages, with the British government examining submissions from other facial recognition and identity firms, such as Yoti, Nomidio and Berlin-based IDnow, as well as a range of medical experts and academics on the viability of an immunity-based scheme. The jury is still out on whether the UK will formally adopt immunity passports, but the potential for such documents to accelerate reopening parts of public life has caused similar proposals to pop up in Germany, Indonesia, Italy, Israel, Colombia, Argentina, Estonia and the US.\n\nSome of the earliest countries to be impacted by the virus have been quick to adopt health certificates, with China embracing the use of a health code app that shows whether a user is symptom-free in order to check into hotels or ride the subway, as reported by Reuters. While not officially an immunity passport, the Chilean government has begun issuing \"virus-free\" certificates to citizens who have recovered from Covid-19, allowing them to return to work without restriction of movement.\n\nThe ticket to reviving the travel industry?\n\nRestoring travel is crucial for global economic recovery. According to the World Travel and Tourism Council, in 2019 tourism contributed nearly US$9 trillion to the world's GDP and accounted for 330 million jobs - roughly one in 10 jobs around the world. However, for travel to fully recommence, governments will understandably require proof that people aren't bringing Covid-19 with them. Presenting verified proof of immunity might become a requirement for passengers before airlines will allow them to board a flight, similar to a passport or visa.\n\nJohn Holland-Kaye, CEO of the UK's busiest airport, Heathrow, has welcomed the introduction of an internationally recognised immunity passport, while acknowledging the success of such a scheme would depend on other countries adopting similar systems. \"If the UK government, with one of the biggest aviation sectors in the world, were to get together with the European Union and United States, between them they'd have the global diplomatic and economic power to set the international standard,\" he told Sky News in May.\n\nOn a call with investors in April, CEO of Delta Air Lines, Ed Bastian said he would \"make whatever changes to the business model that will be necessary\", including adopting immunity passports if required by the US government. Bastian pointed out how readily travellers adapted to new security regulations introduced by TSA and Home Security in the wake of the 9/11 terrorist attacks, and said the most important thing for travellers is confidence their safety is being well managed.\n\nHealth certificates are also beginning to be trialled by hotels. Sidehide, a contactless online reservations platform, announced in May it would partner with Onfido to deliver a contactless booking system using immunity passports. Users will be able to use a QR code to verify their immunity status and then book participating hotels directly through the app. Travellers check in on arrival via the app and can go straight to their room without any contact with hotel staff.\n\nThe problem with testing for immunity\n\nPerhaps the biggest hurdle standing in the way of the introduction of immunity passports is the scientific knowledge about Covid-19 itself. It is still unclear exactly how accurate antibody tests are, and when antibodies are detected, how long they remain in someone's body.\n\nWhen the human body comes under attack from infection, our immune system's response is to produce antibodies that help detect and destroy the virus. These antibodies can remain in our blood for a period of time after recovery to guard against repeat infections. Antibodies are one of the key defences against infection, which is why they have become a focal point for testing.\n\nBut for an immunity passport to work in practice, governments and health practitioners need reliable serology tests that can accurately identify antibodies in a person's bloodstream, which the World Health Organisation says is not possible at this time. A scheme by Emirates to screen airline passengers for Covid-19 antibodies using rapid immunodiagnostic tests was withdrawn after an audit found only 30% of results were accurate. False results could lead to individuals being granted immunity status even if they have never contracted the virus.\n\nThe reason serology tests aren't yet fully reliable is because Covid-19 is still new and researchers are working to better understand it. So far, the virus doesn't seem to be playing by the rules when it comes to traditional immunity theory. Scientists have discovered patients who had recovered from infection, but mysteriously didn't develop any antibodies. Historical blood samples have been found to contain traces of Covid-19 immunity cells that predate the discovery of Covid-19, suggesting some people had pre-existing levels of resistance before the virus was discovered in China in December 2019.\n\nThere is also growing doubt about how long people who have been infected with Covid-19 remain immune to the disease. There is some evidence to suggest that while antibodies can be detected in patients who have recovered from a severe case of Covid-19 for at least three months, a growing number of studies that show in milder cases the antibodies appear to rapidly decline from around three months after infection. Researchers at the University of California, Los Angeles, who conducted one study on antibody-longevity, urged caution over using antibodies as a basis for immunity passports. Another part of the immune system known as T-cells have shown more promise, however, as a longer-lasting source of immunity against Covid-19.\n\nYou may also be interested in:\n\n* Will travel be safer by 2022?\n\n* A new way to fly, guilt free?\n\n* The last big unknown on Earth\n\nA further complication is that in some cases Covid-19 patients have been shown to also carry and potentially spread the virus for up to three months after their recovery. In addition, the world's first proven case of reinfection, with a different strain of Covid-19, has just been reported out of Hong Kong.\n\nThe sum total is that we are still grappling to understand the nature of immune responses to Covid-19 and it is too early to pin our hopes on serology testing. There are also concerns that immunity passports, which create a rubber stamp of approval, may mislead the public as to the complexity of their immune status, resulting in them ignoring public health advice and increasing the risk of continued transmission. It could also create a perverse incentive for individuals to seek out infection in order to gain immunity and return to \"normal life\". In May, a poll by the Daily Mail found 19% of Britons would consider deliberately becoming infected if immunity passports were introduced by the UK Government.\n\nIf, or when, a Covid-19 vaccine is developed in the future, it is possible a vaccination certification scheme similar to that already used for yellow fever could be introduced to permit travel. However, most experts believe a vaccine could become widely available by mid-2021 - an agonising wait for the tourism sector - and even this is an optimistic prediction.\n\nA slippery slope\n\nCivil rights advocates on both sides of the Atlantic have flagged the introduction of immunity passports as the potential beginning of a slippery slope. At a time when Black Lives Matter has forced the world to critically examine its structural inequalities, these groups warn immunity passports could create a new privilege in the form of an antibody elite.\n\nCombining health data with biometric data further increases the ability of states to build up highly detailed, intrusive and intimate records of people\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) says immunity certificates could exacerbate existing racial disparities in the US. This is because the industries most likely to adopt them are those where employees cannot work from home - such as food production, sanitation, transportation and delivery. These industries typically employ immigrants, workers of colour and women: demographics who already experience unequal access to healthcare. These workers risk infection to earn a paycheque and have limited safety nets if they become ill. Workers who do survive infection and gain immunity could be given preference for work over others without immunity, creating a new underclass. These workers are confronted with a terrifying choice to either remain unemployed or take the risk and become infected.\n\nIf that sounds unbearably bleak, it has happened before. When yellow fever swept through 19th-Century New Orleans, workers who weren't immune to the disease were considered unemployable. This disproportionally impacted migrants and people of colour, who were forced by their conditions to keep earning money, while wealthy white families and business owners could retreat indoors for protection.\n\nThe ACLU has warned immunity passports could form part of \"a new health surveillance infrastructure that endangers privacy rights\", a concern shared by Ella Jakubowska at European Digital Rights (EDRi), an association of civil and human rights organisations from across Europe. Jakubowska says that \"combining health data with biometric data further increases the ability of states to build up highly detailed, intrusive and intimate records of people\", including housing, employment and travel history. \"This can, in turn, have a chilling effect on freedom of expression\" with governments using immunity passports to restrict freedom of movement under the pretext of fighting the pandemic.\n\nThe tension of balancing civil liberties with collecting big data is nothing new. What matters is how governments strike that balance between freedom and security. China's mass surveillance network, which has previously come under criticism from Western media as overreaching, has proven remarkably effective in managing Covid-19.\n\nHowever, in an interview with the BBC, Adam Schwartz, a senior lawyer at the Electronic Frontier Foundation in California, said historically governments have been reluctant to wind back security powers after they've been introduced. \"For example, in the wake of the 9/11 attacks, the US created vast new surveillance powers. Nineteen years later, those powers are still very much in the hands of the US government.\" This retention of special powers beyond the scope of which they were originally intended is referred to as \"mission creep\" and experts warn Covid-19 may usher in a new age of global digital surveillance.\n\nGovernments are already in the unenviable position of balancing public health with the need to revive the economy. While immunity passports appear, on the surface, to be a panacea to reviving tourism and a significant chunk of the global economy, they also bring the added complexity of human rights to a table already groaning under the weight of a once-in-a-century event.\n\nFuture of Travel is a series from BBC Travel that investigates what the world might look like to travellers in the coming years and meets the people living on the frontlines of change.\n\nJoin more than three million BBC Travel fans by liking us on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter and Instagram.",

        "body": "The earliest person to contract coronavirus within the UK has been identified, scientists believe.\n\nAnalysis of samples by the University of Nottingham showed a 75-year-old woman, from Nottinghamshire, tested positive on 21 February.\n\nA Surrey resident was previously believed to have caught the virus first.\n\nThe woman is also understood to be first in the UK to die after contracting Covid-19.\n\nNews of the case has emerged only now, because samples were being analysed in retrospect by researchers as they investigated the origins of the UK pandemic.\n\nNearly 2,000 routine respiratory samples taken from patients at a Nottingham teaching hospital between January and March were tested.\n\nThe report states: \"Patient 1 in this study is, to the best of our knowledge, the earliest described community-acquired case of SARS-CoV-2 in the UK, admitted to hospital care on the 21st of February 2020, and was also the first UK COVID-19 death, preceding the earliest known death by 2 days.\"\n\nUntil now, the first transmission of coronavirus within the UK was thought to have occurred on 28 February. But this new research suggests there were home-grown cases earlier than this.\n\nAlthough the study comes from only one hospital in Nottingham, it signals that coronavirus was circulating undetected in Britain at least in early February 2020.\n\nThe findings are perhaps not surprising, given the limited testing early on in the pandemic which meant only a small number of people were checked for the virus.\n\nPlenty of people have been doubting the official timeline of coronavirus spread. Other research published in May revealed France's first case was in December 2019 - almost a month earlier than previously thought.\n\nStudies like these help build a more complete picture of the history of the outbreak, but do not tell us what the virus will do next.\n\nEven if more people have been exposed to the virus than first appreciated, it's not clear whether this means more of us will be immune to the disease.\n\nThe work also revealed that early coronavirus cases in the UK would have been identified if testing criteria had at the time been less strict, say the scientists.\n\nProfessor Jonathan Ball, one of authors of the study, said there was \"widespread community transmission of coronavirus\" in Nottingham in early February.\n\nHowever, the researchers said the cases went undetected because testing for coronavirus required a strict criteria to be met like a recent travel history.\n\nProf Ball said: \"Had the diagnostic criteria for Covid-19 been widened earlier to include patients with compatible symptoms but no travel history, it is likely that earlier imported infections would have been detected, which could have led to an earlier lockdown and lower deaths.\n\n\"However, the capacity for testing available nationally was not sufficient at the time to process the volume of testing required.\n\n\"In order to prepare for any future pandemic such as this, the UK urgently needs to invest in and expand diagnostic capacity within NHS and PHE diagnostic laboratory services.\"\n\nA Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: \"NHS Test and Trace is working, it's completely free and is stopping the spread of coronavirus.\n\n\"During this unprecedented pandemic we have rapidly built the largest network of diagnostic testing facilities in British history, meaning anyone with coronavirus symptoms can get a test.\"",

    "Would you agree to have coronavirus squirted up your nose?": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "Would you agree to have coronavirus squirted up your nose? All, of course, in the name of science.\n\nThere are plenty who would, and indeed are campaigning to be allowed to take part in so-called \"challenge trials\" to try to accelerate development of a coronavirus vaccine.\n\nAlastair Fraser-Urquhart is one of them. He's 18 and has just received his A-level results. Initially he did not have the grades he needed to study cancer biomedicine at University College London, until the government U-turn.\n\nNow he does, he's thinking about taking a year out, in part to work with 1 Day Sooner, a group campaigning for Covid vaccine challenge trials.\n\n\"I'm in the lowest-risk category for Covid so why wouldn't I make that choice and help save other people who would deal with it far worse than me,\" he says.\n\nA challenge study would involve volunteers being given a Covid vaccine and, a few weeks later, being infected with live coronavirus in order to test whether the jab has protected them. Those involved would be quarantined in a clinical research unit for two weeks and kept under close medical supervision to see if they get infected and develop symptoms.\n\nSo what do Alastair's family think? \"It's fair to say they were not over the moon about it, but I haven't faced any significant opposition. My dad was definitely not chuffed when I told him in June. Both my brothers are OK with it.\"\n\nThe whole world is waiting for a Covid vaccine. There are now at least 30 experimental vaccines in human trials. Thousands of volunteers have been immunised. What happens next depends on where those volunteers live and how they behave. All have been told to maintain social distancing, and not to seek out coronavirus.\n\nThat's good advice for two reasons: only half the volunteers in trials will receive Covid vaccines, the rest will be a control group. Those taking part don't know, at this stage, which group they are in. Secondly, the vaccines may not work at all.\n\nThat's partly why so many trials are being set up in coronavirus hotspot zones in Brazil and the United States, the two worst affected countries in the world.\n\nChallenge trials would take away the element of chance and you'd get immediate results.\n\nI'm the BBC's medical editor. Since 2004 I have reported on a huge range of topics from cancer, genetics, malaria, and HIV, to the many significant advances in medical science which have improved people's health. I've also followed pandemic threats such as bird flu as well as Sars and Mers. Now I'm focusing on Covid-19 and its immense global impact.\n\nNot so fast. There are plenty of people willing to take part in challenge studies. But there are good reasons why no one has rushed into organising one.\n\nChallenge trials have a long history. They have been used to test new vaccines against influenza, typhoid, cholera and malaria. Indeed the first vaccine, developed by physician Edward Jenner in the late 18th Century, involved what would now be regarded as a very dodgy challenge trial involving the eight-year-old son of his gardener. Jenner had noticed that dairymaids appeared immune from smallpox, a devastating viral infection, after suffering from cowpox, a harmless virus. James Phipps was inoculated with cowpox sores and then intentionally exposed to smallpox, but did not get infected. Smallpox is the only infectious disease to have been eradicated from the planet.\n\nNowadays, there is usually a rescue remedy at hand, in case volunteers fall ill after a vaccine challenge trial. Knowing there is an effective treatment means the risks to volunteers are kept at a minimum. That is not the case with Covid-19. There is no medicine guaranteed to prevent an infection from becoming serious, even life-threatening.\n\nIt's impossible to be precise about these. Around nine in 10 deaths with Covid-19 have been in people with underlying health conditions. Studies quoted by 1 Day Sooner suggest the risk of death for healthy and unhealthy people in their 20s could range from 1 in 3,300 to 1 in 14,000. But nearly all deaths in this age group are among people with underlying health conditions, so healthy individuals will be at lower risk. The statistics guru Prof David Spiegelhalter did a rough estimate for me and reckons, for healthy people in their 20s, it could be as low as 1 in 40,000. He says that is pretty much the same risk of them being killed in a road accident each year.\n\nIt may not sound very dangerous, unless of course you are the one in 40,000 or whatever the actual figure is. But it gets more complicated. The risk might depend on how much coronavirus is squirted up the nose. Some studies have suggested a link between the amount of virus exposure and the severity of illness. So a Goldilocks approach would be needed - the challenge volunteers would need enough virus to infect them, but not so much that it might overwhelm their immune system. To work that out, you need a preliminary series of dose-escalation trials, where volunteers would have no protection at all.\n\nAlastair Fraser-Urquhart is ready to take part in those trials too, saying he's thought carefully about the risks. \"What happens if I do end up seriously ill? If I do it will be for science and provide incredibly valuable data,\" he says.\n\nSean McPartlin, 22, is another would-be volunteer. From Ireland, he has a degree in philosophy and is studying in Oxford.\n\n\"My mother has a hereditary lung disorder and every day we go without a vaccine is a day that she takes a risk she doesn't have to,\" he says. \"I want to do everything I can to help get that vaccine for her and everyone else like her as quickly as possible.\"\n\nSean says his family have been supportive. He thinks two weeks in a clinical research unit could help him focus on his studies, and the main threat would be boredom.\n\n\"Getting involved in a trial like this involves time and energy, and that's something I am lucky to have. I don't have any medical knowledge, so I can help in a different way.\"\n\nAmy Letts, 36, has taken part in studies to test malaria and typhoid vaccines. For the malaria trial she had to submit to being bitten by several mosquitoes infected with the malaria parasite. For the other study she drank a solution laced with typhoid bacteria.\n\n\"I had a mix of reasons for taking part. Firstly, there is the potential good it can do. I was delighted when I found out that the typhoid vaccine I'd been given has been a success and is now being used to save thousands of lives.\n\nThen there is the compensation. They do pay for your time. I lived very close to the research unit in Oxford so it was easy for me to pop in and have my daily blood tests and monitoring.\"\n\nAmy tried to volunteer to receive the Oxford Covid-19 vaccine, but was excluded because it uses the same technology - a chimpanzee adenovirus - as the malaria vaccine she received there a decade ago.\n\nI think it is likely, but they may not get under way for months. The team behind the Oxford University/AstraZeneca Covid vaccine are apparently considering them.\n\nTheir vaccine is already in advanced trials involving tens of thousands of volunteers. A challenge study might complement that data, but it wouldn't replace it.\n\nProf Adrian Hill, director of Oxford University's Jenner Institute has said he hoped challenge trials could begin \"by the end of the year\".\n\nAnother leading coronavirus vaccine contender has also said it is considering challenge trials.\n\nThe head of vaccines at Janssen, a Belgian pharma company, said preparations were underway to ensure there were stocks of coronavirus on hand in order to allow such studies to take place.",
