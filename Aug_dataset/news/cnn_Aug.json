        "body": "(CNN)Severe illness and death remain rare in children with Covid-19, a new study suggests, while disparities do appear in kids who may require critical care or suffer complications.\n\nPediatricians described the findings as reassuring as children accounted for fewer than 1% of some coronavirus cases in England, Wales and Scotland; and only 1% of those children died, the researchers reported.The researchers -- from various UK institutions -- analyzed data on 651 Covid-19 patients under the age of 19 who were admitted to 138 hospitals across England, Scotland and Wales between January and July. These young patients accounted for 0.9% of all patients in those hospitals at the time, the researchers noted.Six of those young patients -- or 1% -- died in hospital. In comparison, 27% of Covid-19 patients of all ages died over the same time period, the researchers noted in their study, published in the British medical journal BMJ on Thursday. Overall, 18% of the young patients needed critical care and \"Black ethnicity was significantly associated with admission to critical care,\" the researchers noted.Read MoreThe most common symptoms the young patients had were fever, cough, nausea or vomiting, and shortness of breath. The researchers found that 52 patients -- or 11% -- met the criteria for multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children, or MIS-C, a troubling complication of Covid-19 in which different body parts can become inflamed.Children who may have had MIS-C were significantly older than those who did not and were significantly more likely to be of non-White ethnicity, the researchers found. Children with MIS-C were also five times more likely than others to be admitted to critical care.Reassured\"This is an observational study of hospitalized children. The limitations include that not all cases may have been captured. This also does not account for the true prevalence of significant COVID-19 infection in children,\" Athimalaipet Ramanan, honorary professor of pediatric rheumatology at the University of Bristol, said in a written statement distributed by the UK-based Science Media Centre on Thursday.\"However, on balance it's an important study as it is likely most children with significant illness would have presented to the hospitals,\" said Ramanan, who was not involved in the new study.Dr. Liz Whittaker, infectious disease lead at the Royal College of Pediatrics and Child Health in Britain, who was not involved in the study, called the findings \"reassuring.\"\"Very low numbers of children have been admitted to critical care and the researchers reported a very low death rate -- particularly in comparison to adults,\" Whittaker said in another written statement distributed by the Science Media Centre. \"On the whole, parents and paediatricians should be reassured by the findings of this paper.\"It was unclear which patients were admitted to the hospital directly for coronavirus infection and which had been admitted for other reasons but happened to test positive for the virus. More research also is needed to determine whether similar findings among young patients would emerge in other parts of the world.",

Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds.\n\n(CNN)In the early days of the pandemic, many people came together to help each other, connecting over socially distant dinners and reaching out for video calls with friends they hadn't talked to in months.\n\nBut this international crisis continues, and Americans are having trouble adjusting to the strain of our new reality. New psychological data taken during the pandemic shows the nation's mental health is languishing, according to data reported this week as part of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report.Suicidal ideation is up among young people since last year, with as many as one in four people ages 18 through 24 having seriously considered suicide in the 30 days preceding the survey, according to the report, in which researchers surveyed 5,412 adults in the US between June 24 and 30. In the general US population, the CDC reported that 11% of adults surveyed had seriously considered suicide in the past 30 days before they completed the survey. Among those identifying as Black or Hispanic, the numbers were worse: 19% of Hispanics reported suicidal ideation and 15% of Blacks reported suicidal thoughts.Read MoreThe results reflect a nation increasingly on edge. The number of Americans reporting anxiety symptoms is three times the number at this same time last year, the CDC said.The pandemic is a new type of challenge\"Previous events have had a start, middle, an end,\" said Vaile Wright, senior director of health care innovation for the American Psychological Association. \"People can't disconnect from this.\"Unlike events such as 9/11 or hurricanes, the coronavirus pandemic isn't just something people watch on the news, limited to a specific time and place. It's everywhere, and it doesn't appear to have an end date.\"Nobody is immune to the stress of the pandemic,\" Wright said. Add on the pressures of the economy, the increased scrutiny on racial injustice and the looming specter of the presidential election, and it's hard for many to feel like things might turn out OK.The emotional burden is falling more heavily on those who reported having been treated recently for mental or emotional issues, the CDC report stated. In particular, the stress is disproportionately falling on the young.\"We're consistently hearing that young people are struggling and having a tough time,\" she said.There are ways to seek helpOn an individual level, Wright noted that the main pillars of psychological health include eating healthy, staying active, getting enough sleep and maintaining social connections.\"Oftentimes when we're in stress, it's hard to come up with a game plan,\" she said. \"Friends and family play that role.\"But figuring out healthy ways to socialize virtually can require being intentional. Passive thumbing through social media or \"doom scrolling\" doesn't constitute meaningful or supportive social interaction, Wright said. If you're on social media it's better to try to directly engage with or respond to others, she said. In particular, if someone you know or love stops engaging, that can be a sign that it's time to reach out.\"You can say things like 'I'm worried about you,' and ask if they're eating, sleeping and taking care of themselves,\" Wright said.You can encourage them to seek professional help from a therapist or counselor. That process is actually now a little easier during the pandemic, Wright explained, citing APA data that 75% of mental health providers have switched over to telehealth.\"Providers are available, and we know teletherapy to be effective,\" she said.The National Action Alliance for Suicide Prevention recommends that those needing emotional support related to Covid-19 should call the Disaster Distress Helpline (800-985-5990), or text TalkWithUs to 66746. And if you're experiencing a suicidal crisis, you can call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 800-273-8255 or text the Crisis Text line by texting HOME to 741741 to get help.Even if you're not in crisis, it's crucial to find ways, albeit often virtually or physically distanced, Wright said, to maintain bonds with others and do what we can to support each other before someone enters into a crisis mode.Many were doing that well in the spring as the nation entered into the pandemic, she felt. And the nation's mental health now requires us to recall that same spirit.\"As a community, we need to collectively re-amp up,\" Wright said.",

        "body": "(CNN)What if someone told you there was a magic potion by which you could prevent disease, improve your intellect, reduce your stress and be nicer to your family while you're all cooped up together during the pandemic?\n\nIt sounds too good to be true, as if solving those problems would really require dietary supplements, workout programs, diets, meditation and a separate room to cry alone. It turns out that sleep, according to numerous studies, is the answer. It's the preventive medicine for conditions related to our physical, mental and emotional health. And despite how important sleep is, it can be difficult to make it a priority. \"During a pandemic such as Covid-19, there's a potential to induce or exacerbate many sleep issues,\" Dr. Matthew Schmitt, a doctor of sleep medicine at Piedmont Healthcare in Georgia, told CNN. \"A lack of quality sleep not only affects how we feel during the daytime, but can also impair our immune system function, which is vital in protecting us from common viral illnesses.\" Read MoreSubscribe to CNN's Sleep, But Better Newsletter: Want the best sleep of your life? Sign up for our newsletter series for helpful hints to achieve better sleep.A sleep routine is just one of the behaviors that is part of sleep hygiene, a buffet of efforts needed to sleep well that include eating healthy meals at regular times and not drinking too much coffee, said Dr. Meir Kryger, a professor of pulmonary medicine and a clinical professor of nursing at Yale School of Medicine in Connecticut. \"All of these things are really interconnected in terms of their function. All of them are connected to the body clock,\" Kryger said. \"The body is like an orchestra where there's an orchestra leader that's sort of the main timer, but everybody else is playing it together and they're optimizing what they are doing.\" Once you've developed your sleep routine, here are 10 benefits you could gain from the regimen. 1. Helps your body heal and repair itselfOur nightly shut-eye is our bodies' time for healing and repairing itself from performing its taxing daily functions. \"Imagine you're a car or something that's running for 16 hours during the day,\" Kryger said. \"You're going to have to do stuff to get back to normal. You just can't keep on running.\" During sleep is when we produce most of our growth hormone that ultimately results in bone growth. Our tissues rest, relaxing our muscles and reducing inflammation. And each cell and organ have their own clock that \"plays a really important role in maximizing or optimizing how our body works,\" Kryger added. 2. Lowers risk for diseaseSleep on its own is a protective factor against disease.When people get too much or too little sleep, \"there appears to be an increased risk of deaths ... and other diseases raising their ugly heads,\" Kryger said, such as heart problems and diabetes. The healing period during sleep also factors in, as it allows cells that would cause disease to repair themselves. 3. Improves cognitive functionSleep feeds our creativity and cognitive function, which describes our mental abilities to learn, think, reason, remember, problem solve, make decisions and pay attention. \"As you sleep, memories are reactivated, connections between brain cells are strengthened, and information is transferred from short- to long-term,\" said a National Sleep Foundation article on the subject. \"Without enough quality sleep, we become forgetful.\" 4. Reduces stressSlumber of great quantity and quality can enhance your mood and also encourage the brain's ability to regulate emotional responses to both neutral and emotional events. 5. Helps maintain a healthy weightGetting your beauty sleep can help you to maintain a healthy weight or increase your chances of losing excess fat. Two hormones control our urge to eat: leptin and ghrelin. Leptin tells us that we're full, while ghrelin communicates hunger. When we don't sleep enough, both hormones veer in the wrong direction, Kryger said -- ghrelin spikes while leptin declines, resulting in an increase in hunger and the potential to overeat and gain weight. Sleep helps our bodies to maintain normal levels of the stress hormone cortisol as well, which determines how we hang on to excess fat. 6. Bolsters your immune systemKryger has seen the immune systems of patients with sleep disorders fail to normally function. Sleep helps our bodies to produce and release cytokines, a type of protein that helps create an immune response by targeting infection and inflammation. Additionally, \"research done actually years ago showed that when people are sleep deprived, they do not have as vigorous a response to vaccination,\" Kryger added.\"As we're thinking about vaccination that's being developed\" for Covid-19, that kind of research is going to be important.7. May improve your social lifeThe emotional benefits of sleep can transfer over into your social life. \"Just imagine you don't sleep enough and you're cranky,\" Kryger said. \"Who's going to want to be around you? Another part of it is being cognitively sharp.\" Adequate sleep can help you to be more confident, be more easygoing and support your efforts to do your part at home, he added. 8. Supports your mental healthMental health disorders are often associated with substandard sleep and a sleep deficit can lead to depressive symptoms even if the person doesn't have the chronic disorder, Kryger said. \"Getting the right amount of sleep is really important in possibly preventing a mental illness or the appearance of a mental illness,\" he added. And in addition to the benefits for mood and stress regulation, sleeping enough \"may make the treatment of the mental illnesses more efficacious if the person sleeps enough.\" 9. Reduces pain sensitivity Extending participants' sleep time during the night or with midday naps, a 2019 study found, restored their pain sensitivity to normal levels in comparison to sleep-deprived individuals, who had a lower threshold for pain. How this happens would have to be in the realm of perception, Kryger said, which ultimately traces back to the brain. \"The brain is where sleep is,\" he explained. 10. Increases your likelihood for overall successSince sleep can improve our health on all fronts, it consequently can help us be the best versions of ourselves. Healthy cognitive functioning, emotional regulation, coping and social life are all foundational to pursuing and achieving our goals and overall well-being.",

        "body": "5 lessons from the pandemic to tackle the climate crisis\n\nBy Bill Weir, CNN Chief Climate Correspondent\n\nUpdated 5:36 PM ET, Fri August 7, 2020\n\nChat with us in Facebook Messenger. Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds.\n\nWatch the CNN Special Report \"The Road to Change: America's Climate Crisis,\" Saturday, August 8 at 10 p.m. ET, to see how climate change is transforming life across the US.\n\n(CNN)Our enemies seem so tiny.\n\nOne is a virus unleashed from the wilderness, likely by people with mouths to feed and spread by others with planes to catch. The second enemy is a molecule of heat-trapping gas -- methane and CO2 -- unleashed by people with mouths to feed and planes to catch.But rising body counts and shattered economies prove that some of the smallest ingredients found in nature can explode into global emergencies thanks to human nature. In the wars against coronavirus and the climate crisis, we have met the enemy and the enemy is us. Such is is the sentiment of virologists and climatologists alike as they point out how much the pandemic can teach us about the fight for the survival of life on Earth. Read More1. Science denial can be deadlyThe danger of ignoring science is the top lesson from Michael Mann, director of Penn State's Earth System Science Center. \"By rejecting what the leading health scientists were telling us, the current administration's policies of inaction on Covid-19 have needlessly already cost us more than 100,000 lives,\" he said.As the co-author of the famous \"hockey stick graph,\" Mann was among the first to confirm how levels of heat-trapping pollution have jumped with the burning of fossil fuels. As a result, he's endured years of accusations, lawsuits and death threats -- even as his work was repeatedly confirmed by other scientists. He sees a kindred spirit in Dr. Anthony Fauci, now facing similar attacks for simply speaking scientific truth to power. \"If there is a silver lining, it is that the failure of the current administration to respond meaningfully to the pandemic lays bare the deadliness of ideologically motivated science denial,\" Mann said. \"This applies to the even greater crisis of human-caused climate change and the need to treat it as the emergency it is.\"2. The search for a cure is global but your chances of survival are localIn March, a group of governors joined a White House conference call, desperate for federal help in finding ventilators and PPE for their overflowing hospital ICUs. \"Try getting it yourselves,\" Donald Trump replied. Those words not only squandered the unique power of the presidency to focus the nation's makers on a single mission, they also created the kind of frantic bidding wars between American states that can lead to corruption and waste. Suddenly, a grandmother's life depended on the bargaining skills of a mayor or community health administrator. The same dynamic is bound to play out as seas rise, mountains burn and economies shift. So until a vaccine -- or a decarbonized economy -- is discovered, the wisdom of neighbors, mayors and Main Streets could mean the difference between life and death. 3. Individual behavior saves lives but can't fix the problemSocial distancing and mask-wearing have taught us that the personal decision can save -- or cost -- human lives. But to fully eradicate Covid-19 on a planet of over 7 billion, your mask and clean hands won't cut it. Likewise, shrinking your own carbon footprint is vital -- and healthy -- but humanity won't zero out carbon OR cure Covid-19 without massive efforts by every sector of every society around the world. \"Both individual behavior change and systemic change are critical to addressing a global crisis,\" Mann said. \"We need dramatic systemic changes in the form of polices that will help us decarbonize our economy quickly.\"4. Humanity is capable of fast, sweeping changesBillions of people have changed the way they live so far this year. But changes only matter if they last.\"Temporarily, the pandemic reduced the emissions of the world's biggest carbon polluters by 20-25% in just a few weeks.\" says Katharine Hayhoe, a climate scientist at Texas Tech. During the global lockdown, city-dwellers marveled at the cleaner air, brighter stars and walkable streets but even as the world reopens and pollution-spewing industries quickly undo all positive gains, Hayhoe points out that if humanity can repeat the feat with more wisdom and strategy than tragedy and fear, fast action is possible. \"I find this incredibly hopeful because if we made those changes permanent we'd be halfway to the Paris Climate Accords target in just four weeks.\" 5. In the age of \"threat multipliers,\" the health of your body depends on the health of the planet now more than ever\"I often feel as I am putting a Band-Aid on a bullet wound,\" Dr. Renee Salas testified before Congress this week as the emergency room physician and fellow at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health described a surge of Covid-19 and heat stroke patients at the same time. \"I may be able to improve their symptoms but then I send them back out my doors without having gone upstream to the root of the problem. Climate change is increasingly threatening the tools that I need to do my job as extreme heat and climate-intensified weather threaten our health care infrastructure, power, and supply chains.\"She described an equipment shortage in her Boston hospital triggered by Hurricane Maria, 1,700 miles away in Puerto Rico. \"We were forced to ration IV fluids and give the patients who didn't meet the severity criteria a bottle of Gatorade.\" While a new study links an explosion of novel disease with an increase in deforestation, Jonathan Foley hopes the pandemic helps people draw a direct line between forests and hospitals. \"That's happening because we're breaking down natural ecosystems,\" the climate scientist and director of Project Drawdown said. \"Otherwise we keep viruses in check and in the wild. But when we go in and tear down rainforest, we're mixing viruses and people for the first time in history and look what happens. I hope what we learned is that these 'one-off events' aren't one-off at all. They're part of a larger pattern.\"",

Our fact-checkers noted that the event started off with a parade of dishonesty, presenting a misleading portrait of Donald Trump's presidency. Many speakers warned of socialist doom and rampant violence if Trump were not reelected, despite the President and his campaign advisers promising a more optimistic convention than what they claimed Democrats staged last week. Still, there were some aspirational moments, like the speeches from former US Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley and Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina. Here are the hits and misses from CNN's Chris Cillizza, and four takeaways from the first night.Read More2. Wisconsin shootingProtesters in Kenosha, Wisconsin, took to the streets to vent their anger over the shooting of Jacob Blake by police. Buildings and cars were set on fire last night. Blake, a 29-year-old Black father, was shot in the back multiple times by an officer on Sunday as he tried to enter an SUV. Blake's three young children were in the car when he was shot, the attorney representing his family said. Blake was still in intensive care late yesterday, the lawyer said. Two Wisconsin police officers have been put on administrative leave as authorities investigate. The shooting comes as protesters continue to decry police violence on US streets after the deaths of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor.3. CoronavirusSome good news: The average number of new cases and daily deaths from Covid-19 are on the decline, signaling that the virus' surge throughout the US is waning. But now isn't the time to ease up on precautionary measures, experts say. Forecasts for what the fall and winter in the US could look like are grim, and officials warn of some troubling signs across the heartland. Kansas' governor said the state was reporting at least one Covid-19 case in every county, while Kentucky's governor said the state reported more deaths from the virus last week than any other week since the pandemic began. The US has recorded more than 5.7 million infections and more than 177,000 deaths.4. Jerry Falwell Jr.Embattled evangelical leader Jerry Falwell Jr. agreed to resign as Liberty University's president yesterday but withdrew his resignation when news reports about the decision emerged, the Christian university founded by his late father said. The conversations about his fate followed a series of public controversies about Falwell Jr.'s behavior, including an affair a Miami man said he had with Falwell Jr.'s wife that went on for eight years. Falwell Jr. acknowledged the affair in a statement to CNN. The revelation adds new depth to Falwell Jr.'s swift and remarkable fall from grace. In June, he apologized after deleting a much-criticized tweet that showed one person in black face and another in a Ku Klux Klan hood and robe.5. IndiaRescue workers in western India are hopeful they can save 19 people still trapped under the rubble of a five-story apartment building that collapsed yesterday in the state of Maharashtra. State and federal first responders are using specially trained dogs to help dig through the remains of the structure, about 90 miles south of Mumbai. Though several floors of the building had completely collapsed, officials believe it's possible survivors still remain. It's not clear what caused the building to collapse. August is monsoon season in India, when intense rains and floods wreak havoc on infrastructure, but authorities also appear to be investigating negligence.BREAKFAST BROWSEA Black professor said campus security asked her to prove she lived in her own houseSanta Clara University is launching an investigation.Internet searches for anxiety symptoms spiked early in the pandemicWho among us?KFC is suspending its 'finger lickin' good' slogan over the coronavirusIt's probably for the best.Earth's core is younger than previously believed, new research suggestsA mere 1 billion to 1.3 billion years old!NASA is on the hunt for rogue planetsAnd the agency's new space telescope could help identify hundreds of them.TODAY'S NUMBER1.1 millionThe number of acres that have been scorched by California's wildfires since August 15.

Police violenceA 17-year-old from Illinois has been arrested and charged with homicide in a fatal shooting that left two dead during protests Tuesday night in Kenosha, Wisconsin. The police chief there said the teen \"was involved in the use of firearms to resolve whatever conflict was in place.\" Nationwide, the unrest stemming from the police shooting of a Black father, Jacob Blake, over the weekend has crystallized into serious action. Several Milwaukee pro sports teams chose to sit out their games last night, which led to a cascade of paused events nationwide. All in all, a slate of NBA games, several MLB games, plus MLS games and the Western & Southern Open tennis event were canceled or postponed as teams and major athletes, like Lebron James, spoke out against the recent spate of police violence.Read More2. Hurricane Laura A monster Hurricane Laura made landfall overnight in southwestern Louisiana, the region's strongest storm in over a century. It's a rapidly changing situation, but Laura has weakened to Category 3, passing over Lake Charles as it treks inland. It's expected to weaken more as the day goes on, but the danger is far from over. Parts of the region are still expected to experience deadly storm surges of up to 15 feet, which the National Hurricane Center warned is \"unsurvivable.\" Thousands of people along the Gulf Coast have been evacuated, and some 285,000 customers have no power in Louisiana and Texas. In areas already thrashed by the storm, tidal surges may prevent officials from assessing the damage right away. Check here for updates. Check your local forecast here>>> 3. Republican National Convention Vice President Mike Pence and Kellyanne Conway were among the headlining speakers on the third night of the RNC. As reactions to the events in Kenosha unfurled across the sports world, Pence used his VP nomination acceptance speech to make a familiar call for \"law and order.\" He criticized Joe Biden for acknowledging systemic racism in America's police departments and said Biden's policies would lead to \"unsafe streets and violence.\" The RNC has been marked with controversy, with several speakers criticized for their social media comments and past behavior, raising questions about how the RNC vetted its guests. Then, there's the ongoing issue of sitting officials engaging in partisan politics -- actions forbidden by the Hatch Act. Criticism or no, President Trump is scheduled to formally accept his party's nomination tonight from the White House lawn.4. Coronavirus The CDC announced it no longer recommends that people exposed to the coronavirus should be tested if they don't have symptoms. The sudden change caused confusion and even pushback from some leaders, and now a health official says the agency was pressured by the Trump administration to make the changes. Moreover, Dr. Anthony Fauci, arguable the most visible member of the White House's coronavirus task force, told CNN's Dr. Sanjay Gupta he was literally in surgery for a minor procedure when the decision was made. There have now been more than 24 million confirmed coronavirus cases around the world, with more than 5.8 million in the United States. 5. New Zealand A far-right terrorist who killed 51 Muslim worshipers in New Zealand's worst mass shooting in modern history has been sentenced to life in prison without parole. Brenton Tarrant, 29, was sentenced after pleading guilty to the murders after he opened fire in two Christchurch mosques last year. The sentencing concluded a harrowing, four-day hearing in which 91 survivors and relatives of victims described the pain Tarrant had inflicted on the Muslim community. The courtroom was charged with emotion as the judge read the name of every victim, the injured and the dead, telling Tarrant about the lives he destroyed or cut short. \"You showed no mercy. It was brutal and beyond callous -- your actions were inhumane,\" he said.BREAKFAST BROWSEElon Musk is now the fourth-richest person in the world, and he's about to get richerYeah, you have to be pretty rich to pull off blasting a car into space.

        "body": "Chat with us in Facebook Messenger. Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds.\n\n(CNN)Before deciding on whether to hold the 80th annual motorcycle rally in Sturgis, South Dakota, the local city council turned to its residents to get their take.\n\n\"There was a significant amount of discussion that the council had with residents, businesses and state health officials as well as local health officials,\" Daniel Ainslie, the city manager, told CNN Sunday. The city, home to fewer than 7,000, sent a survey to all households asking if they wanted the rally to proceed on its scheduled date. The massive event usually brings in crowds of about 500,000 over 10 days of drag races, contests and concerts. On its 75th anniversary, nearly three quarters of a million people showed. A little more than 60% of people in the city voted against holding the event this week. But the city council approved it anyway.The decision, Ainslie says, was all about being able to prepare for the crowds. Read More\"There are people throughout America who have been locked up for months and months,\" he said. \"So we kept hearing from people saying it doesn't matter, they are coming to Sturgis. So with that, ultimately the council decided that it was really vital for the community to be prepared for the additional people that we're going to end up having.\"The crowds began pouring in last week and are expected to come from all corners of the country -- many arriving from coronavirus hotspots like Florida, Texas and other parts of the US that have seen a rise in cases in recent weeks. South Dakota has reported about 9,605 cases. In Meade County, where Sturgis is located, there have been about 94 reported infections. \"What's important for people to understand is in a very small community and rural western South Dakota, you cannot have tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of people come without preparations, including garbage and sanitation and additional law enforcement and emergency medical personnel,\" he said. \"That was really the thing that drove the council to decide that we had to be prepared for the number of people that came.\"The events held in the city will be limited this year, city officials told CNN, and many that usually drew crowds have been canceled. In addition, the city canceled advertising for the days-long event and \"tried to downplay the rally as much as possible,\" Ainslie said. \"We're telling people when they come here, go on rides throughout the hills, because when you're on your motorcycle driving through the hills, you're absolutely socially distant.\"'Super spreader events are real'The rally has always been a point of contention among the city's residents but this year there's an added concern: a powerful virus that's still running unabated across many US communities. Some experts fear the event -- and the afterhours gatherings in restaurants and bars that have no legally enforced capacity limits -- could lead to a spread of coronavirus not just in the South Dakota community but other parts of the country as tourists return home. \"Those super spreader events are real,\" said Dr. Megan Ranney, an emergency physician at Lifespan Health System and associate professor at Brown University.\"We have reports from across the country of one person infecting 90 or 100 (people) or even more. And so if you have a few of those infections that start at Sturgis, people go back home and even have the potential to spread in their own communities.\"And that, she said, may be happening without people knowing, as symptoms can take anywhere between several days to two weeks to show up. \"This has the potential to seed new hotspots literally across the country,\" she said.The positive thing, Ranney added, is that many events will be taking place outside. But not all of them. \"Those bars and those afterhours events are what do make me and other public health officials quite nervous.\"",

Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds.\n\n(CNN)The school year is starting on a somber note for the Gayle family.\n\nLeona Gayle, 3, is getting ready for her first day of pre-kindergarten, a milestone that her mother -- a fourth grade special education teacher -- was supposed to be there for.But in April, Gabrielle Gayle died from coronavirus at the age of 34, leaving Leona and her family in Rosedale, New York, shocked and devastated. Gabrielle died just three days after losing her baby, who was to be named Gabriel. Now, as the school year begins for many nationwide, the Gayle family can't help but think about Gabrielle, an educator who husband Leon Gayle described as \"very caring and loving.\"\"My daughter asked every day...about when mommy was coming home,\" Leon Gayle, 34, told CNN. \"And every day we had to tell her that she was in the hospital, that she's getting better. And that hopefully, you know, she'll be home soon...the day she died, I had to tell her that her mommy wasn't coming home again.\"Read MoreGabrielle, who was six months pregnant, was among four people -- including Leon -- in their seven-person household to contract the virus. But she was the only one who died.Life before the pandemic Gabrielle, whose nickname was \"Gabby\" or \"Bre,\" graduated from Utica College, where she double majored in special education and general education, Leon Gayle said. Leon said he and Gabrielle met online over a decade ago, in October of 2009. They got married in 2014, and had their daughter Leona -- named after her father Leon, and the singer Leona Lewis -- in 2016. The two were supposed to celebrate their sixth wedding anniversary on July 19th. While teaching in New York at Merrick Academy -- Queens Public Charter School in Laurelton, Gabrielle also served as a softball coach. She was pursuing her doctorate degree in educational leadership from Grand Canyon University. The United Federation of Teachers (UFT), a labor union that represents many teachers in New York City public schools, posted an obituary for Gabrielle on its website, where colleagues are quoted describing the late teacher as someone with a \"huge heart, amazing energy and a passion for education.\" \"She was full of life, love and laughter,\" Charles Watterson, her former co-teacher, told UFT. \"The outpouring of love and support during her loss and the loss of her unborn son is a testament to the beautiful person she really was.\" Covid hit the family hard in MarchGabrielle, Leon and Leona lived with Gabrielle's mom, Beverly Woods, her brothers -- John Jacobs and Alexander Woods -- and Alexander's fianc\u00e9, Jordan.Leon said in early March, he began having difficulty breathing, and experienced nausea, chills, and a cough. His symptoms came before Gabrielle's -- but it didn't take long for Beverly Woods and John Jacobs, who later also contracted Covid, to feel sick. Alexander Woods, who had some symptoms, and Jordan, did not get tested.Initially, Gabrielle's symptoms were more mild -- she had shortness of breath, but not a fever -- so urgent care did not admit her, Leon said. But pregnant women may be at an increased risk for severe illness from Covid-19 compared with women who are not expecting, according to a recent report from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Also, Gabrielle was Black, and a recent report released by the CDC shows how the coronavirus has been especially devastating to certain communities. Black people, Hispanics and those with underlying conditions -- especially men and elderly people -- faced higher risks from Covid-19. On March 28, a determined Gabrielle drove to the hospital to make sure she and her baby were OK. A few days later, she was put on a ventilator, and doctors confirmed she had Covid-19. Eventually, her kidneys started to fail and she was put on dialysis, Leon said.The hospital could only prioritize baby Gabriel or Gabrielle, according to Leon. They asked him if he wanted to deliver the baby, since the baby's oxygen was so low -- Leon said no. \"(The hospital) had mentioned that if we did the delivery, there's a good chance that Gabby may not make it through the delivery, she might lose too much blood and die,\" Leon said. \"So we always chose not to do the delivery.\"On the fourth week of Gabrielle being in the hospital, baby Gabriel died. Shortly after losing her baby, Leon said Gabrielle developed a fungus in her blood -- and her liver failed. Just three days after her baby passed, Gabrielle died on April 25. Months of mourningMonths later, Leon said he and the rest of the family have recovered from the virus. He and his mother-in-law have taken the antibody test, and the results have come back positive for antibodies. John has not taken an antibody test that Leon knows of.Leona was excited to be a big sister, Leon said. His daughter rubbed her mother's stomach, and talked to baby Gabriel.When she first saw her mother on a ventilator, she cried, Leon said. And while Gabrielle was in the hospital, their daughter often also looked outside the door to see if her mother's car was there. \"Leona still misses her mommy and she will ask periodically for her,\" Leon said. \"(And) I have to reexplain everything again.\"",

        "body": "Chat with us in Facebook Messenger. Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds.\n\nLos Angeles (CNN)Most schools in California will not be reopening for in-person education this month -- but one superintendent in the Los Angeles area has come up with a plan to welcome some students back to class. And it doesn't involve their teachers.\n\nOn August 19, when Glendale Unified School District kicks off the academic year, 20 of the district's elementary schools will open some empty classrooms for remote learning.But instead of the traditional 24 students per classroom, there will be no more than 12. School officials are calling the group a \"technology pod,\" which will be supervised by a single substitute teacher or district staffer. The staffers won't be teaching the students -- they will instead be present to offer computer technical assistance, monitor students' mask use, enforce social distancing and keep students focused on their work.Superintendent Vivian Ekchian said she came up with the idea after noticing that many young children of essential workers didn't have proper childcare when schools were forced to pivot to remote learning in March due to the Covid-19 pandemic.Read More\"We learned very early and during the pandemic that our parents who are essential workers, parents who could not work from home or parents who had multiple kids, had a dire need for childcare,\" Ekchian told CNN. \"And the reality was when we changed to remote learning, there wasn't a place for them to drop off their kids. So this at the elementary level is really an opportunity for childcare, for our parents who can't stay home with their kids and need a safe place where their students can continue to learn while they're away working or looking for a job.\"This week, about 1,000 of the 13,000 grade schoolers in the district will head to classrooms, she said.How the idea came to lifeGlendale is in Los Angeles County, where the Department of Public Health said earlier this month that it would not consider any applications for waivers enabling elementary schools to reopen, citing high local Covid-19 case rates.\"We know that to many families, this is a disappointing announcement, but it's based on the existing science and data that is guiding all of our decision-making,\" Los Angeles County Department of Public Health said in a news release on August 4. \"We need to ensure the health and safety of our children, school teachers and staff and all of their families.\"The Los Angeles Unified School District and Glendale Unified School District must comply with LA County rules. However, because there is no formal learning going on in the classrooms, the Glendale Unified School District is merely providing childcare, which is permitted by the county.Ekchian, who has lived in Glendale for 20 years, feels it's her duty to give the community what it needs most during this public health crisis. \"I can't be in a hospital helping a patient,\" she told CNN, \"but I can be at a school site helping a student. And that is my definition of being an essential worker in this capacity.\"More than half -- 52% -- of students at Glendale Unified get free or subsidized meals, she said.\"So we have the trauma of Covid added to everything else that already existed in many of our homes,\" Ekchian said. \"And it's our responsibility as public servants to help.\"In addition, many of the students come from homes where parents speak one of 50 different languages. Ekchian, who was tapped as superintendent in May 2019, became the first woman and the first Armenian American to head the district, which has the nation's largest population of Armenians. \"All students don't have parents who speak English at home,\" Ekchian said, and \"may not have parents who are ready to help them with the homework or stay on task. We don't want the learning gap to be widened over time.\"What the classrooms will look likeWhen Glendale students return this week, schools -- and the classrooms themselves -- will look different than they used to.According to Ekchian, desks will be at least 6 feet apart. Drinking fountains have been turned into hand washing stations. Children will be allowed recess and playtime. But each child will have their own toys and equipment and keep their distance. Pods will not intermingle, and siblings will be in the same pod. Breakfast and lunch will be brought to the door and distributed by the supervisor. Students will have a temperature check each morning and answer health questions before entering the school. And if a child does have Covid-19? \"If we felt that it's in the best interest of the students and adults to shut down for a period of time ... then that's what we would do, but this would not happen in isolation,\" she said.The plan includes contact tracing, along with help with testing and medical consultations. Parents are not being asked to limit their exposure to participate. \"But with it comes a level of expectation that the guidelines are followed so everyone is safe,\" Ekchian said. Many students don't have access to computers and WiFi, so the district distributed a total of 18,000 devices, Ekchian said. Each child will have one at home and one at school to limit cross contamination. Some of the funding came from the CARES Act. A successful pilot program paved the wayAs of Tuesday, the coronavirus has infected more than 5.4 million people and killed over 170,000 nationwide, according to Johns Hopkins University data.The start of the school year has led to educators and parents nationwide clashing over starting in-person classes, and some schools that have reopened have seen new cases. More than 2,000 students, teachers and staff were placed under quarantine in the few reopened districts in several states, according to a CNN tally of reported cases last week.The White House last week also released eight new recommendations for schools, including ensuring students and staff \"understand the symptoms of Covid-19\" and requiring \"all students, teachers and staff to self-assess their health every morning before coming to school.\"President Donald Trump said that children are \"virtually immune,\" and Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos said last month kids are \"stoppers\" of Covid-19. But recent studies show otherwise.Over the last four weeks, there has been a 90% increase in the number of Covid-19 cases among children in the United States, according to a recent analysis by the American Academy of Pediatrics and the Children's Hospital AssociationStill, Ekchian is hopeful about the upcoming school year -- especially after the success of the district's summer pilot program. There were no reported cases of Covid-19 during that time, she said. In new guidance released last week, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) advised face coverings can be worn safely by children over the age of 2, except for rare exceptions. Ekchian said after the pilot program, she isn't concerned about students not wearing masks. \"We did not have a challenge at all,\" she said regarding the enforcement of mask-wearing. \"Our students understood from the youngest to the upper elementary, these are the rules of engagement. This is the new normal.\"The superintendent said she has already been contacted by school nationwide about the program.\"I take full responsibility for it, which means if it's successful we all made it happen,\" she said. \"If it requires changes, it's only my fault.\"\n\nCNN's Faith Karimi, Steve Almasy, Dakin Andone, Holly Yan and Madeline Holcombe contributed to this report.",

An anonymous tipster quickly told school officials about the student's status, Dawn Jones, director of communications and community relations for Moore Public Schools, told CNN. Jones said school officials were later told that because the student was asymptomatic, the student assumed their quarantine should only last five days, though the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends asymptomatic patients quarantine for 10 days. Jones did not say when the student tested positive.The student's parent told school officials they had misunderstood the information they received from physicians, Jones said. The student has reentered quarantine and once confirmed to have no symptoms at the end of quarantine, they can return to school, she said. Read MoreNo staff were exposed to the student with coronavirus, Jones said. And without the school's social distancing guidelines, many more of Westmoore High's 2,500 students could have been exposed. Moore Public Schools gave its 25,000 students the option to enroll in distance learning for the semester, attend classes in-person or attend classes both in-person and online. Masks are required for high school students while at school and on school buses, and classrooms and bathrooms are cleaned daily. Schools across the country that have reopened have found themselves in similar situations with coronavirus-positive students. A number of students were diagnosed with coronavirus after the first day of school in several states, including Mississippi and Georgia. A child in Indiana was sent to school before their coronavirus test results returned.",

        "body": "(CNN)A person who spent hours at a bar during the Sturgis motorcycle rally in South Dakota last week has tested positive for Covid-19, state health officials said Tuesday.\n\nThe potential exposure came during the city's 80th annual Sturgis motorcycle rally August 7-16.Health experts were concerned the mass gathering could be a \"super-spreader\" event, as many attendees travel from all over the country -- including coronavirus hotspots -- and could bring infections back home when they return.The bar-goer visited One-Eyed Jack's Saloon in Sturgis on August 11 from noon to 5:30 p.m. while able to transmit the virus to others, health officials said. Anyone who visited the saloon during that period should monitor for symptoms for 14 days after the visit.South Dakota Department of Transportation officials tracked over 462,000 vehicles entering Sturgis during the rally, according to CNN affiliate KDLT/KSFY. That total is a 7.5% decline from the previous year but still represents one of the largest gatherings since the coronavirus pandemic began.Read MoreMany of those gathered did not wear masks or keep distance from others, most notably at a concert for the rock band Smash Mouth.The potential exposure at the Sturgis bar is one of several Covid-19 cases connected to bars and concerts over the past few weeks in South Dakota. Officials have also announced possible exposures at a Big and Rich concert at the Sioux Empire Fair in Sioux Falls, a gentleman's club in Sioux Falls, a bar in Hill City and a nightclub in Brookings.A little more than 60% of people in the city voted against holding the event. But city officials said they felt they wouldn't have been able to stop the crowds from coming in and instead opted to prepare for the event as best they could.\"There are people throughout America who have been locked up for months and months,\" Daniel Ainslie, the city manager, told CNN last week. \"So we kept hearing from people saying it doesn't matter, they are coming to Sturgis. So with that, ultimately the council decided that it was really vital for the community to be prepared for the additional people that we're going to end up having.\"South Dakota is one of 12 US states that have seen an increase in new cases this past week compared to the week prior, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. The state's seven-day average of new daily cases has increased since last July and topped 100 new daily cases on Tuesday.Adjusted for population, South Dakota's seven-day moving average of new cases is about in the middle of all US states, nestled between North Carolina and Arizona.\n\nCNN's Christina Maxouris contributed to this report.",

Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds.\n\n(CNN)The coronavirus pandemic might have a silver lining.\n\nWith fewer in-person medical appointments and more virtual ones, patients are monitoring their health at home and catching potentially deadly signs and symptoms earlier, spurring a movement to get more monitoring devices into patients' hands. \"Covid has lit a fire under us,\" said Dr. Michael Maniaci, who leads the Advanced Care at Home program at the Mayo Clinic's campus in Florida. It's one of several at-home programs gaining momentum because of the pandemic. \"This opens the potential to re-imagine care in entirely new ways,\" said Dr. Peter Pronovost, who started an at-home monitoring program for coronavirus patients in Cleveland. \"You can make a hospital at home.\" Read MoreMom detects her own preeclampsia In April, because of Covid-19, Whitney Williams started having fewer in-person appointments with her obstetrician. So the pharmacist from Lexington, Kentucky, decided to start checking her blood pressure daily at home. One day her blood pressure was high, and Williams called her doctor, who asked her to come into the office. It turns out she had developed preeclampsia, a disorder that can be deadly for mother and baby. High blood pressure is a signature symptom, and because Williams caught hers in time, she and her baby are fine after long hospitalizations. \"If I hadn't been checking my blood pressure at home and reporting it to my doctor, who knows if I would have made it to the hospital in time?\" Williams wrote in a post on BabyCenter. In April, the Preeclampsia Foundation started the Cuff Kit program, so far delivering more than 2,500 blood pressure cuffs to pregnant women in seven states. Eleni Tsigas, CEO of the foundation, noted that even if doctors return to regular in-person appointments, the cuffs could catch preeclampsia, which comes on suddenly, between visits. Plus, women can check their blood pressure in the weeks following birth, when postpartum preeclampsia can strike and new moms aren't having frequent doctor's appointments. The program had been in the works for months, but the pandemic accelerated its launch, Tsigas said. \"There really is a silver lining to Covid-19,\" she said. A watch-like device helps Covid patients recover at homeWhen the pandemic began, Dr. Peter Pronovost, chief clinical transformation officer at University Hospitals in Cleveland, was worried about Covid-19 patients recovering at home, away from careful monitoring. So his hospital sent patients a device that looks like a smart watch, which monitors oxygen levels, pulse, and respiratory rate. The data is electronically monitored by a team of nurses. Since March, Pronovost's team has distributed more than 1,000 devices to Ohio patients with confirmed or suspected Covid-19. The device has already saved the lives of patients like Leonard Frazier, a janitor at a recreation center in Chardon, Ohio. In March, he was at home with coronavirus when his device detected that his oxygen levels were dropping and his blood pressure was spiking. Nurses called him and told him to come the emergency room immediately. After a week in the hospital, Frazier recovered and was discharged. \"Home monitoring opens up a whole new pipeline for better diagnostics and makes these visible so we can connect people to care,\" Pronovost said. \"With the ability to monitor patients' vital signs at home, we can replicate vital signs that are routinely done at the hospital for very low cost at home.\" Pronovost said it's been \"striking\" how the pandemic has created \"'the fierce urgency of now,' as Martin Luther King said. We had to innovate.\" Mayo Clinic starts program with \"a lot of Bluetooth devices\" Doctors at the Mayo Clinic started thinking about an at-home monitoring program a year ago, but only last month, with the pressure of Covid-19 at their heels, did the program actually launch. Now patients are home, loaded up with devices connected by Bluetooth to Mayo nursing stations. The devices check on patients' heart rate, blood pressure, and oxygen rates. A Bluetooth scale sends in their weight. Next Mayo hopes to use a virtual stethoscope -- patients would place it on their heart and a doctor would listen - and an otoscope, which patients would use to show doctors the inside of their ears and mouths. \"In order to run a hospital at home, you need a lot of Bluetooth devices to turn a bedroom into a hospital room,\" said Maniaci, who runs the at home monitoring program at the Mayo Clinic in Florida. So far, eleven patients in Florida and Wisconsin, with pneumonia, kidney failure, and other diagnoses, are getting care through the program. Mayo hopes to have 60-80 patients in the program by the end of the year, and 600-800 patients by the end of 2021, all monitored by doctors at Mayo campuses in Minnesota, Florida, and Arizona. \"The justification for this was made real by the pandemic,\" Maniaci said. \"Covid has opened up a realm of virtual medicine that was barely used before.\" Helping patients with diminished access to doctorsPronovost, the doctor at University Hospitals in Cleveland, said blood pressure cuffs for pregnant women is a perfect example of low-cost, highly effective home monitoring.\"A blood pressure cuff costs between $10 and $30, and we could significantly reduce maternal mortality and neonatal complications, because preeclampsia is a major cause of pre-term birth,\" Pronovost said. The effect could be particularly profound for Black women, who have a higher incidence of preeclampsia and have less access to prenatal care. \"Inequities in maternal mortality and neonatal mortality in non-Whites versus Whites is morally reprehensible,\" Pronovost said. \"This could be a really effective way of addressing health inequities. For all expectant moms, careful monitoring can be helpful. Williams said she'll always be grateful for her at-home blood pressure cuff. Because of her preeclampsia, and an associated disorder called HELLP Syndrome, her doctors had to deliver her baby, Emma Rose, six weeks early. Emma spent more than three weeks in the hospital. So did her mother, who suffered a ruptured liver. \"I don't know that Emma and I would be here today if I hadn't checked my blood pressure at home and known when to go into the doctor,\" she said.",

Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds.\n\n(CNN)If you ask Michelle Gutierrez, there's nothing more powerful than love and prayer -- that's why when her husband, David, who's battling coronavirus, was put on a ventilator, she knew exactly what to do.\n\nEvery day for the past two weeks, Michelle has been visiting her husband at St. Luke's hospital in Houston, Texas. Even though he's in a coma and can't hear or see her, she told CNN, she stands in the parking lot underneath his hospital room window and prays for him an hour every day.\"I can see him in my mind,\" Michelle said. \"I can put it all together when I'm praying, I can see him in that bed, and it puts a smile on my face even though he isn't where I want him to be.\" On June 25, Michelle said she tested positive for the coronavirus and David tested negative. As she fought hard to overcome it, David started developing symptoms and on July 1, she said he tested positive. As she monitored David's symptoms and oxygen levels at home, with each passing day, they got worse. On July 8, David was hospitalized. About 10 days later, Michelle said she got a call from a nurse saying he was going to be put on a ventilator because his oxygen levels had dropped to an unhealthy level.Read More\"It was one of those, 'say goodbye to your loved one because we don't know if they're going to get out of here' phone calls,\" Michelle said.\"I love you and see you later\" are the last words Michelle heard from David on July 18.When she hung up, Michelle said her first feeling was an overwhelming sense of fear. That's when she turned to prayer. \"I felt a calmness come over my body and I was able to just be OK,\" Michelle said. \"I fell asleep that night, how I don't know...but I know that it must have been God because there's no way I could have gone to sleep that night.\"This is the first time in 10 years that the couple have been apart for more than one week.Fueled by prayer to do more than write lettersBefore David was put on a ventilator, Michelle said they would swap text messages back and forth and occasionally FaceTime, even though it became increasingly difficult for David to speak -- Michelle said she'd do all the talking and David would listen.And even though he's in a coma right now, Michelle still keeps up her end of the conversation by writing letters to him several times a day. She faxes the handwritten letters over to the hospital for David's nurses to read aloud to him. \"He's going to have a lot of reading to do when he wakes up,\" she said. \"I text him in between the letters so he will maybe have days of reading to catch up on.\" \"When those nurses read those letters to him, I have faith that he can hear those words,\" she said.On July 22, four days after David was out on a ventilator, Michelle said she \"just wanted to be close to him,\" so that's when she decided to go to the hospital, even if that meant connecting with David from afar, outside his room.Michelle posted about her idea on Facebook and welcomed others to join too. \"I wish I was doing this before it (coronavirus) hit my family but it's never too late to start,\" she wrote on Facebook, \"You all are more than welcome to join in person or at home to pray.\" Over the last couple of weeks, Michelle said she's been joined by strangers, church members, nurses and friends who say they have all gained a little extra hope in their own lives because of her efforts.On Tuesday, Michelle said a nurse called her to the hospital to see David through the glass window of his room.On her walk to his room, Michelle said she couldn't contain her excitement.\"When I actually saw him in person through the glass, he looked good,\" she said. \"I was able to talk to him through the intercom and it was a short visit, but it was nice, I felt so close.\"A wedding anniversary unlike the restMichelle and David met in 2009 while she was having her car serviced. There was a language barrier between the shop owner and Michelle, so David stepped in to assist because he's fluent in Spanish. Once the pair met and exchanged contact information they began dating shortly after.Michelle said David told her several times throughout the beginning of their relationship, '\"You know you're going to be mine, you know that right?'\" After two years of dating, the couple got married. Now, their 10-year anniversary is around the corner on September 4.To celebrate, Michelle said David had plans to take her to the beach -- a plan she said she's holding him to once his health improves.For others going through similar situations with loved ones, Michelle said keeping a positive mental attitude, saturating yourself in prayer and holding onto hope are what gets her through.\"When the time is right, he's (God) going to breathe into his lungs and restore his health,\" she said. And until that happens, Michelle said she isn't going to stop showing up and praying for her husband, even if that means from a distance.",

Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds.\n\n(CNN)One of the dozens of individuals who tested positive for Covid-19 after a wedding reception in Maine has died, according to hospital officials.\n\nThe woman, who wasn't named, is linked to a Coronavirus outbreak that the Maine Centers for Disease Control is currently investigating from a large social gathering held on August 7. \"We are sorry to share that this patient passed away early [Friday] afternoon,\" Robert Peterson, CEO of Millinocket Regional Hospital, said in a statement on Friday. \"Our thoughts and sympathies are with her family as they cope with this difficult loss.\"This is the first death linked to the outbreak that stemmed from a wedding ceremony and reception held in the Millinocket area. On Thursday, officials said that there were 32 positive cases associated with the gatherings. The hospital added that this was their only inpatient admission linked to this outbreak. All other individuals who tested positive were given care instructions and told to quarantine. Tracing the outbreakRead More\"I just want to remind everyone that as our investigation continues, we keep our focus on the care and well-being of those who are ill,\" Maine CDC Director, Dr. Nirav Shah said on Thursday. \"That is, at the end of the day, what an epidemiological investigation is about. It involves helping people who are sick and helping prevent others from becoming sick.\"The wedding guests attended a reception at Big Moose Inn, according to the Maine CDC. The Big Moose Inn is a 37-acre property that includes a restaurant, cabins and campgrounds near Baxter State Park. The inn has hosted weddings since the 1970s and can accommodate 100 guests in their Fredericka's Restaurant, according to their website. Shah said they are investigating other points of connection with the group including the ceremony that was held at Tri Town Baptist Church. The Maine CDC said the wedding reception had approximately 65 guests, which is a violation of the state's requirements for large gatherings that is currently capped at 50 people for indoor events. On Thursday, the Maine CDC said they delivered an imminent health hazard citation to the owners of Big Moose Inn for this violation. \"It is an official notice from the agency that they have not aided to one or more health-related regulations,\" Shah said. \"When it was delivered the the owners they did agree to comply to all these issues they were cited for going forward.\" He added that there isn't a financial penalty associated with the citation, but there could be if there is further evidence of noncompliance.CNN reached out to Big Moose Inn for comment and did not receive a response.Seven cases among childrenOf the 32 cases, 26 are confirmed and six are probable cases, according to Maine CDC on Thursday. The median age of confirmed cases thus far is 42 years old, with a range of those who have tested positive spanning from 4 years old up to 78 years old. A total of seven cases are among children under the age of 18.Of the cases that have been detected, 87% have been individuals who are symptomatic. \"At this phase of the outbreak investigation, that is not an atypical finding,\" Shah said.Previously the agency announced that six cases were from individuals that didn't attend the event but who had close contact with reception attendees. \"What I think is really important about this situation is that it is another reminder that Covid-19 exists everywhere in Maine and it can spread really quickly when large groups of people gather,\" Shah said previously about this case. The agency is conducting contact tracing for guests, staff and people who might have had close contact with individuals with confirmed cases. They encourage anyone who attended the event and has symptoms to contact their health care provider.\n\nCNN's Laura Ly and Dave Alsup contributed to this report.",

        "body": "London (CNN)Fourteen-year-old Indiana Evans is a promising dancer from Hertfordshire, southern England, who was doing 16 hours of practice a week on top of school before the coronavirus pandemic hit.\n\nIndiana fell ill with a cough in early March, said her mother, Jane Evans. Although she didn't have any other coronavirus symptoms, her parents kept her home for two weeks in line with government guidance. She was never ill enough to be hospitalized, her mother told CNN. Nonetheless, the teenager -- who planned to audition for prestigious dance schools -- can now barely manage a trip to the supermarket. Like many others who fell ill in the early weeks of the pandemic in the UK, Indiana was never tested for the coronavirus. But her mother said doctors have diagnosed her with post-viral fatigue post-Covid. She is one of a number of children who appear still to be suffering symptoms related to the coronavirus months after first falling ill, according to accounts from their parents.Read MoreWhile awareness is gradually growing with regards to \"long Covid\" in adults, much remains unknown about any potential long-term impact in children.Parents whose children have been battling symptoms as diverse as fatigue, breathlessness, chest pains, diarrhea and \"Covid toes\" for weeks say there is little information available to help guide their recovery -- a situation all the more worrying given the imminent return to school for many.In the United States, President Donald Trump has called for schools to reopen despite concerns over the rate of community transmission in many areas. And he was censured this week for comments during a \"Fox & Friends\" interview in which he falsely claimed that children were \"almost immune\" to the virus.While Covid-19 symptoms are generally milder in children than in adults, with a much lower likelihood that they will require hospitalization, the virus can still pose a risk to children's health -- a point stressed by Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID). A few have even died.Additionally, a tiny proportion of children and teenagers have been hospitalized in the US, United Kingdom, Italy and elsewhere with a rare condition known as multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children, or MIS-C, a potential complication following Covid-19 infections.'There's so much unknown'\"Covid in children falls into two categories really -- the primary infection with the virus seems to be a largely benign event in children, except for some tiny numbers where there's a pre-existing condition,\" said Athimalaipet Ramanan, Honorary Professor of Paediatric Rheumatology at the University of Bristol in England.\"But what is an issue in a small minority of children is hyper-inflammatory syndrome, where they get quite unwell and get admitted.\"Ramanan said he had not yet seen cases of children with apparent longer-lasting mild Covid symptoms. \"Probably they are starting to trickle through the primary care system,\" he said. \"I think we will know more about this in the months to come.\"One challenge is that it's not yet clear how attributable such symptoms are to the coronavirus, he said. Another is that since children were very mildly affected, they were not a priority for testing. \"We will have to work to ascertain if these are incidental findings of the coronavirus era or if these are related to the coronavirus,\" he said.Some parents have turned to online networks such as the Long Covid Support Group as they try to make sense of a baffling array of symptoms that don't fit with the \"typical\" characteristics of the disease but continue to trouble their children. CNN spoke by phone with the parents quoted in this story after making contact through such support networks.Indiana initially seemed better after a week -- but 10 days later, started to feel exhausted, her mother said. At first, the teenager tried to keep up with schoolwork and dance practice online but her symptoms seemed to worsen after doing any exercise at all.In the following days, Indiana began suffering migraines and seeing flashing lights. \"Her face all swelled up, her eyes swelled up, she got a rash all over her body,\" said Evans. She contacted the doctor after Indiana began getting chest pains and palpitations but was told her daughter just needed to rest, she said.Eventually Indiana was referred for hospital tests to rule out other problems, Evans said. \"All the results came back absolutely fine, nothing highlighted in the chest x-rays or blood tests even though she was getting a really tight chest,\" her mother said. She will shortly start one-to-one rehabilitation classes to aid breathing and muscle strengthening.Evans remains uncertain what lies ahead for her formerly \"extremely active, very healthy\" daughter, who's due to join a new school in September. \"In our experience it seems like an evolution. The virus evolves in the body from one thing to something else. You're okay and then something else happens,\" Evans said. \"There's so much unknown. We don't know how long this will last for, we don't know what will happen if she starts exercising again.\"Evans, like other parents who believe their children are suffering long-term effects of the coronavirus, is also worried that Indiana could be denied healthcare support because she hasn't had a positive test. \"We just have to take each day at a time,\" Evans said. \"I think the hardest thing for her is not knowing what's going to happen in the future. She's not able to dance, she's very aware of that -- and it was a huge part of her life before.\"'A rollercoaster for the whole family'Birgit, from East Sussex in southeast England, said her previously active seven-year-old son is still fatigued, has lost weight and can't run far without being noticeably out of breath, four months after contracting suspected Covid-19. She and some other individuals in this article asked to be only partially identified out of privacy concerns.Birgit said she, her husband and their son got sick in mid-March and are all still recovering. \"It's been a rollercoaster for the whole family,\" said Birgit. Her son's symptoms started with a temperature, diarrhea and conjunctivitis, she said. \"He had blotchy skin and became quite unfocused. During the next few weeks he had a real loss of appetite -- which he still has -- became quite weepy, and he's normally a very happy, active little boy.\" His symptoms, which were intermittent, also included fatigue and trouble swallowing, she said. \"I'm also very concerned about his emotional well-being, especially with us having been ill for such a long time and having had relapses.\"At one point, she said, things got so bad that she and her husband drew up a legal document regarding care of their son if they both were hospitalized or worse. \"Having that plan reassured him but it's a difficult conversation to have with a seven-year-old,\" she said.Birgit said she got little support from her general practitioner or the National Health Service's 111 advice service. No one in the family was tested, although doctors told her they believed she had Covid-19 and the letter signing her off from work says likely Covid-19, she said.\"It's the uncertainty -- I wonder where this is going and for my little boy, what will this mean for him with sports,\" she said. \"I don't want to be silly, at least all he has is shortness of breath, but I don't know what that means going forward. Should we have his lungs checked out? There's so little guidance.\"Charlotte, from Buckinghamshire, southern England, also believes her son suffered lingering effects of Covid-19, although he seems fully recovered now.Ten-year-old Freddie fell ill in March and was given an inhaler and steroids after experiencing a cough so bad he had trouble breathing, she said. He recovered in about a week but then had a rash, followed by diarrhea that lasted for several weeks.Charlotte had a negative antibody test but her son has not been tested, she said, adding that his symptoms were similar to her own. 'They are scared to return to school'Jen Stefanic, who lives in a rural county in the northwestern US state of Idaho, said her three children, a 12-year-old boy and girls ages 10 and seven, had all experienced waves of various symptoms since late May. All were normally very active and healthy. The symptoms include headache, low fever, aches and chills, joint pain, rashes, acid reflux, diarrhea, insomnia, loss of taste and smell, cough, wheezing and swelling of hands and feet, Stefanic said.No coronavirus tests were available, she said, but the family doctor told her to assume they had all had the virus. She and her husband first fell ill in March.\"I truly think that this virus has changed things in each of us,\" she said. \"My heart aches for them as they are scared to return to school.\" Another mother in the English Midlands, who asked to be known as Jane, said her three boys were now recovered but that she continues to suffer debilitating symptoms after all becoming ill in March.The eldest, who has just turned 16, had Covid toes -- where his toes and heels turned a dark purple color -- for three months but otherwise has felt fine, she said.One of her 11-year-old twins had a sore throat, tight chest, abdominal discomfort, Covid toes and continues to suffer daily nosebleeds, she said. He has only reported feeling more normal again since mid-July. The other twin suffered joint pain in his knees and hips, followed by intermittent bouts of sickness and diarrhea over a period of several weeks, she said.Doctor: No concrete data yetResearchers have so far focused their attention on the small number of children who have been hospitalized with MIS-C, rather than those suffering lingering symptoms after suspected coronavirus exposure.Dr. Nathalie MacDermott, a National Institute for Health Research academic clinical lecturer at King's College London and London hospital physician, told CNN she had seen more cases of children affected by MIS-C than acute Covid respiratory illness.\"At the moment there's no concrete data that's been published in relation to children and long-term problems, but that's because we are still fairly early on and children haven't been so badly affected,\" MacDermott said. In addition, because of the relatively small number of children involved, studies may need to look at children in multiple countries, she said.\"It's certainly possible that children may experience the kind of problems we are hearing about in adults such as long-term fatigue,\" she said. \"From a clinical perspective we are only really seeing those children who were admitted to hospital so it's very hard to know what's going on in the community.\" MacDermott recommended that parents of children with \"significant ongoing symptoms\" seek help through their primary care providers to ensure other possible underlying conditions are not missed. \"It's important that people realize that pediatric services are now fully functioning,\" she said, adding that the absence of a positive test would not exclude children from getting post-Covid care.",

        "body": "(CNN)There's a new test for students at Alabama State University -- but this one happens before they even walk into a classroom. Covid-19 screening stations are being set up to scan their vital signs and warn them when they're not social distancing.\n\nSeveral high-tech screening stations being installed Tuesday in high-traffic areas, such as the campus food court, are designed to read a person's temperature, heart rate and respiratory rate from 3 to 4 feet away. Another set of machines at the university can show a live video feed of people walking or standing nearby and mark a red circle on those who aren't staying 6 feet apart.But these devices won't catch anyone who's spreading the virus without symptoms. According to a July 10 report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, an estimated 40% of Covid-19 patients do not show symptoms.Still, during a week when Alabama is seeing an upswing in the seven-day average of new Covid-19 cases, and the University of Alabama reported 1,200 positive cases on its campus, Alabama State University is hoping this is one more tool to help it avoid becoming the next hot spot.So far, Quinton Ross Jr., president of Alabama State University, told CNN there are no known cases of Covid-19 on his campus. With 4,000 students and 900 faculty and staff members, the university in Montgomery is much smaller than the University of Alabama in Tuscaloosa, where the rising cases of Covid-19 among nearly 10 times the population had prompted the mayor of Tuscaloosa to temporarily shut down all bars.Read More\"Here at Alabama State University it's really embracing a culture shift,\" Ross said, regarding the mandatory mask mandate, and testing of all students, faculty and staff before they returned to campus.Universities across the country are attempting a combination of mask mandates and other rules to curb the spread of the virus, even in some cases testing wastewater to detect Covid-19 in the sewage coming from particular buildings.Ross said the installation of five thermal scanners and five social distancing rigs adds one more layer of protection to an already stringent set of campus rules and reduced capacity in any face-to-face classroom instruction. Each thermal scanner costs about $20,000, and each social distancing rig costs about $10,000, according to a representative for Draganfly, the company that makes these stations. The stations at ASU are paid for through money received from the CARES Act.While many devices can offer temperature readings, Draganfly said its screening technology allows the reading of one's heart rate and respiratory rate, among other vital signs, from a distance of 3 to 4 feet. The technology measures blood volume changes, like when a person blushes. The change in certain colors can be used to time one's heartbeat. The technology also measures shoulder motion to see when someone inhales or exhales to detect respiratory rates.If someone exhibits symptoms similar to those of Covid-19, the person is then taken aside for further evaluation to see if he or she need to be re-tested for coronavirus.Dr. Amesh Adalja, senior scholar at Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, told CNN the presence of high-tech screening stations is more a show of force than something that can single-handedly make a significant difference in detecting Covid-19. \"There are a lot of companies that are trying to market some of these products that I think go really above and beyond what actually has value, when it probably is the simple, cheap stuff that probably has the most value,\" Adlaja said.He said an iPad to screen for a person's temperature, paired with questions about their symptoms, can be just as effective in detecting someone with Covid-19 symptoms. But one positive side effect of the screening stations might be in changing people's behavior.\"It may have this kind of other benefit, in which people ... who might be having mild symptoms, who otherwise would still try to go about their activities in daily life or go to work, they may be less likely to do that knowing they may face some kind of screening,\" he said.Still, Adlaja said there could be a false sense of confidence if people pass the screening. Many people experiencing mild or no symptoms can still spread the virus.Cameron Chell, the CEO of Draganfly, said he compares the solutions to Covid-19 to Swiss cheese. Each layer may have its holes, but he says these stations are an added layer of protection. \"The other option is to is to do nothing or, you know, to rely on testing every single person all the time, which isn't necessarily an effective solution either,\" Chell said. Ninety-one percent of the ASU student body is African American, a point that State Sen. Bobby Singleton said highlights the need for the installation of the screening stations.\"In some of these rural areas, and even around Montgomery, Tuscaloosa, there's a high rate of obesity, there's a high rate of diabetes in the African American community,\" Singleton said. \"Alabama State is a high-risk group. It is a high-risk area, and President Ross is making sure he and his staff are doing everything to address those high-risk students to make sure that they can stay on campus.\"Chell said Draganfly is working with dozens of schools to set up similar stations. It is also working with half a dozen clients on a drone program, similar to one that was tested in Westport, Connecticut, in April. That pilot program quickly ended when critics, including the American Civil Liberties Union, cited privacy concerns.The stations set up at Alabama State screen only those who give their consent. Draganfly said it does not collect their personal information, but daily statistics are sent to the university. \"I consider myself 'Big Brother' because I do want to know who is his positive or negative on this campus,\" Ross said, \"because that drives the decisions that we make on a daily basis, and we want to make sure that our campus is safe.\"",

Wear a d*** mask.\"In an interview with CNN's Chris Cuomo on PrimeTime and infectious disease expert Dr. William Schaffner last week, the actress said she was waiting for advice from doctors on what to do now that she is in recovery, noting that it's not clear what next steps she should take.\"My question is there is no guidance on what to do once you recover. I don't know if I should go get my heart checked, my lungs checked. There's concerns about vascular system. Do I need to go get a panel for all of that?\"\"There's no guidance because this is all so new,\" she added.Schaffner said while there are no next steps that have been established yet, anyone still experiencing symptoms like Milano should continue to see their primary physician for care.Milano has been suffering with several symptoms for months, she said in an Instagram post last week. \"This was me on April 2nd after being sick for 2 weeks,\" she posted along with a photo showing her wearing a breathing apparatus.\"I had never been this kind of sick. Everything hurt. Loss of smell,\" she wrote. \"It felt like an elephant was sitting on my chest. I couldn't breathe. I couldn't keep food in me. I lost 9 pounds in 2 weeks.\"I basically had every Covid symptom,\" Milano wrote, adding that although she had tested negative for the virus twice, she has since tested positive for antibodies.\n\nView this post on Instagram\n\nThis was me on April 2nd after being sick for 2 weeks.

        "body": "Chat with us in Facebook Messenger. Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds.\n\n(CNN)Covid-19 precautions need to stay consistent -- whether or not the numbers are coming down -- because the more Americans move around the more the virus does too, a health expert said.\n\nWhen case numbers start to come down, people tend to interact more, and more movement predicts how the virus will spread, said Dr. Christopher Murray, director of the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington. Though cases have risen to more than 4.9 million and coronavirus deaths have surpassed 161,000, former hotspots like New York are seeing positive changes. But health experts have predicted the national death toll will get worse through the year, and many have called for a stronger national leadership against the virus.In list ranking countries response to the pandemic assessed by Foreign Policy Magazine, the United States ranks near the bottom.\"If you look at the mobility data collected from cell phones in many parts of the country, we're almost back to pre-Covid levels of mobility, so we're just not being as cautious as other people are in other countries,\" Murray told CNN's Wolf Blitzer on Friday. Read MorePrecautions can bring and keep the numbers down while the nation waits on a vaccine, US Surgeon General Dr. Jerome Adams said in a news briefing Friday. All it takes is what he calls his \"Three W's.\"\"Number one, wash your hands. Number two, watch your distance -- meaning stay at least six feet from others and avoid crowded places. And number three, wear a face mask,\" Adams said.Rethinking testingOne important factor to reopening the US while maintaining safety is rethinking the national strategy on testing for the virus, said Dr. Rajiv Shah, president of the Rockefeller Foundation and former USAID administrator. Currently, only symptomatic people are frequently tested, meaning 40% to 50% of all spreaders, those who don't show symptoms, aren't being tested and told they may be contagious, he said.\"You have to know that as soon as possible, and then limit transmission from that node of contagion,\" he said during an Aspen Ideas webinar on Friday. \"That's the whole ball game.\"But even testing primarily symptomatic people been impacted by backlog, many states report.The Virginia Department of Health reported a sharp increase of cases on Friday, but that increase came from a technical issue and a backlog from the two days prior, according to a statement. And Miami-Dade County, the hotspot for cases in Florida, continues to struggle with a lag in testing results, according to state data obtained by CNN.One day in the past week, testing labs reported that 19.2% of test results took more than seven days to deliver. On a different day, 45% of test results took between four and seven days.Precautions matter for children, tooAs schools reopen for the new school year, researchers are learning more about how the virus spreads among children.A new report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention supports the early belief that most coronavirus cases in children appear to be either asymptomatic or mild. But, the report said, when children are hospitalized, they need the intensive care unit as often as adults do.To slow the pandemic, the CDC said children should be encouraged to wash their hands often, keep a good physical distance away from others, and if they are 2 years of age or older, they should wear a mask when they are around people outside of their family members. One rare but serious complication children can develop from a coronavirus infection is known as multisystem inflammatory syndrome, or MIS-C, and at least 570 cases have been reported, the CDC said.As the pandemic continues, health care providers should be on the lookout for the syndrome that most commonly causes abdominal pain, vomiting and a skin rash. More than 74% of the cases were among Hispanic and Black children, the CDC said.Pandemic highlights racial disparitiesFor communities of color, Covid-19 has been a \"double whammy\" that shows the work the US needs to do to correct disparities in health and health care, Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said on Friday.For example, Black Americans are more likely to have jobs that are considered essential, Fauci said, which leads to a much greater risk of being infected. \"Then there's the other thing that is really the chronic and decades-old dilemma of the social determinants of health, which is why African Americans have a higher degree of diabetes, of hypertension, of obesity, of heart disease, of chronic lung disease, of kidney disease,\" Fauci said. \"That does not need to be. But to get corrected, you have to make a decades-long commitment to change that.\"Part of that commitment has to include making resources like immediate testing and results as well as access to health care concentrated in demographics at higher risk of infection.Trials for vaccines for Operation Warp Speed will be inclusive and diverse, chief adviser Moncef Slaoui said Friday. And once it is complete, he said they will be distributed widely.\"We are extremely cognizant of the importance of making sure that the vaccines, if and when they become available, are appropriately allocated in the population, on the basis of data ... and on the basis of need,\" he said.\n\nCNN's Lauren Mascarenhas, Rebekah Riess, Gisela Crespo, Naomi Thomas, Jen Christensen and Rosa Flores contributed to this report.",

        "body": "Tijuana, Mexico (CNN)Stay at home, be safe, but go hungry. Go out, earn a living, but risk your life. For so many in Mexico, this has been the pandemic's impossible choice.\n\nAnd it's a difficult enough choice if you're a shopkeeper or a cab driver. But it's on another level if you're a sex worker.\"I'm so scared for my health,\" said Alejandra, a sex worker in Tijuana, who asked we only use her first name. \"I don't know if the person I'm with has the disease or not.\" Welcome to TijuanaTijuana, Mexico's famed red-light district, called Zona Norte, sits a stone's throw from the US-Mexico border. Calle Coahuila, the area's main strip, is normally teeming with a frenetic action bathed in neon light.Read MoreWomen in short dresses and the highest of high heels stand along the sidewalks, beckoning groups of men to spend some time and money with them. Massive strip clubs, some with hotels attached, act as de facto brothels. Many specifically cater to the thousands of Americans who cross the border from California each month, looking for a kind of fun that can't be found legally in the United States, except maybe in some Nevada counties where prostitution is permitted. All of it is legal here -- or, at least, it was until the pandemic descended.ShutdownMexico's government shuttered its economy in late March. Non-essential businesses were forced to close, including in the state of Baja California, where Tijuana is the largest city.That meant that all the strip clubs, bars, sex hotels and even the sex workers on the sidewalks were forced to close up shop, restrictions that remain in place today.The land border between the United States and Mexico was also closed to non-essential travel. It was all done with the intent of slowing the virus' spread. But on a recent reporting trip to Tijuana, it was abundantly clear that while the sex industry isn't as vibrant as it was pre-pandemic, there's a lot of sex happening behind closed doors.Some follow the rules, some don'tThere's something odd about standing in an empty strip club with the lights on. But it's where we met Roberto Torres, who owns the El Zorro Men's Club, just off the district's main drag.\"I don't think we're safe to open yet,\" he told us. \"So, I'm not going to put myself at risk or my employees at risk either.\"He had to let go of all his female employees. He says most of them went home but for those that didn't, he has an idea where some could've ended up.Reopening his business would be illegal, but in Tijuana, it's clear other business owners don't care. \"People are opening, certain places are open, certain [sex] hotels are open,\" he said.The new way of life is to risk your lifeNearly 8,000 workers are registered with the government but there are likely hundreds, if not thousands more that aren't registered.Many have left town or stopped working, according to local state police CNN spoke to, but there are those that stayed because they are supplying the demand that remains.Although the border is officially closed to non-essential travel, there are exceptions for dual citizens and few vehicles are stopped for checks by Mexican officials. So it's relatively easy to make the short trip. And some Americans are still coming here to have sex.They do so with people like Alejandra, whom we found working near a migrant shelter in the city. She cautiously agreed to speak with us somewhere private. CNN producer Natalie Gall\u00f3n let her borrow some everyday clothes, so she wouldn't attract the attention of the hotel staff when we arrived. \"Things are really bad for me, right now,\" said the several-year veteran of the industry, now in her mid-twenties. \"I'm constantly worried, every single day.\"She said the pandemic has hit her in two ways, watching her customer base decline while also exponentially increasing the risk of an already dangerous job.\"I just have no idea what's going to happen, or if I'm going to get infected,\" she said, shifting nervously from side to side in her chair as we spoke.She's tried to put extra sanitation measures in place. Her clients now have to shower and wash their hands before being with her. She has implemented a no-kissing rule and uses hand sanitizer gel throughout the process.But this is sex. Physical contact is unavoidable. Alejandra knows this but says she has no choice. The only way she can provide for her 6-year-old daughter is by going to work.\"If I don't work, we don't eat,\" she said. \"What will I do tomorrow if I end up getting sick? But I still have to go out even though I don't want to.\" Another sex worker we spoke to who uses the name Adanna, said she's only been able to afford not to work because two of her regular American clients send her some money each month.\"Without them, I don't know what I'd do,\" saying that even with the payments she barely gets food on the table for her 5-year-old daughter.If the government says it's safe enough for the businesses to reopen, Adanna told us she'd go right back to work.Jaqueline Aguilar, 34, a transgender sex worker in Ensenada, about two hours south of Tijuana, told CNN over the phone that she returned to work because she had to make ends meet.She's been a sex worker since she was 13 and her day-to-day fears have changed since the pandemic hit Mexico. \"Before, my fears were of violence, that a client would kill me or hurt me. Now, my fear is the pandemic, to go out and God forbid I get infected and can't work. How would I eat?\"The government keeps track of workers in different industries who have gotten the virus, in sectors like healthcare. No such data exists for sex workers.Aguilar, who is also a founder of an organization supporting transgender women and women in the sex industry, says she knows of at least three colleagues who had Covid-19 symptoms but never got tested. Rather, she said, they isolated at home.'I feel completely safe'We spoke to business owners and sex workers during the day in Tijuana, but the only way to get a true gauge on the situation in the red-light district is to head out at night.This is not a place where journalists are welcome, so we rode through the streets with Baja California State Police.At first glance, a lot of businesses look closed. The front doors at some of the bigger and more famous strip clubs are locked. Smaller places have metal gates pulled down over storefronts. But a closer look prompts questions. Why, if the bigger strip clubs are closed, did many we pass still have bouncers out front? Why, if the sex hotels are closed, did many have women out front beckoning people inside?\"The trade is still happening,\" said the police commander driving the pickup we were in. \"It's just happening behind closed doors.\"That fact was quickly confirmed by the Americans we saw and heard on the streets and one American we met, standing outside a sex hotel where he'd been staying for a few days, hiring different women.\"Lots of Americans here,\" said the man who appeared to be in his late 50's and asked that we not use his name. \"They walk across the border and they come here and do their thing.\"He said he's being safe, wiping his hotel room down with antibacterial wipes and not eating indoors. All very safe, except for the part where he has sex with a stranger, which he says he and other Americans here have no problem with.\"I believe I'm pretty well educated about all of this,\" he said. Challenged by the fact that experts on viral epidemiology would universally disagree with him, he would only say he feels, \"completely safe.\"His ignorance about the risks is what puts the lives of the women he hires in danger. But, he's also helping them put food on the table. They are the two sides of a very dangerous coin.\n\nJournalist Jordi Lebrija contributed to this report.",

        "body": "(CNN)If the United States allowed coronavirus infections to run rampant to achieve possible herd immunity, the death toll would be massive especially among vulnerable people, the nation's top infectious doctor said.\n\nDr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, explained the risks during a live Instagram session with actor Matthew McConaughey. \"If everyone contracted it, even with the relatively high percentage of people without symptoms ... a lot of people are going to die,\" Fauci said. \"You look at the United States of America with our epidemic of obesity as it were. With the number of people with hypertension. With the number of people with diabetes. If everyone got infected, the death toll would be enormous and totally unacceptable,\" he said. Herd immunity is reached when around 70% to 90% of a population becomes immune to a disease either through infection and recovery or vaccination. When that happens, the disease is less likely to spread to people who aren't immune because there just aren't enough infectious carriers to reach them.Read MoreIt is still unclear whether survivors of Covid-19 have immunity, though some have still suggested that allowing Covid-19 to plow through populations might help reach herd immunity more quickly if possible -- but it would be a disaster for hospitals. Doctors would be overwhelmed and more people would die, not just from coronavirus but from other infections, too. Tens of thousands more deaths projectedCoronavirus has killed more than 167,000 people and infected over 5.2 million nationwide, according to Johns Hopkins University. In the next three weeks, that number will go up with a total of nearly 189,000 projected, according to an ensemble forecast published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The new projections released Thursday forecast 188,982 deaths by September 5 -- with a possible range of 181,375 to 201,431 deaths.\"State- and territory-level ensemble forecasts predict that the number of reported new deaths per week may increase over the next four weeks in Colorado and may decrease in Arizona, the Northern Mariana Islands, Vermont and Wyoming,\" the CDC said. The prediction relies on about two dozen individual forecasts from outside institutions and researchers.Unlike some individual models, the CDC's ensemble forecast offers projections only about a month ahead. A previous ensemble forecast, published July 23, projected roughly 164,477 coronavirus deaths by Saturday.\"You can't run away from the numbers,\" Fauci said. \"You can't run away from the numbers of people who've died, the number of people getting hospitalized, the surges we're seeing.\" The US has averaged over 1,000 reported daily deaths for 18 consecutive days.Georgia records highest death toll since pandemic startedGeorgia was one of the first states to reopen after being one of the last ones to shut down. This week, it recorded its highest death toll since the pandemic started.The state reported 136 deaths Tuesday -- its most in a single day -- and an additional 109 deaths Wednesday, according to health officials. Its health department reported 2,674 new cases of Covid-19 on Thursday. The virus has killed a total of 4,538 people in the state. And in North Carolina, the department of health said \"an error\" has reduced the total official count of cumulative coronavirus tests performed since the pandemic started. The number has gone down from 2,044,727 to 1,823,283, said Dr. Mandy Cohen, the state's top health official. The error was due to a discrepancy between electronic and manual reporting of test data submitted by the company LabCorp. The error affected the overall number of tests previously reported but it does not change the total confirmed positive cases, the total deaths or the percent positive calculation, the department of health said. In a sign the virus may be around for a while, Kansas City, Missouri, is extending its coronavirus state of emergency into the beginning of next year. Emergency orders will be in effect until at least January 16, 2021. \"It is now obvious to everyone that Covid-19 is not going away over the next five months,\" said Dr. Rex Archer, the director of the city's health department. House party is same as going to a bar, official says As the long holiday weekend gets closer, officials are warning against social events. Adm. Brett Giroir, a member of the White House coronavirus task force, emphasized the need for coronavirus mitigation measures during the Labor Day weekend. He urged people to avoid crowds -- particularly in indoor spaces.\"We talk about bars, but if you have a house party with a hundred people in your living room, that's the same equivalent,\" he said. He described a crowd of people indoors, drinking, talking and not wearing masks a formula for disaster.\"What you really need to do -- whether you're in a hot area or not -- please wear a mask,\" Giroir said. Good hand hygiene is also essential, he said.\n\nCNN's Steve Almasy, Dakin Andone, Andy Rose, Joe Sutton and Janine Mack contributed to this report.",

Can a person who has antibodies begin to date or stop wearing a mask, for example? Absolutely not, he said emphatically.Immunity 101Our adaptive immune system, designed to target a specific and previously recognized invader, contains two main cellular components -- B cells and T cells. Studies on immunity so far have focused mainly on B cells, a type of white blood cell programmed to find and bind to foreign invaders.Once it has attached itself to a virus such as Covid-19, a B cell \"copies itself and churns out antibodies, eventually creating a mega-army of neutralizers for that particular invader,\" said CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta in an explainer on virus immunity.\"Unfortunately, a few recent studies have found that antibodies to this particular coronavirus can fade away pretty quickly especially in people who have had mild cases of Covid-19,\" Gupta said.A pre-print paper (meaning it has not been vetted by scientists who are not part of the initial study) released in July found antibody responses appear to decline 20 to 30 days after Covid-19 symptoms first appear.\"This study has important implications when considering protection against re-infection with SARS-CoV-2 and the durability of vaccine protection,\" the researchers wrote in the paper.In June, a small study found that people who have coronavirus infections but never develop symptoms could have weaker immune responses to the virus.That study found that a group of about three dozen Covid-19 patients who were asymptomatic had levels of antibodies that were significantly lower than what was found among patients who had mild symptoms -- a finding that suggests the asymptomatic patients had weaker immune responses.In early July, a Spanish government study found that just 5% of people in Spain have coronavirus antibodies and in a potentially worrying development, the study also indicated that people's immunity to coronavirus wanes after just a few weeks. The findings show that 95% of Spain's population remains susceptible to the virus.This means that any perceived immunity \"can be incomplete, transitory and then disappear,\" said Dr. Raquel Yotti, head of the Carlos III Health Institute, in a news conference at the time. The institute is a key government agency leading the study. Hoping for a T-cell responseScience is hoping that Covid-19 will also trigger an immune response from another arm of the adaptive immune system -- T cells. One type, called a memory T cell, helps the body remember a specific invader in case it comes back. A recent study found such memory T cells in people infected with SARS-CoV-2, the novel coronavirus that creates the disease called Covid-19. That finding leads to speculation that some people might get milder cases of Covid-19 because their T-cells are reacting to exposure to similar coronaviruses encountered in the past.The virus SARS-CoV-2 belongs to a large family of coronaviruses, six of which were previously known to infect humans. Two are deadly: SARS-CoV-1, the virus responsible for the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), which ended in 2004; and MERS-CoV, the virus that causes Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS).The other four cause the common cold, and because they circulate widely each year, it's possible many people may have already been exposed to one of these so-called \"cousins\" of the novel coronavirus.\"They've been studied and we know that after you had a cold, you develop antibodies to that particular human strain of coronavirus and you will be protected, but it turns out the protection begins to wane after about a year,\" Schaffner said.\"Now when Covid-19 came along, we wondered how much protection are you going to get from this virus? And if you get protection, how long does it last?\" he added. \"We don't know that behavior yet.\"Stay the course Another page on the CDC site, updated in June, refers to the uncertainty that exists surrounding the role of antibodies in future infections.\"Having antibodies to the virus that causes COVID-19 might provide protection from getting infected with the virus again. If it does, we do not know how much protection the antibodies might provide or how long this protection might last,\" the CDC says in regard to testing.Until science knows more about how long immunity lasts, Schaffner advised staying the course of what is known to work: hand-washing, social distancing, avoiding crowds and wearing masks.\"Don't go around looking for reasons not to wear the mask, just wear it. Get used to it,\" Schaffner said. \"We want to all be in this together to affirm our solidarity.\"\n\nCNN's Andrea Kane contributed to this report.",

Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds.\n\nLagos, Nigeria (CNN)More than one million people in Africa have been infected with the novel coronavirus but health experts say the numbers do not give a \"full picture\" of the outbreak on the continent.\n\nAs of early Friday morning, Africa had recorded a total of 1,008,154 cases, and more than half of these are in South Africa.Dr. Matshidiso Moeti, of the World Health Organization, said the cases are a small fraction of the global count but low testing in many African countries means infections have been under-reported.The health agency said while testing facilities have increased in some countries compared to when the outbreak began in February, Africa still fell behind the global benchmark.In Tanzania, the government claims it has defeated coronavirus and has not released any official data since May, and in Nigeria, the WHO is concerned that testing is not available at the grassroots level.Read More\"The challenge is how to decentralize these tests available in states and in countries like Nigeria where we need to get to people in the local governments,\" the agency's program manager for emergency response for Africa, Dr. Michel Yao told CNN.Long test result turnaround timeNigeria, the African nation with the largest population, has tested less than one percent of its 200 million inhabitants as of Friday, and some in the country say getting a coronavirus test can be challenge.While testing is free in state-owned laboratories, there are few of these facilities and they are in major cities. And sometimes, health officials have had to transfer samples to other states to confirm results due to a shortage of kits.The state of Lagos is the epicenter of the virus in Nigeria, with 15,580 cases. It has recently closed health centers specifically created to treat Covid patients. On Monday, the state's governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, announced that worship centers can accommodate half their capacity during services and restaurants are back in business, citing a steady decline in cases.There are concerns that people there are self-managing their symptoms at home. Lagos has tested 66,431 samples so far, a fraction of its 20 million residents.One resident told CNN he waited for two weeks to get a test at a government laboratory after he fell ill in June.\"I was going there many times, and it was not until my daughter made many calls, and I ran into a doctor friend who was at the hospital that day that I was able to do the test,\" Segun Bello-Osagie said.Patient turned backBello-Osagie said a nurse turned him back at the first hospital where he sought treatment when he became sick.\"I was not allowed into the consulting area, and the nurse was shouting that I should not come in even though I was wearing a face mask, and she was dressed like an astronaut,\" Osagie-Bello told CNN.\"She said, 'We can't help you here, we don't attend to Covid people here,' even though I hadn't even been tested.\" She referred him to a government hospital in the city attending to coronavirus cases. Osagie-Bello said he went home instead, fearing he may not endure the long drive and traffic to the hospital.He said he began using herbal therapies that many claimed had helped them when they had similar symptoms while he self-isolated at home.Osagie-Bello says that even though the government has proactively deployed measures to check the virus spread, the delays patients face could discourage them from going to hospitals.\"I know some people who have had symptoms suspected to be Covid-19 gave up on getting testing,\" he told CNN. He added that some hospital officials may tell patients to come back the next day.Chike Ihekweazu, director of the Nigerian Center for Disease Control, acknowledged the slow turnaround time for testing and said the response was partly due to the challenge the country faced initially trying to repurpose its laboratories to test for the virus.Ihekwaezu said South Africa in contrast, which has the highest numbers of testing on the continent and the highest numbers of cases, was able to easily do this.Ihekweazu said the agency has been able to address problems sourcing kit reagents. But he was forced to turn to Twitter in April to seek testing material. He posted a message saying that the agency was \"desperately\" looking for more RNA extraction kits to expand testing in the country.\"We recognise that improving access to testing for COVID-19 is a major priority. We will continue to work closely with other stakeholders and partners to ensure that Nigerians can be tested in a timely manner that will also contribute to the control of this outbreak,\" Ihekweazu told CNN.Another barrier to testing is cost, according to Mobihealth International CEO Funmi Adewara, whose organization is among those assisting laboratories with Covid-19 test sample collection, says.Private facilities charge $132 for tests in addition to the cost of processing the tests. The fee, she says, is prohibitive for a majority of Nigerians without health insurance. Many hit by the economic impact of Nigeria's five-week lockdown to tackle the pandemic.\"How many people have that kind of money to pay for this test?\" Adewara said.She add that Nigeria's testing model excludes asymptomatic carriers, a critical data point that could give health officials a clearer insight into the outbreak in the country.\"We haven't tested enough to the point that we have data to interpret the pattern of infections if we're only testing those with symptoms, but the good thing is that the mortality rate seems low going by official figures,\" Adewara told CNN.Dealing with a new virusIn the early days of the coronavirus outbreak, only two laboratories -- one in Senegal and one in South Africa -- had the capacity to test for the novel coronavirus. It took more than a week to confirm a positive case as samples were taken from different countries to these labs.There are now more testing facilities but Yao with the WHO said the global demand for test kits has limited Africa's testing capabilities as international suppliers prioritize requests from countries in Europe, Latin America and the US with larger caseloads than most African countries. But the African Union in partnership with aid organizations, including the WHO and the Jack Ma Foundation, has launched an initiative to aggregate demand across African countries to mobilize suppliers to produce more kits, according to Yao.\"We need to test wider and wider, not only those who are sick to be more confident so we're not swimming in the dark,\" Yao said\n\nCNN John Maija Ehlinger and Jonny Hallam in Atlanta contributed to the stoy",

Not only were nurses splitting time between schools before the pandemic hit, Kern says, but now she worries about the sustainability of the district's PPE supply.\"A school doesn't typically purchase large quantities of PPE, so the cost to do so is astronomical,\" Kern said. \"The federal government needs to support schools to keep everyone safe.\" Read MoreAs school nurses across the United States prepare for the start of the academic year, the National Association of School Nurses says on-campus medics are wholly unprepared because of a lack of funding and nurses. Nurses who spoke to CNN echo that sentiment. They say keeping children and staff safe won't be tenable if they are not provided more PPE and if school districts don't hire more nurses.\"It's going to be a mad house if there are pockets of outbreaks,\" said Amber Cichocki, a school nurse in northeastern Texas. \"It's just a big unknown.\" Nearly a quarter of US K-12 schools do not employ a licensed nurse, while about 35% employ a part-time nurse, according to a 2018 NASN study, which says there were about 95,000 full-time nurses in the US. That contrasts with the 50.7 million students who were enrolled in school in the fall of 2018, according to the National Center for Education Statistics.\"NASN sees this as a student and family equity issue,\" Laurie Combe, NASN's president, told CNN. \"For many of those students we are the healthcare provider that they see because they do not have access to health insurance. Parents rely on us to help students remain in school if they're not in danger of any condition.\" The nurse and PPE shortage led NASN in April to call for 10,000 more nurses in schools, about a month after states started implementing stay-at-home orders. In July, NASN amended its request, Combe says, as it teamed up with four other education and health organizations to form the Safer Return to Schools Coalition. The group is demanding that Congress approve a minimum of $208 billion for school districts to \"prioritize the health and safety of their students and staff.\" \"Federal investments are critical to ensure that districts are able to retain existing staff and avoid laying off these desperately needed professionals,\" the letter from the coalition read. \"We ask the Senate to make that investment for the children and youth in America's public schools.\" In June, Senator Patty Murray, D-WA, and Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer introduced the Coronavirus Child Care and Education Relief Act, which calls for $430 billion in funding to address childcare and education issues. About $175 billion would go to K-12 public schools to implement public health protocols. School nurses wear many hats Cichocki, the northeastern Texas nurse, is \"cautiously optimistic\" that schools will handle the new year well. She says that the coronavirus adds another task to her already long list of duties. Aside from treating student aches and pains, school nurses carry out vision and hearing screenings and immunizations. They also work with local health departments to mitigate health risks with students and train teachers in recognizing and preventing these health risks. \"We do almost everything a doctor's office does without the doctor, staff or resources,\" Cichocki said.Now, nurses will have to pay attention to coronavirus symptoms and may at times have to isolate students to prevent its spread. The added challenge is that students may attend school despite possibly having symptoms. Identifying those children will be an arduous task. \"Weeding out those symptoms is going to be difficult,\" said Pray, the Washington nurse. \"Who's to say those Covid-like symptoms aren't allergies or an asthma attack?\"In 2009, Mary Pappas, a New York school nurse, emphasized the important role nurses play during modern pandemics when she discovered the first swine flu cluster in the state, which led to a nationwide response, according to The New York Times. But nurses are also susceptible to infection. Cichocki says she has caught influenza from treating students, but she says that does not necessarily mean she'll catch the coronavirus. Despite the risks, nurses remain divided on in-person schooling. While Pray is comfortable with her son's return to school, Kern, the Florida nurse supervisor, has an 8-year-old granddaughter who lives with someone with health complications. \"I would say that under normal circumstance I wouldn't be worried, but she lives with someone who is immunosuppressed, so that is a concern,\" Kern said. \"If it was me, and I was living in that time right now, I wouldn't send my children to school. Not with what's going on.\"Nurses say they will continue to do the best they can with the limited resources at hand. Washing hands, wearing facial coverings and continuously wiping down surfaces will now be more important than ever. \"If I utilize what I know and have been taught as a nurse with disease mitigation,\" Cichocki said, \"I should be able to protect myself to some extent.\"",

        "body": "(CNN)Covid-19 patients not showing symptoms may have similar amounts of the novel coronavirus in their bodies as those who do show symptoms, according to a new study from South Korea. This would suggest that they could still spread the virus to others.\n\nThe study, published in the journal JAMA Internal Medicine on Thursday, included data on 303 Covid-19 patients who were in isolation in March at a community treatment center in South Korea. The patients, mostly young adults, had a median age of 25.Among those patients, 193 of them -- or 63.7% -- were showing symptoms at the time of isolation, according to the study. Whereas, 110 patients appeared not to show symptoms.Only 19.1% of those asymptomatic patients went on to develop symptoms during isolation compared with 80.9% who remained asymptomatic and did not develop symptoms during an average of 24 days they were followed in the study.Nasal and throat swabs were collected from each patient. The researchers then analyzed those samples and examined viral genetic material called RNA, taking a close look at the patients' viral loads, which refer to the amount of virus a person has inside them.Read MoreThe study found that the viral load in asymptomatic patients -- those who were not showing symptoms -- appeared to be similar to that in patients showing symptoms.The researchers noted in their study that viral loads in asymptomatic patients from the time of their diagnosis to being discharged from the community treatment center tended to decrease more slowly than those in both symptomatic and pre-symptomatic patients.The study had some limitations, including that more research is needed to determine whether similar findings would emerge among a larger group of patients -- and the study could not determine just how infectious each person was.\"Although the high viral load we observed in asymptomatic patients raises a distinct possibility of a risk for transmission, our study was not designed to determine this,\" the researchers wrote.\"It is important to note that detection of viral RNA does not equate infectious virus being present and transmissible,\" the researchers wrote. \"For a better understanding of the viral shedding and potential transmissibility of asymptomatic infection, large rigorous epidemiologic and experimental studies are needed.\"Separate research previously has suggested that \"silent transmission\" -- the spread of virus by someone with no obvious symptoms -- could be responsible for half of all novel coronavirus cases in the United States.Transmission via people with no symptoms, or during the few days before symptoms are apparent, may be a primary driver of Covid-19 spread, according to a previous study published in July in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.On Monday, the nation's top infectious disease expert, Dr. Anthony Fauci, said that asymptomatic transmission is a driving factor in community spread.\"There are people who are spreading it who have no symptoms at all, and we know that definitely occurs. It's difficult to identify it, and it's difficult to do identification, isolation and contact tracing,\" Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said during a news briefing with Connecticut Governor Ned Lamont.\"It isn't easily identifiable who these spreaders are,\" Fauci said. \"That makes it much more difficult to contain.\"\n\nCNN's Sandee LaMotte, Lauren Mascarenhas and Andrea Kane contributed to this report.",

The data comes from case numbers provided by state health departments of 49 states, New York City, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and Guam.\n\nSome of the increase may be due to more testing, AAP said. Early in the pandemic, testing was reserved for the sickest. A broader number of tests may be identifying children that have fewer or milder symptoms than those who were tested earlier in the pandemic.\n\nChildren make up just over 9% of the total cases in states that report cases by age, according to the report. At least 380,174 total child Covid-19 cases reported as of Aug. 6.\n\nAs of now, it still appears that severe symptoms are rare among children with Covid-19 infections. Children were between 0.5% and 5.3% of total hospitalizations, according to data from the states that record that information. Children were 0% to 0.4% of all Covid-19 deaths.\n\nNineteen states have reported no child deaths. In states that tracked the details, 0% to 0.5% of all child Covid-19 cases resulted in death.\n\nThe AAP called for an effective testing strategy so that communities can make the right choice about opening schools.\n\n\"In areas with rapid community spread, it's likely that more children will also be infected, and these data show that,\" AAP President Dr. Sally Goza said in the news release. \"As a pediatrician, I urge people to wear cloth face coverings and be diligent in social distancing and hand-washing. It is up to us to make the difference, community by community.\"\n\nThe World Health Organization said last week that the coronavirus pandemic is starting to move into the younger population globally, while most cases, by far, are among people ages 25 to 64.",

The Robinsons, who were married 35 years, died 11 days apart after battling coronavirus.The couple, of Vallejo, California, were best friends who met in high school, Adams said. They were avid Bay Area sports fans, were near and dear to their community and loved to kiss. Adams said his parents did everything together, and their bond rubbed off on everyone they were around.\"This is a true love bird story,\" Adams said. \"They showed me how to care, how to love.\"Read MoreKeith, 62, a truck driver for UPS, developed minor coronavirus symptoms first. Being diabetic, he thought it was just the disease messing with him. A week later, Gwendolyn, 60, came down with symptoms, but hers were far worse than her husband's, Adams said. She was sent home from work where she was a donation director for a veteran's home. Even worse, she had asthma and had been struggling with MDS, a type blood cancer, for over a year and was due for chemo. \"The following day, my sister, said \"Mom, I think we should take you in.\" And that was the last time we physically touched her or saw her,\" Adams said. The couple was admitted to the hospital just two days apart, with Keith going in on July 12 and Gwendolyn on July 14.Four days later, on July 18, Gwendolyn passed while saying goodbye to her grandchildren and Adams through FaceTime. Adams said that his dad continued his stay in the hospital fighting the virus, but it was a roller coaster of good and bad days.\"They always seemed to get it under control, but on July 29, it went downhill,\" Adams said. Keith started having kidney trouble, and the doctor's wanted to start dialysis, but Adams said the doctor didn't make it in time, and his dad stopped breathing. The Robinsons left behind their four children and ten grandchildren.\"This is rough,\" Adams said. \"It's one thing to know you are going to lose your parents eventually -- but to know that you just saw them last week...and you never see them again, it's a shock.\" The funeral will be held in Vallejo on August 12. The family set up a GoFundMe Page to help cover the cost of the funeral expenses.",

It's the way you guys are living,\" he said. \"I guess it's a blame game for everything that the minorities do. Like, how do you blame someone for dying at home?\"Gambrell, 33, lost his father to Covid-19 and says he had to fight to get treatment for his mother. He is himself still suffering from the effects of the virus that also struck his brothers.This family is just one example of how hard coronavirus has hit minorities in the United States, and Black people in particular. Blacks are dying at a rate 2.4 times higher than Whites, according to the COVID Tracking Project. Native Americans and Latinos are also dying at about 1.5 times the rate of that of Whites and Asian Americans, the data shows. Read MoreIn Michigan, nearly 40% of all deaths in the state were Blacks -- including Gambrell's father, Gary Fowler -- even though they make up only 22% of the cases, COVID Tracking Project data shows. Fowler, 56, died April 7, just six hours after his own father died of the same virus. David Fowler, 76, a retired GM toolmaker, died in a hospital.Gary Fowler did not.Cheryl Fowler, his wife of 21 years, found him dead in his recliner. It was where he had been sleeping, where he found some help in his struggle to breathe, Gambrell said.\"I honestly feel like if the hospitals would have took my dad more serious, my dad would be here,\" he said.He says he took his father to three hospitals in late March, when Covid-19 was tearing through their city of Detroit. Fowler was not admitted to any of them.One emergency room discharged him with a diagnosis of bronchitis.Gambrell says his dad's fever that day was 101. \"He has a cough. He has vomiting. He has diarrhea. He has shortness of breath. He is complaining of chest pains,\" Gambrell said. \"He's complaining of all the signs that the TV is telling you to watch out for with the coronavirus.\"He was handed one document from a hospital he visited that read: \"There is a high concern you have Covid-19 however we could not test you ...Testing for Covid-19 is very limited and has been restricted to those who are severely ill.\"Finally, Gambrell says, his dad asked him to take him home, complaining no one was listening to him. All three hospitals said they do not discriminate. Two added they were following guidelines from the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention to admit only the sickest patients at that time.On the day he lost his father -- a security supervisor at a senior living complex who loved camping, the outdoors and baseball -- Gambrell's mother developed symptoms. She, too, was turned away from one hospital despite having two prescriptions for a Covid-19 test, Gambrell says. \"The nurse looks at my mother and tells her, 'Ma'am, there's nothing we can do for you here. Go home, drink tea, take Tylenol for your fever.' I was like, 'We're here for a reason, lady,'\" Gambrell said.He drove his mom to a hospital across town where she was admitted. She tested positive for Covid-19 and was diagnosed with pneumonia.Soon she needed a ventilator to help her breathe.When she was discharged, Gambrell felt it was too soon.About a week later. he says, his mom woke up saying she couldn't breathe. \"So, we take her back to the local hospital in Detroit, come to find out my mother developed two blood clots in her lungs.\" Cheryl Fowler spent another week in the hospital. She is now recovering, though heartbroken at the loss of her husband and father-in-law.Gambrell says his parents tried to do the right thing and believes if they had been White, they would have received better care.\"They would have been checked out properly. They wouldn't have been sent home to infect everyone in the household if they were of another race.\"Housing, family and work add to impactLong-standing inequalities in US health care have been magnified by Covid-19, according to Dr. Esmaeil Porsa, CEO of Harris Health System in Houston. \"You're talking about decades, if not generationally, a segment of the population that has struggled with access to adequate health care, so they are already at a worse baseline of health, if you will, than the general population,\" he said.Porsa says his institutions are \"safety net hospitals,\" which serve a predominately minority population. More than 80% of patients are Latino or Black.\"A pandemic like Covid-19, it makes sense for it to disproportionately impact this population that is at risk,\" Porsa said. \"And then you add to it other social and economic situations that this population deals with -- rental housing, multigenerational housing, work situations which exposes them to continued exposure to Covid-19, both at work and at home. Those are all the circumstances that lend themselves to this population being impacted disproportionately.\"Some 55% of coronavirus deaths in Texas are Latino, according to the COVID Tracking Project.\"This pandemic has been with us for six months and there seems to be no end in sight,\" Porsa said. A long recoveryIn Queens, New York, Christell Cadet, 35, is walking with a cane, spending four days a week in rehab.The NYFD paramedic, an asthma sufferer, was placed on a ventilator back in March after coronavirus crippled her ability to breathe on her own. \"Last thing I remember telling the doctors is 'Please intubate me. I can't breathe any longer,'\" she said.Cadet was on life support for nearly a month. She was discharged from the hospital April 30, unable to walk or even lift her arms. Instead of moving Cadet to a nursing home, her mother brought her home. Thomise Cadet, a nurse herself, took on the role of caregiver.Christell Cadet credits the support she received from her mom and the New York City Fire Department. \"Everybody pushed to make sure that I was given all the care possible,\" she said. But she worries that not everyone can count on such help.\"Unfortunately, for the rest of our community ... they don't always have an advocate for them,\" she said.Cadet is deciding how she can help to improve the treatment of minorities with Covid-19, by donating her blood or sharing her medical records.Dr. Porsa hopes that the pandemic is a wake-up call for minority communities but also for local and national leadership.\"There is a root cause here that needs to be addressed, and that has everything to do with the social inequalities and the social injustice that exists,\" he said.\"By improving the economic conditions of a person or community you all of a sudden increase their access to health care, you increase their access to better education, increase their access to a lot of other things. And you not only achieve that in the population you are treating at that time, but for generations to come.\"Keith Gambrell sees the economic inequalities, and believes the root cause is racism.\"It's everywhere. Everything that's in America has some type of systematic racism in it. And it's the God's honest truth. If you can't see that, then you need to wake up and look in the mirror because you're part of the problem,\" he said.\"I feel like I have to be more vocal because there's many people here that can't talk for themselves. Honestly, I feel like I'm kind of the voice for Covid survivors.\"And all the while, he is mourning his father, who died at age 56.\"My dad was awesome. ... He was an honest, hard-working, loving family man.\"",

        "body": "(CNN)Black and Hispanic children are impacted more severely by coronavirus, with higher case rates, hospitalizations and virus-related complications, according to research released this week. These findings mirror similar reports across the nation of adults in minority communities being hit harder by Covid-19.\n\nA report from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released Friday found that Black and Hispanic children are more likely to be hospitalized due to coronavirus than White children. The CDC examined hospitalization records from 14 states and found 576 Covid-19 cases among children who needed hospitalization from March through July 25. The report found Hispanic children were hospitalized for coronavirus at the highest rate, 16.4 per 100,000 people, followed by Black children at 10.5 per 100,000. In contrast, White children were hospitalized at a rate of 2.1 per 100,000. The CDC also reported higher rates of multisystem inflammatory syndrome, or MIS-C, in these populations. Of 570 cases of MIS-C reported to the CDC by July 29, more than 74% were in Black and Hispanic children.MIS-C is a rare, but serious complication of coronavirus in children. Symptoms can include fever, rash, inflammation, stomach problems and shock. The condition can also lead to organ failure and heart damage. Read MoreA study released this week out of Children's National Hospital in Washington, DC, found that coronavirus rates are similarly higher among Black and Hispanic children and those from lower socioeconomic backgrounds. The study examined 1,000 patients tested at a Children's National Covid-19 testing site and found that just 7.3% of White children tested positive for coronavirus, in contrast to 30% of Black children and 46.4% of Hispanic children. Three times as many Black children as White children reported exposure to coronavirus. Implications for reopening schoolsSchools around the nation are currently making decisions about whether children will return to classrooms for in-person classes. A Georgia school district which reopened this week was forced to quarantine at least 260 students and eight teachers after multiple members of the school community tested positive for Covid-19.While the research suggests that children from some populations are more susceptible to the virus and its complications than others, none are immune -- or even \"almost immune,\" as President Donald Trump recently claimed. While children do experience severe illness from Covid-19 less often than adults, children who are hospitalized need the intensive care unit as often as adults do, at a rate of about one in three, according to the CDC.Dr. Khalilah Gates, a pulmonary and critical care specialist at Northwestern Memorial Hospital told CNN Saturday that the CDC research gives us new information about the virus' impact on children that can help us make informed decisions about opening schools. \"We can't back off of testing, and we do have to have more rapid testing,\" Gates added.The CDC report on MIS-C noted that 64% of the children with MIS-C required intensive care, and 10 children died.Health experts have called for additional research into the impact of coronavirus on children, especially that which would help understand the factors driving stark racial inequities.What's driving these disparities?Racial health disparities have existed for years, and the coronavirus pandemic has exacerbated them.Experts say that social determinants of health have led to increased rates of underlying health conditions, like diabetes, heart disease and hypertension in minority communities, placing many at greater risk for coronavirus complications.Structural conditions also play a role. Rashawn Ray, a David M. Rubenstein Fellow with the Brookings Institution, recently noted that social distancing is a privilege that people of color, who often live in densely populated areas, are not afforded. He said discrimination is \"baked into\" our society. People of color are also less likely to have access to healthy food options, recreational spaces and health care.Health experts have urged action toward addressing the disparities, while acknowledging that fixing them will require a decades-long commitment. A good place to start, says the nation's leading infectious disease expert Dr. Anthony Fauci, is with increased testing and access to health care in minority communities.In a Friday conversation with the Dr. Ashish Jha, the director of the Harvard Global Health Institute , Fauci said the disparities brought to light by the pandemic are \"unacceptable,\" and may jolt our society into action.",

        "body": "(CNN)Blood thinners appear to reduce the risk of death by up to 50% among seriously ill, hospitalized coronavirus patients, researchers reported Wednesday.\n\nAnd patients given anticoagulants also were 30% less likely to need a ventilator to help them breathe, a team at the Mount Sinai Health System in New York reported. Their study of more than 4,300 patients also those who died often had evidence of blood clots throughout their bodies, even though many of them had no symptoms of the problem. It's more evidence of the serious, systemwide blood clotting that coronavirus infections can cause, but the findings offer hope of countering the effect. \"Compared to no anticoagulation, both prophylactic and therapeutic anticoagulation was associated with decreased mortality and intubation,\" the team wrote in their report, published in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology. It was not a randomized controlled study, the gold standard for medical research. The study's leader, Dr. Valentin Fuster, says that's next. \"An international randomized trial just started with 15 institutions,\" Fuster told CNN. \"We are comparing three types of anticoagulants that work.\" Read MoreFuster's team said 60% of patients who were not given anticoagulants were discharged alive, 26% of them died in the hospital and 13% were still in the hospital.When patients got the drug prophylactically to prevent blood clots, 75% were released alive, 22% died in the hospital and 3% were still hospitalized during the study period. The researchers said the reduction in the risk of death was similar in patients who got anticoagulants either to prevent clots, or after they began showing evidence of clotting.Sal Mazzara is one of the survivors. He was hospitalized in early April as his coronavirus infection worsened and stayed on a ventilator for a month.\"Sal did not have any blood clots but he was given medicine every day for blood clots to prevent them,\" his wife, Josephine Mazzara, told CNN. At first Mazarra got the clotbusting drug tPA, used for emergency treatment of a stroke. He later got heparin and was sent home with Eliquis, known generically as apixaban -- a pill approved for preventing stroke.Mazzara's treatment required heavy sedation and an incision in his throat so he could be intubated. \"It was a horrible, horrible experience,\" Josephine Mazzara said.\"There's not much I can remember,\" Sal Mazzara, 48, told CNN. \"I completely blacked out.\"The only specific treatment for coronavirus is the antiviral drug remdesivir. Mazzara got that drug, too, during his treatment, Josephine Mazzara said.Doctors have also learned that steroids, specifically dexamethasone, can also help patients recover better from coronavirus infections. Trials are under way to test blood-based therapies that deliver various types of antibodies to help patients fight off the infection, using plasma donated by people who have recovered from infections.In the absence of a slam-dunk treatment for the virus, many medical teams are taking a cocktail approach, giving their patients a combination of drugs to control the immune response, control the virus and to control blood clotting.Mazzara continued on the blood thinner for a month after his release from the hospital in May. \"I'm like 90% back,\" he said.Soon after the pandemic hit New York City hard in March, doctors started noticing their patients were suffering from systemwide blood clotting. Blood clots clogged up kidney dialysis equipment and damaged the lungs, livers and hearts of patients.Physicians now believe the inflammation caused by coronavirus infection is causing the clotting. Sometimes it causes no symptoms until it is too late.In the Mt. Sinai study, autopsies on some of the patients who died showed that 42% had blood clots, including in their brains, lungs, liver and heart. \"They never had the clinical syndrome of a thrombotic disorder. It was silently causing damage,\" Fuster said.The doctors used several different anticoagulants and often more than one on each patient, so it is not possible to say which ones worked best. But Fuster said low molecular weight heparin and apixaban both showed positive effects.The Mount Sinai team published study results involving 2,000 patients in May. Wednesday's report follows up with more patients who were treated more consistently.",

        "body": "Chat with us in Facebook Messenger. Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds.\n\nSao Paulo (CNN)Brazil surpassed 100,000 deaths from Covid-19 on Saturday as cases exceeded 3 million, according to the latest numbers by the country's Health Ministry.\n\nThe fatalities milestone comes less than five months after Brazil recorded its first Covid-19-related death.The ministry said 100,477 people have lost their lives and 3,012,412 have been infected. In the last 24 hours, 905 people have died from Covid-19. The day was marked by manifestations of solidarity with the victims' families and critics of the federal government. Many Twitter users marked their messages with the hashtag #100thousanddeaths. In Rio de Janeiro, the NGO Rio of Peace placed a hundred crosses in the sand and showed a poster asking: \"Why are we the second in number of deaths?\"After the US, Brazil is now the second country in the world to reach the bleak milestone, attributed by critics to the country's haphazard response to the outbreak, personified in President Jair Bolsonaro's leadership.Read MoreBolsonaro has downplayed the coronavirus crisis for months, deriding it as a \"little flu\" and refusing to wear a mask in public even when it was encouraged by his own health ministers and ordered by a judge.As cases began to grow in March, and state governors began to act to contain the spread, Bolsonaro argued that the economy could not be sacrificed for the sake of public health.He criticized unpopular quarantine and shelter-in-place measures, hugging supporters at rallies without a face mask, while encouraging people to continue work and boosting the unproven drug chloroquine as a cure.Bolsonaro has clashed with his health ministers, losing two in a span of a month, and choosing a military general with no background in medicine or public health to take over the role. Bolsonaro tested positive for the virus in July as cases were skyrocketing in the country, and the healthcare system in several states became stretched to the limit.On Thursday, Bolsonaro said on Facebook Live: \"The number [of Covid-19 deaths] is reaching 100,000. We are going to get on with life and look for a way to get away from this problem\", said Getting on with life, however, has not been easy for Daniel Gustavo Veloso, a 34-year-old businessman who lost his father to Covid-19.\"You don't know how painful it is to arrive at the hospital and see your father inside a black garbage bag, with just the face out of it,\" Veloso told CNN. Veloso's father, Victor Manuel Veloso Mendez, lived in Caxias do Sul, a city in the countryside of Rio Grande do Sul State, one of the current epicenters of the coronavirus in Brazil. Despite being elderly and suffering from high blood pressure and diabetes, Victor didn't want to use a mask. According to Veloso, Victor was a fervent Bolsonaro follower. \"He used to say things like 'the virus won't attack me, it doesn't exist, it is something created by the media, by the communists, God will help me, it is just a little flu,'\" Veloso said..When his father realized the seriousness of the disease, it was too late. \"When he arrived at the medical unit his oxygenation was already very low,\" Veloso said. \"He called my mother crying desperately and begging 'don't leave me alone, don't let me die.' It was the last contact we had with him.\"Victor was intubated and died nine days later, on June 19, at the age of 64.The psychology of the pandemic is important in Brazil. According to Gisele Gus Manfro, a psychiatrist and professor of the psychiatry in Porto Alegre, the way the deaths are presented -- as numbers without a face -- and the sensation of powerlessness against the virus are generating a \"trivialization of barbarism\" in the country. \"The unknown is very scary, and at the first moment, people react to that with many symptoms like stress, anxiety, and depression. But after a certain moment it seems to happen a kind of denial ... maybe to defend themselves from a feeling of impotence,\" she said. Disinformation has also played a part.Alexandre Cunha, an infectious disease specialist at Brasilia University Hospital, in the country's capital, said, \"Disinformation has been very bad for us doctors. Every day we have to deal with a relative questioning the treatment or a patient asking for drugs that do not have been scientifically proven like hydroxychloroquine.\" \"[It] feels like people got used to the idea that they can't escape from Covid-19. The country still has to deal with a high number of deaths and people seem numb about it,\" Cunha said.Brazilians have used the internet to create a network of affection and support. The Support Network Host Group Covid-19, for example, has 8,000 psychologists and psychiatrists who provide free virtual care on loss and absence.And the website Inumer\u00e1veis, created to honor Covid-19 victims with individual tributes, is based on the premise that \"there are those who do not like to be numbered; people deserve to exist in prose.\" All the posts are prepared by volunteer journalists who use a questionnaire answered by friends and family at the time of registration.Gabriela Veiga, who works as a social media specialist for Inumer\u00e1veis, notes that the absence of a proper goodbye ritual, imposed by the pandemic, makes it even more important to talk about the ones who lost their lives. \"To talk about their loved ones in a celebratory way, remembering funny moments with that person, for example, helps to improve the mourning process,\" she told CNN.\n\nRodrigo Pedroso reported from Sao Paulo, Fernanda Wenzel from Porto Alegre and Thaize Oliveira from Rio de Janeiro.

For example, the survey showed that at least one adverse mental or behavioral health symptom was reported by more than half of respondents who were: 18 to 24 years old, at 75%;unpaid caregivers of adults, at 67%;reporting they had less than a high school diploma, at 66%;essential workers, at 54%;25 to 44 years old, at 52%.The percentage among those who reported having been treated for existing mental health conditions was even higher.The percentage of survey respondents who reported having seriously considered suicide within 30 days before completing the survey also varied among subgroups, the survey showed. Percentages were significantly higher among:self-reported unpaid caregivers for adults, at 31%;ages 18--24 years, at 26%;essential workers, at 22%;Hispanic respondents, at 19%; Black respondents, at 15%.In all, the researchers found that while symptoms of mental or behavioral health conditions varied significantly among subgroups, unpaid caregivers for adults fared the worst.\"Unpaid caregivers for adults, many of whom are currently providing critical aid to persons at increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19, had a higher incidence of adverse mental and behavioral health conditions compared with others,\" the researchers wrote.They added, \"Although unpaid caregivers of children were not evaluated in this study, approximately 39% of unpaid caregivers for adults shared a household with children (compared with 27% of other respondents). Caregiver workload, especially in multigenerational caregivers, should be considered for future assessment of mental health, given the findings of this report and hardships potentially faced by caregivers.\"The study had some limitations, including that it was based on self-reported information from an online survey, which can lead to some biases if respondents are not honest in their answers around symptoms of depression, substance use, suicidal thoughts and other mental health topics.Before the pandemic, previous estimates have shown that, overall, nearly one in five -- or 20% -- of US adults live with a mental illness.'The adults are not alright in America'When it comes to the new study, \"this is a virtually real-time biopsy of the American mental health experience. So I appreciate you can criticize this study for being internet-based. You can criticize this study for not having formal diagnostic interviews. But you can conclusively say the adults are not alright in America,\" said Dr. Ken Duckworth, chief medical officer of the National Alliance on Mental Illness, who was not involved in the study.\"We are in August and this is a biopsy of almost 6,000 people from June,\" he said. \"There's a mental health crisis resulting from this pandemic.\"Looking ahead, Duckworth said that he would be interested to see follow-up data on what some people who otherwise would be at high risk for mental health consequences of the pandemic -- such as essential workers or caregivers -- are doing to not experience certain mental health symptoms compared with their peers who have reported symptoms. Duckworth also added that the new findings align with previous studies, which found symptoms of anxiety and depressive disorders increased considerably in the United States between April and June compared with the same period last year -- and call volumes to the National Alliance on Mental Illness have gone up, he said.\"If you're a state policy director, if you're a mental health commissioner, if you run a health plan, you need to know this information. There's a whole subset of people -- caregivers, people with pre-existing conditions, people of color, essential workers -- these people are going to need mental health support,\" Duckworth said. \"This is part of the human experience here that's happening to your fellow Americans.\"",

        "body": "(CNN)Parents and pediatricians need to be on the lookout in the coming months for a rare, paralyzing condition that affects young children, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Tuesday.\n\nThe polio-like condition, called acute flaccid myelitis or AFM, tends to peak every other year, and the last surge of cases was in 2018, when 238 cases were diagnosed across the US, the CDC said.This year is likely to see another upsurge but things will be complicated by the coronavirus pandemic.\"AFM is a priority for CDC as we prepare for a possible outbreak this year,\" Dr. Thomas Clark, deputy director of CDC's Division of Viral Diseases, told reporters.\"We are concerned that, in the midst of a Covid pandemic, that cases might not be recognized as AFM, or we are concerned that parents might be worried about taking their child to the doctor if they develop something as serious as limb weakness,\" Clark added.Read MoreThe CDC released results of a study done after the last outbreak in 2018. It put almost all the affected children into the hospital. Patients were 5 years old on average. Most had a fever, respiratory illness or both a few days before they started showing the muscle weakness that is the most telling symptom of AFM. \"In addition to weakness, common symptoms at clinical evaluation were gait difficulty (52%), neck or back pain (47%), fever (35%), and limb pain (34%),\" the CDC said in its report.\"Overall, 98% of patients were hospitalized, 54% were admitted to an intensive care unit, and 23% required endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation.\"The CDC is following up with families now to see how the children have fared in the two years since they were affected. Some may be permanently affected, the CDC said.Quick action neededClark said parents and doctors need to act quickly if children show any symptoms of limb weakness or pain after an infection and should not hesitate to get them to the hospital, even in the middle of the coronavirus pandemic. An evaluation can tell doctors if AFM is possible and quicker treatment might help children recover better, the CDC said.\"Enteroviruses, particularly EV-D68, are likely responsible for the increase in cases every two years since 2014. AFM is a medical emergency and patients must be hospitalized and monitored in case they progress to respiratory failure,\" the CDC said. Another virus called EV-A71 is also suspected of causing some cases of AFM. \"Multiple viruses, including West Nile virus, adenovirus, and nonpolio enteroviruses, are known to cause AFM in a small percentage of infected persons,\" the CDC said.Enteroviruses are common. They cause about 10 million to 15 million infections a year in the United States, according to the CDC. Although they're around all year long, they're most common in the summer and fall, which is also when AFM peaks.Typically, enteroviruses cause cold-like symptoms such as fever, runny nose and body aches, and people recover easily.\"We don't yet know why certain kids develop AFM when the great majority who have a respiratory illness recover without neurological symptoms,\" Clark said. Connection to Covid-19 unclearDr. Robert Redfield, the CDC's director, said his agency is watching to see how the coronavirus pandemic will affect the expected circulation of the viruses linked with AFM. \"It is not known how the COVID-19 pandemic and the social distancing measures may affect the circulation of viruses that can cause AFM, or if COVID-19 will impact the health care system's ability to promptly recognize and respond to AFM,\" Redfield said in a statement.\"If social distancing measures decrease circulation of enteroviruses this year, AFM cases may be fewer than expected or the outbreak may be delayed.\"But he said parents need to be alert. As the parent of six children and grandparent of 11, Redfield said he understands the instinct to hope symptoms just go away on their own. But limb weakness should be taken seriously. \"We want parents to realize it is a potentially serious sign,\" Redfield told the briefing.Whatever parents do to reduce the risk of coronavirus infection will also help prevent the infections linked with AFM, the CDC said. That includes careful hand hygiene, cleaning surfaces, mask use and physical distancing.Acute flaccid myelitis first started causing concern in 2014, when it was diagnosed in 120 patients in 34 states. Since then, the number of cases has risen in an every-other-year pattern. The CDC confirmed 22 cases in 2015, 149 cases in 2016, 35 cases in 2017 and 238 in 2018.\n\nCNN's Michael Nedelman and Sandee LaMotte contributed to this report.",

        "body": "(CNN)A sudden change in federal guidelines on coronavirus testing came this week as a result of pressure from the upper ranks of the Trump administration, a federal health official close to the process tells CNN, and a key White House coronavirus task force member was not part of the meeting when the new guidelines were discussed.\n\n\"It's coming from the top down,\" the official said of the new directive from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.White House coronavirus task force member Dr. Anthony Fauci said he was in surgery and not part of the discussion during the August 20 task force meeting when updated guidelines were discussed.\"I was under general anesthesia in the operating room and was not part of any discussion or deliberation regarding the new testing recommendations,\" Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta. \"I am concerned about the interpretation of these recommendations and worried it will give people the incorrect assumption that asymptomatic spread is not of great concern. In fact it is,\" he said.Read MoreThe new guidelines raise the bar on who should get tested, advising that some people without symptoms probably don't need it -- even if they've been in close contact with an infected person. Previously, the CDC said viral testing was appropriate for people with recent or suspected exposure, even if they were asymptomatic.CDC would not comment on questions about its own policy change. A CDC spokesperson referred all questions to the Department of Health and Human Services.In a statement to CNN, HHS Assistant Secretary Brett Giroir said: \"This Guidance has been updated to reflect current evidence and best public health practices, and to further emphasize using CDC-approved prevention strategies to protect yourself, your family, and the most vulnerable of all ages.\"HHS has not specified what change in \"current evidence\" may have driven the change. In a call with reporters Wednesday afternoon, Giroir said the update to the CDC guidelines on testing was deliberated and approved last week.\"This was discussed at the last task force meeting and approved, I think that was Thursday of last week,\" Giroir told CNN's Jeremy Diamond on the call. \"We posted this on Monday morning.\"Giroir said in the call that the updated CDC guidelines were written by multiple authors, adding that he, Fauci, Dr. Deborah Birx and Dr. Stephen Hahn, the commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, worked on the updated guidelines. Giroir said the focus was to do more \"appropriate\" testing, not \"less\" testing, and said, \"it cannot be interpreted that we are inhibiting local public health.\"But the new directive also lines up with a trend in policy and rhetoric from the White House. President Donald Trump has repeatedly suggested the US should do less testing.Dr. Carlos del Rio, an infectious disease specialist and associate dean of Emory University School of Medicine, said on CNN Newsroom on Wednesday that the CDC has not provided evidence to explain the changes. \"I mean, the evidence that I'm aware of as of today is that close to 40% of the cases of the infections are asymptomatic and asymptomatic people transmit the infection,\" Del Rio said.\"So, not testing -- I mean, if you have been in contact with somebody for a few minutes, that's okay. But if you have been in contact for 50 minutes and that people doesn't have a mask, I think you need to be tested regardless if you have symptoms or not. We know especially young people going into the house and then transmit inside the household. So, the guidelines baffle me and I really don't understand them.\" New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo accused the Trump administration of using the CDC as a political tool for the campaign.\"The only plausible rationale is they want fewer people taking tests because, as the president has said, if we don't take tests you won't know that people are covid positive and the number of covid positive people will come down,\" Cuomo told reporters Wednesday. \"It fosters his failed policy of denial,\" he said of the President.This story has been updated with comments from Dr. Anthony Fauci.\n\nCNN's Betsy Klein, Kristina Sgueglia, Andrea Diaz and Jacqueline Howard contributed to this report.",

People who develop symptoms again within three months of their first bout of Covid-19 may need to be tested again if there is no other cause identified for their symptoms.\n\nIn a statement emailed to CNN on Friday, a CDC spokesperson said the guidance is \"based on the latest science about COVID-19 showing that people can continue to test positive for up to three months after diagnosis and not be infectious to others.\"\n\nYet \"this science does not imply a person is immune to reinfection with SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, in the 3 months following infection. The latest data simply suggests that retesting someone in the 3 months following initial infection is not necessary unless that person is exhibiting the symptoms of COVID-19 and the symptoms cannot be associated with another illness.\"\n\nThe statement noted that people with Covid-19 should be isolated for at least 10 days after showing symptoms and until one day after their fever subsides without the use of fever-reducing medications.\n\nThe statement added that CDC will continue to closely monitor the evolving science for information that would warrant reconsideration of these recommendations.",

Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds.\n\n(CNN)Not enough Blacks and Latinos are participating in US vaccine trials to fight Covid-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus. CNN en Espa\u00f1ol Medical Correspondent Dr. Elmer Huerta hopes to change their minds.\n\nMore than 50% of cases of Covid-19 in the United States are African Americans or Latinos, yet they make up only 15% of participants in the first Phase III vaccine trial in the United States, co-developed by biotech company Moderna and the National Institutes of Health.In fact, National Institutes of Health Director Dr. Francis Collins gave the trial a \"C\" grade for recruiting minorities.\"From the first week I saw the numbers, and they were not as encouraging as I would have liked,\" Collins told CNN.The vaccine could be delayed if the trials don't recruit enough minorities. That's why Huerta, a longtime public health advocate, volunteered for the Phase III trial.Read More\"When you have a clinical trial, it's extremely important for all the races and ethnicities to be represented because sometimes there are differences in toxicity and effectiveness of a medication or vaccine,\" Huerta said. \"As a Latino I thought it was very important for me to participate.\"Huerta, who is a professor of medicine at George Washington University, was elected president of the American Cancer Society in 2007, becoming the first Latino president in its history. He is also the founder and director of the Cancer Preventorium at the Washington Cancer Institute, and hosts several radio programs with RPP Noticias de Per\u00fa focusing on health care and more. Why are Black and Latinos hardest hit?There are a number of reasons why Black and Brown communities have higher risks for catching Covid-19 and having more severe reactions that can lead to hospitalization and death.One factor is that long-standing discrimination and social inequities can lead to limited access to health care and make those populations more likley to have underlying medical conditions such as diabetes and heart disease, according to a US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report released earlier this month.There are also structural factors, such as economic and housing policies; and social factors, such as essential worker employment status requiring in-person work, according to the CDC report. Black leaders agree that it's hard to recruit Black people into the vaccine trials.\"When we Black people hear 'clinical trials,' we think 'we're not going to be researched on,' and that's across economic status and across educational status, not just one sector,\" Renee Mahaffey Harris, president and CEO of The Center for Closing the Health Gap in Cincinnati, told CNN Senior Medical Correspondent Elizabeth Cohen.Huerta, who takes questions on his Spanish-language podcast, \"Coronavirus: Realidad vs. ficci\u00f3n con Dr. Elmer Huerta,\" hopes his own efforts will make a difference. \"Please, especially African Americans and Latinos who are underrepresented in this study, consider it,\" Huerta said. \" You are going to get your injection, you will participate, the study lasts for 25 months, and you will be helping yourself and the community.\"Half the study participants receive the real vaccine, and half get a placebo. Participants will track if they have symptoms or side effects for about two years. In the meantime, Huerta has some advice. \"We want to remind you that - until we have an effective and available vaccine or medication - the use of a mask, keeping a distance of at least two meters from other people and washing your hands frequently, are the best measures to fight against infection by the new coronavirus,\" said Huerta, in a recent podcast. Practicing one of those safety measures should not cause the others to be neglected, he added. All are necessary to win the fight against this deadly new disease.Have a question about coronavirus?

        "body": "(CNN)Are parents really supposed to be reassured by all this talk about \"mild\" cases of Covid-19 in children? What about the unfortunate \"few\" youngsters who have died or come down with a strange and severe associated illness?\n\nNo parent wants to take the odds that their child might be the exception to the rule.\"We've had 90 deaths in children in the United States already, in just a few months,\" Dr. Sean O'Leary, vice-chair of the American Academy of Pediatrics Committee on Infectious Diseases, told CNN's Anderson Cooper on Monday.\"It's not fair to say that this virus is completely benign in children,\" he said.As a number of schools and universities across the country have begun classes or are moving forward with plans to begin full or partial in-person instruction in the coming weeks, fears among families are on the rise. The question looms: Will our children be safe? Read MoreAfter all, there has already been a 90% increase in the number of Covid-19 cases among children across the US in just the last four weeks, according to data released this week by the AAP.In Florida, where most public schools haven't opened yet, seven children have died, three in just the last month. Hospitalizations due to Covid-19 among children in Florida rose by 105% during the same four week time frame, from 213 to 436.Because most children have been sheltering at home until recently, it's not surprising that the numbers of cases in children were low at the start of the pandemic.\"Kids just haven't had that many contacts,\" said CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta in a Tuesday Facebook Live event. \"As we're seeing kids develop more and more contacts, we are seeing the numbers go up. And they're going up at an increasingly rapid pace. This is why I am worried about schools.\"We've got to approach this judiciously because if we have terrible outbreaks in schools, and if people get sick -- kids, faculty, teachers, whoever gets sick and someone dies -- obviously beyond the physical toll, (there is) the psychological toll, as well on communities,\" Gupta said. \"Which is something that really worries me.\"What are the symptoms?Symptoms of Covid-19 are the same in children as they are in adults.\"If you look at the long list of potential symptoms -- congestion, cough, fever, loss of sense of smell -- they can all happen in both adults and children,\" O'Leary said. Other key signs include any difficulty in breathing; a rash, especially one that is quickly spreading; a lack of energy; and problems keeping a child awake, said pediatrician Dr. Daniel Cohen, who practices close to the epicenter of the New Rochelle, New York, outbreak, where nearly 2,900 people were infected from early March through late May. \"It's very important to let the doctor know immediately if you can't really get them up, if they're falling asleep all the time and just exhausted, if they're not drinking, not eating -- the activities of daily living,\" Cohen said.Don't hesitate to call the doctorNo worry is too small to reach out to your pediatrician, experts say. Parents are the best detectives because they know how their child typically behaves.\"It may be something that you cannot communicate but something's bothering you,\" Cohen said. \"I always tell parents, 'Look, if you're nervous, I should be, too. That's just the way things are right now.' The only call that's a wrong call is the unmade one.\"O'Leary agreed. If parents \"see their child is looking particularly ill or sicker than they would expect with a typical cold or illness, they should call their pediatrician to discuss. Severe anything is always a concern.\" The pandemic is affecting the way medicine is practiced. Take fever, for example, a common sign of illness in children that might have been put on the \"watch and see\" list in pre-Covid times. \"Today if we have a child with fever, I'm talking to those parents on a daily basis because of the ambiguity and the fear we all have,\" Cohen said. \"We don't want to miss that one kid.\" It's not just the diagnosis of Covid-19, he said. \"It's watching the progression of the illness. Is this child getting sicker faster than you would like to see? And that's when you want to get them care,\" Cohen added.That guidance applies to the emotional and psychological health of children as well, O'Leary said. \"Kids being more isolated, kids showing more anxiety, more depression,\" O'Leary said. \"Those are things -- even though they're not directly related to Covid -- that need attention.\"Can you tell if your child is sick?It's an especially scary reality for parents that many young children are asymptomatic, which means there are no signs or symptoms that their kids are carrying the virus. Still others have an extremely mild case with few issues. That should be a relief for parents when it comes to their child's safety, because if a child with Covid-19 is weathering the virus well, pediatricians are just supporting and guiding the parents during the illness, Cohen said. The concern then turns to protecting others, such as siblings, parents, grandparents and the community.\"Children can be a spark and we don't want the fire to spread,\" Cohen added. \"The best way to get rid of a fire is to remove the fuel, so we keep everybody separated.\"The only way a parent might suspect an asymptomatic illness is by tracking their child's exposure to others with Covid-19 and to be aware of what is happening in the school the child attends.\"Knowing their habits, knowing who they were around, knowing their exposures are key,\" Cohen said. \"You know, a child not wearing a mask in Georgia is different right now than a child not wearing a mask in New York, because cases are rising in Georgia.\"Whether asymptomatic children should be tested for a coronavirus infection depends on \"how often the kids are being exposed to other people\" and the testing capacity in their communities, O'Leary said.\"The most important thing for getting kids back into school is really to get the virus under control in the surrounding community,\" he said. Mitigation measures that work for decreasing transmission of the virus -- wearing masks, cleaning our hands and physical distancing -- are most important, O'Leary added.Rare but severe illness linked to Covid-19Another worry for parents is multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C), It's a rare and unusual presentation in children that can appear a few days to weeks after a child has been exposed to Covid-19. \"It resembles something known as Kawasaki's, which is also an inflammatory syndrome in the body. And it can be quite devastating for children,\" Gupta said.\"Thankfully, it is rare, but it does happen,\" Gupta added. \"It does seem to happen in the United States, in the UK, more than other countries around the world, and we're still not sure why that is. But this is something that doctors, pediatricians, parents, everybody is sort of keeping an eye out on.\"As of August 6, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had confirmed 570 cases of MIS-C across 40 states and the District of Columbia, including 10 deaths. The average age of those cases is 8 years old, and 70% of the cases have occurred in Latino or non-Hispanic Black children. Dr. Kevin Friedman, a pediatric cardiologist at Boston Children's Hospital, said that although there could be aspects of the immune system that predispose certain groups to MIS-C, the effect on communities of color could also be related to higher rates of multifamily living conditions, parents holding jobs as essential workers outside the home and higher rates of preexisting health conditions. The clues of this rare syndromeThe first clue to MIS-C is a persistent fever without a clear cause, according to the AAP. If that pops up in a child who has been recently exposed to anyone who may have had Covid-19, it should \"raise suspicions.\" Other signs to look for include abdominal pain, diarrhea, swollen glands, red or swollen hands and feet, red cracked lips and pinkish or red eyes, called conjunctivitis. Rapid breathing or other respiratory signs may also be present, but are not as common.Beside the common fever symptoms, the gastrointestinal symptoms are most prevalent in children with MIS-C, with 80% to 90% of patients experiencing them, said Friedman, who is also an assistant professor of pediatrics at Harvard Medical School. Children with MIS-C get sick rapidly, the AAP says, and may soon show signs of shock. When examined, they show symptoms of multi-organ dysfunction and high inflammatory blood levels of inflammation.Most children with MIS-C will need to go to the hospital, the CDC says, and some will need care in the pediatric intensive care unit.However, experts like Friedman believe there's a milder form of MIS-C that doesn't quite surface in public health reporting. \"We're probably only experiencing the tip of the iceberg with this disease,\" he said. \"Some mild cases are also occurring.\" MIS-C can be prevented the same way we prevent coronavirus spread in general, he added. That means making sure you and your family are washing your hands regularly, complying with universal mask adherence and practicing social distancing. It's one more thing to watch out for as kids go back to school, but the condition is still very rare. \"Any place where there is Covid exposure, there will be MIS-C too. It is inevitable that we'll see this with the reopening of schools,\" Friedman said, adding that in his experience the vast majority of children with MIS-C improve and \"they improve quite quickly.\" Not sure your child is sick or just stressed?Some parents may be concerned with more typical parenting issues -- like if their child is truly sick or possibly just avoiding getting up early. Because we're in a pandemic, experts say it's best to assume the child is not faking symptoms.\"Many kids are having depression or mood reactions to the pandemic, so that can also affect energy level and motivation,\" said developmental behavioral pediatrician Dr. Jenny Radesky, an assistant professor of pediatrics at the University of Michigan.\"Similarly, if your child tends to have headaches or stomachaches in response to stress, or has a sensitive stomach, then use that information to help you not overreact to new complaints,\" she adds. After all, we are all storing a lot of stress in our bodies these days. When asking about symptoms, she adds, don't ask direct questions such as '\"Does your throat hurt? Does your tummy feel weird?\"\"Children will say automatic yes and no responses,\" Radesky said. \"Instead ask 'What feels bad? Point to it. What does it feel like?' \" Finally, remember this: \"It's hard to fake a fever. Fevers are not psychosomatic,\" she said. \"When in doubt, call your child's doctor. They know how to differentiate organic symptoms from psychosomatic reactions.\"You still could be sending a sick kid to schoolStill, no matter how careful a parent is, \"because so many kids with Covid-19 are asymptomatic, it's certainly still possible that you are sending a child with asymptomatic Covid-19 to school,\" Radesky said. \"We need more surveillance testing of asymptomatic students and teachers, otherwise we may feel false reassurance that we are sending a non-contagious child to school,\" Radesky said.In a commentary published Tuesday in the journal JAMA Pediatrics, a Stanford University School of Medicine's pediatrics team recommended that schools follow a three-pronged testing approach, carried out in collaboration with local hospitals:All students with symptoms must be tested; Schools should conduct random student and staff testing to identify asymptomatic patients (important for children especially); and students from high-risk households should be offered testing more frequently\"As many school districts face budgetary constraints, schools must evaluate their options and identify measures that are particularly important and feasible for their communities,\" the authors wrote.",

        "body": "(CNN)Terri Wilder became dreadfully ill in 2014, falling asleep immediately each day after she got home from work and laying in bed all weekend, recovering just enough to drag herself to work the next week.\n\n\"I could barely raise my hand to hail a cab,\" she said.After nearly two years, Wilder was diagnosed with a disease called myalgic encephalomyelitis, also called chronic fatigue syndrome, a neuroimmune condition with symptoms including brain fog, severe fatigue, pain, immune aberrations and post-exertional malaise.She had worked for decades as a social worker and activist for marginalized communities, focusing on HIV research and education programs and LGBTQ health. Wilder was shocked to find that ME/CFS lacked a drug approved by the Food and Drug Administration, and scientists studying the disease only received about $5 million annually in research funding from the National Institutes of Health.At that point, she found herself in an altogether new marginalized disease community, reminiscent of the stigmatized groups she fought for at the height of the AIDS epidemic in the 1980s. Read MoreA chronic disease, ME/CFS can last for decades. It often takes root following some form of viral infection, for instance Epstein-Barr virus or Ross River virus. The novel coronavirus is just one more virus that can potentially trigger the onset of this debilitating condition. Wilder fears that hundreds of thousands of people with Covid-19 could develop the same illness plaguing her. And leading medical experts have the same concern.\"Even after you clear the virus, there are post-viral symptoms. I know, because I follow on the phone a lot of people who call me up and talk about their course,\" said Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, in a July 17 interview with Medscape.\"It's extraordinary how many people have a postviral syndrome that's very strikingly similar to myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome.\"Many are falling ill and staying illMore than six months into the global coronavirus crisis, many who contract Covid-19 are not fully recovering. Up to 35% of those diagnosed with Covid-19 were not back to their normal selves two to three weeks after testing positive for the coronavirus, according to a July 24 report by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Of the 292 people the CDC surveyed on post-Covid recoveries, those recovering from Covid-19 reported a median of seven of the CDC's 17 symptoms. Thirty-five percent reported fatigue. And one in five younger people ages 18 to 34 without any other chronic medical conditions reported they had not fully recovered.One of those still struggling with symptoms months later is CNN anchor Chris Cuomo, who first announced that he tested positive for the coronavirus on March 31.Speaking on his show on July 14, he noted that myalgic encephalomyelitis had been suggested to him as a reason why he hasn't fully recovered.\"I've got brain fog that won't go away,\" Cuomo said. \"I've got an onset of clinical depression, which is not sadness. People keep saying to me, 'Don't be sad.' I'm not sad. I'm depressed. It's different. I can't control it.\"Cuomo has regularly talked on air about his battle with Covid-19, and he's conversed with viewers on Twitter about his journey, many of whom say their Covid-19 symptoms are lingering, too.\"I can't recover from workouts the way I did before,\" he continued.Failure to recover from exercise, or post-exertional malaise, is often considered a hallmark ME/CFS symptom, according to a 2015 report by the National Academy of Medicine. That report also estimated that 836,000 to 2.5 million Americans suffer from ME/CFS, although most are not diagnosed.At present, ME/CFS is estimated to have a $17 billion to $24 billion impact on the US economy, based on medical bills and patients' lost income due to many being unable to work, according to the CDC.If you have chronic Covid-19, it's important to restLiving with ME/CFS, seeing Covid-19 pillage her city and reading press reports of Covid-19 patients not recovering has left Wilder on edge.She has been using all her connections from her career in public health to help raise the alarm about chronic symptoms that so-called Covid \"long-haulers\" are likely to face for months or years to come.On Friday, Wilder is facilitating a webinar for people facing the lingering effects of Covid-19. That event, in collaboration with the Myalgic Encephalomyelitis Action Network, sold out quickly with minimal advertising, showing her that there's likely a big need for the information she and ME/CFS clinicians are providing.\"The first thing that terrifies me is 'Don't exercise.' You can make yourself sicker,\" Wilder said. \"This is something that everyone with ME wishes that somebody had told them in advance. We don't want people to go through the things that we did.\"Those with ME/CFS should prioritize activity management, or pacing, the CDC recommends. This means you should understand your physical and cognitive limits, and not push beyond them, as this will result in a crash, setting you back on your recovery. \"Some patients and doctors refer to staying within these limits as staying within the 'energy envelope,'\" the agency said.Researchers are monitoring how patients' symptoms progressA number of research and support groups are setting up to help people struggling with long-term Covid-19 symptoms and to explore how and why immune system abnormalities might lead to ME/CFS.More than 14,000 people have joined an online Covid-19 support group on the website of Body Politic, which describes itself as a queer feminist health collective and media company. The community offers insights for those who have tested positive, are experiencing symptoms or are recovering from Covid-19. And it contains special sections for those whose Covid symptoms have lasted beyond 30 or 90 days.Members of Congress are taking notice as well.Democratic Rep. Jamie Raskin of Maine is co-sponsoring a bill, HR 7057, the \"Understanding Covid-19 Subsets and ME/CFS Act.\" The proposed legislation calls for $60 million in federal funding, or $15 million annually through 2024, for projects including data collection, collaborative research centers and a medical research program to be executed by the National Institutes of Health and the US Department of Veterans Affairs.One of the groups that would likely vie for additional federal resources is the Open Medicine Foundation, a collaborative of scientists focusing on ME/CFS research with centers at Stanford University and Harvard University.The group launched a study of Covid-19 patients that will monitor how their disease and its possible aftereffects, specifically chronic conditions that might occur after an illness, evolve. The researchers will analyze patients' genomes, as well as complete protein and metabolism profiles at regular intervals.\"Covid-19 gives us an unprecedented opportunity to advance our understanding of post-viral disease,\" said Dr. Ami Mac, the director of translational medicine at the Stanford Genome Technology Center, which is associated with the OMF. \"This could result in a longstanding public health disaster leaving in its wake untold numbers of new sufferers of a condition that feels like a 'living death' for those of us afflicted,\" Mac, who has ME/CFS, said.In the next couple weeks, she hopes to finish building an app by which researchers can follow Covid-19 patients and the symptoms, tracking how and when they develop symptoms consistent with ME/CFS.\"We plan to obtain blood samples over a few years longitudinally to allow us to see which molecular changes occur that prevent resolution of symptoms,\" she said.Both Mac and Wilder plan to keep dedicating themselves as strong advocates for Covid-19 long-haulers who need all the support, scientifically and socially, that they can get.One way Wilder did that was by asking Fauci a question about ME/CFS and Covid-19 at a July 9 news conference organized by the International AIDS Society. Fauci's acknowledgement of the link garnered international headlines, and afterwards he went on to compare the two conditions publicly on at least two other occasions last month. \"Because of my HIV background and my knowledge of social activist groups like Act Up, I just quickly realized we have to work together and I have to take advantage of every opportunity available to me,\" Wilder said.",

        "body": "(CNN)If college campuses want to remain open this fall, it may take frequent screening of college students, according to a modeling study published Friday in the journal JAMA Network Open.\n\nThe researchers found that screening college students every two days -- even with a low-quality test catching 70% of positive Covid-19 cases -- is a cost-effective regimen, estimated to keep infections at a more controllable number than screening weekly with a higher-quality test. But if students and colleges adhere to strict policies such as mandated indoor masking and handwashing, the authors said less frequent testing may be adequate. Read MoreBeware false-positives The researchers also found that too much testing risks generating false-positive cases that may undermine student confidence in their university's surveillance program and overwhelm quarantine spaces. The researchers recommend a test with high specificity that is able to mitigate instances of these false-positive results. Yale public health Professor A. David Paltiel, the study's lead author, said that some colleges may not be able to logistically meet the high bar that their data suggests for reopening amid the pandemic. \"Our view is that if you can't see your way toward at least minimal meeting of these screening standards or maintaining control over prevention, then a school really needs to ask itself if it has any business reopening,\" Paltiel said. The researchers modeled a hypothetical cohort of 5,000 students, 10 of which were positive for Covid-19, to assemble data on the most cost-effective monitoring program that would minimize total infections and reduce strain on isolation or quarantine spaces. Under the researchers' modeling, they failed to find a plausible circumstance in which waiting to act until symptoms emerge would be sufficient for containing an outbreak. As some universities do not currently plan to test their students regularly, Paltiel said such policies would be \"like a fire department that only responds to calls once they have verifiable evidence that the house has already burned to the ground.\" \"If things go awry, the consequences are going to be borne, not so much by the students, but by the staff, the dining hall workers, the faculty members and the surrounding community,\" Paltiel said. Dr. Rochelle Walensky, who is chief of infectious diseases at Massachusetts General Hospital and a CNN Medical Analyst, said she firmly believes the type of test required to surveille college campuses is different than tests, such as the nasopharyngeal swab, to identify symptomatic people in a hospital or general community. She said colleges need tests that, for example, swab the inside of the cheek that can be run \"like a pregnancy test\" with a short turnaround time. \"I'm a physician in heart and spirit,\" said Walensky, a co-author of the paper in JAMA Network Open. \"And the diabetics test themselves for sugar four times a day, so it's not impossible to think that frequent, rapid testing would be easy and doable.\" Student compliance is key In a commentary published alongside the study, other scientists called the research's implications \"important\" but also said its conclusions underestimate student ability to adhere to behavioral interventions, along with public health efforts for mitigating Covid-19 spread on campuses. Walensky argued that colleges do not know how their students will behave until they are back on campus and that colleges could start testing aggressively and dial back, if necessary. \"The downside of not starting aggressively and doing, for example, only symptom-based screening is you won't know an outbreak until it's already happened,\" Walensky said. Colleges have a responsibility to provide students with adequate screening, masks and hand hygiene supplies such as hand sanitizer, according to Paltiel. But he also said that students will need to stay socially connected, and it falls to colleges as \"the adults in the room\" to create imaginative and realistic options for students to enjoy their youth, while ensuring student safety. \"I think we need to be really careful to set students up to succeed rather than setting them up to fail, and later to scapegoat them for what went wrong,\" Paltiel said.",

        "body": "(CNN)Colorado State University has paused all football-related activities indefinitely, the school's director of athletics said, after learning of racism and verbal abuse allegations from within the Rams' athletic administration and in the football program.\n\nThis comes after Colorado State had announced earlier in the week that it had launched an investigation into its athletic department following a report alleging players had been told not to report Covid-19 symptoms or they would see reduced playing time.\"Today, we learned of some extremely troubling allegations of racism and verbal abuse from CSU's athletic administration generally and in the football program specifically,\" athletics director Joe Parker said in a statement Friday.\"Colorado State University is committed to being an anti-racist university, and we will not tolerate any behavior or climate that goes against that core value. Moreover, CSU Athletics is committed to the health and well-being of student-athletes above all other priorities, and this includes their mental health. We believe it is our responsibility to make sure that all student-athletes feel welcomed and valued as members of an inclusive athletics community.\"Parker's statement said the pause includes all practices, workouts and team meetings. The statement also said that he had asked university President Joyce McConnell to expand the independent investigation announced earlier in the week to include a comprehensive review of the athletic department and football program regarding the allegations of racism and verbal abuse.Read More\"While we have been working hard towards playing football this fall, the holistic well-being of our student-athletes is our unequivocal top priority,\" Parker said. \"We must and will address these allegations before we focus on playing football.\"On Tuesday, Colorado State announced it had begun an investigation into its athletic department following a report alleging players have been told not to report Covid-19 symptoms or they will see reduced playing time.According to a report by the Fort Collins Coloradoan, coaches have told football players not to report coronavirus symptoms and threatened them with limited playing time if they quarantine. The report also alleges that the athletic department is changing contact tracing reports so players can continue to practice.\"The story raises concerns about whether the health and well-being of our student athletes is truly the top priority of Colorado State University,\" McConnell said in a statement Tuesday.\"I tell you all now that nothing is more important to me or to CSU than the health and well-being of our students. Nothing. They are our purpose and our responsibility, each and every one of them, whatever sport they play or major they declare.\"The investigation is being handled by McConnell's office.The Coloradoan report cited statements from multiple anonymous sources in the department. One current Rams football player told the paper, \"I believe there is a cover-up going on at CSU ... It's not about the health and safety of the players but about just trying to make money off the players.''Players dispute claims regarding coronavirusSeveral Rams players disputed the claims in the report on social media Tuesday.Quarterback Todd Centeio tweeted, \"Coming from a player with a compromised immune system. I never once felt like @CSUFootball ever put me in jeopardy. I have felt very comfortable and safe while going through both voluntary and mandatory workouts. The allegations are not true.\" Defensive lineman Toby McBride wrote in a Twitter post, \"Lots of misinformation. All coaches wear masks at all times. We fill out a symptom questionnaire daily before we are allowed into the facility. They even provided us w/ masks and wash them daily. The athletes/staffers that complained are the same ones not following protocol.\"And defensive lineman Scott Patchan tweeted, \"Name the sources. Cause when I was sick I was urged to call the trainer right away lol. And we have a team meeting every morning stressing the importance of doing the right things. So I'm calling bs.\"Head football coach Steve Addazio, who was hired in December after spending seven seasons at Boston College, said in a statement Tuesday, \"The health and welfare of our student-athletes on the Colorado State football team is our top priority, and I fully support President McConnell's investigation into concerns about whether these protocols were properly followed by everyone involved with our program.\"We want every student-athlete to have confidence that we are taking every possible measure to ensure their safety, and we will continue working with the training staff, the athletic department and the University to evaluate and implement any additional steps necessary to live up to our high standards.\"Colorado State is scheduled to open its season at home on September 19 against Northern Colorado.",

Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds.\n\n(CNN)Despite frequent warnings from health officials that big gatherings can spread Covid-19, large groups continue to congregate across the United States leading to outbreaks in communities, on college campuses and beyond.\n\nUniversities in at least 19 states have reported outbreaks, some tied to large group gatherings.Following what the dean of students and head of public safety called \"incredibly reckless behavior,\" 23 Syracuse University students were suspended Thursday after gathering on the campus quad at night. The next day, citing \"a rapidly escalating increase\" in the percentage of people testing positive for the virus, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill announced that testing would be implemented for three residence halls.Meanwhile, at least 26 cases of coronavirus in three states are being linked to the Sturgis Motorcycle Rally, which drew thousands of people to South Dakota earlier this month. And an individual who tested positive for the virus after a Maine wedding reception has died according to a statement Saturday from Robert Peterson, CEO of Millinocket Regional Hospital. At least 32 positive cases were linked to the August 7 wedding, CNN has previously reported. Read More\"We are sorry to share that this patient passed away early (Friday) afternoon. Our thoughts and sympathies are with her family as they cope with this difficult loss,\" Peterson said. Masks could save 70,000 lives, Murray saysTo prevent outbreaks from becoming even more widespread, Dr. Chris Murray said it's time for local governments to enforce more stringent mask rules.\"It will take a concerted effort but the impact is extraordinary, it's really quite extraordinary what it could achieve,\" Murray, chief of the University of Washington's Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, told CNN's Anderson Cooper on Friday night. \"It really depends on what our leaders do, (both) as individuals, and what governments do.\" IHME projected that if nothing about the nation's approach to prevention changed, death rates would dip in September but rise later in the fall, and the total would reach about 310,000 by December 1.But if significantly more people -- about 95% of the US population -- wore masks, the projection of total deaths from now to December would drop by almost 70,000, he said. On the other hand, if governments ease current social distancing restrictions and mask mandates, the daily US death toll could reach 6,000 by December, up from his current prediction of 2,000 daily, Murray said.Over 176,000 people have died of Covid-19 in the US since the pandemic began, and more than 5.6 million have been infected, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.Coronavirus case rates have been dropping for weeks in parts of the US, but death rates have been relatively elevated.Some states see positive changesNew York and New Jersey were early hotspots of the coronavirus pandemic but both reported encouraging signs this week.New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy tweeted Saturday afternoon that the state saw its lowest number of coronavirus-related hospitalizations since March 24.\"It's incredible what we've achieved by pulling together as one New Jersey family, but we're not over the finish line yet. Keep it up,\" he posted.And New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo's office reported in a news release Saturday that the infection rate in the state stayed below 1% for 15 straight days, setting a new record low.For the first time in two months, the number of coronavirus-related hospitalizations in Mississippi dropped below 1,000, according to Gov. Tate Reeves.Meanwhile, other states are reaching troubling milestones.California's death toll is nearing 12,000, the California Department of Public Health said Saturday. With 95 deaths reported Saturday, Georgia broke 5,000 coronavirus deaths.Concerns and questions around the new school yearThe start of a new school year with in-person classes has brought trepidation to some Americans as more young people suffer infections.In Florida, a 6-year-old girl became the youngest person in the state to die from coronavirus complications. Health officials say they still don't know if the child contracted the virus from a known case or if it was travel related.Many schools across the country have implemented increased measures to protect students and staff against the virus, even though researchers are still learning how the virus spreads among young children.For older students, universities have responded to rising numbers with more preventative measures.On Sunday, Georgia Tech reported 33 new cases of Covid-19, including 17 members of a Greek organization. This brings the total number of coronavirus cases at George Tech to 251.On Friday the University of Miami reported four students in its Hecht Residential College had tested positive for Covid-19, officials said on the university's Covid-19 website. Those students, and several others \"who have shown symptoms,\" were immediately removed from their floors and are in isolation, officials said.Florida State University in Tallahassee has now created \"a rapid COVID-19 test laboratory that turns around results in 24 hours\" and its own contact assessment team, FSU spokeswoman Amy Farnum Patronis told CNN.At Florida Atlantic University in Boca Raton, students began moving into campus dorms on a staggered schedule with designated hours to promote social distancing.\"I think it's everywhere. I don't think there's any hiding from it. I think just protecting yourself is the best thing you can do,\" Kari Thronson, the parent of a college freshman, said.Many colleges have already reversed plans for in-person classes and returned to remote learning after coronavirus cases were detected on campus, leading to quarantines.Towson University in Baltimore County, Maryland, is temporarily moving to online classes after 55 people tested positive for Covid-19 on campus over two days last week, the university said Saturday. At East Carolina University, its Interim Chancellor Ron Mitchelson said Sunday that two weeks after welcoming students on campus, they are moving to online classes due to a \"rapid acceleration\" of cases and \"multiple clusters,\" a release said from the Greenville, NC university. The University of Notre Dame in Indiana announced Tuesday that undergraduates would be learning remotely for the next two weeks after a spike in Covid-19 cases since students returned to campus on August 3. Since August 3, more than 408 students have tested positive, according to Notre Dame's online health dashboard.\n\nCNN's Sheena Jones, Jennifer Henderson, Melissa Alonso, Ganesh Setty and Elizabeth Joseph contributed to this report.",

        "body": "(CNN)A gathering of people in Maine to celebrate the joyous occasion of a wedding has sparked an outbreak of the coronavirus, according to officials.\n\nThe wedding guests attended a reception on August 7 at Big Moose Inn in Millinocket, according to the Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention. The Big Moose Inn is a 37 acre property that includes a restaurant, cabins and campgrounds near Baxter State Park. The Inn has hosted weddings since the 1970s and can accommodate 100 guests in their Fredericka's Restaurant, according to their website.\"Right now, we do not know if the outbreak originated at the Big Moose Inn or whether there may have been additional sites of transmission at other points during the gathering,\" Dr. Nirav Shah, Maine CDC director, said during a news conference on Tuesday. He added that the reception was a connecting point for the group and the agency is still investigating the outbreak. \"What we know right now is that the reception that occurred there on August 7 was a connecting point and that there may have been other sources of transmission in addition to the reception at Big Moose Inn,\" Dr. Shah said. Read MoreCNN reached out to Big Moose Inn for comment and did not receive a response.On Monday, Maine CDC announced the wedding reception had approximately 65 guests. In total, 24 people have tested positive for Covid-19 in connection with the event, according to the agency. They added that 18 of those cases were individuals who attended the reception and six others who had close contact with reception attendees.All those testing positive are residents of the state of Maine, according to Maine CDC. The state has 4,197 reported cases and 127 reported deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University's tally of cases in the United States.The agency is conducting contact tracing for guests, staff and people who might have had close contact with individuals with confirmed cases. They encourage anyone who attended the event and has symptoms to contact their health care provider.\"What I think is really important about this situation is that it is another reminder that Covid-19 exist everywhere in Maine and it can spread really quickly when large groups of people gather,\" Dr. Shah said.While it is unclear if the event was held indoors or outdoors, the state requirements for large gatherings are currently capped at 50 people for indoor events and 100 people for outdoor events. If the space cannot accommodate five people per 1,000 feet then fewer individual can attend, according to state governor's executive orders. \"I ask everyone to remember this situation as you attended social gatherings of your own,\" Dr. Shah said. \"Things like wearing a face covering and maintaining physical distancing is as important today as any time in the outbreak investigation.\"\n\nCNN's Dave Alsup contributed to this report.",

But new research suggest that the virus and its symptoms are often no where near finished by that benchmark.According to research published Tuesday in the British Medical Journal, patients may need to wait over a month before being retested to know whether they have cleared the virus.The study also suggests that about one in five negative tests are false negatives, meaning many are still spreading the virus after testing negative without knowing it.Even once patients do test negative, many patients are reporting that their symptoms -- from aches to loss of smell to brain fog and affected mood -- can last months longer.Read More\"We think that this long-term damage may in part be due to vascular damage, kind of a footprint that the virus leaves even when it's gone from the body,\" Dr. William Li told CNN's Chris Cuomo earlier this week, adding that researchers have seen the virus damaging blood vessels that connect the entire body.And with so much still unknown about the virus, Li said it isn't clear when \"long haul\" patients will be back to the lives they had before.The virus has killed 184,689 in the US since the pandemic began, according to Johns Hopkins University.Tests available for $5 in SeptemberLack of access to tests has been a roadblock to getting the coronavirus pandemic under control in the US, experts have said. But this month, $5 rapid tests will be sent out to states, Admiral Brett Giroir, the head of US Covid-19 testing efforts, said Tuesday.The nasal swab antigen test does not require an instrument to read it and comes with a free smartphone app so the healthcare provider can record the test results and automatically send it to public health systems.Giroir said 48 million tests a month will be available to the US.\"I want to assure all of you that we will continue to build the testing ecosystem to support flattening the curve and saving lives,\" said Giroir. \"Full speed ahead in terms of quantity, quality and diversity of testing to support our national strategy.\"Testing availability and speed has improved in the US, particularly since the disastrous spring delays. Giroir said 91.9% of results from major referral labs, which do about half the tests in the US, were completed in three days. The mean turnaround time in August for large referral labs was 2.27 days.Still, that 2.27-day average delay allows the virus to quietly spread, and public health and lab industry experts have repeatedly called on the federal government to take a larger leadership role in coordinating testing supplies.Covid found in university sewage systemNow that many colleges and universities are returning to the classroom, cases are breaking out across campuses.Colleges and universities in 37 states have reported a total of 25,000 cases, according to a CNN tally. Among them are the University of Missouri, where there are 424 active cases among students since classes resumed last week, and the University of South Carolina, which has reported over 1,000 active cases. Officials at the Utah State University have issued mandatory testing and quarantine for 287 students across four residence halls after they found elevated amounts of the virus in sewage samples.The mandatory quarantine is effective immediately and will continue until the test results are returned. USU has also activated a Covid Care Team to arrange for resources to assist the affected students, including meal deliveries.\"This testing isn't new to Utah, it started shortly after the pandemic began and has been successful in monitoring the spread of the disease,\" said Amanda DeRito, a director with the university. \"The benefit of testing the water is that we get a snapshot into what is happening on campus and can quarantine even before a student becomes symptomatic. It is also less invasive.\"Some officials hold back while others move ahead to reopenSome state and local officials are putting more measures into place to rein in the spread of the virus, while others are moving forward to reopen.Oregon Gov. Kate Brown extended the coronavirus state of emergency to November 3.\"When I last extended the COVID-19 state of emergency in June, I told Oregonians that we were at a crossroads: we could work together to stop the spread of COVID-19 in Oregon, or we could watch infections and hospitalizations spike,\" Brown said in a statement. \"Until there is an effective vaccine for COVID-19, this disease can spread like wildfire if we let our guard down.\"But elsewhere, officials are relaxing measures.Under California's new four-tiered reopening system, San Francisco officials announced the city would move to Phase 2, which would allow hair salons, nail salons, massage parlors and gyms to resume outdoors in the coming days. More entertainment sites and houses of worship will be able to open with limitations in the coming weeks.And North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper announced that Friday will bring the state to Phase 2.5 of its reopening, which will increase gatherings to 25 people indoors and 50 outdoors. Playgrounds will be opened, along with museums and aquariums at limited capacity.\"We're encouraged to see North Carolina holding steady on most and decreasing on some of our key data metrics,\" Cooper said. \"Because of our stable numbers, today we're ready to take a careful step forward.\"\n\nCNN's Annie Grayer, Maggie Fox, Lauren Mascarenhas, Renee Baharaeen, Rosa Flores, Jen Christensen and Nakia McNabb contributed to this report.",

Ron DeSantis wants to \"give the fans what they want\" when it comes to sports returning to schools and college campuses this upcoming school year.\n\nDeSantis made the remarks during a news conference in Jacksonville Thursday where he pushed for the return of girls and boys sports in his state.\n\nDeSantis said \"there is a risk out there\" with sports. But, he doesn't foresee youth sports teams operating in an \"NBA style bubble.\"\n\nInstead, when an athlete develops symptoms, that athlete would be isolated and tested. And the athlete could then return 10 days after displaying symptoms.\n\n\"What I would not do is just... shut down everything else. I mean I think if everyone else is fine, you got to just keep going,\" DeSantis said.\n\nDeSantis said the vast majority of youth either have zero or mild symptoms. The governor said that as a father, if his children were old enough to play sports, he would want them to play.\n\n\"I would want them playing,\" DeSantis said. \"If they bring something back to the house, I mean, as much as I wouldn't want that, I would rather take that risk, than to deprive them of the opportunity. You know, to do things like this. But that's just me as a father, the calculation I would make.\"",

        "body": "(CNN)Companies testing Covid-19 vaccines should know by the end of the year whether any can protect people from the virus, federal officials say.\n\nOfficials with the Operation Warp Speed coronavirus vaccine effort told reporters Friday that the public-private partnership is not cutting corners, but that it may not take long to tell if one or more of the vaccines works.Paul Mango, deputy chief of staff for policy at the Department of Health Human Services, said during a phone briefing that Operation Warp Speed was \"absolutely on track... if not a little ahead\" in the race to have a Covid-19 vaccine by 2021.\"There are no guarantees in science, but what Operation Warp Speed does is maximize the probability of having at least one vaccine,\" Mango said. \"We obviously have two of our six vaccine candidates that are in phase three clinical trials right now... We will have four vaccines in phase three clinical trials by the middle of next month.\"LIVE UPDATESRead MoreMango said the Food and Drug Administration had asked that each trial enroll 30,000 subjects, \"and we are above the halfway point,\" with manufacturing already underway for three vaccines.But he said the process of approving any eventual coronavirus vaccine would be the same as for any vaccine.\"There is a thing called a Data Safety Monitoring Board, an independent body that is assigned to each clinical trial,\" Mango said. \"We have no insight into the data until the DSMB says we can look at it. They can come back and say, 'This is not a good vaccine.' They could come back before we even have 30,000 folks enrolled and say, 'We have enough. This looks great.'\"Mango said Operation Warp Speed will likely continue if President Donald Trump loses the presidential election in November, given that the \"vast majority\" of people working on it are not political appointees.FDA extends use of Covid-19 drugMeanwhile, the FDA has extended its emergency use authorization for remdesivir to all patients hospitalized for coronavirus, regardless of the severity of their disease.An EUA allows the FDA to expedite use of a coronavirus drug that has not yet received full approval. The FDA originally authorized remdesivir for emergency use in May only for patients with severe coronavirus who needed help breathing with extra oxygen or mechanical ventilation. The drug has been shown to shorten recovery time for some coronavirus patients.The FDA said Friday that clinical trials of remdesivir, including phase three trials, showed a five-day course of the drug could reduce recovery time in moderately ill patients with pneumonia from Covid-19. \"The data show that this treatment has the potential to help even more hospitalized patients who are suffering from the effects of this devastating virus,\" FDA Commissioner Dr. Stephen Hahn said in a statement.Iowa tops some state-by-state rankingsSince January, US health authorities have identified more than 5 million cases nationwide, and more than 180,000 people have died, according to the latest data compiled by Johns Hopkins University. The United States has averaged 41,991 new cases over the last seven days, down 10% from the previous week, according to Johns Hopkins.Iowa has overtaken the top spot in the nation when it comes to the highest 7-day average of new cases per 100,000 people, the data show, with 31.49. It is followed by North Dakota, Mississippi, Alabama and South Dakota.Iowa also reported a record high daily number of new cases, Johns Hopkins reports, with 2,681. It is followed by Minnesota, North Dakota and South Dakota.More than 300,000 deaths predicted by year endA well-known coronavirus model previously cited by the White House forecasts more than 317,000 US deaths from Covid-19 by December.As of Friday morning, the model from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington projects that 317,312 people may die from the illness -- marking an increase of about 8,000 deaths from a previous estimate the model projected a week ago. The new IHME estimate suggests that the US could see more than 136,000 additional deaths between now and December, and the daily death rate could rise to more than 2,000 per day.Yet IHME researchers noted on their website on Thursday, when they updated their model, that \"if mask wearing in public increases to 95%, more than 67,000 lives could be saved.\"Another forecast by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention puts the number of US deaths at 200,000 by September 19.The projections published Thursday forecast 200,292 deaths by September 19, with a possible range of 195,824 to 207,269 deaths.\"State- and territory-level ensemble forecasts predict that the number of reported new deaths per week may decrease in 18 jurisdictions. Trends in numbers of future reported deaths are uncertain or predicted to remain stable in the other jurisdictions,\" the CDC says on its forecasting website.Unlike some individual models, the CDC's ensemble forecast projects only about a month. The previous ensemble forecast, published August 20, projected roughly 195,000 coronavirus deaths by September 12.Health officials 'concerned' about new testing guidelinesThe National Association of County and City Health Officials and the Big Cities Health Coalition say they are \"incredibly concerned with both the impact and the process\" of the CDC's abrupt testing guidelines changes this week and urged in a letter sent on Friday that the CDC change course.The CDC changed its Covid-19 testing guidelines Monday to say some people without symptoms may not need to be tested, even if they've been in close contact with someone known to have the virus. Previously, the CDC said viral testing was appropriate for people with recent or suspected exposure, even if they were asymptomatic.\"Rather than empowering public health professionals and moving our nation forward in a cohesive way to address the pandemic, this abrupt change has caused confusion, consternation and undermined the credibility of the agency with public health professionals and the public alike,\" the letter says. \"This revision and its resulting impact is adding yet another obstacle for public health practitioners to effectively address the pandemic.\" The letter says that the lack of evidence cited to inform the changes has them \"troubled,\" and changing testing guidance to suggest close contacts of those with confirmed Covid-19 do not need to be tested is \"inconsistent with the science and the data.\" Caution urged around schoolsIn a statement Friday, American Academy of Pediatrics President Dr. Sally Goza urged the CDC to reverse its decision.\"The inexplicable decision by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to advise against testing individuals who have been exposed to the virus but who are asymptomatic is a dangerous step backward in our efforts to control this deadly virus,\" she said.Goza said this testing will yield information that is crucial to answering questions about how the virus is transmitted, especially among children, who often show few or no symptoms.\"To control this virus, so that we can safely re-open schools and resume activities that allow children to be healthy and happy, we need the ability to conduct widespread testing and collect more information -- not less,\" Goza said.Vermont Commissioner of Health Mark Levine said the state will not change its Covid-19 testing guidelines despite the new guidance issued by the CDC, with residents there still required to get tested if they think they have been exposed to the virus.During a coronavirus press conference, state officials said that about 65% of students would participate in remote learning a few days a week. \"We are watching the numbers, the data and the signs,\" to see if schools and the economy will open more, Vermont Governor Phil Scott said.In Georgia, Gwinnett County Public Schools said Friday that 34 of its more than 12,000 teachers had resigned for Covid-19-related reasons.The district started the school year remotely but began the phase in to in-person instruction this week. Teachers in Georgia's largest school system had recently protested the district's plan to phase students back into the classrooms. In hurricane-hit Louisiana, Governor John Bel Edwards said Friday he was concerned about the slowdown in testing for Covid-19 after schools reopened.\"Frankly, we can not afford to loose sight of our testing, because it was about three weeks ago that our schools came back,\" Edwards said. \"We have had students back on our college campuses, and as you know it takes about two weeks after behavior changes to see if there is any changes in positivity, which will lead to more hospitalizations and deaths.\" \"So this is a very bad week for us not to be doing robust testing,\" Edwards said at a press conference.Study finds saliva tests as effective as nasal swabsResearchers said Friday that inexpensive saliva tests that patients can administer themselves to check for coronavirus work at least as well as tests taken via nose swabs -- and might even work better.A team at Yale University who developed an inexpensive saliva test compared it to tests taken the traditional way, by nasopharyngeal swabs.\"We tested saliva specimens collected by the patients themselves and nasopharyngeal swabs collected from the patients at the same time point by health care workers,\" Nathan Grubaugh of the Yale School of Public Health and colleagues wrote in a letter to the New England Journal of Medicine.They found the samples were as useful for detecting coronavirus as the swabs were. \"In addition, a higher percentage of saliva samples than nasopharyngeal swab samples were positive up to 10 days after the Covid-19 diagnosis,\" they wrote.\n\nCNN's Naomi Thomas, Lauren Mascarenhas, Jacqueline Howard and Maggie Fox contributed to this report.",

        "body": "(CNN)Fires burning across California and Colorado are pumping out smoke that would be bad enough on its own, but might also worsen coronavirus symptoms, doctors warned Thursday\n\nThree doctors in California say residents should be aware that wildfire smoke worsens respiratory symptoms and could lead to increased ER visits for asthma and other respiratory issues. Smoke particles from the fires, which spread for hundreds of miles, damage the lungs, said Dr. Stephanie Christenson, a University of California San Francisco assistant professor of medicine. The particles, 20 to 30 times smaller than the diameter of a hair follicle, \"can get in and lodge deeply in the lungs and cause inflammation,\" Christensen told a briefing sponsored by UCSF.\"And that is also what we were worried about in Covid-19, whereas people get more severe disease, the inflammation in their lungs can overwhelm the system, and potentially cause really severe issues,\" she said.Read MoreIt's not certain smoke worsens coronavirus symptoms, she said, but it probably does.ER visits may soarEmergency rooms can expect an increase in the number of patients showing up with respiratory symptoms, said Dr. Jahan Fahimi, medical director of the UCSF Emergency Department.\"During times of poor air quality, emergency departments will oftentimes be on the receiving end of patients with respiratory complaints and so we do expect that in places where the wildfires are particularly raging bad, that those ERs will likely see an uptick in the number of patients presenting to the ER,\" Fahimi said.This is where things get tricky when dealing with a pandemic and wildfires. People are being told the outdoors is safer for averting coronavirus infections. \"That certainly is true,\" Fahimi said.\"However, when the air quality is this bad, outdoor poses a whole new risk with respect to the wildfire exposure. All the more reason to shelter in place and stay at home.\" Cotton masks not adequateAnd then there is the issue of masks.\"Important to remind people that the cloth face coverings that people are wearing with regard to Covid-19 do not protect you - by in large, do not protect you - from wildfire smoke exposure,\" said Dr. John Balmes, a UCSF professor of medicine in the divisions of occupational and environmental medicine and pulmonary and critical care.That doesn't mean people should nix the cotton masks altogether. \"If you can't get either a surgical mask or an N95, wear the cloth mask, because the most important thing right now is to protect others from transmission of the virus,\" Balmes said. Plus, said Fahimi, people infected with Covid-19 \"who are irritated by wildfire smoke may cough and sneeze and spread that virus, so ever more important for everyone to wear to wear masks.\" And what about the firefighters working on the front lines, in close quarters, sleeping in tents and eating together?\"It's an issue,\" Balmes said. \"The US Forest Service has been concerned about this for months.\"Crews with the US Forest Service are trying to camp separately and socially distance. When firefighters aren't on the front lines, they are wearing masks, he said.Compounding the issues -- CalFire often utilizes prisoners on the fire lines.\"Prisoners have been particularly hard hit with SARS-CoV-2 infection,\" Balmes said. This year at a fire training camp for prisoners, \"I think about half of the people being trained came down with the SARS-CoV-2 infection,\" he said.\"It's a big problem and we have to really support our firefighters. They are working really hard in very dangerous conditions and are really at risk for both Covid-19 and the effects of wildfire smoke,\" he said.",

The new research, described in a letter to the editor published in the journal Rhinology, suggests that loss of taste and smell in Covid-19 patients isn't simply due to congestion in the nose.\"We know that Covid-19 behaves differently to other respiratory viruses, for example by causing the body's immune system to over-react, known as a cytokine storm, and by affecting the nervous system,\" Carl Philpott, of the University of East Anglia's Norwich Medical School who was involved in the research, said in a news release on Wednesday.\"So we suspected that patterns of smell loss would differ between the two groups,\" he said.Philpott and his colleagues studied smell and taste function in 10 Covid-19 patients, 10 acute cold patients and 10 healthy people who served as a control group.Read MoreThe researchers not only found that the smell and taste function of Covid-19 patients was significantly worse than in both the cold patients and the healthy individuals -- but also the ability to detect sweet and bitter tastes was particularly impaired in Covid-19 patients.\"It is particularly interesting that Covid-19 seems to particularly affect sweet and bitter taste receptors, because these are known to play an important role in innate immunity,\" Philpott said in the release.Philpott called for additional research to explore the relationship between the virus and these taste receptors.\"It was this loss of true taste which seemed to be present in the Covid-19 patients compared to those with a cold,\" he said in the release.The researchers believe that loss of taste in Covid-19 patients isn't just more severe, but is caused by a different mechanism in the olfactory system, which is responsible for the body's sense of smell. The researchers say their findings indicate that Covid-19 patients are experiencing a direct loss of the ability to taste, rather than an indirect loss of taste because the sense of smell is impaired.Covid-19 can produce increased inflammation throughout the body. The researchers suggest that this inflammation can damage taste receptors. They say it is also possible that Covid-19 can affect a part of the brain stem connected to the sense of taste.Both the Covid-19 and cold patient groups in the study reported improvement in their sense of taste and smell over time, although only 30% of Covid-19 patients reported complete recovery. The researchers say it is likely that a portion of the Covid-19 patients will experience persistent loss of taste after they clear the virus.The research had some limitations, including the small study size. More research is needed to determine whether similar findings would emerge among a larger group of Covid-19 and cold patients.Yet overall, Philpott and colleagues say smell and taste tests can discriminate between Covid-19 and cold patients, which means these tests could potentially be an additional screening tool for those with the novel coronavirus.The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention includes a \"new loss of taste or smell\" on its list of Covid-19 symptoms to watch for.\"What's called anosmia, which basically means loss of smell, seems to be a symptom that a number of patients developed,\" CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta told CNN anchor Alisyn Camerota on \"New Day\" in July.That symptom appears to be more prevalent in mild or moderate cases of Covid-19, and tends to appear at the beginning of the illness. It may even be one of the first signs that you are sick.\n\nCNN's Sandee LaMotte contributed to this report.",

        "body": "(CNN)Coronavirus cases linked to the Sturgis motorcycle rally in South Dakota last week have now reached across state lines to Nebraska, public health officials said.\n\nAt least seven Covid-19 cases in Nebraska's Panhandle region have been tied to the rally, Kim Engel, director of the Panhandle Public Health District, confirmed in an email to CNN. The department said that contact tracing had been completed, and declined to comment further.The cases that have appeared in Nebraska are the latest to be connected to the 80th annual Sturgis motorcycle rally, which took place August 7-16.South Dakota state health officials announced Thursday that a person who worked at a tattoo shop in Sturgis had tested positive for the virus, and could have possibly exposed people during the event last week. Read MoreThe person was an employee of Asylum Tattoo Sturgis, and could have spread the virus to others on August 13-17 from 10 a.m. to 2 a.m., officials said.Earlier this week, officials said a person who spent hours at a bar during the rally had also tested positive. That individual visited One-Eyed Jack's Saloon in Sturgis on August 11 from noon to 5:30 p.m. while able to transmit the virus to others, health officials said. Anyone who visited either the tattoo shop or the saloon, which are located at the same address, during that period should monitor for symptoms for 14 days after the visit.Rally had raised concernsHealth experts were concerned that this year's Sturgis motorcycle rally could be a \"super spreader\" event. The 10-day mass gathering typically draws crowds of more than 500,000 people from all over the country, including coronavirus hotspots.South Dakota Department of Transportation officials tracked more than 462,000 vehicles entering Sturgis during the rally. Though the total was a 7.5% decline from the previous year, it is still one of the largest mass gatherings since the start of the pandemic.Many of the attendees did not comply with health guidelines such as wearing masks and keeping distance from others, as seen at a concert for the rock band Smash Mouth.A little more than 60% of people in Sturgis voted against holding the motorcyle event. But city officials said they felt they wouldn't have been able to stop the crowds from coming in and instead opted to prepare for the event as best they could.\"There are people throughout America who have been locked up for months and months,\" Daniel Ainslie, the city manager, told CNN last week. \"So we kept hearing from people saying it doesn't matter, they are coming to Sturgis. So with that, ultimately the council decided that it was really vital for the community to be prepared for the additional people that we're going to end up having.\"South Dakota reported 193 new cases on Friday. It's one of several US states that have seen an increase in new cases this past week compared to the week prior, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.\n\nCNN's Eric Levenson and Christina Maxouris contributed to this report.",

        "body": "(CNN)Covid-19 deaths in the US should start dropping around parts of the country by next week, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention director said, as Americans stick to mitigation efforts that help curb the spread of the virus.\n\nSo far, more than 5.5 million Americans have been infected and at least 174,255 have died, according to Johns Hopkins University. The country's seven-day average for daily deaths has topped 1,000 for at least 24 days in a row. Mitigation measures like controlling crowds and shutting down bars work, CDC Director Dr. Robert Redfield said Thursday, but it takes time until they're reflected in the numbers. \"It is important to understand these interventions are going to have a lag, that lag is going to be three to four weeks,\" Redfield said in an interview with the Journal of the American Medical Association. \"Hopefully this week and next week you're going to start seeing the death rate really start to drop.\"The daily average of new cases in the US has been on the decline for weeks. Redfield's message comes as one Trump administration official said Covid-19 case trends are now \"going in the right direction.\"Read MoreBut Redfield warned that while officials have observed cases fall across red zones in the country, cases in yellow zones across the heart of the US aren't falling. \"Middle America right now is getting stuck,\" he said. \"That is why it's so important for Middle America to recognize the mitigation that we talked about ... it's for Middle America too, the Nebraskas, the Oklahomas.\"\"We don't need to have a third wave in the heartland right now,\" he said. \"We need to prevent that.\"Superspeading events help drive pandemicIn rural areas, superspreading events have been especially important in helping drive the pandemic, researchers in Georgia said this week. Superspreading events like parties, conferences and large gatherings have been cautioned against by leaders throughout the country. Earlier this month, experts raised concern about a motorcycle rally in a small South Dakota town which was expected to bring tens of thousands of visitors. Biostatistician Max Lau of Emory University and a team analyzed Georgia health department data in more than 9,500 Covid-19 cases in four metro Atlanta-area counties and Dougherty County in rural southwestern Georgia between March and May.\"Overall, about 2% of cases were directly responsible for 20% of all infections,\" they wrote in their report. Younger people were more likely to spread the virus than people over 60, the Georgia study showed.In Ohio, the governor said that while the state has seen a significant decrease in cases across urban areas, infections have increased in rural areas. \"Spread is primarily, we're seeing in social situations, family gatherings where people are unmasked, and in close contact and basically let their guard down,\" Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine said Thursday.Up to 60 million Americans likely infected Experts have for long said the true number of infections throughout the country is likely many times higher than the cases reported. On Thursday, Redfield said as many as 60 million Americans could have contracted the virus -- more than 10 times the number of cases recorded. \"I think if you're going to do a crude estimate, somewhere between 30 and 60 million people -- but let's let the data come out and see what the data shows,\" he said. There are many reasons behind why the number of true infections remain uncertain.Many cases were missed early on in the pandemic due to a lack of testing capacity. And many Americans who never got tested in the first place could recover from the virus without ever knowing they had it. Last month, the CDC estimated about 40% of people infected with the virus don't show symptoms. White House declares teachers essential workers Meanwhile, amid a turbulent back-to-school season the White House made a new push for a return to education normalcy. Teachers were declared essential workers in what is the administration's latest effort to pressure school districts to bring students back this fall. Under Department of Homeland Security guidance issued this week, teachers are now considered \"critical infrastructure workers,\" and are subject to the same kinds of advisories as other workers who have born that label -- such as doctors and law enforcement officers.Guidance for essential workers state they can continue to work even after exposed to a confirmed case of the virus, as long as they remain asymptomatic. Across the US, institutions have been torn between remote instruction or implementing dozens of new measures to prevent virus clusters around in-person learning. Many teachers have protested a return to in-person instruction, saying doing so could prove deadly. Some have opted to resign instead of going back to class amid the pandemic. In Arizona, three teachers who shared a classroom teaching online during the pandemic all contracted the virus earlier this summer, despite following safety protocols. One of them died less than two weeks after being hospitalized. As some schools reopened, more than 2,000 students, teachers and staff members across several states were asked to quarantine following more than 200 positive cases reported. And as university campuses now welcome students into dorms, colleges across at least 15 states have reported Covid-19 cases, tracing back to athletics, Greek life or off-campus gatherings.\n\nCNN's Sarah Westwood and Shelby Lin Erdman contributed to this report.",

        "body": "(CNN)The coronavirus pandemic has had an especially harsh impact on people with intellectual and developmental disabilities -- and they need special support, a group of specialists argued Friday in a letter to the American Journal of Psychiatry.\n\nMany of these vulnerable people have lost the critical support they need and can't advocate for themselves, Dr. John Constantino, director of the Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities Research Center at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, wrote along with a group of colleagues at other institutions. Web-based technology often is not helpful to people with disabilities, and many can't understand what they need to do to protect themselves from the virus.\"People with intellectual and developmental disabilities were disproportionately isolated prior to the pandemic, and the intensification of that isolation stands only to weaken the community for all citizens,\" the authors wrote.Most people with intellectual and developmental disabilities require in-person care or critical therapeutic support in their living environments, they noted. Access to those services has been temporarily lost by many during the pandemic. Read MoreRestoring this must be a first priority, but it has to be done safely; in-person staff must ensure that they protect their clients from Covid-19 infection. While there has been emerging guidance on the safe care and support of individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities, it's still evolving and hasn't reached all the places where it's \"desperately needed.\" The authors also wrote that it's not always presented in a way that can be fully understood by the people with intellectual and developmental disabilities.Social distancing and other mitigation efforts have also likely had a disproportionate impact on those with intellectual and developmental disabilities, many of whom require physical proximity to caregivers and loved ones.Additionally, the technologies that have allowed millions of people across the world to stay in touch have not had the same benefit for those with intellectual and developmental disabilities, who benefit from being physically close to caregivers and loved ones \"to make day-to-day life fulfilling, predictable, and manageable.\" Virtual interaction, when it is accessible, is \"an inadequate substitute\" for many with intellectual and developmental disabilities, they wrote. Telehealth, while it does have many potential advantages, can also leave gaps in critical aspects of health care for this segment of the population.Solely relying on telehealth could create problems for those who cannot verbalize or adequately communicate pain, discomfort or symptoms to providers and when it comes to monitoring for things like adverse effects of medication, which is often done in person.The letter's authors are directors of the Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities Research Centers Network, a nationwide group funded by the National Institutes of Health's Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, and leaders of the Association of University Centers on Disabilities.",

Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds.\n\n(CNN)Just days before classes are slated to resume, colleges across the country are finding it may be next to impossible to create a coronavirus-free environment on campus.\n\nYoung people -- who US officials say helped drive a nationwide surge of new coronavirus cases over the summer -- are now returning to college campuses across the country. With them have come reports of hundreds of infections. Despite efforts to keep the virus at bay, outbreaks have been traced to off-campus gatherings, sororities and fraternities, and dorms, leaving schools to reassess how to proceed with the fall semester.At Appalachian State University, a cluster was associated with the football team. Iowa State University said 175 students tested positive for the virus -- about 2.2% of those tested -- during move-in.\"It's just extremely difficult to consider yourself to be in a bubble when there is a very high level of community spread around you or when people are coming from all over the country and congregating on college campuses,\" said Dr. Leana Wen, the former Baltimore City Health Commissioner. \"You can't keep coronavirus out.\"There are the universities reporting coronavirus casesRead MoreAcross the US, the spread of the virus is still very much not under control. The country has reported more than 1,000 new deaths in a day at least 12 times this month. In Florida, officials reported deaths of more than 200 people in a day -- for at least the 10th time in the past month. More than 5.4 million Americans have been infected since the start of the pandemic and at least 171,821 have died. While older Americans and those with underlying conditions are at greater risk of severe illness, health officials have emphasized it's not only those populations that should be cautious.Coronavirus cases in children steadily increased from March to July, experts said earlier this month and one in three children who were hospitalized were admitted to intensive care -- the same as adults. And younger people who may recover from the virus with minimal symptoms and in many cases don't require hospitalization, still can have \"residual symptoms for weeks and sometimes month,\" said Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.\"We'd better be careful when we say 'Young people who don't wind up in the hospital are fine, let them get infected, it's OK.' No, it's not OK,\" Fauci said during an American Society for Microbiology briefing on Monday. Track the virus 14 students asked to leave Drake University campusSome university leaders made it clear from early on that there will be zero tolerance when it comes to violating safety guidelines. Fourteen Drake University students were asked to leave the campus for two weeks after violating an agreement signed by students that outlined health and safety protocols for the year. Several of the students \"are now facing repercussions through the Code of Student Conduct,\" said a letter from the Dean of Students Jerry Parker.\"This message is not intended to call out the students involved -- it is a reminder that we must hold each other accountability,\" Parker wrote.The letter echoes the sentiment of another university president, who sent a stern warning to students who don't follow safety guidelines.\"Let me be perfectly clear, if we don't do these things, YOU WILL BE SENT HOME and more importantly, our community members' health will be at risk,\" Villanova University President Peter M. Donohue wrote last week.Coronavirus: Your questions, answered Universities change class plans Rising cases have led some colleges to scrap plans for in-person learning to start the school year. All undergraduate classes at the University of Notre Dame will be remote for the next two weeks as the university tries to get a recent spike in coronavirus cases under control, the president announced this week. Michigan State University classes will begin remotely for all undergraduates, President Samuel L. Stanley announced. UNC - Chapel Hill is also moving to remote learning for undergraduates starting Wednesday, Chancellor Kevin Guskiewicz and Vice Chancellor Robert Brown said in a letter about a week after classes started.\"In just the past week (Aug. 10-16), we have seen COVID-19 positivity rate rise from 2.8% to 13.6% at Campus Health. As of this morning, we have tested 954 students and have 177 in isolation and 349 in quarantine, both on and off campus,\" the letter said.The school said it still plans to play sports this fall, despite no longer holding in-person classes. The University of Alabama announced spectators will be allowed at home football games, saying this week it prohibits tailgating on campus but will allow fans to fill up about 20% of the Bryant-Denny Stadium. That venue usually holds about 20,000 fans. Ithaca College, in New York, which previously pushed back its fall in-person semester to October, announced this week it was shifting to remote instruction for the entire semester.\"I sincerely believe this is the correct and responsible choice for Ithaca College to help protect the health and safety of our students, their families, our faculty and staff, and our Ithaca-area communities,\" President Shirley M. Collado wrote in a letter to the community.Saliva test could be in use within weeks Meanwhile, SalivaDirect, the test that got the green light from the FDA last week, could be in use by approved labs within the next few weeks, says Anne Wyllie, an epidemiologist at Yale School of Public Health who was part of the team responsible for the protocol.\"It's been actually very inspiring to see how many labs have already reached out to us -- how many are ready and willing to get going with SalivaDirect,\" Wyllie told CNN.This is great news for many Americans who still have to wait several days to receive their results -- a waiting period that some health officials have called counterproductive to the country's efforts to get the virus under control. The test doesn't require specialized supplies and can deliver results in less than three hours. Officials have called the test a \"game changer\" and one expert has also pointed to its expected low cost.\"We simplified the test so that it only costs a couple of dollars for reagents, and we expect that labs will only charge about $10 per sample,\" said Nathan Grubaugh, a Yale assistant professor of epidemiology.\n\nCNN's Amanda Watts, Naomi Thomas, Annie Grayer, Jamiel Lynch, Giovanna Van Leeuwen and Jennifer Henderson contributed to this report.",

        "body": "(CNN)As Covid-19 started to spread across the United States earlier this year, dermatology offices began to see suspicious signs on some patients' skin: Red or purple toes, itchy hives, mottled bumps on fingers, a lacy red rash that spread across legs and arms.\n\nBut were those truly associated with the novel coronavirus? After all, many other factors could be at play.\"Many viral infections can trigger a skin rash, so when you catalog these case reports, you have to have other data. Was the patient on a medication a week before the rash began? Are there other possible causes?\" asked Dr. Art Papier, an associate professor of dermatology at the University of Rochester Medical Center in New York.\"This is the challenge that Covid-19 brings up. With these different types of presentations and different rashes, is it hives because the patient just has hives or hives related to Covid-19?\"Case reports began to be released in medical journals. The latest, published Wednesday in the journal JAMA Dermatology, describes the experiences of four patients with severe Covid-19 who were admitted to hospitals in New York City in March and April.Read MoreThe patients, ages 40 to 80, had discoloration of their skin as well as lesions called retiform purpura, according to the research report. Biopsies were performed for each patient and they showed that the patients had a type of vasculopathy, meaning that their blood vessels were affected.The researchers -- from NewYork-Presbyterian/Weill Cornell Medical College -- wrote in their report that the skin discoloration could represent partial occlusion or blockage of blood vessels, and the retiform purpura could represent full blockage.Such rashes and discoloration of the skin can be a \"clinical clue\" to there being possible blood clotting in the body, the study said. Since early on in the pandemic, doctors have noticed that severe Covid-19 could cause abnormal blood clotting in patients.The report comes with some limitations, including that the researchers were not able to confirm the precise timing of when rashes and other issues with the skin first appeared for each patient. Also, more research is needed to determine whether similar findings would emerge among a larger group of Covid-19 patients.Yet overall, the researchers wrote in their report that physicians caring for Covid-19 patients should be aware of skin discoloration and rashes as \"potential manifestations\" of abnormal underlying blood clotting.'Many viral infections can affect the skin'Doctors and researchers from around the world also have reported about other types of skin rashes among Covid-19 patients. Covid-19 often triggers significant inflammation in its victims, in some cases producing the so-called cytokine storm that appears to be causing the worst damage in advanced patients.The skin is particularly sensitive to inflammation, said board certified dermatologist Dr. Seemal Desai, a spokesperson for the American Academy of Dermatology.\"The cytokines that are cranking up the immune engine of the car is what then triggers a variety of these immune molecules to go into the skin and wreak havoc on the skin,\" said Desai, a dermatologist in Plano, Texas.In July, researchers from King's College London in the United Kingdom called for skin rashes and \"Covid fingers and toes\" to be considered as a key symptom of Covid-19, even arguing that they can occur in the absence of any other symptoms.Key coronavirus symptoms that are widely accepted include fever, cough and shortness of breath, but a range of other signs have been suggested. The loss of smell and taste, another outlier, was recently included on the list of most common symptoms by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.The Kings College researchers used data from the Covid-19 Symptom Study app, which is submitted by around 336,000 people in the UK. They found that 8.8% of people who tested positive for coronavirus reported a skin rash as a symptom, compared with 5.4% of people who tested negative.The KLC team then set up a separate online survey, gathering information from nearly 12,000 people with skin rashes and suspected or confirmed Covid-19. The researchers found that 17% of respondents who tested positive for the coronavirus reported a rash as the first symptom of the disease. For 21% of people who reported a rash and had confirmed Covid-19, the rash was their only symptom.The researchers reported their findings in a pre-print study posted to the online server medRXiv.org. The findings have not been published yet in a peer-reviewed journal.\"Many viral infections can affect the skin, so it's not surprising that we are seeing these rashes in Covid-19,\" Dr. Veronique Bataille, consultant dermatologist at St Thomas' Hospital and King's College London, who was involved in the pre-print study, said in a press release in July.\"However, it is important that people know that in some cases, a rash may be the first or only symptom of the disease,\" Bataille said. \"So if you notice a new rash, you should take it seriously by self-isolating and getting tested as soon as possible.\"Measles-like rashes and rashes inside the mouthPreliminary research has suggested that skin rashes and lesions inside the mouth might be a symptom of coronavirus infection -- but researchers say more study is needed.In May, scientists around the world did a literature review and found patients were also presenting with red, itchy welts, and with a red or pinkish rash that looked a lot like measles.\"It's a reaction that we typically call morbilliform which means measles, which presents in kind of pink spots, lots of little pink spots all over the skin,\" said Papier, the dermatologist at the University of Rochester Medical Center.Another study published in JAMA Dermatology in July, found that among 21 patients in Spain who were confirmed to have Covid-19 and skin rash, six of those patients or 29% had enanthem, or lesions or rash in the mouth.The mean amount of time between the onset of Covid-19 symptoms and developing enanthem was about 12 days among the patients, according to researchers from the Hospital Universitario Ramon y Cajal in Madrid.\"This work describes preliminary observations and is limited by the small number of cases and the absence of a control group,\" the researchers wrote, adding that their findings still suggest enanthem to be a possible Covid-19 symptom and not a reaction to medications, for instance.\"Despite the increasing reports of skin rashes in patients with COVID-19, establishing an etiological diagnosis is challenging,\" the researchers wrote. \"However, the presence of enanthem is a strong clue that suggests a viral etiology rather than a drug reaction.\"",

Basic demographic information was collected for all patients. The team used survey data to estimate family income quartiles based on home addresses.Read MoreOf 1,000 people tested, 207 were positive for coronavirus. About 9.7% of those in the highest income quartile were infected, while 37.7% in the lowest quartile tested positive, Goyal's team found.Goyal, a pediatric emergency medicine specialist, described the results as \"striking.\" \"Understanding and addressing the root causes of these disparities are needed to mitigate the spread of infection,\" the team wrote.Of the patients tested, about one third were Black and about a quarter were Hispanic. The team found that the inequities existed even after they adjusted for age, sex and median family income. Inequalities could be in part due to limited access to health care and resources, as well as bias and discrimination, but the researchers said that further research is needed to understand the cause.Goyal and colleagues note that these findings may underestimate the inequities in coronavirus rates, because a physician referral was needed for testing, and minority and lower socioeconomic populations have less access to primary care physicians.Because this study focused on one site, the results may not be generalizable to other geographic locations.",

        "body": "(CNN)The multi-billion-dollar effort to get a coronavirus vaccine on the market could see delays because researchers haven't recruited sufficient numbers of minorities to join the clinical trials.\n\nOf the 350,000 people who've registered online for a coronavirus clinical trial, 10% are Black or Latino, according to Dr. Jim Kublin, executive director of operations for the Covid-19 Prevention Network. That's not nearly enough, as study subjects in trials are supposed to reflect the population that's affected. Research shows that more than half of US coronavirus cases have been among Black and Latino people.Dr. Francis Collins, director of the National Institutes of Health, gave the Moderna trial, the first in Phase 3 in the United States, a \"C\" grade for recruiting minorities. \"From the first week I saw the numbers, and they were not as encouraging as I would have liked,\" Collins told CNN.Read MoreThe stakes are high. Operation Warp Speed, the government's effort to develop a coronavirus vaccine, says it aims to deliver 300 million doses by January -- a speed unheard of in the history of vaccine clinical trials. If not enough Black people and other minorities enroll, the panel of experts who monitor the trials could force a delay until they get the numbers they need. \"That's something that's been actively discussed,\" said Dr. Nelson Michael, coordinator of community engagement activities for Operation Warp Speed. \"There's a lot of concern.\" Michael said several factors have led to \"a perfect storm of not goodness\" for recruiting Black study subjects: historical abuse of Black people in medical experiments like Tuskegee; present racial injustices and health care disparities; and recent social unrest and the financial strain placed on the Black community by the faltering economy. Black leaders agree that it's a challenge to recruit Black people into the vaccine trials, especially since it needs to happen very quickly -- the first two Phase 3 clinical trials started in late July and expect to finish enrollment in September. \"This is a very, very tall order,\" said Dr. James Powell, a Cincinnati physician who has been approached with requests to encourage Black participation in the vaccine trials. \"When we Black people hear 'clinical trials,' we think 'we're not going to be researched on,' and that's across economic status and across educational status, not just one sector,\" said Renee Mahaffey Harris, president of The Center for Closing the Health Gap in Cincinnati. Moderna and Pfizer, the two US companies currently in Phase 3 trials, won't reveal how many of their participants are from minority groups. Each trial eventually expects to recruit 30,000 participants. Moderna's 89 trial sites across the United States are \"actively working within their local communities to reach a diverse population of volunteers,\" Ray Jordan, a company spokesman, wrote in an email. \"We hope to achieve a shared goal that the participants in the (Covid-19 vaccine) study are representative of the communities at highest risk for COVID-19 and of our diverse society.\" A Fourth of July Zoom call At 10:20 p.m. on July 3, NIH's Collins sent an email to colleagues asking for a Zoom meeting the next day. \"I certainly ruined everybody's holiday,\" Collins remembers. But he said the topic was \"absolutely critical.\" He wanted to discuss how to recruit groups such as minorities and older people into the trials.Collins says he told those at the July 4 meeting, including Michael and Dr. Anthony Fauci, that they had to make sure the trials \"didn't go down the wrong path, because the default was clearly going to be that a lot of young white people would be likely to sign up, and we would have a trial that was scientifically way short of what it needed to be and would not engender anybody's confidence.\" Federal law and NIH policy mandate inclusion of minorities into clinical trials because vaccines and drugs might have a different effect on them than they do on White people. If an insufficient number of minorities sign up, the experts monitoring the trials might require additional recruitment.\"The Data Safety Monitoring Board could slow the trial down,\" Michael said. \"If the demographics aren't right, they could tell the sponsor to slow enrollment down until you hit different numbers. They could say 'We do not want you to develop a vaccine tested for safety and efficacy basically on a single ethnic group.' \" There's another reason why researchers are trying to include minorities. If everyone who volunteered for a coronavirus vaccine trial got their shot and then stayed home, at the end of the study they would likely all test negative for the virus, not necessarily because the vaccine worked, but because they never encountered the virus in the first place. That's why in any vaccine study, including this one, researchers seek out study subjects who are most likely to come in contact with the virus in their daily lives. That's health care workers, for example, and also minorities, who are more likely to have essential jobs that require in-person work, and more likely to live in multigenerational, multifamily households, among other factors. A study by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, examining reports of nearly 600,000 cases where race was indicated, found that while 13% of the population is Black, 22% of cases were Black. The report also found that while 18% of the US population is Latino, 33% of cases were Latino. Since about half of case reports don't indicate race, researchers have also looked at the incidence of Covid-19 on a county level. While nearly 20% of US counties are disproportionately Black, they account for 52% of Covid-19 diagnoses and 58% of Covid-19 deaths nationally, according to the report published last month in the Annals of Epidemiology. After that Fourth of July meeting, the mission was clearer than ever: Engage minority communities to encourage them to join the clinical trials. \"There is a tremendous amount of pressure on this now. I've never seen community engagement get this level of play. Not even close. Ever,\" Michael said. 'I'm an old white guy' Collins and Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, have made it clear they they're not the ones to speak directly to minorities to increase trust in vaccines. \"I'm an old white guy at NIH,\" Collins told USA Today in June. \"Credibility is not going to come from another bunch of government officials pounding the table and saying, 'This is good for you.'\" Fauci told CBS News last month that \"a \u202fwhite\u202f guy like me with a suit like me and a tie on going in, talking to people who are people that you don't usually relate to every day\" wasn't the best approach. \"You want to go into the African American community with people who look and think and act like the people you're trying to convince,\" he said. That's Mahaffey Harris, who has been doing advocacy and development work with minority communities for 30 years. On August 5, Mahaffey Harris received a call from a doctor asking her to recruit minorities into the Moderna vaccine trial. She knows she didn't give him the answer he was looking for. At this point, Mahaffey Harris won't recruit people for the clinical trials. She won't even put information about the trials on Covid19communityresources.com, a website run by her group, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, and other organizations. \"I am always cautious when I'm being contacted by anyone involved in pharmaceutical research because I, as a Black woman, never want to be a part of engaging and recruiting people for research that ends up having any bias in it or any hint of impropriety, like what happened at Tuskegee,\" she said. She told the coronavirus researcher she will meet with him later this month. She has received these calls in the past for other clinical trials. \"They'll say, 'I need 100 people' and I say, 'I'm not just going to get you 100 people,\" she said. None of this surprises Dawn Baker, the first person in the United States to receive a coronavirus vaccine as part of a Phase 3 clinical trial. After getting her first shot, Baker, a Black TV news anchor in Savannah, Georgia, received much love and support from her community, but also disbelief.\"Dawn done lost her damn mind,\" one woman wrote on Facebook. \"i got 2 words...TUSKEGEE EXPERIMENT,\" another wrote, referring to the infamous medical studies that abused Black men. Two people just posted GIFs of Black people shaking their heads \"no.\" Baker received her shot three weeks ago, but said concerned Black people are still coming up to her, asking if she's feeling OK.\"I told them I've never felt better,\" said Baker, who doesn't know if she received the vaccine or the placebo. \"But I can tell they're not sure if they believe me.\" Government efforts to engage minorities The NIH says it has \"engagement efforts\" with various groups, such as those that represent Black churches and Black doctors and nurses. Operation Warp Speed, a part of the US Department of Health and Human Services, says it has engaged with minority organizations as well. Collins noted that some of the Moderna sites are commercial and others are a part of NIH's network. He said when the trial began July 27, the commercial sites started up first, and the NIH sites have opened up more recently. \"The NIH funded sites are in a better position to be able to emphasize and do the community engagements, to try to reach out to minority communities,\" he said. \"Watch this space -- we're going to see this improve I think fairly rapidly,\" he said. He added he had a meeting with top Moderna executives on July 10. \"I heard from them that they were really committed to this kind of diversity in enrollment,\" Collins said. \"I heard absolutely strong endorsement of that from Stephane Bancel, the CEO, and from Stephen Hoge, the president. I was not concerned that they were considering this just a nice thing to do; they were clearly very committed.\" The NIH set up the Covid-19 Prevention Network to recruit participants into the trials. In the next week to 10 days, the network will be releasing materials, such as print and radio spots and videos for social media, targeted to specific groups, including minorities, according to Kublin, the network's executive director of operations. \"I wish it had started a month go,\" Kublin said. \"We have, all of us, been working 24/7 to make this happen as quickly as possible.\" Michele Andrasik, the director of community engagement for the network, said she recognizes the hurdle to recruiting minorities for trials, but is optimistic that progress can be made as her group works on outreach programs in partnership with community groups. \"I think there are ways we can address the challenges that are inherent at the pace of what we've all been asked to do,\" Andrasik said. What's not working: warp speed As the name Operation Warp Speed suggests, the government and pharmaceutical companies are working quickly to come up with a vaccine against Covid-19. Moderna and Pfizer started their Phase 3 trials July 27 and plan to fully enroll them in September. That's a speed unheard of in the history of vaccine clinical trials. But Black leaders interviewed for this story said mistrust of medical institutions and the government, based on centuries of abuse and injustices, can't be undone that fast. \"That doesn't happen at warp speed,\" said Dr. James Powell, a principal investigator for Project IMPACT, or Increase Minority Participation and Awareness of Clinical Trials, a part of the National Medical Association, which represents African-American physicians and their patients.\"They're not going to get the numbers for next month that they want. You have to build that trust,\" added Dr. Doris Browne, the president of the NMA.This mistrust is not just based on the Tuskegee experiment, where from 1932 until 1972, Black men were subjects in a syphilis study without their knowledge or consent and were not offered penicillin to treat their disease. It's also the legacy of Dr. J. Marion Sims, considered the father of modern gynecology, who in the mid-1800s experimented on slaves in the South, performing surgeries without their consent and without the use of anesthesia before surgery. And from the 1940s until the 1970s, in several studies, researchers exposed hundreds of study subjects, mostly Black people, to potentially fatal amounts of radiation, according to Harriet Washington, author of \"Medical Apartheid: The Dark History of Experimentation from Colonial Times to the Present.\" Injustices and disparities continue to this day. \"African-American people get treated differently. They have less access to doctors. When they describe their symptoms, they are not believed as often as Whites are. Medical technology is withheld from them. All of these things are a matter of record,\" said Washington, a lecturer in bioethics at Columbia University. \"Now we're approaching them with an experimental vaccine that we're offering as a benefit -- but asking people to trust that is asking a great deal,\" she added. \"There's a risk to taking an experimental vaccine. There's just no way to sugar coat that.\" Phase 1 and 2 trials of experimental coronavirus vaccines, with dozens or hundreds of study subjects each, have shown the vaccine to be safe. While some participants did experience symptoms such as fever and muscle aches, they felt better after a day or two. Black leaders interviewed for this story said part of the problem is they were contacted by vaccine researchers just days or weeks ago, which didn't leave them much time. John Daniels is an attorney advising a Covid-19 advisory group for the Church of God in Christ, the largest Pentecostal denomination in the United States with millions of adherents, predominantly African American. He said he received a call requesting help just two weeks ago. \"This has to be vetted through a process,\" he said. \"At the Church of God in Christ we have a health advisory group that involves a dozen or so national experts and it takes time to walk through this and translate it to the 1,500 ministers and say what are we going to do for the six to eight million people who are in our church.\" Daniels and other leaders wondered why they were contacted so recently when it's been known for many months that minorities would be needed in the trial. \"The researchers knew where they needed to be. Why did they wait until now?\" said Powell of Project IMPACT. The key for researchers to get what they want, he and others said, is to invest in long-term relationships with the Black community, and not call just at the beginning of a trial, asking Black people to roll up their sleeves and take the injections. \"Mistrust is always there when you don't invest in trustworthiness,\" he said. Browne, the NMA president, said the vaccine researchers should have involved Black doctors from the start, as part of the planning and implementation of the trials.\"We are not in any way going to come in at the last minute to be utilized as an entr\u00e9e to get African-Americans or other people of color involved in a program where we don't have a clear understanding of every phase of it,\" she said. What could work: relationships Dr. Paul Bradley knew in advance that his office in Savannah would be the very first site in the United States to give someone an injection in a Phase 3 coronavirus clinical trial. He knew that the first person he injected would get media attention. He thought about who that person should be, and Dawn Baker's name came immediately to mind. Bradley has been Baker's family doctor for more than 30 years. He knows Baker is well-loved and has tremendous credibility in Savannah. Plus, he knew that, as a local TV anchor, she would handle interviews flawlessly. And yes, she's Black -- that was a bonus, he said. He knew she'd inspire other Black people, and White people, too, to join the trial. He asked her if she was interested, and she said yes. \"We've developed a great rapport. I go to events, and he's there. I've met his family. It's not just a medical relationship. I really do trust him,\" Baker said. \"I knew Dr. Bradley wouldn't do anything to hurt me.\" The next day, many of the people who came to Bradley's office to volunteer -- both Black and White -- cited Baker as the reason. Baker said she knows there's resistance in her community to joining clinical trials, and she hopes she made a difference. \"Maybe since I was at least bold enough to come forward right now, that might change that -- that could eventually save their lives,\" she said. \"I hope that maybe just seeing my face will help them to change their opinions about that.\" Bradley's connections to the community helped in other ways, too. He's known Savannah Mayor Van Johnson for years, and the two have discussed the trials. After they talked, the mayor posted an article about the trials on his Facebook page. Recently on his \"Friday Fun\" Facebook livestream show, one of his guests was Dr. Carlos del Rio, who's running Moderna's trial at Emory University in Atlanta. \"I don't take this lightly, to speak the truth and tell people to check it out and be a part of something,\" the mayor said. \"If it wasn't for the people who stood up for the polio trials, we'd still have polio around.\" Then Bradley spoke with Ricky Temple, pastor of Overcoming by Faith, one of the largest churches in Savannah with 3,000 members. Ask any vaccine researcher about recruiting Black clinical trial participants, and they'll mention the power of churches. Their hope is that during a Sunday sermon, a preacher will encourage his or her flock to sign up. Before he spoke with Bradley, CNN asked Temple if he'd ever consider speaking about the trials from his Sunday pulpit. Temple laughed. \"You can't just have a preacher say, 'in our announcements today, trials are going to be held, and they're looking for Black people,'\" Temple said. \"The audience is going to be -- 'What they're going to come and put a germ in me?' They're going to be scared to death -- \"you gonna put coronavirus in me?'\" After speaking with Bradley, Temple surveyed those close to him in the church, asking if he should bring the clinical trials up at a Sunday service. \"I met with my staff, and no one supported me doing it. They were 100% no, because of Tuskegee. I asked members, I asked families, and I got the same response. It was incredibly consistent. What I heard was fear,\" Temple said. Temple's decision: to create a \"courageous conversation\" about the clinical trials with leaders in his church. \"We're big readers in our church, and I'll send out some documents. We have many medical professionals in our congregation, and I'll get them together, and we'll discuss this,\" he said. He wonders why he has to put together documents that can address the fears about clinical trials. If the US government is so anxious to get minorities to enroll in the trials, why hasn't someone created a website, or even a pamphlet, with information? Temple said one of the first things he'll distribute to his church leadership is information about how, in 1997, then-President Bill Clinton apologized for the Tuskegee study, saying that the men were \"lied to by their government,\" that the experiment was an \"outrage\" and \"deeply, profoundly, morally wrong.\" Clinton said he was sorry \"that this apology has been so long in coming.\" Temple thinks that might make a difference in the eyes of his congregants. \"I'll create these courageous conversations, because this is something we should pray about, something we should care about,\" he said. \"I think this could be an interesting education you can have if you open your heart to it.\"",

Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds.\n\n(CNN)Nearly a fifth of British adults likely experienced some form of depression during the coronavirus pandemic, according to official figures released Tuesday --- twice as many as before the pandemic hit.\n\nSome 19.2% of British adults likely had some form of depression in June, up from 9.7% before the pandemic, said the UK's Office for National Statistics (ONS) in a report. Conversely, 3.5% of adults experienced an improvement in their symptoms of depression.Nearly 13% developed moderate to severe depressive symptoms during the crisis, ONS said.\"Adults who were young, female, unable to afford an unexpected expense or disabled were the most likely to experience some form of depression during the pandemic,\" said Tim Vizard, principal research officer at the ONS.A large majority (84.9%) of adults experiencing some form of depression said they had been feeling stressed and anxious, and 42.2% said their relationships were being affected. In comparison, 20.7% of adults with no sign of depression said Covid-19 was impacting their relationships.Read MoreThe results are based on a nationally representative survey of adults in Britain, the Opinions and Lifestyle Survey, which asks a series of questions in order to produce a score of depressive symptoms.For example, respondents were asked if they would be able to afford an unexpected expense of \u00a3850 ($1,122), thereby indicating if they were struggling financially. Those who couldn't afford it were more likely to experience symptoms of depression.Charley Baker, associate professor of mental health at the University of Nottingham, UK, told the Science Media Centre it was \"unsurprising\" to see rates of depressive symptoms increasing.\"It's important though to avoid over pathologizing what might be seen as reasonable responses to the current pandemic, replete as it is with uncertainty and fear,\" said Baker.Elaine Fox, professor of cognitive and affective psychology at the University of Oxford, told the Science Media Centre that the ONS data is \"worrying,\" but emphasized that it provides an indication of every day feelings rather than a diagnosis.\"The most worrying aspect of these results in my view is that, given the financial problems many are now experiencing, an increasing inability to pay bills is likely to lead to ever increasing levels of depression and anxiety,\" she said. \"These economic factors are likely to play an important role in the nation's mental health in the coming months and years.\"The impact of coronavirus measures on mental health has also been revealed in the US. Earlier this month, a survey from the US Centers for Disease Control revealed that almost 41% of respondents were struggling with mental health issues stemming from the pandemic -- both related to the coronavirus pandemic itself and the measures put in place to contain it, including physical distancing and stay-at-home orders.In the US, prescriptions for anti-anxiety medicine started climbing in mid-February, spiking 34% by March 15, according to a report from Express Scripts, a Cigna-owned pharmacy benefit manager.The peak roughly coincided with the World Health Organization declaring a global pandemic on March 11 and states starting to impose stay-at-home orders.The increase in usage was nearly twice as high for women, whose prescriptions jumped almost 40%, compared with men, who saw a 22.7% rise.",

He got better around April 27, and he tested negative for the virus twice afterwards.He continued to feel well for about a month. Then on May 31 he sought care for fever, headache, dizziness, cough, nausea and diarrhea. Five days later, he was hospitalized and required ongoing oxygen support.

Their analysis suggests he had two distinct viral infections.Read MoreThe pre-print study has not yet been peer-reviewed by a journal, but the researchers noted that the findings suggest humans can catch Covid-19 multiple times.It's not the first case documented globally.Earlier this week, Hong Kong researchers said they found the first documented case of coronavirus reinfection in a 33-year-old man. He tested positive for Covid-19 twice this year.The pre-print study -- which the University of Hong Kong said on Monday has been accepted by the journal Clinical Infectious Diseases -- found that the man was reinfected with two different versions of the virus 142 days apart.\"After one recovers from COVID-19, we still do not know how much immunity is built up, how long it may last, or how well antibodies play a role in protection against a reinfection,\" Mark Pandori, the director of the Nevada State Public Health Laboratory, said in a news release Thursday.\"If reinfection is possible on such a short timeline, there may be implications for the efficacy of vaccines developed to fight the disease. It may also have implications for herd immunity,\" Pandori said. \"It is important to note that this is a singular finding. It does not provide any information to us with regard to the generalizability of this phenomenon.\"In the Hong Kong case, researchers said the man experienced coronavirus symptoms during his first bout of Covid-19, but that he didn't have any obvious symptoms the second time.",

        "body": "(CNN)CNN has received countless questions from parents and children around the country about the deadly coronavirus pandemic. As a father of three, Dr. Sanjay Gupta knows how important it is to talk to your kids about this virus and all the changes it brings. Each week, he tries to answers as many of these questions as possible.\n\nHere are some kids' questions he tackled this week.Delaney Giangeruso, age 7, Glen Ridge, New Jersey: \"My grandma got Covid-19. Her doctor says she's immune to coronavirus for one to three years. Is that true?\" Dr. Sanjay Gupta: \"First of all, I hope your grandma's doing better. I'm sure that was pretty scary. Truth is, your grandma should have some protection against the virus now, but we don't know how long and how strong that protection is, so in the meantime everyone still has to be careful.\"Months into this pandemic, much about the disease remains unknown. Although there have been claims about people having immunity once they've had it, It remains unclear if that is actually true. Additionally, it's unknown how long any sort of immunity would last. Read MoreEmmy, age 6, Atlanta, Georgia: \"Why do some people get the coronavirus but don't feel sick?\" Dr. Gupta: \"People who are older, people who have preexisting conditions like heart disease, they are more likely to get sick. Kids are less likely to get sick, but they still can, but that means we all have to do everything we can to stop the virus from spreading.\"The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention now estimates that 40% of people infected with Covid-19 don't have any symptoms or are \"asymptomatic.\" Much of the spread of the virus can come from these \"silent spreaders\" who don't realize they are carrying the virus and can unintentionally pass it to others. That's why wearing a mask and social distancing measures are so important to follow.Your coronavirus questions answeredNoah, age 7, Atlanta: \"How many people already have the coronavirus and how many more will get the virus?\" Dr. Gupta: \"As things stand now there have been about 5 million people in the United States who have been confirmed to have the infection and the numbers are likely to continue to go up. What we hope is that they eventually flatten and then come down. If we all do the right thing, that's what's going to happenBrandon, age 6, Summit, New Jersey: \"When can I hang out with Grandma and Grandpa again and not have to worry about giving them coronavirus?\"Dr. Gupta: \"We get this sort of question all of the time. The truth is I think you can see grandma and grandpa now. You just have to do it in a safe way. Maybe meet them outside, keep a little bit of distance and if you're going to get in close, put on a mask.\" (That's welcome news for grandparents too!)And finally, it's never too late to ask about the December holidays. Layla, age 3, Summit, New Jersey: \"Santa Claus, are you allowed to come to my house, now that the virus is here? Can you please?\" Dr. Gupta: \"Christmas probably will feel a little different this year, but Santa Claus is still probably going to visit homes all over the world. He may have a mask on, he may keep a little bit of extra distance, but there are ways to still have Christmas and be safe.\"Parents, take note, Christmas is not canceled this year. If your children have a coronavirus question for Dr. Sanjay Gupta, submit it below and we will be answering as many as we can.",

        "body": "(CNN)One of the questions I am getting more than any other: Am I going to send my children back to school? As a father of three teen and preteen girls, this has been a constant discussion in our household, and it hasn't been easy. My girls want to go back to school, and they are placing enormous pressure on us parents to make it so. They miss their friends, the social structure and the immersion in humanity that kids need and crave at this age. Virtual learning has played an important role for them, but it is not a substitute for in-person learning, especially for younger kids. As things stand now, my children are scheduled to start school next week.\n\nMany schools around the country have already made the decision for the students. At least 63 of the 101 largest school districts in the country decided to start the year with virtual learning. There are other school districts that have decided to go in-person, though many with virtual options. My own kids' school left the choice up to the individual families, and while it's difficult, I'm grateful we have options. Families all over the country are struggling with access to childcare, technology and even food -- all of which can make a physical return to school a necessity.Knowing my family would have to make a decision about school, we started doing our homework a few weeks ago, looking at the data and existing criteria, to come up with the best science-based choice for us.For starters, I visited my kids' school and spent time with the head of the school to best understand the safety precautions they were putting in place. They are very much in line with recommendations from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. There will be a mask mandate, plenty of hand hygiene stations, physical distancing plans, frequent disinfecting of surfaces and even outdoor classes when possible. Students will eat lunch in the classroom, and there won't be any mass gatherings or assemblies. While physical distancing is the toughest challenge, the school has made creative use of space in libraries, gymnasiums and cafeterias to obtain the necessary square footage to try and address this. It has been a herculean effort over the past few months, but of course, none of this works if the students themselves aren't diligent about following these practices on buses, in hallways and in classrooms.Our school also took the extra step of testing all the students and faculty and staff this past week, and the results were made available within 96 hours. My girls all tested negative, and that gives us some reassurance for those kids who choose to attend school, as those students testing positive will be asked to isolate at home. I fully realize this sort of \"assurance\" testing is sadly still not nearly available enough in this country, and it is also not a perfect tool. Some tests have been known to give a considerable amount of false negatives, depending on the type of test you take and how early you take it. And, while someone may test negative today, there is no guarantee they won't test positive for the virus tomorrow.Read MoreMuch of the discussion about returning to school revolves around the risk to the health of our children. According to the CDC, the largest pediatric study out of China found that 90% of children with Covid-19 develop mild or moderate symptoms, 4% were entirely asymptomatic and 6% became severely or critically ill.By the first week of August, 90 children in the US had died of Covid-19, which represents less than 1% of all deaths, according to an analysis by the American Academy of Pediatrics and the Children's Hospital Association.As of August 6, MIS-C, a multi-system inflammatory syndrome, was identified in at least 570 kids across the country, ranging in age from less than 1 to 20. About two-thirds of those children didn't have underlying conditions before being diagnosed with MIS-C, like Juliet Daly, a Louisiana 12-year-old who nearly died in April.It is true that children are far less likely to get sick from Covid-19, as compared to adults, but they are by no means immune. They can become infected and they can spread it quickly. A widely cited study out of South Korea showed that kids 10 to 19 were spreading the virus just as much as adults. In fact, they had the highest rate of Covid-19 among household contacts. Interestingly, in that same study, children younger than 10 did not account for a significant amount of viral spread. This was surprising because a recent study published in JAMA Pediatrics concluded younger kids may carry higher amounts of the virus in their nose, as compared to adults. And any parent will tell you how easily little kids spread viruses in their own homes. (When our kids were very young, a single cold in any one of them meant the whole family was going to soon become infected.)So, I decided to take a closer look at the South Korean study, and noticed a very important detail: It included fewer than 30 positive cases younger than 10 years old. Of the nearly 60,000 contacts that were traced in that study, only 237 were from children under 10. The low rate of spread among young kids may not have been because they are less likely to transmit the virus, but because they have largely been home over the last few months, and had few contacts as a result.As our kids become increasingly mobile, they will become part of a large national experiment, and there is little doubt the infection rates will increase. Just over the past four weeks, the number of children infected in the United States has increased by 90% to more than 380,000 cases, according to that same analysis by AAP and CHA. While some of that increase may be due to increased testing, younger kids starting to emerge from their homes for the first time also play a role. And, for much of the country, schools haven't even yet reopened.It is also important to remember that a school community is made up of more than just young students. According to one recent analysis, nearly a quarter of teachers working in the United States school system are at higher risk of serious illness from Covid-19, either because of age or pre-existing conditions. I was particularly struck by the stories of worried teachers around the country who said they were writing out their wills in anticipation of returning to school.My family also took a closer look at the overall rate of viral spread in our own area. Within the Fulton County Schools system, where we live, the guidelines for schools to return to full-time, face-to-face instruction requires the county rate of new cases per 100,000 people to be fewer than 100 for the last 14 days. Fulton County's current rate? 316.2. Atlanta Public Schools have decided to go all-virtual for the first nine weeks. Additionally, our county, which includes part of Atlanta, doesn't meet the federal government's criteria for return to school either. According to the gating criteria from the Coronavirus Task Force, we would have had to pass through two phases, each requiring a 14-day downward trajectory of documented cases and the ability to treat all patients without crisis care. We are simply not there yet.Finally, the positivity rate in Georgia over the seven days (ending August 10) is 11.3%, based on data from the Covid Tracking Project, which means we still aren't doing enough testing in our area. Recently, the Surgeon General said he would like to see positivity rates at less than 10% in communities before schools consider reopening. We are close, but it is still worrisome to place students back into an environment with that much community viral spread. It is worth noting that when we started pulling kids out of school around mid-March, there were fewer than 5,000 known cases in the United States and confirmed deaths were in the double digits. Now, school districts are considering reopening as more than 5 million people have been infected and more than 164,000 people have died in the US, according to Johns Hopkins University.Just over the past few weeks, we have been given several clues of what may happen as schools start to reopen. An overnight summer camp in North Georgia had nearly 260 attendees become infected, though the CDC noted some could've contracted Covid-19 another way. A high school in Woodstock, Georgia, is temporarily closed after at least 14 positive Covid-19 cases in its first week. Hundreds are under quarantine in the county. Another school in Dallas, Georgia, opened and then closed its doors after six students and three faculty became infected. Their plan is to reopen after disinfecting the school, though it is not clear how much of a difference that will make, as there is no mask requirement -- and a single sneeze or cough could once again contaminate a classroom.It is a lot to consider, but in the minds of our family, the evidence is clear. After considering all the objective criteria and assessing the situation in our own community, we have made the decision to keep our girls out of school for the time being. This was not an easy decision, but one that we believe best respects the science, decreases the risk of further spread and follows the task force criteria. As a compromise, we will allow our children to have a physically distanced orientation meeting with their new teachers so they can meet them in person before starting to interact with them on a screen. And, after two weeks, we will reassess. It will also be important for us to understand what the triggers will be in our school, in terms of newly diagnosed infections or illnesses, that will require a return to virtual learning. Full and honest transparency from everyone will be more necessary than ever.None of this is easy, and some families may arrive at a different conclusion after looking at the same data. In the age of Covid-19, it seems we are all forced to become amateur epidemiologists, while also being the best parents we can be.\n\nCORONAVIRUS: FACT VS FICTION PODCAST: In an audio essay, CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta opens up about his thoughts and fears for his children as they grow up in this pandemic.",

We are on the other end of it. We are on the other side. We are no longer contagious. And we are -- thank god -- we are healthy,\" he said. Read MoreJohnson said he believes they contracted it from close family friends. He encouraged others to exercise extreme caution when meeting with friends or family and taking measures -- like getting tested for coronavirus before meeting up and wearing a mask -- to prevent the spread. Ever the wellness advocate, he also said he believes he benefited from his general commitment to his health.\"I've gotten knocked about and gotten my a-- kicked a little bit in the past with some challenges, but testing positive for Covid-19 is much different than overcoming nasty injuries or being evicted or even being broke, which I have been more than a few times,\" he said. \"The reason why I feel this is different is because my number one priority is to always protect my family and protect my children, my loved ones.\"",

        "body": "(Kaiser Health News)Old. Chronically ill. Black.\n\nPeople who fit this description are more likely to die from COVID-19 than any other group in the country.They are perishing quietly, out of sight, in homes and apartment buildings, senior housing complexes, nursing homes and hospitals, disproportionately poor, frail and ill, after enduring a lifetime of racism and its attendant adverse health effects.Yet, older Black Americans have received little attention as protesters proclaim that Black Lives Matter and experts churn out studies about the coronavirus.\"People are talking about the race disparity in COVID deaths, they're talking about the age disparity, but they're not talking about how race and age disparities interact: They're not talking about older black adults,\" said Robert Joseph Taylor, director of the Program for Research on Black Americans at the University of Michigan's Institute for Social Research.Read MoreA KHN analysis of data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention underscores the extent of their vulnerability. It found that African Americans ages 65 to 74 died of COVID-19 five times as often as whites. In the 75-to-84 group, the death rate for Blacks was 3\u00bd times greater. Among those 85 and older, Blacks died twice as often. In all three age groups, death rates for Hispanics were higher than whites but lower than Blacks.(The gap between Blacks and whites narrows over time because advanced age, itself, becomes an increasingly important, shared risk. Altogether, 80% of COVID-19 deaths are among people 65 and older.)The data comes from the week that ended Feb. 1 through Aug. 8. Although breakdowns by race and age were not consistently reported, it is the best information available.Mistrustful of OutsidersSocial and economic disadvantage, reinforced by racism, plays a significant part in unequal outcomes. Throughout their lives, Blacks have poorer access to health care and receive services of lower quality than does the general population. Starting in middle age, the toll becomes evident: more chronic medical conditions, which worsen over time, and earlier deaths.Several conditions -- diabetes, chronic kidney disease, obesity, heart failure and pulmonary hypertension, among others -- put older Blacks at heightened risk of becoming seriously ill and dying from COVID-19.Yet many vulnerable Black seniors are deeply distrustful of government and health care institutions, complicating efforts to mitigate the pandemic's impact.The infamous Tuskegee syphilis study -- in which African American participants in Alabama were not treated for their disease -- remains a shocking, indelible example of racist medical experimentation. Just as important, the lifelong experience of racism in health care settings -- symptoms discounted, needed treatments not given -- leaves psychic scars.In Seattle, Catholic Community Services sponsors the African American Elders Program, which serves nearly 400 frail homebound seniors each year.\"A lot of Black elders in this area migrated from the South a long time ago and were victims of a lot of racist practices growing up,\" said Margaret Boddie, 77, who directs the program. \"With the pandemic, they're fearful of outsiders coming in and trying to tell them how to think and how to be. They think they're being targeted. There's a lot of paranoia.\"\"They won't open the door to people they don't know, even to talk,\" complicating efforts to send in social workers or nurses to provide assistance, Boddie said.In Los Angeles, Karen Lincoln directs Advocates for African American Elders and is an associate professor of social work at the University of Southern California.\"Health literacy is a big issue in the older African American population because of how people were educated when they were young,\" she said. \"My maternal grandmother, she had a third-grade education. My grandfather, he made it to the fifth grade. For many people, understanding the information that's put out, especially when it changes so often and people don't really understand why, is a challenge.\"What this population needs, Lincoln suggested, is \"help from people who they can relate to\" -- ideally, a cadre of African American community health workers.With suspicion running high, older Blacks are keeping to themselves and avoiding health care providers.\"Testing? I know only of maybe two people who've been tested,\" said Mardell Reed, 80, who lives in Pasadena, California, and volunteers with Lincoln's program. \"Taking a vaccine [for the coronavirus]? That is just not going to happen with most of the people I know. They don't trust it and I don't trust it.\"Reed has high blood pressure, anemia, arthritis and thyroid and kidney disease, all fairly well controlled. She rarely goes outside because of COVID-19. \"I'm just afraid of being around people,\" she admitted.Other factors contribute to the heightened risk for older Blacks during the pandemic. They have fewer financial resources to draw upon and fewer community assets (such as grocery stores, pharmacies, transportation, community organizations that provide aging services) to rely on in times of adversity. And housing circumstances can contribute to the risk of infection.In Chicago, Gilbert James, 78, lives in a 27-floor senior housing building, with 10 apartments on each floor. But only two of the building's three elevators are operational at any time. Despite a \"two-person-per-elevator policy,\" people crowd onto the elevators, making it difficult to maintain social distance.\"The building doesn't keep us updated on how they're keeping things clean or whether people have gotten sick or died\" of COVID-19, James said. Nationally, there are no efforts to track COVID-19 in low-income senior housing and little guidance about necessary infection control.Large numbers of older Blacks also live in intergenerational households, where other adults, many of them essential workers, come and go for work, risking exposure to the coronavirus. As children return to school, they, too, are potential vectors of infection.'Striving Yet Never Arriving'In recent years, the American Psychological Association has called attention to the impact of racism-related stress in older African Americans -- yet another source of vulnerability.This toxic stress, revived each time racism becomes manifest, has deleterious consequences to physical and mental health. Even racist acts committed against others can be a significant stressor.\"This older generation went through the civil rights movement. Desegregation. Their kids went through busing. They grew up with a knee on their neck, as it were,\" said Keith Whitfield, provost at Wayne State University and an expert on aging in African Americans. \"For them, it was an ongoing battle, striving yet never arriving. But there's also a lot of resilience that we shouldn't underestimate.\"This year, for some elders, violence against Blacks and COVID-19's heavy toll on African American communities have been painful triggers. \"The level of stress has definitely increased,\" Lincoln said.During ordinary times, families and churches are essential supports, providing practical assistance and emotional nurturing. But during the pandemic, many older Blacks have been isolated.In her capacity as a volunteer, Reed has been phoning Los Angeles seniors. \"For some of them, I'm the first person they've talked to in two to three days. They talk about how they don't have anyone. I never knew there were so many African American elders who never married and don't have children,\" she said.Meanwhile, social networks that keep elders feeling connected to other people are weakening.\"What is especially difficult for elders is the disruption of extended support networks, such as neighbors or the people they see at church,\" said Taylor, of the University of Michigan. \"Those are the 'Hey, how are you doing? How are your kids? Anything you need?' interactions. That type of caring is very comforting and it's now missing.\"In Brooklyn, New York, Barbara Apparicio, 77, has been having Bible discussions with a group of church friends on the phone each weekend. Apparicio is a breast cancer survivor who had a stroke in 2012 and walks with a cane. Her son and his family live in an upstairs apartment, but she does not see him much.\"The hardest part for me [during this pandemic] has been not being able to go out to do the things I like to do and see people I normally see,\" she said.In Atlanta, Celestine Bray Bottoms, 83, who lives on her own in an affordable senior housing community, is relying on her faith to pull her through what has been a very difficult time. Bottoms was hospitalized with chest pains in August -- a problem that persists. She receives dialysis three times a week and has survived leukemia.\"I don't like the way the world is going. Right now, it's awful,\" she said. \"But every morning when I wake up, the first thing I do is thank the Lord for another day. I have a strong faith and I feel blessed because I'm still alive. And I'm doing everything I can not to get this virus because I want to be here a while longer.\"\n\nKHN data editor Elizabeth Lucas contributed to this story\n\nKHN (Kaiser Health News) is a nonprofit news service covering health issues.

        "body": "(CNN)As many hope for a vaccine to bring Covid-19 under control, a leading vaccine expert warned against using an emergency use authorization (EUA) to put one on the US market as soon as possible.\n\n\"How can you justify a substandard or lesser review for something that would be injected in tens of millions, maybe hundreds of millions of Americans?\" Dr. Peter Hotez, a professor and the dean of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine, said in series of social media posts Wednesday.EUAs allow the FDA to greenlight unapproved medical products without going through the complete lengthy process needed for full approval. But Hotez urged federal health agencies to \"follow that process\" for a vaccine so significant.Three vaccines for a virus that has infected more than 6.1 million Americans are currently in Phase 3 testing in the US, which experts have called impressively quick. Officials have insisted no vaccine will be distributed to the public until it is effective and safe, but they differ on when that might be. Many, including the Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Dr. Anthony Fauci, say early 2021 would be a good estimate, while other officials are eyeing the coming months.President Donald Trump has predicted that there will be a vaccine available in time for the November 3 election, and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention told public health officials around to US to prepare to distribute one as soon as late October. But health experts say those predictions aren't realistic. Read More\"This is like the Boy Scout motto, 'Be Prepared,'\" Director of the National Institutes for Health Dr. Francis Collins said. \"Even if it's very low likelihood, if everything happened to come together really beautifully and we had an answer by then and we knew we had a vaccine that was safe and effective, wouldn't you want people to be ready to figure out how to do the distribution? That's all that CDC is saying.\"Fauci pleads with nation to avoid Labor Day weekend spikesWith the upcoming Labor Day weekend, Fauci pleaded with Americans not to repeat the mistakes of past holidays.\"We know from prior experience that when you get into holiday weekends -- the Fourth of July, Memorial Day -- there's a tendency of people to be careless, somewhat, with regard to the public health measures that we keep recommending over and over again,\" Fauci said in an interview with MSNBC's Andrea Mitchell Wednesday.Many previous celebrations resulted in outbreaks of cases, a fate that Fauci said can be avoided.\"You can have an enjoyable weekend, but you can do a couple of fundamental things that we talk about all the time,\" he said. \"Masks, distance, avoiding crowds, outdoors much more than indoors, washing your hands -- those types of simple things.\" Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear made the same request as the state prepares to feature the Kentucky Derby over Labor Day weekend, which will run without fans in the stands.\"Please, let's not look back and say something as special as what this weekend can be, turned into the time when this virus got out of control,\" Beshear said. Los Angeles cuts hospitalizations in half in 5 weeksPrecautions have brought the number of hospitalizations of coronavirus patients in Los Angeles to its lowest levels since early April, Mayor Eric Garcetti announced at a news conference Wednesday evening.\"Today, 1,062 Angelenos are in the hospital because of Covid-19. To put that in perspective, in just the last five weeks alone, we've cut our hospitalizations by more than half,\" said Garcetti.On Wednesday, Los Angeles County reported 1,457 new cases of the coronavirus, raising the total since the start of the pandemic to 243,935. The county also reported 51 new deaths -- 12 of which were in the city of Los Angeles -- bringing the total to 5,878. California has the most reported infections of any state, with more than 720,000 cases.Los Angeles will now allow county schools to offer on-campus service for small numbers of K-12 students who need \"learning support,\" Garcetti said. And earlier Wednesday, Los Angeles County announced the reopening of hair salons and barbershops at limited 25% capacity.But the mayor was quick to point out that residents should not confuse the improved hospitalization and infection rate and any business reopenings with \"going back to normal,\" reiterating that county-wide restrictions will remain in place.Sending infected college students home is 'the worst thing you could do'New Covid-19 hot spots keep popping up across the US, with worrying trends in the Midwest and at colleges nationwide. More than 25,000 cases of Covid-19 have been reported from colleges and universities in 37 states, according to a CNN tally through Wednesday. But it's not just college students getting more infections. The number of new cases among children has jumped 17% in two weeks, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics and the Children's Hospital Association. While Covid-19 deaths are rare among children and young adults, many young people are suffering long-term effects from the disease. And even those without symptoms can easily spread coronavirus to others. That's why colleges and universities shouldn't send infected students home, said Fauci.\"Keep them at the university in a place that's sequestered enough from the other students. But don't have them go home, because they could be spreading it in their home state,\" Fauci told NBC's \"Today\" show in an interview aired Wednesday.\n\nCNN's Steve Almasy, Topher Gauk-Roger, Holly Yan, Annie Grayer and Maggie Fox contributed to this report.",

And as researchers rush to develop vaccines, they've had little evidence to tell if antibodies that protect against Covid-19 last long enough to get the virus under control. But developments from researchers Monday brought optimistic outlooks to both fronts.SalivaDirect, a test that does not require specialized supplies and can deliver results in less than three hours, could be available to the public in a matter of weeks, according to Anne Wyllie, an epidemiologist at Yale School of Public Health who was part of the team responsible for the protocol.And though many are in early stages and have not been peer-reviewed, a recent batch of studies show that humans -- even those with mild symptoms -- have a \"robust\" immune response to coronavirus that could provide evidence that a vaccine could protect the public for more than just a short period of time, said Dr. Ian Lipkin, director of the Center for Infection and Immunity at Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health.\"This is very good news and it's optimistic,\" Lipkin said Monday. \"You know, it is a bit of blue sky that we've been looking for.\"Read MoreHow long that protection lasts is still unclear, but the studies indicate it could last for months.The news comes as the White House coronavirus task force coordinator said Monday she wished the early days of coronavirus in the US looked more like it did in Italy: strict lockdowns keeping people home as infections spread.Positivity rates are dropping, but deaths have been above 1,000 daily since late JulyThe average number of daily, official new coronavirus cases reported in the US has been declining for weeks. But daily deaths -- which experts say can spike weeks after a jump in new cases -- have recently been at a relatively elevated level.Daily new cases over the past week averaged about 49,100 as of Monday, down from more than 65,000 per day in mid-to-late July, according to Johns Hopkins University data. Daily testing also has declined, however, since late July, according to the Covid Tracking Project.Tracking Covid-19 cases in the USThe seven-day average of test-positivity rates in the US dropped to 6.6% as of Tuesday, down from 8.5% in mid-July, according to the Covid Tracking Project.The CDC's director has suggested communities' positivity rates should be below 5% to comfortably reopen schools. At least 24 states averaged above 5% as of Monday. Still, the country's seven-day average for daily Covid-19 deaths has been above 1,000 for 22 straight days as of Monday, after seven weeks of below 1,000.Los Angeles County, a hotspot in California, has seen steady progress in the fight to curb the virus, LA County Public Health Director Barbara Ferrer said Monday. Daily hospitalizations have dropped 37% in the last month.\"We do continue to be cautiously optimistic that all the sacrifices and the hard work that we've seen across our county is working and that we're in fact back to slowing the spread,\" Ferrer said.Texas on Monday became the fourth state to surpass 10,000 Covid-19-related deaths. And Florida nearly doubled its count of coronavirus deaths in just a month, bringing the total to 9,539.Georgia, Florida and Texas led the nation for highest per-capita rate of average new daily cases as of Tuesday morning, according to CNN's analysis of JHU data.However, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis tweeted Monday that the state is reporting the lowest number of cases of Covid-19 in one day since mid-June at 2,760; adding that the number of coronavirus-positive patients hospitalized in the state is down almost 40% since July 21.Schools at decision-point as researchers learn more about coronavirus in young peopleHealth experts learning more about how young people are contracting and spreading the virus must decide if and how to bring students back to school for the new academic year.A common perception is that young people don't need to worry about being infected, director of the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases Dr. Anthony Fauci said Monday. But researchers have found that even those not hospitalized can have \"really troublesome\" long-term effects.\"In individuals who are young and otherwise healthy, who don't require hospitalization but do get sick and symptomatic enough to be in bed for a week or two or three and then get better, they clear the virus -- they have residual symptoms for weeks and sometimes months,\" he said during a American Society for Microbiology briefing. \"These are people that supposedly recovered from Covid-19,\" he said. Meanwhile, many schools that have resumed instruction in-person have quickly reported infections.During the first week of in-person instruction, at least three Florida school districts reported having to place students in quarantine. The latest of which, Baker County School District, has reported at least three positive cases, according to the Florida Department of Health.The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill abruptly decided this week it will no longer hold in-person undergraduate classes on campus, starting Wednesday, after about 130 students tested positive for Covid-19 in the first week since classes began.West Virginia Gov. Jim Justice said the state is grappling with returning to in-person teaching, responding to accusations of bowing to pressure.\"Nobody is going to pressure me in any way to put our teachers, our service personnel, our kids especially back into a situation that I feel in my heart that is not as safe as we can possibly make it,\" Justice said.Study finds possible coronavirus spread on airplaneResearchers in Germany say they've found possible evidence of the spread of coronavirus on an airline flight.In March, early in the pandemic, two passengers developed coronavirus infections after sitting through a nearly five-hour flight, the researchers said.It began with an infected hotel manager. A week before the flight, 24 travelers had contact with a hotel manager who later tested positive for Covid-19, according to research published in the journal JAMA Network Open on Tuesday. They all were among 102 passengers on the Boeing 737-900 flight from Tel Aviv to Frankfurt. None of the passengers had received Covid-19 diagnoses before the flight. That early in the pandemic, there were no mitigation measures in place and passengers were not asked to wear masks.Researchers from the Institute for Medical Virology at Goethe University in Frankfurt, Germany examined those 24 travelers, all members of a tourist group, and tested them for coronavirus. Most of the other passengers were also contacted four to five weeks later for interviews. Seven members of the tourist group tested positive for Covid-19. Four were symptomatic during the flight, two were presymptomatic and one remained asymptomatic, according to the researchers. \"We discovered two likely SARS-CoV-2 transmissions on this flight, with seven index cases,\" the researchers wrote. The two people who may have been infected on the flight were sitting at the back of the plane, directly across the aisle from the seven infected passengers seated in a cluster.\"These transmissions may have also occurred before or after the flight,\" the researchers wrote.\"The airflow in the cabin from the ceiling to the floor and from the front to the rear may have been associated with a reduced transmission rate,\" the researchers wrote. \"It could be speculated that the rate may have been reduced further had the passengers worn masks.\"\n\nCNN's Raja Razek, Artemis Moshtaghian, Topher-Gauk Roger, Amanda Watts, Jason Hanna, Naomi Thomas, Jen Christensen and Anna Sturla contributed to this report.",

        "body": "White House Coronavirus Task Force member Dr. Anthony Fauci said he was undergoing surgery and not in the August 20 task force meeting for the discussion on updated US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines that suggest asymptomatic people may not need to be tested for Covid-19, even if they've been in close contact with an infected person.\n\n\"I was under general anesthesia in the operating room and was not part of any discussion or deliberation regarding the new testing recommendations\" at that meeting, Fauci told CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta.\n\n\"I am concerned about the interpretation of these recommendations and worried it will give people the incorrect assumption that asymptomatic spread is not of great concern. In fact it is,\" said Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.\n\nFauci's comments undercut claims by Adm. Brett Giroir, the administration's coronavirus testing point person, who told reporters on Wednesday that the new guidelines had the White House Coronavirus Task Force's stamp of approval. Asked whether Fauci signed off on the guidelines, Giroir said, \"Yes, all the docs signed off on this before it even got to the task force level.\"\n\n\"We worked on this all together to make sure that there was absolute consensus that reflected the best possible evidence, and the best public health for the American people,\" Giroir also said earlier in the call, pushing back on the notion that the new guidelines were the result of political pressure. \"I worked on them, Dr. Fauci worked on them, Dr. (Deborah) Birx worked on them. Dr. (Stephen) Hahn worked on them.\"\n\nThe new CDC guidelines appeared to be the result of an idea raised to the task force by CDC Director Robert Redfield a month earlier, when a surge of coronavirus cases strained US testing resources and some members were looking for new messaging on how to stem excess testing.\n\nRather than continue to encourage anyone in close contact with a coronavirus-positive individual to get tested, Redfield suggested the CDC could relax the guidance, deeming a test unnecessary for otherwise healthy individuals not experiencing any symptoms, two sources familiar with the matter said. Experts worry that this will discourage the widespread testing of asymptomatic individuals that could help bring the pandemic under control.\n\nThe idea was met with immediate resistance from several task force members. In a coronavirus task force meeting Thursday, members debated the guidelines in-depth and in person, when Fauci was absent.\n\nThe new guidelines were quietly published on the CDC website on Monday, catching media attention Tuesday evening and drawing a deluge of criticism from the public health community.\n\nThe new guidelines stunned some federal health officials who are generally briefed on coronavirus matters, and many state health officials had also not been briefed on the change. Many federal health officials were scrambling on Wednesday to understand the impact of the new guidelines and who pushed through the change.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has repeatedly lamented widespread testing in the US, falsely claiming it is responsible for surges of cases in the US and suggesting the US should slow down testing. Those comments and the surprising CDC guidelines led to allegations that the CDC's new guidelines were political and not scientific in origin.\n\n\"It's coming from the top down,\" a federal health official told CNN of the new directives.\n\nGiroir insisted the decision was science and evidence-based and said there was \"no direction from President Trump, the Vice President, or the [HHS] Secretary about what we need to do when.\"\n\n\"This is evidence-based decisions that are driven by the scientists and physicians, both within the CDC with my office in the lab Task Force, and certainly among the task force members,\" Giroir said.\n\nPrevious CDC testing guidance said anyone who had close contact with someone with coronavirus should get tested, whether they have symptoms or not.\n\nThe site was changed to say: \"If you have been in close contact (within 6 feet) of a person with a COVID-19 infection for at least 15 minutes but do not have symptoms, you do not necessarily need a test unless you are a vulnerable individual or your health care provider or State or local public health officials recommend you take one.\"\n\nDr. Carlos del Rio, infectious disease specialist and associate dean of Emory University School of Medicine, said on CNN Newsroom on Wednesday that the CDC has not provided evidence to explain the changes. \"I mean, the evidence that I'm aware of as of today is that close to 40% of the cases of the infections are asymptomatic and asymptomatic people transmit the infection,\" del Rio said.\n\n\"So, not testing -- I mean, if you have been in contact with somebody for a few minutes, that's okay. But if you have been in contact for 15 minutes and that people doesn't have a mask, I think you need to be tested regardless if you have symptoms or not,\" he added.\n\nAmerican Medical Association President Dr. Susan Bailey called on CDC and HHS to \"release the scientific justification\" for the changes.\n\n\"Months into this pandemic, we know COVID-19 is spread by asymptomatic people. Suggesting that people without symptoms, who have known exposure to COVID-positive individuals, do not need testing is a recipe for community spread and more spikes in coronavirus,\" Bailey said in a statement.\n\nCalifornia, meanwhile, will not abide by new guidelines, Gov. Gavin Newsom said in a news conference.\n\n\"I don't agree with the new CDC guidance period, full stop, and it's not the policy in the state of California,\" Newsom, a Democrat, said. \"We will not be influenced by that change. We're influenced by those that are experts in the field that feel very differently.\"",

        "body": "Covid-19 cases among US children increased 90% over the past 4 weeks, report says\n\nThere has been a 90% increase in the number of Covid-19 cases among US children over the past four weeks, according to a report published Monday by the American Academy of Pediatrics and the Children's Hospital Association.\n\nAccording to this new report, expected to be updated weekly, there were 179,990 new Covid-19 cases among US children between July 9 and August 6. The data comes from case numbers provided by state health departments of 49 states, New York City, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and Guam.\n\nSome of the increase may be due to more testing, AAP said. Early in the pandemic, testing was reserved for the sickest. A broader number of tests may be identifying children that have fewer or milder symptoms than those who were tested earlier in the pandemic.\n\nChildren make up just over 9% of the total cases in states that report cases by age, according to the report. At least 380,174 total child Covid-19 cases had been reported as of August 6.\n\nIt still appears that severe symptoms are rare among children with Covid-19 infections. Children were between 0.5% and 5.3% of total hospitalizations, according to data from the states that record that information. Children were 0% to 0.4% of all Covid-19 deaths.\n\nNineteen states have reported no child deaths. In states that tracked the details, 0% to 0.5% of all child Covid-19 cases resulted in death.\n\nThe AAP called for an effective testing strategy so that communities can make the right choice about opening schools.\n\n\"In areas with rapid community spread, it's likely that more children will also be infected, and these data show that,\" AAP President Dr. Sally Goza said in the news release. \"As a pediatrician, I urge people to wear cloth face coverings and be diligent in social distancing and hand-washing. It is up to us to make the difference, community by community.\"\n\nThe World Health Organization said last week that the pandemic is starting to move into the younger population globally, while most cases, by far, are among people ages 25 to 64.",

Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds.\n\n(CNN)A top federal health official is issuing a stark warning: Follow recommended coronavirus measures or risk having the worst fall in US public health history.\n\nCoronavirus has infected more than 5 million people and killed over 166,000 nationwide, according to Johns Hopkins University. On Wednesday alone, there were 55,910 reported new cases and 1,499 deaths -- the highest number of fatalities since May. \"For your country right now and for the war that we're in against Covid, I'm asking you to do four simple things: wear a mask, social distance, wash your hands and be smart about crowds,\" said Dr. Robert Redfield, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. \"I'm not asking some of America to do it,\" he told WebMD. \"We all gotta do it.\"Read MoreWithout following the recommendations, this could be \"the worst fall, from a public health perspective, we've ever had,\" he said. In addition to taking measures to combat the pandemic, people should also get a flu vaccine. \"By getting vaccinated, you can protect your children,\" he said. \"When we look at the mortality that we see with flu, one thing is for certain. The kids that get vaccinated, they basically get protected against death.\"The CDC has bought 10 million doses of the flu vaccine for uninsured adults this year, compared to the typical 500,000 doses. On coronavirus vaccines, Redfield is cautiously optimistic one or more vaccines will be ready by the start of 2021.Anti-vaxxers ramp up conspiracy theoriesThere are 270 active trials for coronavirus treatments, experts say. And anti-vaxxers have taken to social media to spread lies about the future coronavirus vaccine. Some include claims it contains monkey brains or that it's a CIA plot to take over the world. Others allege the vaccine will include an invisible trackable tattoo or it will disfigure those who take it. As the lies spread, the government's multi-billion-dollar vaccine effort has yet to come up with a public education campaign to counteract the propaganda.\"We are behind here,\" said Dr. Francis Collins, director of the National Institutes of Health. \"We haven't done a good job of getting (coronavirus vaccine) information out there.\"The stakes are high. A third of Americans said they'd not get vaccinated against coronavirus, even if the vaccine is widely available and low cost, according to a CNN poll in May. \"Speaking for myself, I think I underestimated the level of public resistance,\" Collins said. \"I didn't expect it to be that widespread.\"Dr. Tina Hartert of the Vanderbilt University Medical Center said lack of faith in the vaccine can lead to major outbreaks. She described the government's communication on the vaccine as crucial. \"We should have started on this months ago but it's never too late to start this important messaging. Because otherwise the messaging people will listen to is the story of one child from another parent,\" Hartert told CNN's Anderson Cooper. Over 2,000 people quarantined as schools reopenCoronavirus continues to spread at high rates across the South, Midwest and West -- even as the total number of new cases has declined following a summer surge.Nationally, over the past seven days, the United States is averaging about 53,000 new cases per day, down 11% from the week prior. As educators and parents clash over starting in-person classes, some schools that have reopened have seen new cases. More than 2,000 students, teachers and staff have been placed under quarantine in the few reopened districts in several states, a CNN tally of reported cases show. Of those, at least 230 positive coronavirus cases have been reported among the school districts reopened for in-person learning.In Georgia, just outside Atlanta, more than 1,100 students, teachers and staff in the Cherokee County School District are under quarantine due to dozens of Covid-19 positive cases or exposure. Schools reopened 10 days ago.In Florida, a day after the Martin County School District reopened for in-person teaching, an entire elementary class and one bus route were placed under quarantine after a student showed coronavirus symptoms, spokeswoman Jennifer DeShazo said Wednesday.Several states including Mississippi, Alabama, Oklahoma and Indiana reported cases of teachers, students and sports players testing positive for coronavirus. At Oklahoma's Broken Arrow Public Schools District, 33 employees tested positive last week, Superintendent Janet Vinson said. The White House released new recommendations for schools. They are primarily basic hygiene tips and don't outline what schools should do if they find coronavirus cases in their halls. The recommendations also encourage the use of masks, but do not require students, teachers or staff to wear them. President Donald Trump said the federal government will provide up to 125 million masks to school districts nationwide. Average of over 1,000 deaths daily for 17 days Deaths from the virus have remained high. The seven-day average of daily coronavirus deaths was over 1,000 on Wednesday, the 17th consecutive day the US averaged over 1,000 deaths per day.Adjusting for population, states in the Southeast are seeing the most new cases. Georgia and Florida -- states led by Republican governors who have not issued face mask requirements -- have the highest per capita new cases over the past seven days, followed by Alabama and Mississippi.On Wednesday, Florida health officials announced more than 8,000 new case reports and 212 new deaths.You asked, we're answering: Your top coronavirus questions\n\nCNN's Joe Sutton, Rosa Flores and Sara Weisfeldt contributed to this report.",

And while both have experienced symptoms, James Baker has been able to do office work from home, and Susan Baker has felt well enough to cook, Williams said. \"He said he feels crummy.\"News of the diagnosis marks just the latest high-profile political figure to contract the virus as the US has struggled to mitigate its spread. Though case rates have dropped in recent weeks, daily deaths -- which experts say can spike weeks after a jump in new cases -- have recently been at a relatively elevated level.Baker first came to national prominence as chief of staff for President Ronald Reagan, later becoming secretary of the treasury. While serving as secretary of state for President George H.W. Bush, he was a key figure in assembling a coalition of dozens of countries to join the United States in driving Saddam Hussein's Iraqi troops out of Kuwait.Currently, Baker is the honorary chairman of the Baker Institute of Public Policy at Rice University, and senior partner at the Baker Botts law firm. But he hasn't shied from politics in recent years. Read MoreBaker told CNN in 2017 that President Donald Trump's penchant for tweeting would have made his job \"a lot harder\" if he worked in the current administration.\"A lot of people will tell you they think it's counterproductive,\" Baker said then of Trump's Twitter habit. \"Running a business and running the government are two entirely different undertakings.\"\"The one thing that I would worry about, if I were one of his senior officials, would be not knowing until 2:30 or 3 in the morning when you see the most recent tweet what the policy was,\" he continued. \"Because when a president of the United States speaks he speaks ... he's creating policy.\"",

The data comes from case numbers provided by state health departments of 49 states, New York City, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and Guam.\n\nSome of the increase may be due to more testing, AAP said. Early in the pandemic, testing was reserved for the sickest. A broader number of tests may be identifying children that have fewer or milder symptoms than those who were tested earlier in the pandemic.\n\nChildren make up just over 9% of the total cases in states that report cases by age, according to the report. At least 380,174 total child Covid-19 cases reported as of Aug. 6.\n\nAs of now, it still appears that severe symptoms are rare among children with Covid-19 infections. Children were between 0.5% and 5.3% of total hospitalizations, according to data from the states that record that information. Children were 0% to 0.4% of all Covid-19 deaths.\n\nNineteen states have reported no child deaths. In states that tracked the details, 0% to 0.5% of all child Covid-19 cases resulted in death.\n\nThe AAP called for an effective testing strategy so that communities can make the right choice about opening schools.\n\n\"In areas with rapid community spread, it's likely that more children will also be infected, and these data show that,\" AAP President Dr. Sally Goza said in the news release. \"As a pediatrician, I urge people to wear cloth face coverings and be diligent in social distancing and hand-washing. It is up to us to make the difference, community by community.\"\n\nThe World Health Organization said last week that the coronavirus pandemic is starting to move into the younger population globally, while most cases, by far, are among people ages 25 to 64.",

Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds.\n\n(CNN)A Georgia high school that came under scrutiny last week when a student shared a photo of a crowded hallway will temporarily move to virtual learning after it reported nine cases of Covid-19, according to a letter the school district sent to parents Sunday.\n\n\"As a result of our being informed of nine cases of Covid-19 at North Paulding High School following the first week of in-person instruction, along with the possibility that number could increase if there are currently pending tests that prove positive, we have consulted with the Department of Public Health and are temporarily switching the instructional method to Digital Learning at NPHS,\" the letter from Paulding County Schools Superintendent Brian Otott said. The high school will only offer digital learning Monday and Tuesday. Tuesday evening families will be informed of whether remote instruction will continue or if students can return to school, the letter said. Meanwhile, \"the school will be thoroughly cleaned and disinfected,\" Otott wrote. The school district will also work with the Georgia Department of Public Health to identify anyone else who had close contact with the confirmed patients and have yet to be identified. Principal Gabe Carmona wrote in a separate letter Saturday that \"six students and three staff members who were in school for at least some time last week ... have since reported to us that they have tested positive.\"Read MoreOne student at a middle school in the county, Sammy McClure, Sr. Middle School, has tested positive for the coronavirus, according to a letter sent by Principal Jaynath Hayes to parents Sunday.The student was in school \"for at least some time last week\" and reported to the school that they have tested positive, the letter said. The school is being cleaned by custodial staff and is following DPH recommendations, according to the letter.The school is asking anyone whose child exhibits symptoms to have them tested as soon as possible and notify the school.The Paulding cases are just the latest instance of students and teachers testing positive for Covid-19 after returning to school, highlighting the risks of resuming in-person classes amid the coronavirus pandemic.Last week, the high school in Dallas, Georgia, -- about 40 miles from Atlanta -- attracted nationwide attention thanks to a photo posted on Twitter by sophomore Hannah Watters. The viral image showed Hannah's classmates in a crowded school hallway with few visible masks. The school district resumed classes August 3.Hannah previously told CNN she shared the photo because she was concerned for the safety of her classmates and school staff, as well as the wider community. \"We're all pretty concerned about going back,\" Hannah said of her friends Sunday. \"And I know a lot of my teachers are, too.\" She added, \"We all want to go to in-person. I have no intention of shutting the county down, the state down, because I know a lot of people don't learn well online, I don't learn well online. ... I want to be able to have some type of normality this year ... but we can't if we're not safe.\" In his letter Sunday, Otott apologized to families for \"any inconvenience this schedule change may cause, but hopefully we all can agree that the health and safety of our students and staff takes precedence over any other considerations at this time.\"'Good and necessary trouble,' student saysDr. Jonathan Reiner, a CNN medical analyst and professor of medicine at George Washington University said Sunday it was nice the school would be disinfected. But he said it wouldn't have a large effect on containing the virus, pointing to the virus' high rate of spread in Georgia.\"The virus isn't being transmitted by the school, it's being transmitted by the people who attend the school,\" he said. \"It's in the community. Disinfecting the school isn't going to have a big impact.\"Otott previously said in a letter to the community that the viral photo was taken out of context and that class changes in high school were a challenge. \"It is an area we are continuing to work on in this new environment to find practicable ways to further limit students from congregating. Students are in this hallway environment for just a brief period as they move to their next class,\" the superintendent wrote. He added: \"There is no question that the photo does not look good. ... Wearing a mask is a personal choice, and there is no practical way to enforce a mandate to wear them.\"Otott's letter also said the district anticipated needing to make \"adjustments.\" The district previously decided to make Thursday and Friday virtual learning days for students receiving in-person instruction, \"so that all of our schools can step back and assess how things are going so far,\" Otott said.Hannah said she was initially suspended for posting the photo. But on Friday, her mother told CNN the suspension had been reversed. Lynne Watters spoke with the school's principal Friday morning, she said, and was told her daughter would not be suspended and a suspension would not appear on her record. Hannah can return to school on Monday. Hannah doesn't regret sharing the photo, she told CNN. \"I'd like to say this is some good and necessary trouble,\" she said Thursday. \"My biggest concern is not only about me being safe,\" she said. \"It's about everyone being safe because behind every teacher, student and staff member there is a family, there are friends, and I would just want to keep everyone safe.\"Hannah said Sunday that she had received backlash and \"threats\" for sharing the photo. According to Hannah, her family and friends have received screenshots from group chats that included threatening language against her.Hannah said she understands some students, especially seniors, might be worried about having their last year of high school taken from them, but said she doesn't want that. \"I just hope that sooner or later everyone can understand that I'm not trying to shut it down and when I did expose the school district, it wasn't to cancel the senior year, not to go after anyone,\" she said. \"It was just to keep us all safe.\"\n\nCNN's Hollie Silverman and Bill Wunner contributed to this report.",

        "body": "(CNN)Teachers in Gwinnett County, Georgia, staged a socially distant protest Thursday of the district's plan for students to return to school as hundreds of district employees have tested positive for Covid-19 or are in quarantine because of potential exposure.\n\nThe teachers and their families gathered -- in their cars -- at the Gwinnett County Public Schools district office in Suwanee, honking horns and displaying signs to express their displeasure with the district's recent decision to phase in face-to-face instruction. It was the second day of protest. The school year has not yet started in Gwinnett County, but already 263 school staff either tested positive for Covid-19 or are in quarantine. There have been 28 confirmed and 67 suspected cases of COVID-19 among employees of Gwinnett County Public Schools as of Wednesday, according to Sloan Roach, the executive director of communication and media relations.The district identified 168 close contacts of those people, resulting in a total of 263 employees impacted by either a positive test result or quarantine.Read MoreThe district is set to reopen with online learning on August 12, but Superintendent J. Alvin Wilbanks announced Tuesday that students will be returning to classrooms in phases beginning August 26. All teachers are expected to prepare and teach classes from school buildings, even for virtual learning.\"It hit us with a shock,\" teacher Aireane Montgomery told CNN's Jim Sciitto on Friday morning. \"It has been a catastrophe.\"Some teachers have underlying health conditions, she said, and instructors are concerned about their own health, as well as students and staff members.Schools throughout the district are proceeding differently, which is \"unnerving,\" Montgomery said. \"It's being made on politics. There's no way that this could be made due to scientific research.\"Gwinnett County school officials defended the decision.\"In making our plans, we have tried to balance the information about COVID cases in Gwinnett with the concerns of parents who fear for their children's educational progress, as well as their own employment, and need for us to bring their children back to school,\" Roach said. She added that many of the teachers and staff have understandable concerns about returning to in-person instruction, but the district is committed to doing what it believes is best for students in terms of their health, safety, and education. \"Our district is having to make difficult decisions that we know will not be popular with everyone,\" Roach said.Roach compared teachers to essential workers. \"Just as other essential workers serve the community, our school district staff members serve the children and families of this community,\" she said.While many teachers are upset about going back to school, some Gwinnett County parents have been vocal about wanting their children back in the classroom.\"The virus is not going away, we know it's not going away. We have to enforce some sort of normal,\" said parent Joanne Bayouk. \"And though our normal is going to change, our kids need to go back.\"4 positive cases in Columbia County schoolsMeanwhile in Columbia County, Georgia, four students from three high schools who attended classes in person this week have tested positive for Covid-19, Columbia County School District Superintendent Sandra Carraway said.The district started the new school year Monday for those who chose to attend in-person classes. The students who tested positive attended Evans High School, Lakeside High School and Harlem High School. Carraway said students who were in close contact with the those who tested positive are now quarantining at home. She declined to provide the number of students being quarantined. High schools in Columbia County are operating on A/B schedules to reduce the number of students at each school on any given day. The district says it requires all students to wear face coverings during transition periods and in any setting where social distancing is not possible. The Columbia County School District says it also has contact tracing, cleaning and messaging plans in place. The district sent a message to parents on Wednesday reiterating that students who don't feel well should stay home. It also noted that anyone waiting for Covid-19 test results, regardless of whether they have symptoms, should not come to school until they receive the results.\n\nCNN's Dianne Gallagher contributed to this report",

        "body": "Chat with us in Facebook Messenger. Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds.\n\n(Kaiser Health News)Every day, the nation is reminded of Covid-19's ongoing impact as new death counts are published. What is not well documented is the toll on family members.\n\nNew research suggests the damage is enormous. For every person who dies of Covid-19, nine close family members are affected, researchers estimate based on complex demographic calculations and data about the coronavirus.Many survivors will be shaken by the circumstances under which loved ones pass away -- rapid declines, sudden deaths and an inability to be there at the end -- and worrisome ripple effects may linger for years, researchers warn.If 190,000 Americans die from Covid complications by the end of August, as some models suggest, 1.7 million Americans will be grieving close family members, according to the study. Most likely to perish are grandparents, followed by parents, siblings, spouses and children.\"There's a narrative out there that Covid-19 affects mostly older adults,\" said Ashton Verdery, a co-author of the study and a professor of sociology and demography at Pennsylvania State University. \"Our results highlight that these are not completely socially isolated people that no one cares about. They are integrally connected with their families, and their deaths will have a broad reach.\"Read MoreBecause of family structures, Black families will lose slightly more close family members than white families, aggravating the pandemic's disproportionate impact on African American communities. (Verdery's previous research modeled kinship structures for the US population, dating to 1880 and extending to 2060.)The potential consequences of these losses are deeply concerning, with many families losing important sources of financial, social and caregiving support. \"The vast scale of Covid-19 bereavement has the potential to lower educational achievement among youth, disrupt marriages, and lead to poorer physical and mental health across all age groups,\" Verdery and his co-authors observe in their paper. Holly Prigerson, co-director of the Center for Research on End-of-Life Care at Weill Cornell Medicine in New York City, sounded a similar alarm, especially about the psychological impact of the pandemic, in a new paper on bereavement. \"Bereaved individuals have become the secondary victims of Covid-19, reporting severe symptoms of traumatic stress, including helplessness, horror, anxiety, sadness, anger, guilt, and regret, all of which magnify their grief,\" she and co-authors from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York noted. In a phone conversation, Prigerson predicted that people experiencing bereavement will suffer worse outcomes because of lockdowns and social isolation during the pandemic. She warned that older adults are especially vulnerable.\"Not being there in a loved one's time of need, not being able to communicate with family members in a natural way, not being able to say goodbye, not participating in normal rituals -- all this makes bereavement more difficult and prolonged grief disorder and post-traumatic stress more likely,\" she noted.Surge in demand for bereavement careOrganizations that offer bereavement care are seeing this unfold as they expand services to meet escalating needs.Typically, 5% to 10% of bereaved family members have a \"trauma response,\" but that has \"increased exponentially -- approaching the 40% range -- because we're living in a crisis,\" said Yelena Zatulovsky, vice president of patient experience at Seasons Hospice & Palliative Care, the nation's fifth-largest hospice provider.Since March, Seasons has doubled the number of grief support groups it offers to 29, hosted on virtual platforms, most of them weekly. All are free and open to community members, not just families whose loved ones received care from Seasons. (To find a virtual group in your time zone, call 1-855-812-1136, Season's 24/7 call center.) \"We're noticing that grief reactions are far more intense and challenging,\" Zatulovsky said, noting that requests for individual and family counseling have also risen.Medicare requires hospices to offer bereavement services to family members for up to 13 months after a client's death. Many hospices expanded these services to community members before the pandemic, and Edo Banach, president and CEO of the National Hospice and Palliative Care Organization, hopes that trend continues.\"It's not just the people who die on hospice and their families who need bereavement support at this time; it's entire communities,\" he said. \"We have a responsibility to do even more than what we normally do.\"In New York City, the center of the pandemic in its early months, The Jewish Board is training school administrators, teachers, counselors and other clinicians to recognize signs of grief and bereavement and provide assistance. The health and human services organization serves New Yorkers regardless of religious affiliation. \"There is a collective grief experience that we are all experiencing, and we're seeing the need go through the roof,\" said Marilyn Jacob, a senior director who oversees the organization's bereavement services, which now includes two support groups for people who have lost someone to Covid-19.\"There's so much loss now, on so many different levels, that even very seasoned therapists are saying 'I don't really know how to do this,'\" Jacob said. In addition to losing family members, people are losing jobs, friends, routines, social interactions and a sense of normalcy and safety.For many people, these losses are sudden and unexpected, which can complicate grief, said Patti Anewalt, director of Pathways Center for Grief & Loss in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, affiliated with the state's largest not-for-profit hospice. The center recently created a four-week group on sudden loss to address its unique challenges.The day before Julie Cheng's 88-year-old mother was rushed to the hospital in early July, she had been singing songs with Cheng's sister over the phone at her Irvine, California, nursing home. The next morning, a nurse reported that the older woman had a fever and was wheezing badly. At the hospital, Covid-19 was diagnosed and convalescent plasma therapy tried. Within two weeks, after suffering a series of strokes, Cheng's mother died. Since then, Cheng has mentally replayed the family's decision not to take her mother out of the nursing home and to refuse mechanical ventilation at the hospital -- something she was sure her mother would not have wanted. \"There have been a lot of 'what ifs?' and some anger: Someone or something needs to be blamed for what happened,\" she said, describing mixed emotions that followed her mother's death. But acceptance has sprung from religious conviction. \"Mostly, because of our faith in Jesus, we believe that God was ready to take her and she's in a much better place now.\"Coping with grief, especially when it is complicated by social isolation and trauma, takes time. If you are looking for help, call a local hospice's bereavement department and ask what kind of services it provides to people in the community. Funeral directors should also have a list of counselors and grief support programs. One option is GriefShare, offered by churches across the country.Many experts believe the need for these kinds of services will expand exponentially as more family members emerge from pandemic-inspired shock and denial.\"I firmly believe we're still at the tip of the iceberg, in terms of the help people need, and we won't understand the full scope of that for another six to nine months,\" said Diane Snyder-Cowan, leader of the bereavement professionals steering committee of the National Council of Hospice and Palliative Professionals.\n\nKHN (Kaiser Health News) is a nonprofit news service covering health issues.

US leaders from coast to coast have throughout the past few months warned that young groups of people and social gatherings were driving an increase in coronavirus cases. Many of the nation's top health officials have urged Americans to avoid not just bars but any crowded indoor spaces.On Friday, Illinois reported the highest number of daily cases since May 24, with more than 2,260 new cases. The state has now reported more than 200,000 infections and more than 7,700 deaths. The event took place in Mount Carmel, officials said, about 160 miles southeast of Springfield. It's unclear how many people attended in total.Read MoreWabash health officials told CNN affiliate WFIE at least five cases were linked to the event and 40 close contacts were identified. \"We're just trying to alert the other kids that may have been there -- that they may have been in contact with several positive cases and to watch for symptoms,\" Wabash County Health Department Administrator Judy Wissel said, according to the news station. The \"mini-prom\" was not a school-sanctioned event, the affiliate reported.\n\nCNN's Brad Parks and Kay Jones contributed to this report.",

        "body": "(CNN)Doctors may have been right to be concerned that people with heart problems were avoiding the ER due to Covid-19, according to a new study published Friday.\n\nIt provides evidence that people have stayed away from the emergency room even with acute heart attack symptoms. And some may have died as a result.Researchers from the Providence Heart Institute system based in the US northwest looked at the records of more than 15,000 heart attack patients from between December 30 and May 16 of this year. They found \"important changes\" in heart attack hospitalization rates. Patients also fared worse during the early and later parts of the pandemic, they reported Friday in the medical journal JAMA Cardiology. And patients with the most serious type of heart attack appeared to be more than twice as likely to die at one point. Read MoreThere was a substantial decrease in hospitalizations early in the pandemic, with the case rates starting to fall on February 23. Patients hospitalized for a heart attack during the pandemic tended to be younger by about 1 to 3 years than patients before the pandemic. The authors think older patients may have had a \"greater reluctance\" to get medical help if they had symptoms. Typically, older people have gotten sicker from Covid-19.Patients who were hospitalized for a heart attack during the pandemic spent less time at the hospital than before the pandemic. This may be because hospitals wanted to keep beds open in case they were needed for Covid-19 patients, the researchers said. The patients were all seen at hospitals within the Providence St. Joseph Health System in Alaska, California, Montana, Oregon, Texas and Washington. Patients were also more likely to be sent home from the hospital rather than sent to a rehabilitation center. That may have been out of a concern about the risk of being exposed to the novel coronavirus at those facilities.Around March 29, the number of people hospitalized for a heart attack did increase, but it was at a slower rate than before the pandemic. It took five full weeks to go back to the levels hospitals were seeing pre-pandemic. The researchers think the shift may have been after doctors started encouraging patients with symptoms to follow through and get care. The researchers couldn't find evidence that doctors were treating patients any differently than they would when there wasn't a pandemic. Yet there was a real difference in how well some patients did. There was a substantial increase in deaths among patients who suffered a more serious type of heart attack called STEMI. That's when one of the arteries is blocked and blood and oxygen can't get to the heart. The rate of people who died from these serious heart attacks was even greater during the later part of the pandemic, the study found.\"Compared with the before COVID-19 period, however, patients with STEMI had a statistically greater risk of mortality during the later COVID-19 period,\" they wrote. One way of analyzing the deaths, called an observed to expected ratio, indicated patients were more than twice as likely to die from STEMI heart attacks during the study period. Time matters with a serious heart attack. A delay in care due to a patient's reluctance to seek help or because emergency medical services were behind or the emergency department was full could hurt the chances of survival. This study is in line with what others have found. Early research published before it was peer reviewed saw a 25% drop in the number of acute coronary syndrome cases in March of this year compared to March of 2018 and 2019. A letter published in May in the New England Journal of Medicine found the number of patients in the US undergoing imaging for a stroke decreased by 39% since before the pandemic. The researchers say more study is needed to determine exactly what contributed to the increased number of deaths.In April, concerned about this trend, the American Heart Association put out an urgent statement asking people to call 911 if they felt heart attack symptoms like chest pain, shortness of breath, or nausea. For women it's more common to have symptoms like unexplained tiredness and nausea or vomiting. The AHA's Don't Die of Doubt campaign was necessary, the association's president Dr. Mitchell S.V. Elkind said, because people having a heart attack have a much better chance of surviving if they get help immediately.\"If people feel that they might be having symptoms of a heart attack or stroke, then they should call 911, even during the pandemic,\" Elkind said.Elkind, who was not a part of the Providence study, said he would like to know more about why this has been happening. \"Common sense would tell us that many people were afraid to come into the hospital during the pandemic, but there are some other reasons as well,\" Elkind said. In addition to fear, he heard patients say that they didn't want to be a bother to doctors who are so busy. Elkind is a neurologist at New York Presbyterian Hospital and professor of neurology and epidemiology at Columbia University.Elkind said there may also have been fewer people having heart attacks.\"This is a little bit more controversial theory,\" Elkind said. But with everyone on lockdown, there were fewer cars on the road and less pollution. \"We know that air pollution is an important risk factor for heart attacks and strokes. So that could account for some of the same effect. There may have been an actual decrease in incidence of these events.\"",

        "body": "(CNN)This isn't the first time leaders have struggled with deciding whether to keep schools open in a pandemic.\n\nDuring the influenza pandemic in 1918, even though the world was a very different place, the discussion was just as heated.That pandemic killed an estimated 5 million people worldwide, including 675,000 Americans, before it was all over.While the vast majority of cities closed their schools, three opted to keep them open -- New York, Chicago and New Haven, according to historians.The decisions of health officials in those cities was based largely on the hypothesis of public health officials that students were safer and better off at school. It was, after all, the height of the Progressive Era, with its emphasis on hygiene in schools and more nurses for each student than is thinkable now.Read MoreNew York had almost 1 million school children in 1918 and about 75% of them lived in tenements, in crowded, often unsanitary conditions, according to a 2010 article in Public Health Reports, the official journal of the US Surgeon General and the US Public Health Service.\"For students from the tenement districts, school offered a clean, well-ventilated environment where teachers, nurses, and doctors already practiced -- and documented -- thorough, routine medical inspections,\" according to the Public Health Reports article.The city was one of the hardest and earliest hit by the flu, said Dr. Howard Markel, a medical historian and director of the Center for the History of Medicine at the University of Michigan. He was a co-author of the 2010 Public Health Reports article.\"(Children) leave their often unsanitary homes for large, clean, airy school buildings, where there is always a system of inspection and examination enforced,\" New York's health commissioner at the time, Dr. Royal S. Copeland, told the New York Times after the pandemic had peaked there.Students weren't allowed to gather outside school and had to report to their teacher immediately, according to Copeland. Teachers checked students for any signs of the flu, and students who had symptoms were isolated.If students had a fever, someone from the health department would take them home, and the health official would judge whether the conditions were suitable for \"isolation and care,\" according to Public Health Reports. If not, they were sent to a hospital. \"The health department required families of the children recovering at home to either have a family physician or use the services of a public health doctor at no charge,\" the Public Health Report article said.The argument in Chicago for leaving schools open for its 500,000 students was the same: keeping schools open would keep the children off the streets and away from infected adults, the reasoning went.If social distancing was helpful then, it would have been made easier by the fact that absenteeism in schools soared during the pandemic, perhaps because of what one Chicago public health official called \"fluphobia\" among parents.\"The absentee rate was so great, it really didn't matter\" that schools were open, Markel said.Part of Chicago's strategy was to ensure that fresh air was circulated. School rooms were overheated during the winter so that windows could remain open at all times, according to a 1918 paper by the Chicago Department of Health. The paper concluded that an analysis of data showed that \"the decision of keeping the schools of this city open during the recent influenza epidemic was justified.\" And in New York, then Health Commissioner Copeland told the New York Times: \"How much better it has been to have the children under the constant observation of qualified persons than to close the schools.\" Markel, who with other researchers pored over data and historical records in looking at the response of 43 cities to the 1918 pandemic, isn't as convinced. New York \"didn't do the worst, but it didn't do the best, either,\" Markel said, adding Chicago was slightly better.Research showed that cities who implemented quarantining and isolation, school closures and bans on public gatherings fared the best, he said.\"The cities that did more than one\" of these measures \"did better. School closures were part of that contribution,\" Markel said. Public health experts, including Markel, are quick to point out that Covid-19 is not influenza, which was a well-known disease in 1918. There is still a lot to learn about the novel coronavirus and the disease it causes, Covid-19.The right decision today, Markel said, is school closure.\"It's better,\" he said, \"to be safe than sorry.\"",

During his first episode of illness, the patient had a cough, sore throat, fever and headache for three days, according to the study. He tested positive for Covid-19 on March 26. Then during his second episode, the patient was returning to Hong Kong from traveling in Spain via the United Kingdom, and he tested positive during his entry screening at the Hong Kong airport on August 15, the researchers said. The man was hospitalized again but remained asymptomatic. Read More\"The patient got re-infected 4.5 months after the first infection. Therefore, it shows that for this patient, the immunity induced by the first infection is short lasting,\" Dr. Kelvin Kai-Wang To of the University of Hong Kong, who worked on the study, said in an email to CNN.For the study, researchers at the university and various hospitals in Hong Kong analyzed specimens collected from the patient 10 days after his symptoms emerged in the first episode and then one day after hospitalization for the second episode. Genetic analysis suggested that the first infection was from a strain of the coronavirus most closely related to strains from the United States or England, and the second infection was most closely related to strains from Switzerland and England.\"This case illustrates that re-infection can occur even just after a few months of recovery from the first infection. Our findings suggest that SARS-CoV-2 may persist in humans, as is the case for other common-cold associated human coronaviruses, even if patients have acquired immunity via natural infection or via vaccination,\" the researchers wrote. The findings also show that people who have had coronavirus already should nonetheless get vaccinated if and when a vaccine becomes available, the researchers wrote.. \"Patients with previous COVID-19 infection should also comply with epidemiological control measures such as universal masking and social distancing,\" they wrote.The researchers called this the \"first case\" of re-infection of Covid-19 in their paper, but other experts are calling for more research. \"What I think is really important is that we put this into context,\" Maria Van Kerkhove, the World Health Organization's technical lead for coronavirus response and head of the emerging diseases and zoonoses unit, said during a media briefing in Geneva on Monday. \"There's been more than 24 million cases reported to date. And we need to look at something like this on a population level. And so it's very important that we document this -- and that, in countries that can do this, if sequencing can be done, that would be very, very helpful. But we need to not jump to any conclusions,\" Van Kerkhove said.\"Even if this is the first documented case of reinfection, it is possible of course because with our experience with other human coronaviruses, and the MERS coronavirus and the SARS-CoV-1 coronavirus, we know that people have an antibody response for some time but it may wane.\" This case of possible Covid-19 reinfection came as no surprise to Dr. Paul Hunter, a professor in medicine at the University of East Anglia's Norwich School of Medicine in Britain who was not involved in the new study.\"The report from Hong Kong of a re-infection in a man by COVID-19 that was genetically different from the first infection should not be too surprising. It is, however, important that this is documented,\" Hunter said in a written statement distributed by the UK-based Science Media Centre on Monday.\"Of particular note was that the case was a young and otherwise healthy person and that the second infection was diagnosed 4.5 months after the initial episode,\" he said.\"Commentators have been saying for some time that immunity is unlikely to be permanent and may only last a few months. Given the different intensity of the antibody response in people with mild or severe illness and the subsequent decay in levels, it is likely that those with a mild illness will have a shorter duration of immunity than those with severe illness.\"Dr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center and professor of pediatrics at Children's Hospital of Philadephia, said it was \"great news\" that the man in the new study had no symptoms the second time he was infected.\"That's all you want to see,\" said Offit, who was not involved in the study.He told CNN that this is a good indicator that a Covid-19 vaccine will do something similar.\"It's encouraging for the vaccine that his first infection induced an immune response that protected against disease,\" Offit said.Overall, the new study \"is a textbook example of how immunity should work,\" Akiko Iwasaki, of the Yale School of Medicine, who was not involved in the study, wrote in a Twitter post on Monday.\"Second infection was asymptomatic. While immunity was not enough to block reinfection, it protected the person from disease,\" Iwasaki tweeted. \"Patient had no detectable antibody at the time of reinfection but developed detectable antibody after reinfection. This is encouraging.\"She added that since reinfection can occur, herd immunity by natural infection is unlikely to eliminate the novel coronavirus. \"The only safe and effective way to achieve herd immunity is through vaccination,\" Iwasaki tweeted. \"Lastly, while this is a good example of how primary infection can prevent disease from subsequent infection, more studies are needed to understand the range of outcomes from reinfection.\"\n\nCNN's Elizabeth Cohen contributed to this report.",

Unable to control the 101-degree fever with cold compresses and Tylenol, and worried about her boy's headache and occasional chest tightness, Lamb took Rahsaan to the emergency room. Beyond the fever, doctors couldn't find anything wrong with Rahsaan and sent him home with instructions to come back if his temperature kept climbing. A few weeks later, across the East River in Queens, Joseph Mendoza also developed a fever.His mom, Marisol Fiallo, was afraid to take her 13-year-old son to an emergency room overwhelmed by patients with Covid-19. She decided to find a place that would agree to safely evaluate and treat her son. Read MoreOnce she'd found an open clinic that would take him, she phoned her husband to bring Joseph to her. Joseph, too, was sent home after that first evaluation with instructions to come back if the fever persisted. Both boys worsened over the days that followed. Rahsaan's fever went on for 10 days and when it finally broke, his right eye suddenly stopped moving. For Joseph, an angry looking rash and red eyes eventually accompanied his fever. Rahsann and Joseph were both admitted to the intensive care unit at New York Presbyterian Morgan Stanley Children's Hospital. Each mother faced her fears alone in the ICU. Lamb suppressed her fears and willed herself to stay in the moment, focusing on every word the doctors said. Fiallo prayed; she prayed to the Virgin of Guadalupe and all the saints, offering to perform a pilgrimage to Mexico if her son recovered. A mysterious illness gets a nameJoseph and Rahsaan did recover. After countless tests, a spinal tap for Rahsaan and medicine delivered straight to Joseph's heart, they were both diagnosed with what is now known as multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children, MIS-C for short. It's a rare complication of Covid-19. \"We didn't really know whether these cases were related to Covid at first. We saw just a few at first and most of the cases didn't have positive Covid tests,\" said Dr. Steven Kernie, chief of pediatric critical care medicine at Columbia University and New York-Presbyterian Morgan Stanley Children's Hospital.The first cases arrived in his ICU before there was an antibody test for Covid-19 and the condition could be established as a complication of Covid-19 that arises weeks after the primary infection, Kernie explained.Though questions remain, much more is now known about MIS-C. It is now defined as \"a condition where different body parts can become inflamed, including the heart, lungs, kidneys, brain, skin, eyes, or gastrointestinal organs,\" according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Its symptoms include some of what Rahsaan and Joseph experienced and more: a fever, abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, neck pain, rash, bloodshot eyes, or feeling extra tired.The rare but severe condition had affected 570 children across the country and taken the lives of 10 by the end of July, according to the latest available data from the CDC. In a parallel to what has become the narrative of Covid-19 in adults, 73% of the children affected are Black and Latino. The higher rates of the complication are likely a reflection of the greater numbers of Black and Latino children being infected with SARS-CoV2, the virus that causes Covid-19, explained Kernie. \"[These communities] have just been affected much more severely with SARS-CoV2 infection and therefore more children are going to have MIS-C. But I don't think, at least we certainly did not see in our experience, a predilection for any particular ethnicity,\" he added. 'A perfect storm of inequality'To Lamb, the data is just the latest iteration of the disparities that have affected her community for years. \"I've lived in Harlem my entire life and it's not surprising to me,\" she said. \"I've heard it a million times. It's always a higher something in our community....asthma, ADHD, it's always something.\"Lamb, who lives in a tenement owned by the New York City Housing Authority, describes the living conditions in her community as \"less than ideal.\" For instance, overcrowding has made it very difficult for people to keep their distance. She has also witnessed a lag in time between when information reaches English-speakers and when it reaches the Spanish-speaking community. \"It took a minute for them, for somebody to properly communicate to the Spanish speaking community the importance of social distancing and wearing masks,\" she said.Housing and health literacy are just a few of the many social factors that can affect the health of entire communities. What are known as the social determinants of health also include income, race, structural racism and discrimination, food insecurity, education and pollution in the air, says Dr. Dodi Meyer, director of community pediatrics and professor of pediatrics at Columbia University and New York Presbyterian Morgan Stanley Children's Hospital.\"We are living in a city of vast inequities to begin with,\" said Meyer, describing the pandemic as the \"perfect storm of inequality.\" To Meyer, who has spent her career working as a pediatrician in New York City and has studied the social determinants of health; the higher rates of MIS-C in Black and Latino children are just the tip of the iceberg. \"For all of us who have been in healthcare with our eyes really open to what's going on, this is not a surprising finding,\" said Meyer. \"I think unfortunately you need extremes to highlight something that a lot of us that have been working on this for our careers know very well,\" she added. To Meyer, the path forward starts with a true investment in prevention. Investing in prevention\"[In the U.S.] there is no public health infrastructure. There is no structure. There is in writing a prevention agenda, but there's no investment in prevention,\" said Meyer. Developed countries in which people enjoy better health than Americans spend 90 cents on medical care for every $2 spent on social services, Meyer notes. The U.S. spends $2 on medical care for every 90 cents spent on social services, resulting in worse health outcomes, she added. As Covid-19 continues to spread through the country, one thing is clear: unless the pyramid is inverted and the country invests more heavily in addressing the root causes of disease, Myer say, the health of Black and Latino communities will continue to suffer. Until then, Joseph, Rahsaan and many children like them will continue to walk around with an understanding and an appreciation of the seriousness of Covid-19 and its consequences that many adults around them lack. Both boys continue to follow up with specialists, Joseph is still on steroids to suppress the inflammation in his body and Rahsaan has refrained from playing basketball with his friends, afraid of bringing the virus home to his little niece who has recently spent more time with the family.",

        "body": "Chat with us in Facebook Messenger. Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds.\n\nChicago (CNN)It only took a few months for Illinois' budding recreational marijuana industry to blossom -- even during the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nLast year, Gov. J.B. Prizker passed bipartisan legislation legalizing marijuana for recreational use and sale in the state -- the 11th in the nation to do so - starting January 1, 2020. When the pandemic struck, dispensaries were deemed essential businesses and were allowed to remain open during lockdown.Today, it's a booming business -- July alone saw more than $60 million in sales, setting a new record for the state -- topping May and June, which had also set records. It's a boon for the state, which, like others around the United States, has had to reassess its finances because of the pandemic. In the first six months of the year, the state recouped about $52 million in tax revenue, blowing through its initial estimate for the first half of 2020 of $28 million. About 35% of that tax revenue is returned to local governments, including communities that had been negatively impacted by the criminalization of marijuana.Other states are seeing similar upticks in recreational pot sales, including Colorado, which has a much more established recreational market.Read MoreWhile polls have shown an increasing number of Americans who say they support legalization of marijuana, there remain ardent opponents, who say states in which the drug is legal have more marijuana-related car crashes and increased young adult use, and that cannabis can be a pathway for other drugs, including opioids.\"We are moving way too fast to legalize in this country without taking into account the costs of such a policy,\" says Smart Approaches to Marijuana, a leading anti-legalization group. \"We need to slow down. The only people who benefit from a rush to legalize are a small number of investors.\"But in Schaumberg, Illinois, the opening of their first dispensary was met with enthusiasm, including from local government officials who attended opening day.At the newly opened Schaumberg, Illinois, location of Sunnyside -- a dispensary chain in nine states -- a line snaked out the door all Saturday afternoon as customers waited to retrieve orders placed online. The new system and other social distancing measures are in place as a response to Covid-19. The Schaumberg location is the largest dispensary in Illinois and the chain's largest in the nation, according to Cresco Labs, which owns Sunnyside.The sales uptick in Illinois isn't tied only to the pandemic, according to Jason Erkes, a spokesman for Sunnyside and Cresco Labs. But he said he does suspect the pandemic is driving some people to buy more.\"You have more stores opened up providing greater access across the state,\" Erkes told CNN. \"You have more product coming to market, so when people are checking out, people can buy more, and you have the pandemic which just hit, causing a lot of symptoms of anxiety and depression and people are looking to cannabis as an alternative. So, it's really been a perfect storm for the industry.\"As Americans struggle with record levels of stress, anxiety, sadness and other mental health challenges as a result of the pandemic, some say they have found relief in marijuana.One customer, Joshua Simao, said marijuana helps ease not only his back and shoulder pain, but the anxiety he has felt during this uncertain time.\"Right when the pandemic hit, everybody started losing their jobs,\" Simao said. \"I was a victim of that so I really do think that this has helped me deal with that.\"Experts have cautioned that smoking or vaping marijuana can raise the risk of more severe Covid-19 complications.Smoking cannabis causes a degree of inflammation in the airways, similar to bronchitis, and daily smoking can damage the lungs over time, doctors with the American Lung Association say. An infection on top of that can lead to complications.That concern does not seem to be dampening sales or enthusiasm.\"I think municipalities across the state are seeing stores like this and realizing they made an OK decision to allow a cannabis store in their community and the tax benefit is an insular benefit,\" Erkes said. \"The residents aren't unhappy. They sky isn't falling. And they're getting a nice benefit to help with some of the issues they're having.\"",

        "body": "(CNN)A recent batch of studies, many early stage and not yet peer reviewed, show that humans have a \"robust\" immune response to Covid-19 that may protect them from further infection, even if they had mild symptoms. How long that protection lasts is still unclear, but the studies indicate it could last for months.\n\nOne leading immunologist says the findings provide optimism that people will not have to endure repeated coronavirus infections. It also provides evidence a vaccine might protect people for more than a short time.\"The hopes that I've had appear to be realized with these early studies,\" said Dr. Ian Lipkin, director of the Center for Infection and Immunity at Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health. Early in the pandemic, some scientists questioned how long the body would remember the infection and continue to produce antibodies -- the proteins the body makes to fight an infection -- to protect it. Studies showed these antibodies decline over time and different people produce different numbers of antibodies. It's been unclear what kind and what level of an antibody response is needed to provide protection. \"This is an accumulation of more information that allows people to become more comfortable with the idea that we are going to have immunity that's going to be longer in duration,\" Lipkin told CNN. \"We don't know that for a fact, but there are a few things that are interesting that gave me a basis for optimism.\"Read MoreOne of the studies showed that T cells appear to be activated by this novel coronavirus. T cells are important immune cells that stimulate various arms of the immune system and that also attack and kill cells already infected by a virus. Another study that looked at donor blood samples found that a big part of the population, between 20% to 50% of people in some areas of the US, may have T cells that recognize the novel coronavirus, even if that person has never been infected. It's still unclear why people have them. It may be what's called cross-protection from other coronaviruses that cause the common cold. What scientists still don't know is if this provides protection against Covid-19, but it has potential.\"So, this is very good news and it's optimistic,\" Lipkin said. \"You know, it is a bit of blue sky that we've been looking for.\"Jennifer Gommerman, who worked on one of the early studies, found that the antibody response to this novel coronavirus is \"actually quite durable.\"\"The immune response is doing exactly what we would expect it to,\" Gommerman, an immunologist at the University of Toronto, told CNN. \"At least at about four months, which is, as far as, most of us can measure at this point in the pandemic,\" Gommerman said. Gommerman said there is some decay in the level of antibodies, as one would expect in a normal immune response, but it does not plummet.Gommerman said another study coming out from immunologist Marion Pepper's work at the University of Washington finds that the immune response is not a \"one-trick pony.\" Instead it is like a \"Swiss Army knife that has a lot of different tools\" for fighting the novel coronavirus. Pepper's study shows that some of the T cells form memory T cells that can hang around and help provide protection in case a person encounters the novel coronavirus again. From studies that look at SARS, another coronavirus, research shows that the memory T cell response is long lived. Gommerman said since scientists have not seen a record of re-infection, even with as widespread as the pandemic is, that strongly suggests the body's immune system is working well against this threat, and re-infection is less likely.\"So that is all good news,\" Gommerman said. \"That means that people who are infected with this novel coronavirus should have the capacity to mount what's called a memory immune response to protect themselves against infection.\"What remains unclear is how long the human body's response to the novel coronavirus can provide protection. Since it's only seven months into the pandemic, these studies cannot determine how long protection lasts, but at least one shows even having a mild infection provided three months of protection and suggests that protection will likely last longer. \"The hard part about durability is that's a time dependent measurement,\" said David Masopust, a Howard Hughes Medical Institute scholar in the department of Microbiology and Immunology at the University of Minnesota. \"We'd really like to know five years from now how that looks. Unfortunately, we can't predict that today,\" Masopust added. The research results are what scientists would expect from a coronavirus, he said.\"What the research is showing us is encouraging -- that things are looking normal in the sense that you have what we call humoral immunity, or antibodies,\" Masopust told CNN.\"And you develop B cells, which can differentiate into cells that make antibodies, and it looks like you have T cells that looked durable, to the extent that this study was capable of looking at that,\" he added. \"The bad or sad news would be if they had gotten something different from these studies.\"Masopust said while these studies are encouraging, it is still unclear whether the immune system's memory can actually protect people from infection. \"Again, that's a real world experiment that, will unfortunately be done by the people come into contact with the coronavirus,\" Masopust said. Gommerman said the findings about this robust immunity response mean that any future vaccine should also provide protection for a useful period of time. \"This durable immunity that we are seeing means that when we do come up with a vaccine that is well designed and it's safe, a vaccine can replicate what the virus does,\" Gommerman said. \"People need to take it when it comes along.\"",

        "body": "(CNN)In those long-ago days of early 2020, business was cranking for Adam Flowers, a former street magician with an enterprising mind.\n\nThe owner of a Las Vegas tour business that includes ghost and mob tours, Flowers had just teamed up with 81-year-old Frank Cullotta, an admitted former hitman for the mob. They parlayed Cullotta's violent crimes of the past -- which Cullotta says included murder -- into a schtick, creating a YouTube channel called \"Coffee with Cullotta.\" It racked up thousands of views, which in turn drove visitors to the physical tour. Things were going well at home, too. Flowers, 43, had moved his retired parents to Las Vegas from Chicago the prior year. His wife worked as a technical director at Caesars Entertainment. Then came the coronavirus. By summer, Flowers' tour business was on hold, his wife was furloughed, they were living on unemployment, and Flowers and Cullotta were both stricken with Covid-19 -- too ill to record more episodes. Read MoreBut that's not the worst. On July 9, Flowers' father -- John Flowers, a former firefighter and amateur magician who inspired his son to pursue showbusiness -- died of Covid-19.\"It's a lot to have happen to you all at once,\" Flowers said. As the US struggles to contain a virus and shore up its battered economy, few states are facing a Catch-22 as stark as the one in Nevada: Reopen the bars and large entertainment venues and risk an upsurge of deadly infections. Keep everything closed and deal with Depression-era levels of unemployment and the death of businesses. At 15%, the state's unemployment rate in June -- the latest available data -- is the fourth highest in the US, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. (The July figures for states will be released August 21.) It does mark an improvement: Nevada's jobless rate was twice as high back in April, when it topped the nation. Although bars remain shuttered, the casinos -- which were closed for more than two months -- reopened in early June, and the city witnessed a brief surge of car travelers from Western states. But Covid-19 infections and deaths in Nevada rose steadily through July. Jeremy Aguero, an economist with Las Vegas policy research firm Applied Analysis, believes Nevada's jobless rate will soon worsen, because demand tapered off in July. A full recovery, Aguero said, is between 18 and 36 months out. \"The long arc of this challenge is going to be painful,\" he said. No state's economy leans more heavily on tourism than Nevada's, and tourism in the state has been walloped by the pandemic. Even with the bump in June, visitor volume that month was 70% below June of 2019, according to the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority. Crowds -- the life blood of Sin City -- have become danger zones, and Vegas like all cities has been forced to drain itself of them. The toll on entertainers has been especially brutal. Situation for entertainers getting 'dire' Desiree Gordon was an exotic dancer at Sapphire Las Vegas -- a gentleman's club on the Vegas Strip. She weathered the 2008 recession just fine. Traveling businessmen, she said, still streamed in, purchasing $2,000 bottles of champagne. \"We were still getting a bunch of daily tips,\" said Gordon, 37. \"You know, we were still making more than the person working at Target.\" When Sapphire closed in March because of the virus, she found herself filing for unemployment for the first time in her life. By July, she was living on the couch of a friend who'd just tested positive for Covid-19. This sent Gordon looking for another rental unit for her and her 11-year-old daughter. \"I don't know how renting's gonna happen,\" she said. \"No one has jobs because of what's going on. So how do I get into a place?\" Showbusiness has come to a standstill in Vegas. From striptease acts to musical residencies to variety shows, entertainment in the city has gone dark. Some entertainers are finding creative ways to stay physically fit. Silvia Silvia, a 60-something crossbow daredevil sharpshooter who performs at a variety show at the Rio Showroom called \"Wow,\" keeps her chops up in her tiny backyard garden. Here, the grandmother of six practices one of her signature routines: shooting a balloon balanced on a stick held in the mouth of her husband, Victor -- a professional juggler. \"If I don't have space to practice I will be crazy,\" said Silvia, a native of Spain. But she's getting antsy: \"We need to be on stage.\" In late June, citing the pandemic, Cirque du Soleil, a Montreal-based circus company that has dominated Vegas for two decades, filed for bankruptcy protection. As part of the announcement, it laid off 3,500 employees.Jimmy Slonina, a 47-year-old physical comedian, was working as a backup performer for both Cirque du Soleil and the Atomic Saloon Show, a raunchy wild west act at The Venetian resort. Both shut down. A seasoned performer, Slonina -- who is married to Robin Slolina, an artist who was a judge on Skin Wars, a reality-contest show for body-painting -- said he is mulling other ways to make a living: copywriting, social-media marketing, voice-over work. \"But there are a lot of people in those businesses who have gone to school for it and have years of experience,\" Slonina said, \"when I was wasting my time, dropping my pants in front of thousands of people every night.\" Since the shutdown Slonina said he has participated in a quarantine cabaret online and made a chunk of change on tips. He even participated in an adult-only, paid-service version of the cabaret -- with more nudity. It was a one-off.The Sloninas own a house, but he is nervously watching their savings dwindle. He said the last of his unemployment checks has been cashed. \"It's not going to be long before it gets pretty dire,\" he said. Harry Shahoian was one of the busiest Elvis Presley impersonators in Vegas, but at the moment, he doesn't feel like The King. The pandemic killed the music in mid-March and it hasn't turned back on. All his regular shows have vanished. Shahoian said he easily made six figures in normal times. Now, he's on unemployment. Although the casinos are open, Shahoian says it just isn't the same, what with all the gamblers wearing masks. \"You don't usually come to Vegas to be careful,\" he said. \"You go there to be reckless and have fun.\" While Vegas is known for its tourism and entertainment, the pandemic has decimated another outsize local industry: conventions, which in 2018 brought 6.5 million people to town and employed nearly 43,000 people, according to the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority. Most of the conventions in the Covid era have been canceled -- even some for next year. Marty Bindschatel worked full time for 22 years in the once-booming convention and trade-show industry. \"I thought this was going to be the best year ever,\" said Bindschatel, 45, noting that 2020 was booked solid with big events. Now, \"my life is on pause.\" Bindschatel, who worked as a freight foreman, said he is \"plowing through\" his savings and scared. He says he's leaving Vegas for Reno, where it's cheaper. \"Not scared of the virus,\" he said. \"I'm healthy; I work out every single day. ... I'm afraid of our economy. And I'm afraid of Las Vegas not coming back in a sensible manner.\" The pandemic has also ravaged one of Nevada's best-known industries: that of legalized prostitution, which isn't legal in Las Vegas but is elsewhere throughout the state.Madam Dena, who heads Sheri's Ranch -- one of the largest legal brothels in Nevada -- said the shutdown of her industry has created a dangerous situation for the 75 sex workers who do business at her facility in the town of Pahrump, about an hour outside of Vegas. As independent contractors, she said, they do not qualify for unemployment benefits or qualify for business aid. And the contractors -- who generally make between $70,000 and $100,000 annually -- have trouble landing what Dena calls \"square jobs,\" such as office work.\"The independent contractors -- the sex workers -- are having to try illegal avenues to support their families,\" said Dena, who for privacy reasons asked that her last name not be used. \"If a girl is having to go to a hotel room -- at least I pray it's a hotel room and not like a back of a car or something -- she's running the risk that the person can take advantage of her.\"At Sheri's Ranch, she said, all customers -- and sex workers -- are screened for sexually transmitted diseases, and there are panic buttons inside the rooms and security on hand should things go sideways. Dena believes the sex trade in Nevada has been unfairly overlooked, noting how other businesses that involve human contact -- such as massage parlors and nail salons -- have been allowed to reopen. \"Nothing's been said about any of the sex workers or the brothels in the state of Nevada -- from the governor, from anywhere -- just that we can't open,\" she said. \"There's different ways we can change the services around to still accommodate people.\"The risk of eviction: 'I'm scared to death'It's a lot to process in a place that remains traumatized by the foreclosure crisis of 2008, which hit Nevada harder than any other state. And yet, the number of layoffs during the pandemic -- 280,000 in just two months -- already eclipses the 196,000 jobs lost in 2 1/2 years during the prior crisis, according to a report by Applied Analysis, using data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.Many Las Vegans are suddenly worried about keeping a roof over their heads. About 47% of renter households in Nevada are at risk of eviction, according to a tracking tool developed by global advisory firm Stout Risius Ross, LLC. (The national average is 42.6%.) \"That's a sixth of the (state's) population,\" said Emily Benfer, who co-created a Covid-19 housing policy scorecard with Princeton University's Eviction Lab, a national research center on evictions. The state's eviction moratorium is set to expire September 1 and housing advocates are worried about an eviction tsunami. \"I'm scared to death,\" said Stacey Lockhart of HopeLink of Southern Nevada, a nonprofit that helps people living in poverty. \"I'm predicting that by September we're going to see evictions go through the roof.\" Among the renters that HopeLink has helped keep afloat is Reynaldo Arroyo, a hip-hop dancer who has appeared on \"America's Got Talent\" and danced for Cirque du Soleil. He was most recently a freelancer who performed street shows and conventions.Arroyo, 30, said he'd had $10,000 worth of gigs booked for the next couple months when everything shut down. \"Poof,\" he said of the work, \"completely gone.\" To pay rent, he and his wife took out loans. To pay for groceries, they opened a credit card. When they lost the ability to pay rent, HopeLink came to their aid. \"Everything is just falling apart slowly,\" he said. \"I'm just trying to keep it together.\" After months of unemployment, Arroyo finally landed a job as a \"bud tender\" at a cannabis dispensary. On his first day of work in early August, Arroyo says he clocked in and the manager promptly notified him that a coworker had tested positive for Covid-19. \"I was like, 'Oh my God,'\" he said. Not everyone thinks a tidal wave of evictions in Nevada is imminent. Susy Vasquez, executive director of the Nevada State Apartment Association, said only about 10% of renters statewide have been delinquent. Nearly half of them, she added, have \"ghosted\" their landlords -- that is, they have not been at all communicative. Those are the ones who are most likely to be evicted first, she said. \"We have people buying cars and RVs but not paying their rent,\" she said, adding that landlords have spotted tenants who have new cars in their driveways or are illegally renting out their units on Airbnb \"but haven't paid a cent in rent.\" Vasquez acknowledged that the situation could soon take a turn, now that a $600 weekly jobless benefit for out-of-work Americans has expired -- especially if it isn't soon renewed. \"People are going to be a little more strapped,\" she said. How Covid-19 hit every part of this entertainer's lifeFor Adam Flowers -- owner of the Vegas ghost and mobster tour business -- the anguish of the virus is all-encompassing, wreaking havoc on his livelihood and his family. He and his wife, Alicia Morse, are crossing their fingers that Caesars Entertainment will keep them on her health insurance after August. They cut off insurance payments to a car, which they now can't drive. The YouTube views for \"Coffee with Cullotta\" -- Morse's idea -- have dropped off.\"We went from having just a steady cash flow, everything was running fine, to slam the brakes on and throw it in reverse and everybody wants their money back,\" he said. \"Everybody was canceling their trips out here.\" And then there was the virus itself. Flowers said he and his parents had tried to be so careful: they wore masks, they stopped hugging (to his mother's chagrin). \"I want to look back and go, 'wow, we were overly cautious,'\" he said. Flowers remembers the day in mid-June when he was helping his 74-year-old mother, Donna, bring the groceries into their house. She had been coughing; her doctor told her it was likely a sinus infection. It turned out to be Covid-19, which would give her double pneumonia, leaving both of her lungs infected. While helping her put away groceries, Flowers noticed his 78-year-old father emerge from his bedroom and sit on the hallway floor. His breathing seemed labored. Flowers asked John if he was OK. \"He's hard of hearing -- and with the mask on, he couldn't hear me,\" Flowers said. \"So I pulled my mask down, 'Dad!'\" Flowers picked up his father, draping the elderly man's arm over his shoulder, and helped him into a chair. \"That's gotta be when I got infected,\" he said. Two days later, as a pre-symptomatic carrier, Flowers went to lunch at the Peppermill with Frank Cullotta, the 81-year-old former mobster, after they finished a recording session for their YouTube channel. \"We took our masks off, and we sat there and ate,\" he said. \"That must be when I gave it to him.\" Cullotta, he said, is still sick. Eventually, the symptoms kicked in for Flowers, and he -- like his parents and Cullotta -- tested positive. \"It felt like I had crushed glass and needles in my chest -- in my lungs,\" he said. \"And when I coughed, all these little sharp pains in there. I never felt that before; it was terrible.\" The 6-foot-5 Flowers said he lost 20 pounds in two weeks. And yet, as somebody who has experienced both the economic and biological havoc of Covid-19, Flowers finds himself torn on which side to prioritize. \"I lost my father, so I know this disease -- it's a real thing,\" he said. At the same time, Flowers said, \"How long can everybody just sit? ... How long can the government keep printing money?\"",

        "body": "Chat with us in Facebook Messenger. Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds.\n\n(Kaiser Health News)Flu season will look different this year, as the country grapples with a coronavirus pandemic that has already killed more than 176,000 people.\n\nMany Americans are reluctant to visit a doctor's office, and public health officials worry people will shy away from being immunized.Although sometimes incorrectly regarded as just another bad cold, flu also kills tens of thousands of people in the United States each year, with the very young, the elderly and those with underlying conditions the most vulnerable. When coupled with the effects of Covid-19, public health experts say it's more important than ever to get a flu shot.If enough of the US population gets vaccinated -- more than the 45% who did last flu season -- it could help head off a nightmare scenario in the coming winter of hospitals stuffed with both Covid-19 patients and those suffering from severe effects of influenza.Aside from the potential burden on hospitals, there's the possibility people could get both viruses and \"no one knows what happens if you get influenza and Covid (simultaneously) because it's never happened before,\" Dr. Rachel Levine, Pennsylvania's secretary of health, told reporters last week.Read MoreIn response, manufacturers are producing more vaccine supply this year, between 194 million and 198 million doses, or about 20 million more than they distributed last season, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. As flu season approaches, here are some answers to a few common questions:Q: When should I get my flu shot?Advertising has already begun, and some pharmacies and clinics have their supplies now. But, because the effectiveness of the vaccine can wane over time, the CDC recommends against a shot in August. Many pharmacies and clinics will start immunizations in early September. Generally, influenza viruses start circulating in mid- to late October but become more widespread later, in the winter. It takes about two weeks after getting a shot for antibodies -- which circulate in the blood and thwart infections -- to build up. \"Young, healthy people can begin getting their flu shots in September, and elderly people and other vulnerable populations can begin in October,\" said Dr. Steve Miller, chief clinical officer for insurer Cigna. The CDC has recommended that people \"get a flu vaccine by the end of October,\" but noted it's not too late to get one after that because shots \"can still be beneficial and vaccination should be offered throughout the flu season.\"Even so, some experts say don't wait too long this year -- not only because of Covid-19, but also in case a shortage develops because of overwhelming demand. Q: What are the reasons I should roll up my sleeve for this?Get a shot because it provides protection against the flu and, thereby, from spreading it to others, which may help lessen the burden on hospitals and medical staff. And there's another message that may resonate in this strange time.\"It gives people a sense that there are some things you can control,\" said Eduardo Sanchez, chief medical officer for prevention at the American Heart Association. While a flu shot won't prevent Covid-19, he said, getting one could help your doctors differentiate between the two diseases if you develop any symptoms -- fever, cough, sore throat -- they share. And even though flu shots won't prevent all cases of the flu, getting vaccinated can lessen the severity if you do fall ill, he said.You cannot get influenza from having a flu vaccine.All eligible people, especially essential workers, those with underlying conditions and those at higher risk -- including very young children and pregnant women -- should seek protection, the CDC said. It recommends that children over 6 months old get vaccinated.Q: What do we know about the effectiveness of this year's vaccine?Flu vaccines -- which must be developed anew each year because influenza viruses mutate -- range in effectiveness annually, depending on how well they match the circulating virus. Last year's formulation was estimated to be about 45% effective in preventing the flu overall, with about a 55% effectiveness in children. The vaccines available in the US this year are aimed at preventing at least three different strains of the virus, and most cover four. It isn't yet known how well this year's supply will match the strains that will circulate in the US Early indications from the Southern Hemisphere, which goes through its flu season during our summer, are encouraging. There, people practiced social distancing, wore masks and got vaccinated in greater numbers this year -- and global flu levels are lower than expected. Experts caution, however, not to count on a similarly mild season in the US, in part because masking and social distancing efforts vary widely.Q: What are insurance plans and health systems doing differently this year?Insurers and health systems contacted by KHN say they will follow CDC guidelines, which call for limiting and spacing out the number of people waiting in lines and vaccination areas. Some are setting appointments for flu shots to help manage the flow. Health Fitness Concepts, a company that works with UnitedHealth Group and other businesses to set up flu shot clinics in the Northeast, said it is \"encouraging smaller, more frequent events to support social distancing\" and \"requiring all forms to be completed and shirtsleeves rolled up before entering the flu shot area.\" Everyone will be required to wear masks.Also, nationally, some physician groups contracted with UnitedHealth will set up tent areas, so shots can be given outdoors, a spokesperson said. Kaiser Permanente plans drive-thru vaccinations at some of its medical facilities and is testing touch-free screening and check-in procedures at some locations. (KHN is not affiliated with Kaiser Permanente.) Geisinger Health, a regional health provider in Pennsylvania and New Jersey, said it, too, would have outdoor flu vaccination programs at its facilities.Additionally, \"Geisinger is making it mandatory for all employees to receive the flu vaccine this year,\" said Mark Shelly, the system's director of infection prevention and control. \"By taking this step, we hope to convey to our neighbors the importance of the flu vaccine for everyone.\"Q: Usually I get a flu shot at work. Is that still going to be an option this year?Aiming to avoid risky indoor gatherings, many employers are reluctant to sponsor the on-site flu clinics they've offered in years past. And with so many people continuing to work from home, there's less need to bring flu shots to employees on the job. Instead, many employers are encouraging workers to get shots from their primary care doctors, at pharmacies or other community settings. Insurance will generally cover the cost of the vaccine. Some employers are considering offering vouchers for flu shots to their uninsured workers or those who don't participate in the company plan, said Julie Stone, managing director for health and benefits at Willis Towers Watson, a consulting firm. The vouchers could allow workers to get the shot at a particular lab at no cost, for example. Some employers are starting to think about how they might use their parking lots for administering drive-thru flu shots, said Dr. David Zieg, clinical services leader for benefits consultant Mercer. Although federal law allows employers to require employees to get flu shots, that step is typically taken only by health care facilities and some universities where people are living and working closely together, Zieg said.But it does happen. Last month, the University of California system issued an executive order requiring all students, faculty and staff get a flu shot by Nov. 1, with limited exceptions. Q: What are pharmacies doing to encourage people to get flu shots?Some pharmacies are making an extra push to get out into the community to offer flu shots. Walgreens, which has nearly 9,100 pharmacies nationwide, is continuing a partnership begun in 2015 with community organizations, churches and employers that has offered about 150,000 off-site and mobile flu clinics to date.The program places a special emphasis on working with vulnerable populations and in underserved areas, said Dr. Kevin Ban, chief medical officer for the drugstore chain. Walgreens began offering flu shots in mid-August and is encouraging people not to delay getting vaccinated. Both Walgreens and CVS are encouraging people to schedule appointments and do paperwork online this year to minimize time spent in the stores.At CVS MinuteClinic locations, once patients have checked in for their flu shot, they must wait outside or in their car, since the indoor waiting areas are now closed. \"We don't have tons of arrows in our quiver against Covid,\" Walgreens' Ban said. \"Taking pressure off the health care system by providing vaccines in advance is one thing we can do.\"\n\nKHN (Kaiser Health News) is a nonprofit news service covering health issues.

Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds.\n\n(CNN)India has recorded more than 2 million total coronavirus cases, only three weeks after announcing it had hit 1 million confirmed infections, as the country's healthcare systems buckle under the pressure of the escalating pandemic.\n\nOn Friday, India's Ministry of Health and Family Welfare announced that it has recorded more than 2,027,000 confirmed cases, including 41,585 deaths. The rising caseload sees India become only the third country to report more than 2 million cases, behind the United States -- which has seen nearly 4.9 million cases -- and Brazil, which has recorded more than 2.9 million, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University (JHU). India's infection rate has increased exponentially in recent weeks. It took almost six months for the country to record 1 million cases, another 12 days to reach 1.5 million, and only another nine days to hit 2 million.After initially appearing to have curbed the spread of the virus, India, the world's second most populous nation, has struggled to cope with the fast-expanding outbreak. Read MoreAcross the country, critically ill virus patients have been turned away from public and private hospitals for lack of beds, staff and equipment. Earlier this month, a minister died of the virus while two Indian cabinet ministers checked into hospital after testing positive.The virus has also hit celebrities, including Bollywood star Amitabh Bachchan, one of India's most famous actors. The 77-year-old announced Sunday that he has been discharged from hospital after a three-week stay. But India's health authorities have said that part of the reason for the soaring cases is an increase in testing.Since July 29, when India's caseload passed 1.5 million, the country has carried out an estimated 5 million tests, bringing its total number of tests to 22.7 million as of Thursday, according to the Indian Council of Medical Research. And according to health authorities, around 68% of the confirmed cases have now recovered. In India, not all patients require a test to be considered recovered. Patients with mild and moderate symptoms are considered no longer active after 10 days of symptom onset if they meet certain conditions, and a test to confirm that they no longer have the virus is not required. However, severe cases can only be discharged after one negative coronavirus test.Compared with other countries, India's mortality rate remains low. According to JHU data, India has around three deaths per 100,000, compared with almost 67 deaths per 100,000 in the United Kingdom, which has the highest mortality rate of the top 20 most affected countries. India's outbreakAlthough India now has one of the world's largest known outbreaks, it took relatively swift steps against coronavirus during the first phases of the pandemic. In March, Prime Minister Narendra Modi ordered a \"complete\" lockdown for India's 1.3 billion people, making it the largest lockdown in the world. While these measures have been progressively eased over the last few months, some hard-hit parts of the country are still under strict coronavirus restrictions.The country's move to a lockdown likely helped lessen the impact of the outbreak, experts have suggested. But the lockdown also underscored India's inequality, especially in urban areas.After India announced its nationwide lockdown, millions of daily-wage earners living in cities found themselves out of work. Some opted to travel thousands of miles back home to their families in other parts of the country. And for the around 74 million people living in India's overcrowded slums, social distancing was impossible. A study last month found that more than half of residents living in Mumbai's crowded slums may have contracted coronavirus, meaning they were likely being infected at a much higher rate than those not living in slum areas.\n\nCNN's Vedika Sud contributed to this report.",

        "body": "(CNN)As the coronavirus pandemic gained traction in the United States, internet searches for key words related to panic attacks and acute anxiety spiked.\n\nGoogle searches for anxiety symptoms from mid-March to mid-May were the highest they've been in the history of the search engine, according to researchers at the Qualcomm Institute's Center for Data Driven Health at the University of California San Diego.The study was published Monday in the Journal of the American Medical Association.In particular, anxiety and panic attack searches corresponded to major news events, including March 16, when social distancing guidelines were put in place nationally; and March 29, when those guidelines were extended. Queries also spiked on April 3, when US President Donald Trump announced face mask recommendations; and on April 11, when the US surpassed Italy in the number of coronavirus deaths. Read MoreThe results could give leaders and policy makers perspective on how to manage the general population's perception of public health directives, and could inform how we empower those in crisis to seek help quickly, researchers said. \"For some, fear has a greater adverse effect on their health than Covid does,\" said John Ayers, lead author of the study and adjunct associate professor at San Diego State University. \"The results can help leaders listen and think holistically about the cost of some of those measures.\"Timely insight into the nation's moodResearchers monitored how often people searched phrases such as \"panic attack,\" \"anxiety attack,\" \"am I having a panic attack?\", \"signs of anxiety attack\" and \"anxiety attack symptoms.\"The scientists compared the total number of anxiety-related searches during the early days of the pandemic with data reaching back to January 2004, and they adjusted for variables such as population growth and increased internet use over the past two decades.Compared with where the trend on these search terms had been headed prior to the pandemic, the research team said they believe that the crisis caused an 11% increase in searches related to panic attacks during the 58-day period.\"In practical terms, over the first 58 days of the Covid-19 pandemic there were an estimated 3.4 million total searches related to severe acute anxiety in the United States,\" said Benjamin Althouse, an affiliate assistant professor at the University of Washington, and a collaborator on the study. \"Searches for anxiety and panic attacks were the highest they've ever been in over 16 years of historical search data.\"The highest overall day was March 28, a day before social distancing guidelines were extended, in which anxiety searches were 52% higher than expected, had there not been a pandemic.This study comes a week after the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention published survey data showing a spike in the number of people reporting increased substance abuse and seriously considering suicide, a trend that was similarly pronounced as well in the Black and Latino communities.The CDC's report included a startling statistic that one in four people ages 18 through 24 had reported suicidal thoughts in the 30 days preceding the survey.How to better help people in crisisThis new data could help officials design interventions that directly benefit a person in the midst of a panic attack, and it can help researchers target where and when heightened emotional stress is taking place.Using search engine results can give a more real-time insight to meet people where they are, as compared with more traditional research methods such as doing a telephone survey or enrolling participants into a study, Ayers explained.\"Listening to the public can have a direct impact,\" Ayers said. \"We see people expressing a need and seeking help. Internet search is also a pathway for intervention.\"He and his team highlighted Illinois' Call4Calm hotline, rolled out by the state's Department of Human Services' Division of Mental Health to provide anonymous support to people experiencing emotional stress and mental health issues during the Covid-19 crisis.\"This can be scaled up,\" he said.Another way to deploy public health resources where people can access them most immediately, might be to use existing search tools, such as Google's OneBox, to prioritize information that can help in emergencies, the researchers argued.The OneBox feature, which the search giant often uses to highlight news, shopping or image results, is used to prominently display the phone number for the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline, 1-800-273-8255, above other search results if someone inputs a suicide-related search query.Know the signs and what to doYou may be having a panic attack if you're feeling a fast or irregular heartbeat, chest pain, dizziness, headaches or a loss of appetite, according to the National Health Service in the United Kingdom.Emotional signs of a panic attack include symptoms such as feeling tense or nervous, worrying about the past or future, feeling tearful and not being able to sleep or relax.If you're experiencing panic attack symptoms, the NHS recommends calm breathing practices, getting enough exercise, eating a healthy diet, seeking out peer support and using a mindfulness or meditation app.Mental health experts also say that it can be useful to practice gratitude and establish a schedule. Especially during the coronavirus crisis, it's important to be careful with how and when you engage with the media, if news is driving your anxiety. And limiting social media use can help too, as they can spread misinformation and conspiracy theories about the virus.\"A panic attack is not to be taken lightly as it can land someone in the emergency room with shortness of breath, a pounding heart, chest pain, and an intense feeling of fear,\" Ayers said. \"Our results unquestionably warrant a need for increased mental health services.\"\n\nCNN's Sandee LaMotte contributed to this story.",

        "body": "Chat with us in Facebook Messenger. Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds.\n\n(CNN)Before the pandemic, many of us found ourselves doing a little more parenting than we knew we ought to be doing.\n\nMaybe we weren't full-on \"helicopters\" or \"snow plows,\" and, no, we would never have done something illegal to try to ensure our kids' success. Still, many of our parenting decisions -- especially those of us privileged enough to be making lots of choices about our children's lives -- were informed by more \"shoulds\" than \"coulds.\" The diagnosis? Never-enough-itis. The symptoms? Busyness, guilt and deluding ourselves into thinking we could pull this off. Our kids, the magical thinking went, would be wildly successful, self-motivated and down-to-earth, and we parents would remain balanced and happy. Rising income inequality, a lack of community and the increasingly winner-takes-all atmosphere in which we live didn't help. Read MoreBut now, the chaos and suffering brought on by Covid-19 have laid bare just how impossible our parenting standards are. It has never been clearer how much is expected of parents, mostly moms, with little support from our workplaces and public institutions. Contrary to popular belief, moms are also subject to the time constraints created by the rotation of the planet. We too, only have 24 hours in a day. Then there is the impact on our kids, our poor kids, who saw what little agency they had over their time and life choices go down the drain. Our children don't need us pushing them to be shinier, more brag-worthy versions of themselves in this moment.Two new books consider what perfectionist parenting does to the human brain, and what a relaxed, more compassionate parenting can look like for parents and kids. While both titles were written pre-Covid, their messages about privileging connection over perfection are more urgent than ever. It's hard to avoid perfectionismJudith Warner, author of the recently published \"And Then They Stopped Talking to Me: Making Sense of Middle School\" had never intended to be a parent that pushed her kids too far.\"It was always my very conscious intent -- my most precious hope as a parent, in fact -- that my daughters would feel loved and valued for who they were and not what they accomplished,\" Warner said of her daughters, now 20 and 23.But even with the best of intentions, her kids got the wrong message anyway. This was partly from the world around them, which defined success in somewhat narrow terms: good grades, fancy college degree, followed by professional success. It was also because no matter how hard we try to say the right things, our children tend to be keen observers of our true, sometimes even unconcious, desires.\"As so much social science research has shown, children learn far more from the way that we live and the things that we do than they do from what we say, and, particularly once they hit middle school age,\" said Warner, also the author of the bestselling 2006 book \"Perfect Madness: Motherhood in the Age of Anxiety.\" Tweens and young teens are \"super-sensitive to the gap between what we say and what we do,\" she said. These actions that speak louder than words can help our children feel like a product; something we shape, mold and nurture, with an intended outcome in mind.In \"Parenting Outside the Lines: Forget the Rules, Tap into Your Wisdom, and Connect with Your Child,\" writer and parenting coach Meghan Leahy noted how, in the past, parents were more inclined to stand back and watch kids become who they are. That's how most older millennial adults I know were raised.Before the pandemic, many parents operated with the logic that everything they do matters, so they should be doing everything, completely right and very often. This turned what should be a relational relationship into a transactional one, and it had a strange and unhealthy impact on the power balance between parent and child. No wonder everyone was already exhausted when the pandemic and protests hit.Now everything is off the table, and we have a chance to change our ways. The answer isn't necessarily to go back to benign neglect of previous decades, Leahy said, but to find the balance that works for your child.Our kids don't need any more pressureWhen our lives are too kid-oriented, it gives kids too much power, explained Leahy.\"It has been such a disservice to their little souls to be made to feel so important in ways that aren't authentic,\" she said. This pressure to become rather than be can cause kids stress and is likely a factor in the rise in anxiety and depression among children. For those of us sheltering in place, or limiting social engagements, the parent-child dynamic is likely occupying more real estate in the emotional lives of our children than it did before. We need to step back.Children, though especially tweens and teens, \"need psychological, emotional and physical space. Without that space, they can't do the work they need to do on becoming who they are,\" Warner said. \"They also can't develop the skills they need in order to be successful -- at whatever they do.\"As children get older, they need less and less scaffolding from parents, Warner explained, in terms of how they should organize their lives and what their goals should be. However, like children of all ages, they still need parents who are there for them emotionally. Try to treat them more like your friend, and less like your intern or mentee.How to say goodbye to perfectionismUnfortunately, scaling back is not that easy. Even during a pandemic. The culture of intensive, perfectionist parenting runs deep.As a first step, Leahy encouraged parents to remember to make sure they are taking care of themselves. This is always the case, but it's especially true now with the world putting more demands on parents than ever.\"Every single day, a hundred times a day, parents ask me, 'how do we do the fall?\"\" Leahy said, referring to the return to distance learning. \"I tell them: The first thing you need to do is to figure out your schedule and your needs. People can't believe it.\" When parents consider their own needs first, the benefits are twofold. One, kids feel less pressure, even if they aren't conscious of it, as less of the family life is oriented around them. Two, parents are in a better mood and therefore more able to deal with the inevitable emotional upheavals that come with family life during a pandemic. Once we achieve that bandwidth, Leahy said, we will be less likely to take \"our kids' shenanigans personally.\" When we don't take them personally, we feel less like a failure as parents, and our kids feel less like failures too, as they haven't disappointed us as much. Just like that, the internal pressure to be perfect diminishes on both sides.Another step in toning down perfectionist parenting is to untangle the parental ego from the performance of the child. Parents can do this by making it clear to their kids that they matter, no matter what, and then extend this attitude to the wider community. Doing this requires telling and showing, Warner said. \"Parents say 'Be nice!' and then they contribute to the exclusion of low-status, 'unpopular/weird' kids in the way they form car pools; allow parties to come together; witness exclusion and do nothing about it; or even join in mean behavior by gossiping along with their kids,\" she said in an email. These kinds of social hierarchies might be playing out differently today. Who are your kids distance hanging with? Chatting with on their phones? If they suddenly stop talking about their BFF's TikToks, ask them why.Our children learn a lot about the way we view them through the way we talk about and treat other children. Kids also see how we treat ourselves, especially in high-pressure moments like the one we are living in.Over the years as a parenting coach, Leahy saw many families realize their breaking point -- the moment parents realized their expectations were too high and their \"lives were living them.\" It was a moment of reappraisal of their values and lifestyles, and it would often lead to positive change.The pandemic, Leahy said, could function as a breaking point for many families without, hopefully, all the breaking.\"This is a beautiful time to ask our kids what they like. Notice what they are doing during the pandemic, and what they are missing and what they aren't,\" Leahy said. \"I've seen kids whisper to their parents, 'I don't miss travel soccer. I don't miss soccer at all.' And then there are the kids that are crying because they so miss an activity, because it is so in their heart,\" Leahy said.\"We have been gifted an opportunity to really see what lights our kids up.\" We've also, I'd add, been gifted an opportunity to see what lights us up as parents in our relationships with our children. What do we want our time together to look and feel like? If you watch and listen, to your children and yourself, you might find out. Perfectionism is not an easy habit to quit. Still, a moment like this, with all the upheaval, stress and uncertainty, is as good a time as any to give it a try.\n\nElissa Strauss is a regular contributor to CNN, where she writes about the politics and culture of parenthood.",

    "Jerry Falwell Jr.'s fatal miscalculation": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "Jerry Falwell Jr.'s fatal miscalculation\n\nAnalysis by Daniel Burke, CNN Religion Editor\n\nUpdated 0901 GMT (1701 HKT) August 30, 2020\n\n(CNN)Last fall, as scrutiny of his leadership of Liberty University began to intensify, Jerry Falwell Jr. revealed to a CNN reporter one of the secrets of his school's success.\n\nIt didn't start, he said, with his famous father, the Rev. Jerry Falwell, who built the religious right, starred in the \"Old Time Gospel Hour\" on TV and founded the evangelical college in Lynchburg, Virginia. Instead Falwell Jr. praised the pluck and moral flexibility of his grandfather, a bootlegger who delivered moonshine to Virginia hill-dwellers during Prohibition. Dismissive of organized religion, Carey Falwell died at age 55, with a hip flask in his pocket and an unsaved soul, his grandson said. \"My father became a Christian,\" said Falwell Jr., \"but he took that same entrepreneurial spirit into the religious world. And that's why Liberty is where it is today.\" Fallwell Jr., whose tenure as president and chancellor of Liberty University crashed to an inglorious end this week, always seemed closer in spirit to his defiant, bootlegging grandfather than his Bible-thumping namesake. Read MoreIn recent years he has tweeted racist photos and told students that if more people carried guns \"we could end those Muslims before they walk in.\" He has called a parent concerned about coronavirus on campus a \"dummy\" and told a pastor to \"grow a pair.\" He has posted pictures from a party on a yacht suggesting activities that would violate his own school's honor code. And he has fervently supported Donald Trump, comparing him to Jesus and excusing all-manner of un-Christlike behavior. Each time, Falwell would insist he is not a moral leader. His job was to grow Liberty's endowment, campus and student body. \"I have never been a minister,\" he told one critic on Twitter, pointing to his background as a lawyer and real estate developer. \"The faculty, students and campus pastor ... are the ones who keep LU strong spiritually as the best Christian univ in the world,\" he added. \"While I am proud to be a conservative Christian, my job is to keep LU successful academically, financially and in athletics.\"It seemed strange to hear the heir to the Moral Majority's founder and the leader of a school that aims to \"train champions for Christ\" disavowing the responsibility to live a Christian life. But it worked, for a while, because by most worldly measures, Falwell Jr. was a raging success. He oversaw $1 billion in new construction projects, pioneered online learning platforms that boosted enrollment and brought Liberty's football and basketball teams to Division 1, the most competitive level of college sports. (Somehow, amid all of this success, Liberty quietly cut the budget at its divinity school.) Did it matter if Falwell Jr. sometimes acted more like the president of a frat than the country's largest Christian university? Ultimately, yes. \"Saying that he was just a real estate lawyer and not a moral leader was not a luxury he had,\" said one former Liberty University official, who asked to remain anonymous. Falwell Jr. likely assumed that as long as he kept Liberty rolling in money, no one would care much about his personal morality. \"That,\" the former Liberty official told CNN, \"was a fatal miscalculation.\" One scandal too manyFalwell Jr.'s latest scandal blew up on Monday when a young Miami man went public with allegations that he and Falwell's wife Becki had regular sexual liaisons for years, sometimes while Falwell looked on. A day earlier, in an apparent attempt to preempt the allegations, Falwell publicly acknowledged that Becki had an \"inappropriate personal relationship\" with a man but said that he himself was \"not involved.\"Falwell also accused the Miami man, Giancarlo Granda, of blackmailing him and his wife, a charge Granda adamantly denies. A former hotel pool attendant who met the Falwells at a luxury hotel in Miami in 2012, Granda said the Falwells initiated the affair and are \"victim-shaming.\" Ganda said his sexual relationship with the Falwells lasted until 2019 and included trips to the family's farm and to meet President Trump. By this time, Falwell's tenure at the school was already in jeopardy.He had been placed on temporary leave by Liberty's board of trustees on August 7 after he posted a photo on Instagram that showed him with his pants unzipped and his midsection visible. In the photo, Falwell is holding a cup of dark liquid and has one arm around a woman whose shorts are also unzipped. Falwell later apologized and told a radio station the photo was \"just good fun.\" The school's bylaws appear to disagree. The president, they say, should provide \"spiritual and worldview leadership to the University in the pursuit of excellence.\"Karen Swallow Prior, a former professor at Liberty, said Falwell ruled the campus with virtually unchecked power. \"The kinds of things that have been revealed over the past couple of days are not things that happen in isolation,\" Prior told CNN this week. \"There have been red flags for a long time,\" she added. \"The kind of arrogance and authoritarian leadership that we experience as faculty was really just a symptom of this lifestyle that obviously was one in which he thought he could do anything and get away with it.\" Falwell did not respond to requests for comment for this story. The Trump effectThe spotlight on Falwell Jr. intensified when he became one of the first prominent evangelicals to back Trump in early 2016, surprising fellow Christian conservatives.During a Trump campaign visit to Liberty, Falwell glowingly compared the candidate to his late father due to their shared propensity for eschewing political correctness.Echoing his own self-defense, Falwell excused the twice-divorced casino magnate's moral failings, praising Trump's business success and arguing that Americans were electing a president, not a pastor. Falwell was fiercely loyal to Trump, appearing at campaign events with him and saying there was nothing the candidate could do to lose his vote. \"Our whole faith is based around the idea that we're all equally bad,\" he told CNN when asked about a videotape in which Trump bragged about grabbing women in the genitals. \"We're all sinners, we all need Christ's forgiveness.\" Current and former Liberty officials, who asked not to be named, say Falwell's personality changed as his political profile grew. \"The Jerry that I knew was very introverted, almost a loner,\" said the former Liberty University official.While acknowledging his wife's affair, Falwell Jr. said this week that it was awkward to be thrust into the spotlight when he became Liberty's president in 2007 after the death of his famous father. \"I quickly and unexpectedly went from being the lawyer working in the background on the business aspects of the school to becoming a very public person, having to overcome my fears of speaking in front of audiences of tens of thousands,\" Falwell said. Eventually, Falwell grew into the role, reveling in Liberty's prominence as a political power center of evangelicalism. GOP candidates and officeholders often came to address Liberty students, and Falwell basked in the attention. After he endorsed Trump, the media came banging down Falwell's door, intrigued that a prominent evangelical -- and a Falwell -- would support the least conventionally religious candidate in the field. \"Then all of a sudden he's on TV and introducing Trump at rallies,\" said the former Liberty official. \"That's heady stuff, and I think he got reckless.\" Falwell's fatal sinFor years, a handful of Liberty students and alumni had lobbied the school's Board of Trustees to remove Falwell. But his family name, political connections and financial success at Liberty, including an endowment that grew to $1.6 billion, made him untouchable. This summer, as Falwell's indiscretions mounted, the trickle of criticism became a flood. Calling his behavior \"appalling,\" a congressman urged him to resign. So did prominent evangelicals, and an alumni-led petition, urging Falwell \"to stop this infantile behavior and lead our alma mater with dignity as your father did,\" drew nearly 40,000 signatures. \"Falwell's zipper has been down for a long time,\" wrote Calum Best, a 2020 Liberty graduate, in an online opinion column. \"We've seen everything, and it's too disturbing to stay quiet.\"Then came the revelations of the affair with Granda.The irony was almost too obvious. As Falwell benefited from Liberty's growing reputation as a center of Christian conservatism, he appeared to be flouting the very beliefs that accounted for its moral power.When a conservative Christian gets snared in a sex scandal, critics immediately cry \"hypocrisy!\", as if one sinner's fall discredits an entire faith. But Jerry Falwell Jr. wasn't a hypocrite. He never pretended to be holier than thou. Like many successful capitalists, he believed that money made him invulnerable. His fatal sin wasn't hypocrisy, it was hubris.",

        "body": "(CNN)Joe Biden and Kamala Harris will be regularly tested for the coronavirus as the campaign has increased some of its health protocols in the final stretch before Election Day, a campaign official confirmed to CNN.\n\nThe campaign intends to make public if either Biden or Harris tests positive for the virus, per a campaign official, and staff who interact with them will be tested regularly as well. \"This announcement is another step demonstrating Joe Biden and Kamala Harris' commitment to turn the page on Trump's catastrophic mismanagement during the worst public health crisis in 100 years,\" campaign spokesman Andrew Bates said in a statement. The announcement, first reported by Bloomberg, comes after Biden's deputy campaign manager Kate Bedingfield said Sunday that the Democratic presidential nominee hasn't yet been tested for Covid-19 but that he hasn't had the virus. Bedingfield said there were \"strict protocols\" in place should Biden need to be tested. Read More\"He has not had the virus,\" Bedingfield told ABC's George Stephanopoulos on \"This Week\" when asked if he has been tested or contracted the virus. \"We have put in place really strict protocols, as I think all of your journalists who attended our convention in Delaware this week saw. We've put in place incredibly strict protocols to ensure that everybody involved, who is around Vice President Biden, who is around Sen. Harris, is undergoing the appropriate testing. The vice president has not had the virus.\" Asked if Biden has been tested, she said, \"He has not, he has not been tested\" and added, \"However, we have put the strictest protocols in place and moving forward should he need to be tested, he certainly would be. But he has not been tested yet.\" Last month, Biden told reporters he had not been tested for the virus and he told CNN's Jake Tapper in May that he had not been tested because he was not experiencing symptoms. He told Tapper he was following medical advice such as requiring people who enter his home to wear masks and gloves and that he was practicing social distancing. Biden, 77, is among those considered high risk for the virus, according to guidelines by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The coronavirus can be spread by infected people who are asymptomatic and those who haven't developed symptoms yet.",

Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds.\n\n(CNN)Children can carry coronavirus in their noses and throats for weeks even if they don't show any symptoms, which might explain how the virus can spread silently, researchers in South Korea reported Friday.\n\n\"In this case series study, inapparent infections in children may have been associated with silent COVID-19 transmission in the community,\" the researchers wrote in a new study.\"Interestingly, this study aligns with adult data in which up to 40% of adults may remain asymptomatic in the face of infection,\" Dr. Roberta DeBiasi and Dr. Meghan Delaney, both of Children's National Hospital in Washington, DC, wrote in an accompanying editorial. Neither was involved in the research.\"In this study, the authors estimate that 85 infected children (93%) would have been missed using a testing strategy focused on testing of symptomatic patients alone,\" they wrote.The study comes out at a time when the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has been criticized for changing its guidelines on asymptomatic testing, which the American Academy of Pediatrics called \"a dangerous step backward\" in a statement on Friday. Read MoreIn the CDC's updated guidelines, some people without symptoms may not need to be tested, even if they've been in close contact with someone known to have the virus. This newly released research adds more evidence as to why casting a wide net when it comes to contact tracing is a key strategy to mitigate viral spread.\"We know that children often show few or no symptoms of COVID-19. We also know they are not immune to this virus, and they can become very sick. Testing exposed individuals who may not yet show symptoms of COVID-19 is crucial to contact tracing, which helps identify and support other people who are at risk of infection,\" AAP President Dr. Sally Goza said in the statement.Hard to diagnoseThe study, published in the journal JAMA Pediatrics on Friday, included data on 91 asymptomatic, presymptomatic and symptomatic children diagnosed with Covid-19 between February 18 and March 31 at 22 centers throughout South Korea.Among those patients, 20 of them -- or 22% -- did not show any obvious symptoms and remained asymptomatic throughout the study.Another 18 children -- or 20% -- were presymptomatic, meaning they didn't look or feel sick at the time but eventually got symptoms later. In total, more than half of the children -- 71 kids or 78% -- did show symptoms, which included fever, cough, diarrhea, abdominal pain and loss of smell or taste, among other symptoms. The duration of the symptoms appeared to vary, ranging from one to 36 days.\"This suggests that even mild and moderately affected children remain symptomatic for long periods of time,\" DeBiasi and Delaney wrote in the editorial.The data showed that only 8.5% of those patients with symptoms were diagnosed with Covid-19 at the time their symptoms began. Most -- 66.2% -- of the patients with symptoms had symptoms that were not recognized before they were diagnosed, and 25.4% developed symptoms after they were diagnosed.\"This highlights the concept that infected children may be more likely to go unnoticed either with or without symptoms and continue on with their usual activities, which may contribute to viral circulation within their community,\" DeBiasi and Delaney wrote.Virus remained in respiratory tractThe study found genetic material from the virus was detectable in the children for a mean of 17.6 days overall. Even in the children who had no symptoms, the virus was detectable for 14 days on average. It's also possible that the virus remained in the children even longer, the study said, because the date of initial infection wasn't identified.However, this doesn't necessarily mean the children were spreading virus, experts say.The presence of the virus genetic material in swabs \"need not equate with transmission, particularly in people who do not have important symptoms such as cough and sneeze,\" Calum Semple, professor in child health and outbreak medicine at the University of Liverpool who was not involved in the study, said in a written statement on Friday.In addition, \"sensitive molecular detection methods may detect viable, infective virus but also nonviable or fragments of RNA with no capability for transmission,\" DeBiasi and Delaney wrote.More research also is needed to determine whether similar findings would emerge among a larger group of children from other parts of the world.Still, the new study provides information that can be used by pubic health officials when considering the spread of the virus in schools, according to DeBiasi and Delaney.\"A surveillance strategy that tests only symptomatic children will fail to identify children who are silently shedding virus while moving about their community and schools,\" they wrote. \"In regions where use of face masks is not widely accepted or used by the general public, asymptomatic carriers may serve as an important reservoir that may facilitate silent spread through a community.\"The Friday statement from AAP's Goza reinforced the need for systematic, wide-ranging tracking.\"Without data and transparency, science and medical professionals are hampered -- and families are harmed -- as we lack information that helps us understand how easily this virus can be transmitted to others and how to stop it,\" she said.",

Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds.\n\n(CNN)In a letter to the US Food and Drug Administration, lawmakers are urging the agency to temporarily clear the market of all e-cigarettes for the duration of the coronavirus crisis.\n\nThe letter, sent to FDA commissioner Dr. Stephen Hahn on Tuesday, makes this call based on emerging research that suggests vaping or using e-cigarettes can come with an increased risk of being diagnosed with Covid-19 and suffering symptoms.\"This is true in vapers as young as 13, which is particularly concerning, given that young people are increasingly driving the spread of COVID-19, threatening the health and safety of Americans of all ages,\" wrote Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi (D-IL), chairman of the House Committee on Oversight and Reform's Subcommittee on Economic and Consumer Policy, who sent the letter on behalf of the subcommittee.In the letter, the subcommittee asks for Hahn to confirm by August 18 -- in one week -- whether or not the FDA will temporarily clear the market of all e-cigarettes.Considering that the world still doesn't know much about the novel coronavirus that causes Covid-19 -- and that the vaping trend emerged just recently -- not much is known about how the two may affect each other or be associated.Read MoreBut some new studies have started to explore possible connections, specifically around how vapers might have a more difficult time fighting off a coronavirus infection and could possibly be more susceptible to the illness.'We thought that we'd see some relationship'Being diagnosed with Covid-19 was five times more likely among young people who have used e-cigarettes ever, according to a new study that is referenced in Krishnamoorthi's letter.The study, based on an online survey, also found that young people who have a history of using both e-cigarettes and traditional cigarettes were seven times more likely to be diagnosed with Covid-19 compared with those who have never used either product.\"We thought that we'd see some relationship. We did not expect to see a five to seven times more likely relationship. That's huge,\" said Bonnie Halpern-Felsher, professor of pediatrics and director of research in the division of adolescent medicine at Stanford University in California, who led the new study.The study, published in the Journal of Adolescent Health on Tuesday, also found in its survey that respondents who reported vaping in the past 30 days were 2.6 times more likely to be tested for Covid-19.\"About half of the sample was sheltering in place -- because we did ask that -- but that doesn't mean they're not in the backyard with a friend sharing their vaping product,\" Halpern-Felsher said, adding that this increased risk to be diagnosed with Covid-19 could be tied to exposure to the coronavirus from sharing products, touching your face more or possibly breathing in droplets containing the virus through the aerosols of an e-cigarette. More research is needed.\"We don't know. These are hypotheses,\" Halpern-Felsher said. \"I actually think it's all of the above.\"The study included data on 4,351 young people ages 13 to 24 in the United States who completed an online survey in May.The survey asked them questions about using e-cigarettes and traditional cigarettes, along with Covid-19-related symptoms, getting tested and being diagnosed with the disease.\"We've seen adolescents who are vaping having asthma. We've seen seizures. We've seen bronchitis, pneumonia, hospitalizations, lung collapsing and now we're seeing Covid,\" Halpern-Felsher said about the study results.The study comes with some limitations, including that it was based on self-reports from anonymous online survey responses -- which can be vulnerable to biases if respondents don't give honest answers.Overall, Halpern-Felsher said that there is a message for young people and health care providers in the survey findings.\"This is a real call for adolescents to stop using e-cigarettes -- to stop using any inhaled product -- to stop putting things into their lungs that hurt their lungs,\" she said. \"There's a message for healthcare providers and it's a message for parents: talk to your teens.\"Dr. Brian Williams, an internal medicine and pediatric hospitalist at UW Health and researcher at the University of Wisconsin Center for Tobacco Research and Intervention, called the new study's findings \"concerning\" -- and added that it gives more reason to quit smoking or vaping.\"When you do a study like this you're trying to look for a signal. Is there a connection between e-cigarette use and smoking and a Covid-19 diagnosis? And it sure looks like they got a pretty strong signal,\" said Williams, who was not involved in the study. An area that now warrants further study, he said, is why there might be this association between vaping and Covid-19.\"Is it something about the actual ritual of bringing your hand to your face? Are you bringing germs to your face? Is it the result of sharing vaping devices or sharing cigarettes? Or is it something about how smoking or how vaping is causing inflammation in your respiratory tract or affecting your immune system so that it's more susceptible to infection?\" Williams said. \"Those things are unclear at this point.\"While there are many questions left to answer, a separate study recently explored just how many young adults might be at this increased Covid risk due to vaping or other risk factors.Smoking as a risk factorNearly a third of young adults have some type of risk factor that makes them medically vulnerable to severe illness if they get Covid-19, and smoking -- including using either traditional cigarettes or vaping e-cigarettes -- is the strongest risk factor among this age group, according to a study published in the Journal of Adolescent Health in July.The researchers, from the University of California, San Francisco, looked at more than 8,000 participants ages 18 to 25 who had participated in the National Health Interview Survey to see what their medical vulnerability to severe Covid-19 was in relation to risk indicators that had been set out by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, including health conditions and smoking habits.The researchers found 32% of the total study population were medically vulnerable for severe Covid-19. However, when the group of participants who smoked cigarettes or e-cigarettes were taken out of the analysis, the medically vulnerable percentage decreased by half, to 16%.\"This difference between estimates is driven largely by the sizable portion of young adults who reported that they engaged in past 30-day smoking (1 in 10) and past 30-day e-cigarette use (1 in 14),\" the researchers wrote in their study. \"By contrast, relatively fewer young adults reported medical conditions identified by the CDC as conferring severe illness risk.\"The research showed that in the whole study population, young adult men were at a higher risk for severe Covid-19. Although more women reported having asthma and immune conditions, higher rates of smoking in men overrode this. However, looking at just the nonsmokers, women had a higher risk.People who smoke traditional cigarettes have 1.91 times the odds of their Covid-19 progressing to a more severe illness than people who have never smoked, according to a paper published in the journal Nicotine & Tobacco Research in May.For that paper, other researchers from the University of California, San Francisco, reviewed and analyzed 19 previously published studies on the association between smoking and Covid-19. Those studies included data on a total of 11,590 Covid-19 patients. None of the studies assessed e-cigarette use.In their review of those studies, the researchers found that 29.8% of the Covid-19 patients who had a history of smoking experienced their Covid-19 illness progress to a more severe disease compared with only 17.6% of non-smoking patients.In their paper, the researchers called on physicians and public health professionals to collect data on smoking and e-cigarette use as part of clinical assessments among Covid patients.\n\nCNN's Naomi Thomas contributed to this report.",

        "body": "(CNN)The Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) is launching an extensive program to provide regular Covid-19 testing and contact tracing to all students and staff, and to families of those who test positive.\n\nSuperintendent Austin Beutner said in a press release Sunday the effort was \"unprecedented\" but necessary to safely reopen schools.\"This will provide a public health benefit to the school community, as well as the greater Los Angeles area,\" he said. LAUSD is the country's second-largest school district with more than 600,000 students. The district is beginning the new school year without in-person classes as Covid-19 continues to spread widely in California and in the Los Angeles area.Speaking to CNN on Tuesday, Beutner said the testing and tracing program was simply following the science.Read More\"Science has told us children can carry the virus and those without symptoms can spread the virus, and we know schools bring together many families and many multi-generational households,\" he said. \"So if we want to keep schools from becoming a petri dish and we want to keep all in the school community safe, we need to test and trace at schools.\"The hope, he said, is to build a foundation for when LAUSD schools open for in-person learning.The testing and tracing program is part of a collaboration between LAUSD and scientists at UCLA, Stanford, Johns Hopkins University, Microsoft, testing experts and healthcare companies Anthem Blue Cross and Health Net. The organizations will be part of a task force co-chaired by Beutner and former US Secretary of Education Arne Duncan, the release states.Program launched MondayAdm. Brett Giroir, the White House coronavirus testing coordinator, has emphasized that testing is only one part of a comprehensive plan to stop the spread of coronavirus. People must also wear a mask, socially distance from others and wash their hands, he said.\"Not only do we not recommend this strategy of testing everyone on a frequent basis, but I think it could instill a false sense of security,\" Giroir said Friday.Beutner said Tuesday he did not think the LAUSD program would give a false sense of security.\"We're going to make sure our families understand and everyone in our school community understands the importance of safe distancing and good health practices,\" he said. \"But let's go back to March. The head of the World Health Organization told us all, if we want to get control of this virus we have to test, test, test, and that's what we're going to be doing.\"Testing was set to begin Monday, the press release said. Staff members working at schools along with their children who participate in childcare provided by LAUSD were set to be among the first group to be tested in the phased roll out of the program.According to the release, the goal for the early phase of the program is to establish a baseline. Eventually, all staff and students will be tested, which will be followed by periodic testing, the district said. LAUSD is also planning to provide testing to household members of staff and students who test positive or show signs of symptoms. The data collected from the research will be available to the general public, the school system said in the announcement. \"Scientific studies emphasize the need for a robust and consistent testing regimen to keep students, teachers, staff and the broader community safe as we return to classrooms,\" said Duncan. He will help coordinate with government agencies and ensure \"public policy implications are shared with the appropriate policy makers,\" the release states.",

The Cardinals have now had 13 games postponed. The team has not played a game since July 29.\"In light of the most recent positive test results, MLB and the Club believe it is prudent to conduct additional testing while players and staff are quarantined before the team returns to play,\" the MLB said of the postponement in a statement Sunday.Read MoreAt least three teams in the league have had games postponed since the start of the shortened season after members tested positive for the virus.The Miami Marlins had an outbreak that put their season on hold after 21 members of the organization tested positive. The Phildelphia Phillies have had two staff members test positive for the virus.As a result, the league announced stricter guidelines for teams as they continue to play through the season.The changes include reducing the size of traveling parties, requiring staff members and players to wear face coverings while on the road and prohibiting players and staff from meeting in hotel rooms without special permission.Team members go to the ERSome members of the Cardinals have had to go to the emergency room after experiencing symptoms of Covid-19, manager Mike Shildt revealed during a radio interview with KMOX Sunday.Mozeliak confirmed one player and one staff member of the Cardinals visited a hospital, although neither was hospitalized. Both are back at home.\"There are people that have symptoms, and have had a few visits to the ER for some IVs and a little more clarity.\" Shildt said during a radio interview with radio station KMOX Sunday. \"Nobody has had to stay. But there are people dealing with -- I mean, this is real. And people are experiencing a lot of the symptoms that we hear about, that are associated with this. A variety of them. Most of them are experiencing multiple ones. Seems like they rotate with them,\" Shildt told the station. \"And again, nobody is in close to any critical shape, but people are having to deal with some things that aren't comfortable at all.\"As the team continues to battle the virus, the MLB will make a decision about the Cardinals return to the field and announce it later this week, the league said in a statement.",

Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds.\n\n(CNN)Four overnight camps in Maine successfully identified and isolated three Covid-19 positive people with no symptoms, preventing transmission to more than 1,000 other campers and staff this summer, says a new report published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nFor many kids, summer camp looked and felt a little different this year. There were daily temperatures checks, more time spent outside and plenty of face masks. Dr. Laura Blaisdell of the Maine Medical Center Research Institute and colleagues said the extra effort paid off.They detailed where these camps went right in a report examining 642 children and 380 staff members who attended the four camps in Maine for well over a month between June and August. Camp attendees traveled from across the United States and six international locations: Bermuda, Canada, Mexico, South Africa, Spain and the United Kingdom. They quarantined for up to 14 days before arriving at camp and three of the sites asked campers to submit Covid-19 test results before attending.This was an important step in preventing introduction of the virus in a setting with many young adults who could be asymptomatic or presymptomatic, Blaisdell and colleagues wrote in the CDC's weekly report.Read MoreCamp attendees were separated into groups when they first arrived and had to wear face coverings when interacting with people outside of their groups. The camps kept surfaces clean and groups physically distant. They staggered bathroom use and dining times. They also screened campers daily for fever and coronavirus symptoms.Most attendees were tested again for Covid-19 a few days after arriving at camp. That's when a symptomless camper and two staff members tested positive, according to the report. They were rapidly isolated until they recovered, and their contacts were quarantined for 14 days.None of the contacts tested positive for Covid-19, according to the CDC report.The report noted that it wasn't one particular precaution that helped prevent the spread of coronavirus in these camps, but rather a multilayered strategy that was carefully executed.Some camps serve as cautionary tales The Maine summer camps contrast with camps in Arkansas, Missouri and Georgia, which were forced to close down after cases and outbreaks earlier this summer.The Georgia sleepaway camp experienced an outbreak in June, with 44% of its attendees testing positive for Covid-19. While the camp followed some safety guidelines, campers were not required to wear masks, and indoor spaces were not well ventilated. The CDC reported about 26% of those who tested positive at the Georgia camp reported no symptoms, suggesting that asymptomatic infection likely played a role in the outbreak. As schools around the nation return to session, the very different outcomes of these summer camps could serve as a roadmap for preventing spread of coronavirus in large groups.The CDC recently updated its guidance to state that people who have been exposed to someone who tests positive for Covid-19 may not need to be tested. Health officials have questioned the soundness of the guidance, including contact tracing experts who say that testing people without coronavirus symptoms is critical to curtailing the spread of the virus.\n\nAndrea Kane and Alicia Lee contributed to this story.",

        "body": "(CNN)Former First Lady Michelle Obama says she's suffering from a \"low-grade depression.\" The reasons? The pandemic, race relations in the US and the political strife surrounding it all, she says.\n\n\"I'm waking up in the middle of the night because I'm worrying about something or there's a heaviness,\" Obama said in her \"The Michelle Obama Podcast\" on Wednesday. \"I try to make sure I get a workout in, although there have been periods throughout this quarantine, where I just have felt too low.\"It's a familiar feeling for many Americans.A Census Bureau survey found that one in three Americans are reporting symptoms of depression or anxiety, more than three times the rate from a similar survey conducted in the first half of 2019. And because one of the best ways to fight coronavirus is through social distancing, people have gone long stretches of time without seeing their friends or family, exacerbating the already widespread problem of loneliness, which can be deeply harmful to one's mental health.In her podcast, Obama also discussed the racial reckoning in America following the death of George Floyd this summer. She explained it is \"exhausting\" to be \"waking up to yet another story of a Black man or a Black person somehow being dehumanized, or hurt, or killed, or falsely accused of something.\"Read MoreShe also discussed her frustration with people who refuse to wear masks. \"There's almost like there's a limit to our sacrifice and it was about a month and then we just got tired of the virus,\" she said. \"That's been disheartening to see so many people who have grown tired of staying at home because the virus didn't impact them.\"Obama emphasized that while \"we've been through tough times in this nation\" before, \"we are in a unique moment in history... We are living through something that no one in our lifetimes has lived through.\"Since leaving the White House, Obama has pursued multiple projects, including publishing a bestselling memoir and releasing a documentary film series on Netfix. Her Spotify podcast is her latest creative venture, focusing on \"meaningful relationships and conversations.\" Her first guest was her husband, Barack, and upcoming voices will include her mother and brother, late-night host Conan O'Brien, and top Obama White House adviser Valerie Jarrett.\n\nCNN's Caroline Kelly and Kate Bennett contributed to this story.",

Tom Barrett, an impassioned critic of the governor's pandemic orders, announced Sunday that he has contracted coronavirus.\n\nBarrett, who is still an active part-time helicopter pilot in the Michigan Army National Guard, received the positive result during a routine screening before an upcoming training event, according to a press release from his office. The Republican lawmaker said that he does not have any \"significant symptoms\" and will self-isolate.\"I have done my best to make contact with those I have been around in the past couple weeks so that they may also seek medical advice,\" Barrett said. \"I look forward to resuming my normal work schedule as quickly as possible.\" Barrett has accused Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, a Democrat, of greatly overstepping her powers, and sponsored a bill limiting her emergency powers. Read More\"Michigan families are hurting. Jobs have been lost, and unemployment is soaring. Reasonable accommodations can be made to begin to reopen the state, but the governor has been unwilling to work with us,\" Barrett said in May. Whitmer, who announced a state lockdown in March and lifted it in June, has faced backlash regarding her closure orders. Last month, she called for a \"national mask-up campaign,\" saying it is necessary for everyone, even those in the White House, to wear masks to stem the spread of coronavirus as the number of cases surge across the US.In April, protesters carrying firearms descended on Michigan's Capitol to pressure the governor to issue more relaxed measures. President Donald Trump has also attacked Whitmer, a first-term governor, in personal terms over her criticism of his handling of the coronavirus pandemic.Barrett is a supporter of Unlock Michigan, \"a coalition of concerned Michiganders who believe that Governor Gretchen Whitmer's crushing lockdown of life and business across Michigan is a dangerous threat to our livelihoods and constitutional liberties,\" according to the group's website. He held a petition signing event for the campaign on July 18, The Detroit News reported.Following Barrett's coronavirus news, other state lawmakers are suggesting people who may have been exposed get tested.In a statement to CNN, Democratic Senate Minority Leader Jim Ananich said he is \"encouraging members and staff to seek testing if they have any concerns about potential exposure.\"\"Thanks to the hard work of Gov. Whitmer and local health officials, testing is available and should be utilized,\" he said in the statement. \"This is an important reminder to everyone that we must continue to be diligent about wearing masks, social distancing and hand washing, because those carrying COVID-19 may be asymptomatic or nearly asymptomatic.\"Republican Senate Majority Leader Mike Shirkey also encouraged all caucus members to be tested. He announced Monday that legislative sessions have been canceled this week.Amber McCann, a spokeswoman for Shirkey, told CNN on Monday that \"no other senators or staff have reported a positive test.\"\n\nCNN's Lauren del Valle and Lauren M.

        "body": "(CNN)About 3.3 million California homes may lose power during rolling blackouts on Monday and the state's governor is demanding an investigation into the power outages.\n\nThe rolling blackouts were implemented over the weekend as an intense heat wave causes record temperatures across the state, including a high of 130 degrees in Death Valley on Sunday.\"We have a perfect storm going on here,\" said Steve Berberich, CEO of California Independent System Operator (CAISO), which manages most of the state's electrical grid.But California Gov. Gavin Newsom criticized CAISO for implementing the blackouts with little notice and for being unprepared. He wants an investigation into the blackouts.\"These blackouts, which occurred without warning or enough time for preparation, are unacceptable and unbefitting of the nation's largest and most innovative state,\" Newsom wrote in a letter to CAISO, the California Public Utilities Commission and the California Energy Commission. Read MoreEnergy shortages led CAISO to issue a Stage 3 emergency for the first time in about 20 years on Friday and Saturday. Heavy strain on the power grid meant that customers were asked to conserve as much energy as possible and some were subjected to rotating power outages.One megawatt of electricity serves about 750 homes and the state is currently expected to have a shortfall of 4,400 megawatts during peak demand, Newsom said Monday.This is the first time since 2001 the state has reached this level of energy demand, causing rotating power outages, according to Berberich. Newsom said he found out about the blackouts just \"moments\" before they started. Operators of electrical grids were \"caught flat footed, unable to avert disruptive blackouts and to adequately warn the public.\"\"Collectively, energy regulators failed to anticipate this event and to take necessary actions to ensure reliable power to Californians,\" Newsom wrote. \"This cannot stand.\"When CAISO issued Saturday's Stage 3 emergency, it cited the loss of a 470 megawatt power plant and a loss of nearly 1,000 megawatts from wind power.The extraordinary heat wave baking the state is the West Coast's hottest two-week period in 70 years, Newsom said.California and other states were under an extreme heat warning over the weekend. Newsom declared a state of emergency on Monday, citing \"widespread temperatures well in excess of 100 degrees throughout the state.\" The heat is forecast to continue for days.The emergency measure frees up energy by allowing utilities to use backup energy sources to relieve pressure on the power grid.Newsom asked the three organizations to provide updated forecasts for energy demand for the coming days and for any projected gaps between supply and demand.Cooling centers are available in communities throughout the state, but capacity is limited due to social distancing protocols. Those who have tested positive for coronavirus or are exhibiting symptoms are not allowed.CAISO is a non-profit corporation that manages the flow of electricity generated and transmitted by its member utilities across the electrical grid that serves 80% of California and a small part of Nevada.CAISO urged Californians to lower energy use during peak hours, between 3 and 10 p.m. The company suggested ways to save energy like turning off unnecessary lights, closing your drapes, using fans, and if your health permits setting the thermostat to 78 degrees.CNN has reached out to CAISO, California's Public Utilities Commission, the state's Energy Commission, and other utilities for additional comment.\n\nCNN's Sarah Moon and Theresa Waldrop contributed to this report.",

Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds.\n\n(CNN)States across the US are now seeing a decline in coronavirus cases, a US top official said this week, though he warned things could quickly change again if Americans aren't careful.\n\nTrends are now \"going in the right direction,\" said Adm. Brett Giroir, the Trump administration physician overseeing US coronavirus testing, attributing the decline in part to safety protocols such as masks and social distancing.The daily average number official new coronavirus cases reported in the US has been declining for weeks. Cases over the past week averaged about 47,300 as of Wednesday, down from a peak average of 67,317 on July 22, according to Johns Hopkins University data. State leaders who have reported a leveling of new cases also attribute it to adherence to safety guidelines. In Washington state, where health officials say the rate of new cases is slowing, \"face coverings have made a difference,\" Secretary of Health Dr. John Wiesman said.Twelve states' average daily cases have risen at least 10% against the previous week, including Hawaii, Johns Hopkins data show. Hawaii's state capital dramatically tightened restrictions on gatherings -- both indoors and outdoors -- in an effort to control a surge of cases. Read MoreNow isn't a time to ease measures, Giroir cautioned Wednesday during a telebriefing.\"This could turn around very quickly if we're not careful,\" Giroir said. \"We saw that early on after Memorial Day and the couple weeks afterward that sort of started the current outbreak.\"The country had seen cases surge from mid-June into late July, after states lifted restrictions to curb the spread of the virus. In response, more than half the country halted reopening plans and enacted new measures to slow a spread that experts said was out of control. Though case rates have dropped in recent weeks, daily deaths -- which experts say can spike weeks after a jump in new cases -- have recently been at a relatively elevated level.The country's seven-day average for daily Covid-19 deaths has been above 1,000 for 24 straight days as of Wednesday, after seven weeks of below 1,000. The seven-day average of test positivity rates in the US dropped to 6.3% as of early Thursday, down from 8.5% in mid-July, according to the Covid Tracking Project.The director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has suggested communities' positivity rates should be below 5% to comfortably reopen schools. At least 26 states averaged above 5% as of Wednesday.US leaders appealed to young people to skip social gatherings and practice safety guidelines. Younger groups, experts said, helped drive the rise in cases over the summer. As they head back to college campuses now, universities have already reported hundreds of positive tests. Coronavirus infections rising in schoolsColleges in at least 17 states have reported Covid-19 cases on campus, with outbreaks traced to off-campus gatherings, athletics, Greek life, dorms or move-in testing. Auburn University in Alabama is requiring everyone on campus to wear a face covering, indoors and outdoors, after at least 41 people there tested positive last week. That requirement doesn't apply when a students are in their dorm rooms alone or with roommates, or when someone is alone in a private office.The University of Notre Dame's football team canceled practice Thursday after it learned five of its athletes tested positive for Covid-19. Those players have been put into isolation, and six others who were in close contact with them have been put into quarantine, the school said.The university announced earlier in the week that alll undergraduate classes will be remote for the next two weeks as it tries to control a spike in cases.The University of Mississippi said Wednesday that 15 student-athletes and one employee tested positive for the virus. Of the athletes, 11 are on the same team, but the university did not say which sports the positive tests came from.At the University of Connecticut, several students were removed from their on-campus housing after the university found they held an \"unapproved gathering in a residence hall room.\"Fourteen Drake University students were asked to leave campus for two weeks after violating an agreement signed by students outlining safety protocols. Michigan State University has announced the year will start remotely for undergraduate students. In New York, Ithaca College said remote instruction will be extended through the fall semester. In Detroit, a union for K-12 teachers said Wednesday members voted in favor of a potential strike in a bid to change the school district's reopening plan. The district currently intends to start September 8 with some classes online and some in person; the union says the vast majority of teachers want to teach online for now.Dr. Ali Khan, dean of the University of Nebraska Medical Center's college of public health, said Thursday that schools should reopen for in-person classes only when community transmission of Covid-19 is very low.\"Until then ... we'll do this sort of back and forth where they go to school, (then the schools) shut down\" for a little bit, resume, and then close for the year, Khan told CNN's \"New Day.\"Texas, Mississippi and Georgia report most new infections per capita across a weekStates across the South and West continue to report the most daily infections when adjusted for population.Texas led the country per capita with the most average cases per day over a week as of Wednesday, followed by Mississippi and Georgia. Texas' governor has issued a mandate requiring face masks, and Mississippi temporarily mandated mask-wearing in public statewide this month. Georgia has not issued a statewide mask mandate.As Georgia schools reopened this month, some reported hundreds of students and staff were in quarantine after officials identified positive cases. A photo of a crowded high school hallway with nearly no masks in sight raised concern across the country. One school district announced it would begin the year with virtual learning after more than 90 staff members were forced to quarantine. An August 16 White House Coronavirus Task Force report obtained by The Atlanta Journal-Constitution recommended that Georgia do more to fight Covid-19 spread, including closing bars and gyms, limiting indoor dining at restaurants and reducing social gatherings to 10 or fewer people. Gov. Brian Kemp pushed back Wednesday, a day after his state topped the rankings by population.\"If we're the highest (per) capita in the state right now, that's because Texas and Florida and Arizona and some of the states that were peaking a week or two ago are on the downclimb,\" Kemp told reporters. Georgia's seven-day average of new daily cases was around 2,500 Wednesday -- down from a plateau of around 3,700 daily in late July, Johns Hopkins data show.Wait a few weeks after exposure before testing for anitbodies, group saysPeople who want to know whether they have antibodies after being exposed to Covid-19 should wait a few weeks after exposure before getting an antibody test, experts said during a briefing Thursday.A panel of the Infectious Diseases Society of America recommends \"against using antibody testing in the first one or two weeks after exposure to infection, because many patients haven't developed antibodies yet,\" said panel chairwoman Dr. Kimberly Hanson.The society reviewed several studies on antibody testing.\"Three to four weeks after the onset of symptoms -- this is the sweet spot, this is where the tests have the highest sensitivity and the highest specificity,\" Dr. Angela Caliendo said during the briefing. Antibody tests are used to see whether a person was infected with Covid-19 in the past -- not to be confused with diagostic tests, which are meant to determine whether someone is infected now.\n\nCNN's Jason Hanna, Amanda Watts, Jill Martin, Melissa Alonso, Annie Grayer, Elizabeth Stuart and David Close contributed to this report.",

        "body": "(CNN)Researchers are learning more about what pregnant women may experience if they are infected with the coronavirus that causes Covid-19.\n\nPregnant and recently pregnant women who are diagnosed with Covid-19 in the hospital appear to be less likely to have symptoms of fever and muscle pain but more likely to be admitted to the intensive care unit, according to a new paper published in the BMJ medical journal on Tuesday. The study also found pregnant women with Covid-19 are at increased risk of delivering preterm, but preterm birth rates were not high.\"We found that one in 10 pregnant or recently pregnant women who are attending or admitted to hospital for any reason are diagnosed as having suspected or confirmed Covid-19, although the rates vary,\" the researchers -- from various institutions in Europe and China -- wrote in the paper. The researchers reviewed 77 studies on Covid-19 in pregnant and recently pregnant women, published from December 1 and June 26. Collectively, those studies included data on 13,118 pregnant and recently pregnant women with Covid-19, and 83,486 non-pregnant women of reproductive age who also had Covid-19. Read More\"The Covid-19 related symptoms of fever and myalgia (muscle ache) manifest less often in pregnant and recently pregnant women than in nonpregnant women of reproductive age,\" the researchers wrote.\"Pregnant or recently pregnant women with Covid-19 seem to be at increased risk of requiring admission to an intensive care unit or invasive ventilation.\"Older women, women who are heavier and women with conditions such as diabetes, kidney disease or other chronic conditions may also have a higher risk of severe disease, they said.The researchers also found in those studies that pregnant women with Covid-19 are at increased risk of delivering preterm and their babies being admitted to the neonatal unit, although overall rates of spontaneous preterm births were not high. Also, stillbirth and neonatal death rates were low, the researchers found. The studies used in the review primarily reported on pregnant women who required visits to the hospital and not many studies reported outcomes by trimester. \"Reviews such as this can only be as good as the studies they summarize and it is important to note that a high proportion of the included studies have a substantial risk of bias,\" Dr. Marian Knight, professor of maternal and child population health at Britain's University of Oxford, said in a statement distributed by the UK-based Science Media Center on Tuesday. \"It is also important to recognize that, whilst this review reports high preterm birth rates, a number of women affected by COVID-19 in pregnancy are still pregnant, and thus are not included in the study data. This may make preterm birth rates appear artificially high,\" Knight said. \"Nevertheless, some pregnant women affected by COVID-19 may have a subsequent preterm birth and preventing infection remains essential.\"Dr. Edward Morris, president of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, said in another statement on Tuesday that the new paper provides \"a welcome and comprehensive synthesis of the available research\" on Covid-19 in pregnancy. \"While overall risks to pregnant women from coronavirus are low, the findings of this study highlight the particular risks to pregnant women,\" Morris said. \"Pregnant women are included in the list of people at moderate risk as a precaution and pregnant women should therefore continue to follow the latest government guidance on social distancing and avoiding anyone with symptoms suggestive of coronavirus.\"",

        "body": "(CNN)New coronavirus cases are down across the US about 12% on average over the last seven days compared to the previous week, but the nation is still averaging more than 900 deaths a day.\n\nAccording to an analysis of data from Johns Hopkins University, cases are steadily declining in states hard-hit by Covid-19. Compared to last week, new cases are down in Arizona about 36%, California and Texas have seen a decrease of 29%, and Florida's numbers are down 26%.But new cases are rising across the Midwest, including in Indiana, Iowa, Kansas and North Dakota, each of which is experiencing its peak seven-day average for daily new cases. North Dakota claimed the mantle of the state with the highest per capita rate of new cases in the US with a seven-day average of 28.10 new cases per 100,000. Iowa and Kansas both saw record highs Wednesday for new cases reported.Also on Wednesday, the US reported 44,109 cases and 1,222 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins. Read MoreThe number of deaths related to the coronavirus in the US topped 180,000 on Thursday, according to the JHU data. More than 5.8 million cases have been reported.Pandemic response complicated by Hurricane LauraStates hit hard by Covid-19 like Texas and Louisiana are dealing with another threat: Hurricane Laura made landfall overnight as a Category 4 storm with 150 mph winds. Each crisis has complicated the states' responses to the other. Ahead of the storm, some Covid-19 testing sites were closed and efforts paused, likely hampering data collection in the coming days. But the pandemic also hobbled evacuation efforts as residents were worried about seeking refuge in shelters filled with large groups of people. \"We heard that early on from a lot of people, they were fearful of being put into a large shelter,\" Louisiana Lt. Gov. Billy Nungesser told CNN Thursday morning. So instead, people were sheltered in hotels, Nungesser said, where they could remain safely isolated away from other families. \"I think that was a wise move at FEMA to support those moves to hotels instead of large shelters,\" Nungesser said. \"It helped a lot of people make the decision to get out.\"Looking ahead, Nungesser said that the pandemic will also complicate relief efforts, particularly for residents who might have been displaced by the storm. \"We are still dealing with the Covid-19 so finding housing for people is going to be a challenge,\" Nungesser said.Meantime, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott said his state was also relying on new evacuation strategies that were tested last month by Hurricane Hanna, which brought heavy rains to southern Texas. As many residents as possible were evacuated to hotels, Abbott said, instead of large spaces like convention centers. \"It worked every well in the aftermath of Hurricane Hanna because several weeks after ... the number of people testing positive for Covid-19 and the hospitalizations for Covid-19 actually declined,\" he said. New CDC testing guidelines perplex doctorsUpdated guidance from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention this week says some people without Covid-19 symptoms may not need to be tested, even if they've been in close contact with someone who has a confirmed case. The CDC previously said testing was appropriate for people with recent or suspected exposure, even if they were asymptomatic. The new guidance raised eyebrows among doctors who told CNN it didn't make sense. \"These are exactly the people who should be tested,\" said Dr. Leana Wen, an emergency physician and public health professor at George Washington University and former Baltimore health commissioner.\"I'm concerned that these recommendations suggest someone who has had substantial exposure to a person with Covid-19 now doesn't need to get tested,\" she said. Testing these individuals it \"key to contact tracing,\" she added, since so much virus transmission is due to people who are not exhibiting symptoms. Officials from the World Health Organization said the opposite to the CDC on Thursday, emphasizing the importance of expanding testing for those who have had contact with someone who has the virus and finding people with no symptoms. \"We have recommendations to test suspect cases, and in situations where it is feasible and is possible, to expand testing where necessary to really look for the cases so that they could be isolated and contact tracing can ensue,\" Maria Van Kerkhove, WHO's technical lead for Covid-19, said Thursday.Also on Thursday, leaders of the Association of American Medical Colleges said they were \"alarmed\" by the \"irresponsible\" changes to the CDC testing duielines. \"This recommendation is irresponsible when we know that roughly 40% of SARS-CoV-2 transmissions come from an asymptomatic person,\" AAMC Chief Scientific Officer Dr. Ross McKinney Jr. and AAMC President and CEO Dr. David Skorton said in the statement.\"These CDC guidelines go against the best interests of the American people and are a step backward in fighting the pandemic,\" the statement said.While not testing may be alright in some circumstances, there are others where it's necessary, said Dr. Carlos del Rio, infectious disease specialist and associate dean of Emory University School of Medicine. For example, if you've been in contact with someone who's not wearing a mask for 15 minutes. \"We don't want to decrease the amount of testing,\" del Rio said. \"We want to decrease cases by decreasing transmission, not by decreasing testing.\"\n\nCNN's Amanda Watts, Jamie Gumbrecht, Maggie Fox and Michael Nedelman contributed to this report.",

And the country's death toll is now projected to reach at least 173,000 by August 22, according to a new composite forecast from the US Centers for Disease Control and PreventionTo combat the rampant spread of the virus, health officials have worked with state leaders to provide tailored responses that combat the outbreak in each community, Birx said, adding that some mitigation efforts have begun to show positive results. \"But I want to be very clear,\" she said. \"What we are seeing today is different from March and April. It is extraordinarily widespread. So everybody who lives in a rural area, you are not immune or protected from this virus and that is why we keep saying, no matter where you live in America, you need to wear a mask and socially distance.\"Read MoreThe recommendations from health officials have remained the same for months -- yet despite a continuing climb in coronavirus cases, some Americans are still opting to attend large social gatherings, and refuse to wear face coverings. There need to be stricter measures and -- in some communities -- another round of stay-at-home orders, said Dr. James Phillips, a physician and assistant professor at George Washington University Hospital. \"I'm concerned that the complacency that we've seen with coronavirus has led to these mass gatherings and a general disagreement with the science,\" he said. \"People aren't wearing masks, they aren't distancing.\"At least 30 states have paused their reopening plans or imposed new restrictions to combat a rise in cases, and at least 39 states have some kind of mask order in place. But the efforts to slow the spread come as some parts of the country are preparing to welcome students back to schools and college campuses. \"What I'm concerned about primarily is the fact that we haven't controlled this virus in a serious way, we're seeing rises in a lot of states and now we're talking about reopening schools and colleges in the midst of that which I think is going to compound our problem significantly,\" Phillips said. These states require masksAs one school district reopens, 260 employees infected or exposedIn Gwinnett County, Georgia, where dozens protested a return to school last week, at least 260 Gwinnett County Public School employees tested positive for the virus or were in contact with a case, a spokeswoman for the district told CNN Sunday.That announcement came days after teachers returned to class for in-person pre-planning, CNN affiliate WSB reported.And in one Indiana school district that reopened for the new year, a student tested positive on the first day of class, prompting school officials to isolate the child and begin tracking who may have come into close contact.School reopenings will have to be done carefully, Birx said, and areas that have reported a rise of infections should first stop cases before engaging in talks about welcome students back to class. \"If you have high caseload and active community spread, just like we are asking people not to go to bars, not to have household parties, not to create large spreading events, we are asking people to distance learn at this moment so we can get this epidemic under control,\" she said.In late July, the CDC issued new guidelines that came down hard in favor of reopening schools. The guidelines said children don't suffer much from coronavirus but suffer from being out of school. The CDC recommended local officials consider closing schools or keeping them closed if there is substantial, uncontrolled transmission of the virus. The guidelines also said children are less likely to spread the virus than adults -- but new studies suggest children can contribute to its transmission. In Miami-Dade County, dubbed by some experts as the country's epicenter, the superintendent announced Sunday students will continue virtual learning until at least October. The superintendent told CNN affiliate WPLG there's a possibility that some groups of students could return before October, including kindergarten students and children with disabilities, saying there should be a balance between protection and the \"resumption of normalcy.\"Track the virusBirx: 'Super spreading' events need to stopHowever many restrictions and guidelines officials put in place, it will be the public's help in heeding those guidelines that will help drive coronavirus numbers down, Birx said. \"If we are still going to parties at home, even though the bars are closed, if we are creating interactions where we know it's not safe, because there's multiple people there, and you don't have masks on and you're not socially distanced, you can assume it's not super spreading individuals,\" she said. \"It's super spreading events, and we need to stop those.\"Birx has said experts are noticing a pattern of younger Americans often bringing the infection back home without knowing it -- as many go through the virus without any symptoms -- and then pass it on to their parents who then spread it to grandparents or other older residents. Despite Birx and other health officials' continued calls to action, some Americans some Americans have not adhered to the CDC's guidelines.In Philadelphia, police encountered a gathering of more than 500 people Saturday, police told CNN. In California, dozens of Los Angeles bar-goers crowded indoors for a celebration that one bar spokesperson said was supposed to honor first responders. In New Jersey, officials are investigating a teen party that led to a coronavirus cluster last month. And over the weekend, Birx highlighted one more way Americans are bringing the virus home: By vacationing at hotspots.\"If you have chosen to go on vacation into a hot spot, you really need to come back and protect those with comorbidities and assume you're infected,\" she said.More importantly, she said, people who live in multigenerational households in areas that are experiencing outbreaks, should consider wearing masks at home and assume that they are positive if they are living with people who are older or who may have underlying conditions that put them at higher risk for coronavirus complications.\n\nCNN's Naomi Thomas, Sharif Paget and Melissa Alonso contributed to this report.",

        "body": "(CNN)With a newborn in her arms, Molly Grantham was finally home from the hospital, happy to see her two other children showering their new brother with love. But little did they know that those hugs and kisses would lead to the entire family fighting a potentially deadly virus.\n\nGrantham, an anchor for CNN affiliate WBTV in Charlotte, North Carolina, said her family had been extremely careful. She had tested negative for Covid-19 before leaving the hospital. Same with her in-laws who came to watch the other children.But somehow, somewhere, her 9-year-old daughter, Parker, contracted Covid-19. \"We were home with the newborn, and Hobie, it's his name, he was 4 days old or 3 days old at the time and my daughter started experiencing allergy-like symptoms. We didn't think much of it,\" Grantham told CNN's Kate Bolduan. \"Turns out it was (Covid-19) and so by that point we were all here kissing on the baby and we all got it.\"The symptoms were different for everyone, Grantham wrote in a Facebook post. Read MoreAfter experiencing allergy-like symptoms, Parker broke out in a fever and was nauseous. Five-year-old Hutch had a cold and runny nose. Husband Wes lost his sense of taste and smell and felt lethargic. Grantham said she felt fatigued and had bodyaches, which she thought were aftereffects of having just given birth. But later, when she went to get a Covid-19 test -- which came back positive -- a chest X-ray showed she also had pneumonia. Antibiotics she was given for the pneumonia caused her to break out in hives all over her face. The new medicine caused her to throw up. And she had to deal with all of this while caring for days-old Hobie and monitoring him for any symptoms. \"it was scary. Some nights, watching a newborn breathe, watching his rib cage rise and fall,\" Grantham told Bolduan. \"I was like, what am I looking for? Is that breath different from that breath?\" Hobie's rapid test came back negative, but the hospital said he should be assumed positive. So at 10 days old, Hobie was officially the youngest person to be tested and the youngest presumptively positive Covid-19 case in Mecklenburg County, according to Grantham. The house, understandably, was absolute chaos. \"Hobie was crying and Hutch and Parker were fighting. Family members wanted updates. Dishes needed (to be) washed. What were we doing for dinner? Laundry was spilling into the hallways. Everyone else needed me and I wanted to stop picking up the phone,\" Grantham said. The two weeks of her \"quarantine-illness-filled-world\" was \"surreal,\" Grantham said. But now, with her family being all OK, she said she hopes their story will bring more awareness to the fact that children can get Covid-19. \"My message is that kids can get it and that it is a public health issue,\" Grantham told Bolduan. \"It is some ways being politicized all over the place, but it is a public health issue at the core of it.\" \"You can have an opinion on how it should be handled, but the fact is it's impacting everybody and it is very real,\" she said.",

He had general anesthesia and doctors advised him to curtail his talking for a while to allow his vocal cords to recover.\n\nSome context: US Health and Human Services Assistant Secretary Dr. Brett Giroir said during a phone call with reporters on Wednesday that the updated CDC guidance on Covid-19 testing was last discussed and approved by White House coronavirus task force members last Thursday.\n\nGiroir said in the call that the updated testing guidelines originated from within the CDC and were written by multiple authors, adding that he, Fauci, Dr. Deborah Birx and Dr. Stephen Hahn worked on them.\n\n\"The new guidelines are a CDC action. As always, guidelines received appropriate attention, consultation and input from task force experts, and I mean the medical and scientific experts,\" Giroir said, also mentioning CDC Director Dr. Robert Redfield. \"All the task force experts advise on coronavirus-related matters.\"\n\nThe updated guidelines were released on Monday. Previous CDC testing guidance said anyone who had close contact with someone with coronavirus should get tested, whether they have symptoms or not. The site was changed to say: \"If you have been in close contact (within 6 feet) of a person with a COVID-19 infection for at least 15 minutes but do not have symptoms, you do not necessarily need a test unless you are a vulnerable individual or your health care provider or State or local public health officials recommend you take one.\"\n\nA senior federal health official close to the process told CNN on Wednesday the changes came as a result of pressure from the Trump administration. \"It's coming from the top down,\" the source said.",

        "body": "(CNN)Early stage clinical trial results show the Covid-19 vaccine candidate made by Novavax is safe and elicits an immune response, according to a study published Wednesday in The New England Journal of Medicine. The results had previously been announced by the company in early August.\n\nUsing a randomized, placebo-controlled trial -- the gold-standard method of study -- scientists gave the vaccine or a placebo, an inert substance like saline, to 131 healthy adults in May. Eighty-three people got the vaccine with adjuvant, an agent to boost the body's immune response. Another 25 got the vaccine without the booster and 23 got the placebo. Participants also received a second injection 21 days after the first.The volunteers came from two locations in Australia and they were all under the age of 60. People who had Covid-19 or who had recovered from Covid-19 were excluded from the trial.In a phase Phase 1 trial, doctors mostly watch to see if the vaccine is safe, but they also check to see if it produced a response. For 35 days, participants were told to record any potential symptoms or soreness. Volunteers were also given a swab test for Covid-19 if they had any symptoms, and were tested 35 days after their first injection. Read MoreAt day 35, there were no serious or unusual adverse events. One person reported a mild fever that lasted for a day after the second shot. Otherwise, most didn't have any reaction at all, or if they did have a reaction, it was mild. Two people in two of the vaccine groups had headache, fatigue and malaise for a median of two days or less. Two people from two of the vaccine groups had fatigue, malaise, and tenderness. After the second vaccination, most people didn't have any problems, or they were mild. One person had tenderness after the second shot and eight had joint pain and fatigue. The vaccine seemed to generate an immune response. All the volunteers who got the vaccine developed neutralizing antibodies after the second dose.At day 35, participants who got two doses of the vaccine with the adjuvant developed neutralizing antibodies at levels more than four to six times greater than average than the antibodies developed by people who had recovered from Covid-19. Antibodies are the proteins the body naturally produces to fight off an infection or toxin. The vaccine also seemed to generate T-cells, the type of immune cells that also help protect the body from infection, in the 16 volunteers who were randomly selected and tested for T-cell response. The benefit of adding adjuvant to the vaccine was clear, based on the antibody response it generated, the study found. It also showed the value of the second dose on day 21. \"Based on the positive Phase 1 results, we have begun multiple Phase 2 clinical trials, from which we expect to collect preliminary efficacy,\" said Dr. Gregory Glenn, president of research and development at Novavax. \"Novavax is committed to generating the safety, immunogenicity and efficacy data that will support confident usage of the vaccine, both in the US and globally, and the data published today further bolsters our conviction that this is possible.\"There are limits to what this trial can determine about the vaccine. It's a small number of patients and there were few Black and Latinx volunteers in the trial. The patients were also in good health. Dr. Paul Offit, Director of the Vaccine Education Center and professor of pediatrics at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, said the results look good for this early stage.\"It will need to be tested in tens of thousands of people to see not just their response, but if you can prove that it is protective,\" Offit said. \"So we wait months to see if that happens.\"Offit noted that, compared to some of the other candidates among the 33 Covid-19 vaccines in various stages of development right now, this one may have an advantage, because it uses an approach that has been successfully tried with other vaccines, like those that protect against shingles. \"I think my takeaway from this is this is a tried and true vaccine strategy,\" Offit said. \"But we will have to wait and see if they prove it works.\"Five vaccines are in clinical trials in the US, and 33 around the world, according to the World Health Organization.",

Jon Husted was also tested for coronavirus Thursday ahead of Trump's visit and tested negative, DeWine's office said.Landing in Cleveland shortly after the news broke, Trump wished DeWine well in light of his diagnosis and told the crowd gathered at the airport that DeWine is a \"great guy\" who has \"done a fantastic job.\"\"We want to wish him the best, he'll be fine,\" Trump said.DeWine is the latest politician to test positive for coronavirus shortly before they were scheduled to meet with Trump. Last week, GOP Rep. Louie Gohmert, who has frequently refused to wear a mask, tested positive for the virus shortly before he was scheduled to fly aboard Air Force One with Trump to Texas. He is the second known governor to test positive for coronavirus, after Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt announced in July he had contracted Covid-19.DeWine's diagnosis is particularly notable as he has taken aggressive measures to slow the spread of coronavirus in his state, including issuing a stay-at-home order, a mask mandate, closing schools and postponing the state primary. His warnings about the seriousness of the pandemic early on and following the advice of health experts have differed from Trump's repeated downplaying of the virus and propensity to contradict the doctors on his coronavirus task force. DeWine has also taken a slower approach than other Republican governors in reopening his state. The Ohio Democratic Party said it is saddened to hear about DeWine's positive coronavirus test result and offered support for the governor. \"We know how hard he's been working to keep Ohioans safe, and this is just one more reminder that this virus can impact everyone,\" the party's chairman David Pepper said in a statement. \"As fellow Ohioans, we stand with and support our governor and his family at this time.\"This story has been updated with additional background information and reaction.\n\nCNN's Liz Stark and Maegan Vazquez contributed to this report.",

    "Opinion: 5 ways businesses can prevent a costly mental health crisis": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "This op-ed is a collaboration between the mental health doctors in the United States from the National Network of Depression Centers, and Project Healthy Minds, a new millennial-driven mental health nonprofit startup focused on destigmatizing mental illness, using technology to expand access to mental health solutions, and engaging employers to tackle the mental health crisis. The opinions expressed in this commentary are the authors' own.\n\nThe global pandemic sparked a corporate work-from-home revolution -- a new opportunity for many American workers who for decades have been tethered to offices, daily commutes and in-person meetings.\n\nBut as clinicians and mental health advocates, it's imperative that we sound the alarm: As we enter a sixth straight month of remote work, a sprawling mental health crisis is beginning to arise among the US workforce. Nearly four in 10 Americans say the \"coronavirus is having a serious impact on their mental health.\" Many people working from home are battling social isolation and losing any sense of work-life balance. Working parents are struggling under the weight of being present at their jobs while caring for and home-schooling children. These struggles are compounded by the fact that, at least prior to the pandemic, workers rarely -- if ever -- sought help from their employer when they were suffering. More than half of employees responded in a 2019 survey that they did not talk to anyone at work about their mental health in the last year. We are paying for the cost of our inaction in both lives and dollars. Globally, suicide has become the second leading cause of death among people aged 15 to 29. Even before this pandemic, depression and anxiety were costing the global economy $1 trillion each year. It's time for business leaders to recognize that improving mental health for employees is an important investment that demonstrates a commitment to stakeholder capitalism and could help combat another public health crisis. Well-planned workplace mental wellness programs produce more productive workforces and deliver a positive return on investment. As the World Health Organization has noted, \"For every $1 put into scaled up treatment for common mental disorders, there is a return of $4 in improved health and productivity.\" Read MoreWe're urging every business to step up and address their employees' serious mental health needs during this unusual moment by taking a multi-faceted approach.Openly and consistently talk about mental healthOne of the most corrosive elements of our mental health crisis is suffering in silence. Oftentimes, the stigma is more acute in the workplace than it is outside of it. A 2019 survey revealed that 81% of workers said the stigma associated with mental health prevents them from seeking treatment. That's why leaders need to model the behavior by opening up in public settings -- leveraging virtual company town halls, for instance -- to create a structure that permits employees to open up about their own mental health struggles. Train managers on mental healthIn this new world, managers need to go through specialized training so they know when an employee is struggling with a mental health condition -- especially while teams are working remotely and the signals may be less obvious. That means implementing mandatory, company-wide mental health first aid training for managers so that they are well-equipped to proactively identify issues before they get worse. Ditch the \"one-size-fits-all\" approachThe mental health needs of employees are diverse. The needs of a young employee who has recently graduated and lives in a small, urban apartment can be very different than that of a female executive raising and educating children while running a large team. For too long, companies have solely relied on employee assistance programs (EAPs) -- essentially an outsourced hotline where employees can get help with legal problems, child care support, mental health services and more -- to \"check the box\" when it comes to providing mental health services to employees. However, EAPs are rarely used -- multiple studies have found that fewer than 10% of employees are taking advantage of them.Once they've gone through formal training, managers should reach out to their team members individually to ask about their mental health and what they may need to establish new work-life boundaries during the pandemic, which will help them avoid burnout.Redesign employee benefits to support mental healthOur Covid-related work and lifestyle changes aren't going away in the near term. This is a marathon, compounded by uncertainty. Virtual programs can help employees handle stress and emotional symptoms more effectively by teaching mindfulness and relaxation techniques, and encouraging healthful behaviors, like getting adequate sleep, eating well and exercising regularly.Wellness programs help keep people functioning at their best. Programs that support time off for treatment with a plan to return to work have proven benefits for avoiding 'presenteeism' -- when an employee is technically not absent from work, but is less productive. Flexibility to attend weekly therapy sessions or more intensive hospital treatment programs allows employees to focus on getting back to full function. Flexible leave also prevents employees from leaving the company to seek treatment, which can require expensive retraining for skilled roles.Show that your commitment to mental health is authenticWorld Mental Health Day is on October 10. One of the best ways employers can highlight mental health is by celebrating it. Companies should use their brand platform to publicly tell employee stories of overcoming mental health challenges and detail how the company provided support. Employees and prospective talent look to the public positions that companies take on social issues and they make decisions based on that analysis.To overcome the decades of skepticism, stigma and shame that employees feel about talking about their mental health, management needs to demonstrate an authentic, consistent commitment. Now is the time for employers to confront this urgent health crisis that is impacting their employees. Not only is it the right thing to do, but it is also the smart business decision.

She is on the faculty of the UCLA Kaiser Permanente Center for Health Equity where her research focuses on health care delivery, health equity, and health policy. The opinions expressed in this commentary are those of the author. Read more opinion on CNN.\n\n(CNN)It is harder because it was so sudden. It is harder because it is a disease that I know all too well. It is harder because he was young, gifted and Black. It is harder because our community has already endured so much in this cold and callous year that is 2020.\n\nLike Kobe Bryant and George Floyd and John Lewis and the other Black men whose untimely deaths have occurred this year, the passing of Chadwick Boseman at the age of 43 sent shock waves through not just the Black community, but the entire world. His death from colon cancer leaves a vacuum in the world; on the silver screen Boseman embodied legendary men and myths that transcended race and appealed to the best in us all -- historical figures, cultural icons and superheroes that it seemed he alone could portray. And off-screen, he graced us with his wisdom, strength, and compassion for others in a way that only a real-life superhero could. I was not his doctor and cannot speak to the specifics of his clinical course with colon cancer, but as a physician and cancer researcher who has focused her career on disparities in colorectal cancer, I take no pride in sharing that my profession has failed at controlling this disease. Colorectal cancer is the second most common cause of cancer-related deaths among men and women combined in the United States. While traditionally a disease of older adults, it has crept into younger and younger age groups. There are also racial and ethnic groups that see its devastating consequences at a higher frequency. This heavy toll is particularly ironic given that the disease is largely preventable and 90% of the cases are curable if caught early. Read MoreThe impact of colorectal cancer is unrelenting. And without diligently addressing four key features of this disease, it will continue to be so. No longer a disease of older adultsI had the honor of participating in a public tribute to Mr. Boseman the weekend after his death. In the impossible circumstance of mourning a fallen hero while also fulfilling a responsibility to provide education on a disease that is killing too many, I found strength in the example Chadwick Boseman set. If he could continue to inspire millions in the face of his own mortality, I can surely exercise my craft in the midst of my sadness and shed light on this common disease far too often shrouded in mystery. Boseman's diagnosis with colon cancer at 39 is rare and far from the typical presentation of the disease. Traditionally, we think of colorectal cancer as a disease of the elderly. And, in many respects, it is. The mean age of onset is 66 years for men and 69 years for women. The American Cancer Society estimates that only about 11 in 100,000 people will develop colorectal cancer between the ages 35 and 39, compared to about 120 in 100,0000 individuals ages 65 to 69. But the unfortunate reality over the past two decades is that we are seeing this condition more and more in young adults, who we define as those under 50. The number of colorectal cancer cases in that age group is increasing by 2.2% per year. Currently, 11% of colorectal cancer cases occur in this age group. Symptoms too often ignored In many cases, symptoms that are classic for colorectal cancer go unevaluated in young adults, largely because the disease is not highly suspected. Too often, the classic signs -- blood in the stool, new abdominal pain or rectal pain-- are explained away by the patient or by medical providers as benign conditions like hemorrhoids or chronic gastrointestinal conditions. For these individuals, work-up and diagnostic studies are delayed and the diagnosis is missed or pushed further along in time until the best options for treatment or cure are no longer available. With the changing epidemiology of colorectal cancer, we must be more alert when signs of it are present in young adults. Gone are the days of this being a disease of the elderly. All patients with worrisome symptoms should be evaluated and considered for a colonoscopy, regardless of age. The role of race and ethnicityAfrican Americans also must recognize their elevated risk. Incidence of colorectal cancer is 20% higher in Blacks than in Whites, and Blacks are 40% more likely to die from the disease than Whites. These disparities are rooted in long-existing policies and social determinants of health that include living environment, lifestyle factors, medical co-morbidities, differences in screening utilization and health insurance, as well as unequal treatment by health care systems. As a result, Blacks see disparities in every aspect of the colorectal cancer continuum, from prevention and early detection to treatment and survival. Latinos and people of Native American or Alaskan Native descent also face unique barriers to colorectal cancer screening that contribute to low screening rates and poor outcomes. Though public health efforts have focused on addressing disparities in these groups, there is an urgent need for national attention to these health differences. Particularly at a time when the Covid-19 pandemic has increased apprehension about going to health facilities, we need to inform patients that there are safe procedures in place to perform screening. Cancer will not wait for Covid-19 to go away.A lasting legacy through awarenessIn the passing of Chadwick Boseman, I find only one sliver of solace: By honoring his memory and teaching young people, the Black community and other underserved populations about this devastating disease, we may be able to save lives. Everyone needs to be screened for colorectal cancer. For those with a family history of disease, screening should start at age 40 -- or 10 years before the age the earliest family member was diagnosed (whichever is earliest). To get this right, those diagnosed with colorectal cancer must share their medical history with other family members so that we avoid missed opportunities for screening. In addition, genetic testing should also be performed for families with multiple cases. Individuals with predisposing medical conditions like inflammatory bowel disease or a history of radiation to the abdomen or pelvis should discuss with their medical providers the timing of colorectal cancer screening, as early screening is also likely indicated. For African Americans without a family history of colorectal cancer, screening should begin at age 45. And non-Blacks without a family history should initiate screening at age 45 or 50. Fortunately, there are many screening options, including at-home, stool-based screening tests, in addition to colonoscopy. Implementation of programs to encourage screening in the United States has sharply decreased the number of annual colorectal cancer cases and deaths attributed to the disease since the 1990s. However, with nearly 150,000 cases per year, more than 50,000 deaths per year, and too few people using life-saving screening tests, it's clear our efforts to head off the disease are insufficient. A public health priority set by the National Colorectal Cancer Roundtable, a coalition dedicated to reducing the incidence and mortality from colorectal cancer in the United States, challenges us to achieve the goal of getting 80% of Americans screened for colorectal cancer in every community. \"Every community\" specifically refers to elevating screening rates not only for majority populations that have access to high-quality health care but also among low-income, underserved populations and Black and brown communities where we often see the lowest screening rates. These are also the communities in which we see countless barriers to screening, the highest rates of Covid-19 and the greatest potential to stem the impact of colorectal cancer in our nation. We will never fully resolve the loss of such an extraordinary soul as Chadwick Boseman. He helped remind a generation of African Americans of the greatness from which they came and stirred our imaginations to dream of the heroes we can become. He has earned a place in our collective memory, and through his movies, we will celebrate his legacy. As we honor him, we can also continue to highlight the disease that took this remarkable talent too soon. We must increase attention to the factors associated with colorectal cancer risk and the importance of symptoms and screening regardless of age, race, or historical marginalization. In doing so, we can continue to increase public awareness, patient empowerment, and health care access-- and perhaps prevent another brilliant star from fading too soon.",

    "Opinion: In the shadow of a pandemic, Rohingya challenge our ideas about refugees": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "Chat with us in Facebook Messenger. Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds.\n\nKhaled Hosseini is a Goodwill Ambassador for UNHCR, the UN refugee agency, and author of several international bestsellers including \"The Kite Runner\" and \"Sea Prayer.\" The opinions expressed here are his own. Read more opinion at CNN.\n\n(CNN)Ask yourself: how would you survive in your home country if you had no proof of citizenship or even of your existence? How would your children grow up with minimal access to a school or even a hospital? What would you do if one day, after years of discrimination, your home village was attacked by gunmen? Your neighbors killed as their children looked on? Homes burned to the ground? If you're Rohingya, you grab your children, take what possessions you can carry, and you run for your life.\n\nThree years ago this week, that is exactly what hundreds of thousands of traumatized Rohingya had to do.I remember watching with horror images of Rohingya families fleeing Myanmar, trudging barefoot through rice fields, their lives on their backs, leaving behind their homes, their livelihoods, their dead, the friends and loved ones too old, too weak, or too beaten, to follow. They reached the border exhausted, injured, traumatized, and in need of urgent care.Yet even as I write this, I'm aware that too many refugee stories focus on trauma and escape. Too often in the public consciousness, a refugee is a vulnerable, helpless person fleeing violence and in desperate need of rescue. That is an incomplete telling of the story and further injustice to its protagonists. While refugees do in fact need protection, they are defined far less by their status as beneficiaries of care than by their unfathomable courage, resilience, and desire for self-reliance. This is true of every refugee community I have visited, be it Syrians or Afghans or South Sudanese, and it is certainly true of the Rohingya. The Rohingya are a Muslim minority in Myanmar, who despite living in the country for generations, have not been afforded the same rights as its citizens and who have been forced to flee persecution numerous times over the years.Read MoreFrom the outset, Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh took critical leadership roles in the humanitarian response to their own suffering. With support from UNHCR, the UN Refugee Agency, and NGO partners, they formed a community-based protection model, giving fellow refugees the opportunity to have a measure of control over their own lives and learn new skills. The model gave agency to all members of the Rohingya community. That was before the coronavirus pandemic struck. The outbreak of Covid-19 has seen an 80% reduction of humanitarian workers in the camps. The role of the Rohingya refugee community volunteers has therefore become even more essential. As a former physician, I am in awe of the refugee community health workers who have rolled up their sleeves and volunteered to meet the needs of their community. They have worked together to reduce the risk of viral transmission and, given the circumstances, it is nothing short of inspiring.Take 19-year-old Salma, for instance. She is a community health volunteer in the overcrowded Kutupalong refugee camp in Bangladesh. More than 600,000 people live in an area of just 13 square kilometers, five square miles; infrastructure and services are stretched to their limits.Before the pandemic, she took part in a cross-generational volunteer program --half of which is comprised of girls and women- to provide health support, including pre- and post-natal care for women and infants in the camp. But in recent months, she has shifted her responsibilities to the Covid-19 response. Joined by more than 1,400 others, Salma now promotes hand washing and hygiene. She educates the community on how the virus spreads, how to recognize symptoms and seek care, as well as ensuring that those who show symptoms are tested.Despite the challenges of living in a densely populated refugee camp, Salma and fellow volunteers have made a lifesaving difference in their community. By the end of July, there were fewer than 100 confirmed Covid-19 cases among the Rohingya refugee population of about 860,000. I find this very poignant, because it doesn't take much of a leap to see how Salma's work, halfway around the world, is in fact critical to the wellbeing and safety of my own family here in America. For one thing we have all learned in this pandemic is that nobody is safe from this virus until all of us are. I am moved and inspired by the resilience of the Rohingya refugees. They are survivors. They escaped unspeakable horrors, made the long, painful journey to Bangladesh, and overcame the many hardships of life in the camps. They continue to show strength in maintaining hope and a commitment to going home again, against all odds. And now, each day, beneath the shadow of a pandemic, they are working, leading, healing, and challenging our idea of \"who a refugee is.\"",

I agree with these words. I struggle with these words. I would add that, in the months since the novel coronavirus pandemic began largely shutting down our communities, we have also squandered the opportunity to plan for how to safely resume some of the most critical aspects of society. Since many schools closed in March, there has not been nearly enough discussion of how to reopen them in a safer fashion this fall. If we truly wanted schools to open, we would have collectively worked to lower community transmission and allocated the money and resources needed to reopen schools as safely as possible. If the community transmission in my area remains low, my wife and I have made the calculated decision that we will send our children to school. I am comfortable with this decision because I understand and support the mitigation factors our children's school has put in place. Read MoreMy children also understand the importance of masks, distance and how their interactions with others increase risk of infection.But I recognize and have to admit to my privilege. My children attend a private school with the resources to reopen in a manner that will maximize the chance that they, their classmates and the staff at the school will remain infection-free.Even with the resources on hand, the teachers at my children's school are nervous for their health and safety. And rightfully so -- if you have kids and you don't have nerves about schools restarting, then you aren't fully appreciating the situation that teachers, staff and your household are facing. Teachers in public schools understandably have the greatest level of anxiety, based on conversations I've had with them.I am somewhat sheepish in admitting to the following, but one of the other factors that helped in our decision to send our children to school is my knowledge of the link between socioeconomics and infection.The families that send their children to private schools fall into demographic groups that are less likely to be badly affected by the pandemic. We have long-known that there is a wealth disparity with the infection rates. From the early days of the pandemic, public health officials recognized how the virus was deepening American inequality. The financial inequality rife throughout the US drove some families directly into the path of the virus while allowing many with means and office jobs to isolate themselves at home, continuing to work but remotely and away from this plague.The wealth disparity is not unique to the US. A similar phenomenon has also been observed in Canada. In a beautifully written piece, the Toronto Star clearly highlighted the difference in infection rates between the 20 lowest income neighborhoods and the 20 highest income neighborhoods in Toronto. The number of weekly new Covid-19 cases in the lower income neighborhoods, at peak, was as much as 6 to 8 times higher than that of the wealthy neighborhoods.We can speculate as to why there is a wealth disparity with infection rates in our communities: More people in lower income neighborhoods may have been essential workers, providing more opportunities for exposure; often the housing density in those neighborhoods is high, increasing the ease of transmission between households once infections have penetrated the neighborhood; and often within households there are more people in less space, enhancing within-the-home infection rates.These disparities in infection rates should alarm us all. Not just because they highlight how fractured society has become, but because they provide us with a forecast of what is to come in the rest of the US when schools resume in-person teaching. When there are people mixing in the workplace and those workers come home to a family, the spread of the virus in the community paves the way for transmission in the home. Children throughout the US were pulled out of school in the spring semester to finish the school year remotely and have largely been staying home due to lockdown measures. But they will be assembling in groups when the school restarts in person. The infection rates we have seen among lower income essential workers and their families could now become the infection rates we see in children attending school. And those infected children will come home to their community and mix with each other in neighborhoods and sports. And they will spend many hours with their parents, siblings, and extended family. We now know that children can be infected. While the evidence is currently mixed on how easily they can be infected -- ranging from half as likely to as likely as adults (especially for those children over 10 years old) -- the data is robust that children can be infected. However, we can take some comfort in the data showing that children are much less prone to severe outcomes from Covid-19. Lower severity of disease gives many people the justification they need to send their kids to school. This fact alone, coupled with my family's overall good health, does give me some comfort in our decision to send our kids to school. But we must appreciate that children also harbor as much virus in their noses as adults. This is important because the nose and the mouth are the primary locations by which the virus tries to leave your body and find a new host. If children touch their nose or mouth and then touch another child or a shared surface, or they cough or sneeze, the virus could be easily released into the school environment. Given that many children do not develop as severe Covid-19 symptoms as adults, it's possible that their ability to transmit the virus could be lower. But that transmission risk is still, of course, present. And when we consider there are 56 million school-age children in the US, that risk is nothing to take lightly.Some parts of the US have started going back to school, with one Indiana school closing days after it opened due to an infected staff member. Other schools may get a little bit of breathing room before the first infections are revealed. But make no mistake, if there is community transmission in your local area, once schools resume there will be infected children and staff within those school walls. And once they are in the school, you are relying on the mitigation efforts the school has put in place -- masks, physical distance, ventilation and filtration of air, outdoor teaching -- to stop within-school transmission. What is your school doing to prepare? Every parent, teacher and staff member should be asking critical safely questions. If the answers you receive don't align with your risk profile, then you need to demand more of your school and your local government.At this stage the most important thing we can do is to focus our attention on reducing community transmission -- because once schools resume in-person teaching, children will be interacting with larger group of friends and we will be giving the virus mobility and the susceptible hosts it needs to spread in our community.",

        "body": "(CNN)After a long and hard fought primary season, Joe Biden and Kamala Harris have emerged as the Democratic Party's nominees for president and vice president. As delegates prepare for their convention, CNN Opinion asked 10 contributors from across the Democratic spectrum to weigh in on their visions for the future of the party.\n\nKeith Boykin: It's finally time for the party to deliverAt a time when Democrats plan to nominate a 77-year-old white moderate to be our party standard-bearer, the future of the party is clearly younger, more progressive and more colorful than ever before. We see this with Joe Biden's selection of Kamala Harris to be his running mate, but we also see it in congressional races all across the country.After decades of cautious incrementalism, established incumbents in safe Democratic congressional districts who failed to keep up with the new vision of the party have begun to tumble. The two biggest examples come from my home state of New York and my native state of Missouri.In New York, Rep. Eliot Engel, the chair of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, was sent to retirement thanks to progressive challenger Jamaal Bowman. Meanwhile, in Missouri, veteran Rep. William Lacy Clay, lost his primary to progressive challenger Cori Bush.Read MoreThe movement is also gaining by attrition, as the departure of senior Democrats creates new opportunities for young progressives and people of color. The retirement of 83-year-old Nita Lowey in New York's 17th congressional district created an opening for 33-year-old Mondaire Jones. And the retirement of 76-year-old Jos\u00e9 Serrano in New York's 15th opened the door for 32-year-old Ritchie Torres. Jones and Torres will be the first two out Black gay men in Congress.In the old days, Democrats were ashamed to be called \"liberal.\" These days, 76% of Democrats say they'd vote for a socialist for President. And even after weeks of civil unrest that would have spooked fearful Democrats in years past, 86% support the protests against police violence. The wind is at our back. As America becomes more diverse and open-minded, Democrats have won the popular vote in six of the last seven presidential elections, and Republicans have had to resort to voter suppression attempts and gerrymandering to stay in power. Once radical ideas like marriage equality, Medicare for All, legalizing marijuana, universal basic incomes, reducing police budgets and the Green New Deal have slowly become more mainstream. And for loyal Democrats like myself -- who have been patiently waiting for real change for decades -- it's finally time for the party to deliver.Keith Boykin is a former White House aide to President Bill Clinton and a CNN political commentator.Jess McIntosh: Start acting like the majority The Democratic Party should look and govern like the majority it represents. Conservatives have not won the popular vote in a presidential election since 1988 -- with the exception of the election that followed 9/11. So, how do they maintain power? By using a stealth combination of electoral practices, such as voter suppression and gerrymandering, a single-minded commitment to packing the courts with young ideologues to the right of the country and a willingness to mislead the public on issues as important as pandemic response. The new Democratic Party has no greater mandate than the restoration of small 'd' democracy. We must enact structural court reform, end the filibuster and treat election access like the national crisis that it is. Every American must be able to vote easily and safely, and the government must not be rigged to allow a small group of men in danger of losing power to overturn the people's will and ignore their priorities. The majority of Americans believe in gun control, a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants and abortion access. And now, positions once considered too progressive are also becoming mainstream -- from police reform to government-run healthcare to reducing the fossil fuel economy. In short, we should govern like we have the support and mandate of the country, because we do. But we shouldn't just govern like a majority -- we should govern like the specific majority that the Democratic Party is. According to Pew Research, only 39% of white men voted Democratic in 2018, even after two years of a chaotic Trump administration. However, white men are not the majority of the Democratic Party. The Democratic Party is comprised of young people (and politically speaking \"young\" can apply to anyone under 40), a growing number of white women, men of color and, most reliably, the women of color who are still the least represented in government. And their voices should be centered in our governance. As Massachusetts Rep. Ayanna Pressley, a freshman member of Congress, says, \"The people closest to the pain need to be the people closest to the power.\" The Democratic Party is increasingly made up of people who have struggled to live the American dream, only to have those dreams frustrated and stymied altogether. They are the young health care professionals who are tired of being ignored. They are the single mothers who know how far a dollar doesn't stretch. They are the generation who grew up knowing the climate crisis was coming not for some future Earth, but the one they hoped to leave their own children. America has never had a truly representative democracy, and we're going to have to fight to have one now. But the will is there -- and most importantly, so are the numbers.

Andrew Yang: Democrats need to start connecting with middle AmericaWhen I was running for President, I campaigned in small towns around the country, where I was frequently asked, \"What party?\" \"Democrat,\" I would say. Far too often, that person -- a waitress, a trucker or a retail clerk -- would respond in disgust. I had always believed that the Democratic Party existed to improve the lives of working-class people like them, and I was disheartened to discover they felt differently. But their reaction reflects the sentiment of too many Americans who do not think that the Democratic Party speaks to or cares about them. They believe that we are the party of the urban enclaves and the educated elite. They think that we would rather lecture or patronize them than actually spend the time helping to solve their problems. They feel that we don't care to understand their lives and that we believe big government should tell them what to do. Many of them have lost faith in government as a positive force in their lives. And their belief in political parties in general is low. In the latest Gallup poll, 38% of Americans self-identified as Independents, more than the 29% who identified as Democrats or the 28% as Republicans. Party identification is going down, not up. The Democratic Party needs new solutions. I ran for President because I believed that Donald Trump was a symptom of a disease in our country that is getting stronger. In post-industrial towns across the country, people are struggling, overdose rates are sky-high and parents despair for their children's future. Malls are being considered as future Amazon warehouses. And the prospects of a decent middle-class life are out of reach for more and more. The future of the Democratic Party depends on making the case to these voters that we care about them, too. We will fight to give parents the ability to say to their children, \"Your country loves you, your country values you, and your country will invest in you and your future.\" One way to begin that fight is by giving the American people cash in hand. According to an IPSOS/Reuters poll, three quarters of Americans support stimulus checks in the wake of the pandemic. And it makes sense -- those checks would enable millions, by helping them to cover their basic living expenses. They would also begin to humanize the 21st century economy that is turning on so many of us. So, how much should that monthly payment be? $2,000 a month for the remainder of this pandemic would be a good place to start. Universal basic income -- a guaranteed, unconditional recurring payment for every American -- is our future, and one that the Democratic Party should embrace and champion.

He recently founded Humanity Forward, an organization built to realize the vision and ideas of his presidential campaign. Yang is also a CNN political commentator.Jennifer Granholm: Democrats must start playing to their core strength There is a persistent belief that Republicans are \"better\" for the economy than Democrats. It's malarkey. The Democratic Party must start taking credit as the party that is, by nearly every conceivable metric of history and economics, better for the US economy. Skeptical? Here are the data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics: Using the latest jobs numbers, since 1961, Democratic Presidents have presided over the creation of roughly 60 million jobs, while Republican Presidents have presided over the creation of approximately 25 million jobs. In other words, Democratic administrations have created over two times as many jobs as Republican ones -- and in less time. How about other measurements? Forbes published a chart in July showing that Democrats \"dominate\" (their word) in wealth creation in the stock market since the days of President Harry Truman. Democratic Presidents have seen on average 10.6% growth in stocks. Republicans? Only 4.8%. Again, Democrats best Republicans by more than double. How about GDP growth? Same story. According to calculations based on the Bureau of Economic Analysis, the GDP grows 1.6 times faster under Democratic administrations than under Republican ones. Any way you measure it, Democratic policies are better for the economy and for working people. And don't even get me started on which party is worse on deficits and debts (hint: Republicans, by a trillion). Every time there is a change in leadership in the last 30 years, Republicans have trashed the economy, and Democrats have had to clean it up. George H. W. Bush' sluggish slowdown turned into Bill Clinton's booming 1990s. George W. Bush's unparalleled downturn became Barack Obama's decade of recovery. Obama's recovery became Donald Trump's Covid-19 crash. In 2021, Joe Biden and the Democrats will have a hell of a mess to clean up. But if there's anyone up to the task of building us back better, it's Biden. After yet another failed Republican administration, it's no surprise that Democrats will have to build our country and economy back again. Roll up your sleeves, Democrats, we've got a Trump-sized mess to fix. Jennifer Granholm is the former Democratic governor of Michigan and a CNN political contributor. Abdul El-Sayed: Beware of the Never Trumpers Though his signature political skill is his ability to divide, President Donald Trump has ironically emerged as the single most unifying force in Democratic politics. The potential of his second term is the threat that binds everyone -- from progressives like New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez to longtime conservative commentators Bill Kristol and George Will -- together. Pundits talk a lot about the Democratic Party's ascendant progressive wing, which has pulled so many of the party's policies in the direction of the needs of poor and working people. But they have all but ignored the party's lurch rightward. As the Republican Party under Trump has rejected climate science and globalization, Never Trump Republicans like Kristol and Will have struggled to find a political home. They've camped right outside our party's famously \"big tent.\" Every vote against Trump counts right now. However, we cannot make the mistake of sacrificing our own ideals to accommodate theirs. In the first place, the logic that beating Trump will require us to tilt toward conservative ideology to win over Republicans alienated by him is fatally flawed. It neglects that fact that rightward tilting risks losing us progressives and young people whose support for the Democratic nominee in 2016 was five percentage points lower than in 2012 -- and who are critical to defeating Trump in 2020. More importantly, this approach will certainly lose us the future. The piercing glare from the need to defeat Trump and end the Covid-19 pandemic tends to blot out the systems that created them. Underlying them is a chronic epidemic rooted in the failures of so many of the systems we've counted on to deliver the basic means of a dignified life -- health care, housing, competent infrastructure, a just and fair economy. And these failures are largely because they've been sold off to mega-corporations that have corrupted or compromised them for their own profits.Consider the health insurance companies making record profits as 5.4 million lost their health insurance during this pandemic, or the fossil fuel corporations whose very existence comes at the expense of the Earth itself. How do the likes of Kristol or Will think we should take these problems on? They don't. As early as 1994, in response to the Bill Clinton-era healthcare reform, Bill Kristol wrote an essay entitled: \"How to oppose the Health Plan and Why.\" He compared the Affordable Care Act to communism. Meanwhile, on the issue of climate change, Will wrote a Washington Post column called \"Scientific silencers on the left are trying to shut down climate skepticism\" in 2016. Dare I say it, there is no room for climate skeptics in our tent. Indeed, what conservatives have orchestrated is an unprecedented federal disinvestment in the public goods that are so critical to our future. And Trump and his blunders are simply the return on that disinvestment. What our future needs is more public investment in our public schools, finally guaranteeing every American health care through Medicare for All, breaking our addiction to fossil fuels through the Green New Deal and rooting out systemic racism in every policy, law and institution that harbors it. This moment of superlatives -- the worst pandemic in over 100 years; the worst economic prospects since the Great Depression; the greatest uprisings against racism since the civil rights era -- cannot trick us into believing that we can go \"back\" to the normal that helped create them. Rather we must move forward.That means beating Trump, certainly. But if we are serious about winning the election and the future, we need to stick clearly to our ideals and ask those who would join our tent out of shame for what their ideology has wrought to check that ideology at the door. It has failed them -- and failed us all. Abdul El-Sayed is a physician, epidemiologist and former health director for the city of Detroit. He is also a CNN political commentator and author of \"Healing Politics: A Doctor's Journey into the Heart of our Political Epidemic.\"Alexandra Rojas: Be the party of fundamental, not incremental, changeThe coronavirus has upended our economy and society, leaving millions without work and without health insurance. This crisis has made it painfully clear that the status quo is unsustainable, and that just going back to the way things were before President Donald Trump assumed office isn't good enough. People want the Democratic Party to go bigger -- and to offer a bold vision that matches this historic moment. To win not just this year, but in the decades to come, the Democratic Party must be the party of fundamental change, not incremental change. That's why I believe that the future of the Democratic Party is, in many ways, a return to its past: We need to embrace the ambition of the New Deal in the 1930s, which established Social Security and the minimum wage, and the Great Society in the 1960s, which gave us Medicare and Medicaid. We need to return the party to its roots in the labor and civil rights movements of the mid-20th century -- and champion the bold ideas that have galvanized generations before us and are inspiring our generation today. As New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez says, \"We aren't pushing the party left. We are bringing the party home.\" Many of the party's current leaders are overwhelmingly older, Whiter, wealthier and more conservative than the party's base -- but a new generation of leaders who are younger, browner and more progressive are already transforming the Democratic Party and calling for solutions that are as big as the problems we face. This year's House victories by progressives like Jamaal Bowman in New York and Cori Bush in Missouri have shown that Reps. Ocasio-Cortez, Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts, Ilhan Omar of Minnesota and Rashida Tlaib of Michigan weren't flukes; they were just the beginning. And ideas that were once considered radical -- Medicare for All, a Green New Deal, free public college, ending mass incarceration and deportation -- are not only becoming mainstream, they're becoming popular. Joe Biden has already begun to recognize that the ground is shifting beneath him, appointing progressives to a slate of Biden-Sanders unity task forces that have already led the Democratic candidate to adopt a bigger, bolder $2 trillion climate plan. Biden knows that if he enters the White House in 2021, he won't be governing with the Congress from 2009. The Squad is here to stay, and it's growing.Alexandra Rojas is the executive director of Justice Democrats, the left-leaning grassroots organization that recruited Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez to run for Congress, and a CNN political commentator. Van Jones: Embrace a 'humanity first' kind of populismThe Democratic Party would do well to shake off its image as a party for the coastal elites -- and more fully embrace a friendlier version of populism. But not the kind of populism that we have seen recently -- from either end of the political spectrum.Instead, Democrats should adopt the fresh, positive, \"Humanity First\" populism that Andrew Yang brought forward during the primaries.Let me note that the term \"populism\" has become a dirty word. But the concept does invoke an approach to politics that has enduring and growing appeal. At their best, populists champion the unaddressed problems of everyday people. They give voice to the \"least of these,\" those who are struggling. They challenge the obsessions and preoccupations of those who are already in power. And they encourage mass participation in politics and governance. All of this is to the good -- at least in concept. But in practice, our country is stuck between two negative populisms, on the right and left. Negative populism on the right is anti-immigrant, anti-elite and too often anti-Jewish. It traffics in racial demagoguery. It pins the blame for social problems on minority groups that are already ostracized and suffering. Negative populism on the left rails against the \"billionaire class\" -- laying at their feet every ill in the nation and pretending that taxing them will solve all problems. Both of these populisms require you to rage at somebody. Neither of them are good at solving complex problems.The reality is that those who make up the base of the Democratic Party need real answers. Demographically, the future of the Democratic Party lies with the diverse, rising generations. And those folks are threatened by the economic challenge of automation and the ecological onslaught of climate change. To meet the challenge, the future of our party lies with people who are putting forward creative, mixed-economy solutions to these big problems. Neither Joe Biden nor Kamala Harris are associated with either of the camps of negative populism. Biden is a big-hearted leader who longs for respectful disagreement. Harris' life story shows what is possible in America. Based on temperament and biography, these two leaders have the potential to unite America. But they have not yet articulated the ideas that could actually pull the country back together. Fortunately they do not have to look too hard to find the ideas to make up a positive populism. They can just listen to Andrew Yang speak next week at the convention and take notes.Van Jones, CNN host, is the CEO of the REFORM Alliance, a criminal justice organization. He is also the author of \"Beyond the Messy Truth: How We Came Apart, How We Come Together.\" In 2009, Jones worked as the Green Jobs Adviser in the Obama White House.Paul Begala: We need to seek out converts When I voted for Joe Biden in this year's primary, it was the first time in 16 years that I'd voted for a White man for President. And it wasn't because of any politically correct impulse, but because I truly, deeply felt that Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama were the best people to lead our nation. So I supported Clinton in the 2008 primaries, then Obama in the general election, and Obama again in 2012. In 2016, I voted for Hillary Clinton -- mine was one of the 2,865,075 votes by which she beat Donald Trump in the popular vote. When I worked for Bill Clinton's 1992 presidential campaign, there were nine Democratic candidates running for President. All of them were White. All of them were male. I doubt that will ever happen again -- nor should it. The greatest political metamorphosis in American history was the Democratic Party's 180-degree turn on race. Democrats went from being the party of George Wallace to the party of Barack Obama. We aren't turning back. Biden is now leading the most diverse Democratic coalition I've ever seen. His supporters range from four star generals to the only self-avowed Democratic socialist in the US Senate. At the same time that the Biden-Harris coalition is amazingly broad, it is also astonishingly unified. In my 37 years in and around Democratic politics, I have never seen anything quite like it. Of course, nothing unites the people of Earth like a threat from Mars, and many Americans regard Donald Trump as a dire galactic threat. Holding that coalition together will require tremendous political skill. Holding together a big, broad, diverse, multi-racial, multi-ethnic, multi-cultural, multi-gender, multi-generational, multi-regional, multi-religious party is good training for leading a big, broad, diverse, multi-racial, multi-ethnic, multi-cultural, multi-gender, multi-generational, multi-regional, multi-religious country. The key to Biden's ability to do so, it seems to me, is his empathy. I've known Biden a long time. He's been tested by what Scripture calls \"a fiery trial.\" And Biden emerged deeply compassionate for others' pain. The challenge for Democrats is not simply to hold together this coalition, but to expand it further. There are two kinds of political parties, just as there are two kinds of churches: those who seek out converts and those who hunt down heretics. Biden is a Pope Francis-style Catholic: he is forever seeking out converts. His selection of Kamala Harris, and his convention, will showcase Biden's ability to destroy his enemies -- by making them his friends. Paul Begala, a Democratic strategist and CNN political commentator, was a political consultant for Bill Clinton's presidential campaign in 1992 and served as a counselor to Clinton in the White House. He is the author of the new book, \"You're Fired: The Perfect Guide to Beating Donald Trump.\" Jen Psaki: Let's reject the moderate-progressive divide Let me throw out a wild idea. What if the way to solve the division within the Democratic Party -- the perceived disagreements between the progressives and the moderates, that is -- was actually to reject that oversimplified breakdown to begin with? The longtime supporters of Democratic nominee Joe Biden don't actually oppose all progressive ideas. And every person who supported Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders does not think that moderate Democrats are immoral. The narrative about party division may make for a good headline, but it repeats a mistake Democrats have made in the past -- failing to understand how most people who are not in Washington, the media or professional punditry think. The reality is far more nuanced. It is possible for someone to support the bold calls for a Green New Deal, a progressive initiative led by Sanders and New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio Cortez, while also having concerns about what the impact of Medicare for All might be on their private health care options. It is also possible for someone to have deep concerns about the unchecked power of social media companies on society, while also supporting trade agreements, viewed as a more moderate initiative, because of the impact on their small business. Most Americans don't live their lives trying to neatly fit into one wing of a political party. Instead, let's take the best lessons we have learned this year to date. First, let's stop making the assumption that just because something hasn't happened yet means that everyone involved with the Democratic Party before 2016 is against it. For example, there are older White male members of the Democratic Party, not just Sanders, who were talking about climate change decades ago. John Kerry even met his wife at a climate conference in 1992. We need members of the old guard to bring about substantive policy change. Second, just because someone is new to politics and government does not mean he or she won't know how things works. Knowing where the bathroom is in the Cannon House congressional building is not as important as knowing how to persuade legislators to support a particular bill. And, at the same time, let's stop associating political experience with weakness and corruption. If politicians have been in office a long time, it may be more effective to invite them to the party and offer a bridge for them to join the movement. Finally, it's time to refrain from using Twitter as the political barometer of where the country is. Twitter users skew White, liberal and young. We can help ourselves a lot more by listening to what local mayors, state representatives and community leaders tell us about what is happening on the ground than looking for what the most viral missive on a social media platform tells us.

Follow her at @jrpsaki. Mitch Landrieu: Now is the time to deal with systemic racismThis is a time for choosing. We have an opportunity, with Joe Biden and Kamala Harris leading our party and the country, to reach for transformational policy.I particularly want the Democratic Party to deliver sweeping policy changes to address racial equity. For too long, Democratic stalwarts have made genuine pledges to correct the wrongs of the past, but by running away from the issue of race directly, we have failed to meaningfully repair the breach. The racial wealth gap today is as wide as it was in the 1960s. For example, a typical White family has nearly 10 times the wealth of a typical Black family. And the racial wealth gap has exacerbated other inequities, related to health, environment and housing.Some in our party decry \"identity politics.\" But setting a vision for who we want to be as a country and then delivering on it is far from that. Winning policy that is \"race neutral\" will not change these outcomes. We must talk more directly about the role of systemic racism in every facet of our lives if we are to make the policy changes necessary to advance equity. Our party and our country will only be strong if we all are moving together. The good news is that running toward the issue of racism may not present the political backlash it once would have. The last several months have proven to be a time of great reckoning for America. But even before the brutal death of George Floyd, the Democratic presidential primary produced the most robust debates on race and racial equity policies since the late 1960s. Voters today are more knowledgeable about the wounds of the past, which has never been more important given who currently occupies 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.Until more White Americans come to grips with the country's past -- and that includes White Democrats -- we will remain stuck. We must redesign the systems that have kept us divided for generations. It's going to take backbone from leaders at all levels in the Democratic Party to push forward aggressively and boldly. Long after Donald Trump is gone, racism will still plague this country. Let's hope the Democratic Party of tomorrow realizes that prioritizing issues of racial equity will not only deliver for our party's most loyal voters but also heal the soul of our nation.

In short, we need much more information than we now have.Hahn later walked back his comment about how many lives are saved by CCP (he said on Twitter that criticism of his remarks was \"entirely justified\") but there's still considerable confusion in the medical world that needs clearing up as it further complicates communications between physicians and their patients. Read MoreThe FDA's decision has real consequences for understanding how CCP should be used to treat the disease, and when it will most likely not be useful. Normally, such questions would be resolved by randomized clinical trials, but completing such trials may now be difficult or even impossible.With CCP now generally available under an Emergency Use Authorization, will patients still volunteer to join a randomized trial, knowing that they might actually receive a placebo? Will physicians refer their patients to a randomized trial, or simply go ahead and use convalescent plasma anyway? CCP is already in short supply, so will there be enough to meet increased demands?All the more reason, then, to understand the strengths and weaknesses of CCP therapy. If it turns out to be impossible to prove that CCP therapy is effective via randomized clinical trials, all we can do is apply common sense and the limited data already available in the scientific literature and via academic networks. This is far from ideal, but may now be the scenario we face, unfortunately.The scientific basis of CCP therapy is giving an outside boost to a patient battling the virus. The plasma contains virus-neutralizing antibodies -- proteins that recognize the invading virus, bind to it at specific locations and prevent it from infecting human cells. They \"neutralize\" the virus.CCP therapy is very soundly based on decades of experience with other infections. It's generally considered quite safe, but all blood products carry some risk, including rare but fatal transfusion reactions and transfusion-transmitted infections. Safety assessments in large randomized clinical trials are important for good reasons!But CCP therapy can only work well when the patient receives enough antibodies to make a difference. And all too often that's simply not the case. The amount of antibodies in the blood of Covid-19 patients depends on the severity of the infection and when the measurement is made. The sickest patients have the most antibodies, even those who go on to die. People with mild symptoms who recover at home usually have only very low levels of these antibodies.The best donors are seriously ill hospital patients who recover, are discharged and then give their plasma within the next month or two. Plasma donations from people who recover from mild infections are all too often not useful. Because this point is not widely understood by the general public and perhaps not even by all physicians, it can lead to a significant waste of resources.The FDA has recommended using only CCP with a minimum strength of antibodies, although physicians are allowed to use any CCP they can get their hands on. Experience in our and colleagues' laboratories tells us that nearly half the plasma samples from prospective CCP donors don't reach the FDA's standard, while others only barely make it. This suggests that much of the significant effort of screening donors and collecting CCP is wasted, and if the screening is not done, then patients have a good chance of receiving a useless infusion.Another key point is that hospitalized Covid-19 patients rapidly produce virus-neutralizing antibodies in their own plasma -- so much, in fact, that adding donor plasma to the mix often leads to only a negligible increase in useful antibodies .CCP therapy is not a simple procedure. Considerable efforts are being made to obtain suitable plasma units and then use them. It's not helpful, and indeed very wasteful and potentially harmful, if the wrong CCP units are used at the wrong time in the wrong patients. There's enough knowledge already around, including preliminary information from randomized clinical trials, and the hints in the Mayo Clinic manuscripts, to know that it's best \"to hit early, hit hard\".But to use CCP therapy effectively, only the most antibody-rich plasma should be used. And it should be given early, within the first week after the patient enters hospital, preferably the first three days. If CCP infusions are delayed much longer than a week, the amount of extra antibodies provided will probably be the proverbial drop in the bucket. But again, only randomized control trials will tell us the real answers--and the safest and actually effective way to use CCP therapy for Covid patients.President Trump was never going to tell the public that. But the FDA should have -- and now it must.",

    "Opinion: Rushing a Covid-19 vaccine before we get full data would be an enormous mistake": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "Chat with us in Facebook Messenger. Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds.\n\nKent Sepkowitz is a CNN medical analyst and a physician and infection control expert at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion at CNN.\n\n(CNN)On Monday, the Financial Times reported that the White House may bypass standard Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations to fast-track the use of the so-called Oxford coronavirus vaccine.\n\nThe possible shortcut seems similar to the administration's decision on Sunday to circumvent the same regulatory body to, as the President said, break \"the logjam over the last week\" by granting emergency use authorization for convalescent plasma treatment. This was despite prior skepticism from some top government health officials that enough data existed to warrant such action, according to a CNN source. As with the convalescent plasma decision, this tough-guy approach of pushing aside regulations to introduce an incompletely studied vaccine is an enormous mistake. The Oxford vaccine, while promising, is still in the early stages of clinical development.We have seen published information on 1,077 healthy volunteers, only half (543 people) of whom received the Oxford product. (The other half received a different already approved vaccine for a type of meningitis). The side effect profile of the Oxford vaccine is concerning, though not a showstopper. Among the participants, who were healthy, 91% white and 35 years old on average, more than half reported headache, fatigue, chills and feeling feverish.Read MoreEighteen percent developed objective fever. These symptoms were substantially more frequent than in the control group who received meningitis vaccine. While these are relatively common side effects that usually do not pose a threat, it's still important to fully understand all the risks associated with the vaccine and how they might affect various demographics who might be vaccinated.Without this understanding, it is difficult to be fully confident about the safety of the vaccine -- especially if it is given broadly. There is a predictable problem for any vaccine as it moves from a carefully curated clinical trial to use in the real world: people who need the product most are almost always excluded from the early studies because they don't meet \"eligibility criteria\" -- the rules of the study that almost never allow people with co-morbid conditions to participate. This means that we have no information on how safe the vaccine is in older people, those with serious heart problems, cancer, diabetes, or other frailties -- the exact population most in need of the vaccine. And relevant to Covid-19 and the Oxford data thus far, few participants have been Black or Hispanic, groups with higher rates of severe Covid-19 disease. In other words, we don't know how the average older American with a co-morbidity or two will respond to the vaccine -- both from perspective of protection as well as side effects -- if President Trump jumps the gun and makes it available for use. At a practical level, this will add substantial confusion for patients and doctors everywhere. For example, if someone develops a headache and fever a day after the vaccine, it is easy to shrug off the symptoms as vaccine-related in a healthy 35-year-old volunteer.But what about an 80-year old just-vaccinated grandmother with heart problems? And what if the fever speeds up her pulse, causing chest pain? Should she go to an emergency room? The problem is more than just one or ten or a thousand patients. Given the already vaccine-skittish nature of some in the US (including Trump himself not so long ago) a few stories of possible toxicity could sink the entire program, leaving us both unvaccinated and more vaccine-averse for the next promising product that comes along.This transition from big promise to functioning program has been an issue throughout the Trump efforts to fight Covid-19. As with diagnostic testing, it is one thing to have equipment or supplies but it is another thing altogether to implement a program. You can't just declare, \"we have a vaccine! Come and get it!\" and hope things work out.The basics are simple: To implement a program, you need an implementation plan. Then you need people to turn that plan into a manageable the day-to-day program. And this must be national, not local. Then, there are countless issues that must be resolved before any Covid-19 vaccine arrives from the UK, including: Who will receive the vaccine first? Young people? Old? Critical workers? And who will decide?Where will the vaccinations be given? Clinics? Hospitals? Military sites? Who will administer the vaccines? Doctors? Pharmacists? Nurses? Will they be certified? Are they indemnified if they cause injury?Who will clean the exam room after the vaccine is given? Will it need a Covid-19 level deep scrub?How many vaccines will be given a day? How many per hour? Will AstraZeneca, which partnered with Oxford to develop the vaccine, be protected from liability? Will medical insurers be asked to pay for medical illnesses related to an unapproved vaccine? In the Ford era rollout of the swine flu vaccine, these were particularly difficult issues. Who should the vaccinated 80-year old grandmother call the next day when she has a headache and fever? The local doctor's office? A national 800 number? Who will gather information on safety? The current federal Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) is voluntary and no other national system exists. Who will review this information and determine if fever and headache are indeed vaccine-related or from another cause?Will the patient be asked to pay for the vaccine? Will there be a fee to use the facility and a fee to the person giving the vaccine? This was another area of debate for President Ford. Given the expedited timeline, will people be properly tracked -- as they would be in a phase 3 clinical trial -- so we can see if, in fact, the vaccine actually works? The administration is likely asking these questions. We know that the White House is aware of the safety concerns, or at least was a few weeks ago when the Russian Sputnik V vaccine became the first registered Covid-19 vaccine in the world. Russia has not released full, or even much, data on this vaccine. Then, White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany stated that \"Our vaccines [in the US] go through rigorous phase three clinical trial, where we have 30,000 individuals that we test to make sure it's perfectly healthy in moving forward. So that's the kind of standard we have for American vaccines, and it's important that we do that.\" We have to trust that a lot of work has been done behind the scenes to prepare for a widespread vaccination with a novel or series of novel agents. But even with lots of planning, this is a very large task.I was involved in the smallpox vaccine program in 2002 as a member of the national Smallpox Vaccine Safety team. Our role was to help assure that the national roll-out of smallpox vaccine, planned for millions of people, including (mostly young and healthy) military and healthcare workers, was safe and that each potential serious side effect was carefully scrutinized. Before the first vaccine was administered, we spent months on conference calls thinking about how to efficiently, fairly and decisively perform the task. And then once people were vaccinated, we spent more months reviewing clinical events. A safe rollout of a Covid-19 vaccination is possible if a similar approach is followed. I am sure that US public health professionals are right now at work on this task. But the group must be given the time, data and independence to work together in the public interest. As importantly, they must not be derided by politicians as wimps and bureaucrats, logjam-makers, stallers, nervous Nellies, maybe even card carrying Deep Staters who are unwilling to push America forward -- either for political reasons or because they aren't fit for the task. The stakes are extremely high: without time, data and independence, the US Covid-19 vaccine program will become the latest in a string catastrophic string of Covid-19 failures that have led to unnecessary disease and death.",

    "Opinion: Telling young people to stay inside during a pandemic is like telling them to abstain from sex. Here are some better ideas": {

The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely her own. View more opinion articles on CNN.\n\n(CNN)Covid-19 numbers are bad and getting worse. At the time of writing, there have been over 20.5 million cases and nearly 750,000 deaths worldwide. In the United States alone there are over 5 million cases, and the pandemic has now claimed more lives than those lost in the nearly two decades of the Vietnam War.\n\nYet I continue to see headlines like \"Young Americans Partying Hard and Spreading Covid-19 Quickly,\" \"Parents cooperating with health officials after New Jersey teen party leads to Covid-19 cluster\" and \"300 teens exposed to COVID-19 at big party near Austin.\" As I am writing this, there are throngs of people at my apartment building's pool -- no masks and no physical distancing.This wasn't supposed to happen. I'm a 20-something myself, and during the early days of the pandemic I wrote an open letter to my generation explaining why they should be staying away from crowded beaches and staying home. I cited reliable facts and figures about the pandemic and, pointing to Italy, warned of the consequences of not taking it seriously. After it was picked up by CNN, my letter reached a national audience. In the face of conflicting public health advice, I hoped that highlighting the data itself would change hearts and minds. Read MoreFive months later, it is clear that neither my piece nor the many Covid-19 public health dashboards have persuaded many of my peers. I'm struggling to understand why. This is not just wounded pride. Young people between 20 and 40 are a significant portion of the growing number of cases, and many more may be contagious even if they don't show any symptoms. If we want to stop the virus and re-open our schools, shops and restaurants, we need to get young people on board with masks and social distancing. Why aren't facts enough to do this? I don't have definitive answers. But with five months to ponder it, I have some ideas.First, public health campaigns that promote total elimination of risk don't work well -- especially for young people. Think about abstinence-only sex education. It's been proven to be ineffective. But it's also associated with worse outcomes because it deprives kids of opportunities to understand how to reduce risks if they do choose to have sex. Similarly, simply bombarding young people with #StayHome memes likely won't eliminate risky behavior. In fact, a 30-year-old man who thought Covid-19 was a hoax recently died after attending a \"Covid party\" in Texas. Clearly, some young people are not getting good information on mitigating risk. We're actually in a worse position than those teaching abstinence-only sex education, because unlike the risk of STDs or teen pregnancy, the risk of Covid-19 was unknown just a few months ago. The pandemic has progressed with speed and -- given the mixed messaging from public officials -- chaos. It's no surprise that when we tell young people they can either stay at home or risk serious danger by leaving the house, they choose to leave the house.Secondly, peer pressure during quarantine is enormous. I feel it daily. How can so many people be posting about their trip to the lake, dinners at fancy restaurants and \"darties\" -- daytime parties -- while I sit at home? Lastly, young people have always had a strong sense of invincibility. Gary L. Wenk, a psychology and neuroscience professor at Ohio State University, reports that feelings of immortality hinge on the fact that their frontal lobes are not fully developed, or myelinated. This process is completed between the ages of 25 and 30.People see more of their mortality as they age -- young people simply aren't primed for death. And during a pandemic, that's a problem. So how can we apply these ideas to change behavior? One idea is to focus on a harm reduction model, which has successfully reduced teen pregnancies and substance abuse. Rather than an abstinence-only approach to the pandemic -- never leave the house, always wear a mask, stay 6 feet away from others -- we can recognize that some people, especially younger ones, are going to take risks whether we like it or not. Instead of telling them to \"STAY HOME FOREVER,\" we can help young people understand what activities are safer -- biking with a few friends, hiking, getting take-out food -- versus what are more dangerous: house parties with lots of people and swimming in crowded public pools. We can also try to turn peer pressure into a force for good. Studies show that peer influence can be a powerful tool in decreasing risky behavior among youth. For example, students with friends who use substances are more likely to increase their use. Conversely, after they participated in a peer-led substance abuse program, they reduced their use. Instead of shaming young people for following the crowd, we can encourage them to create an environment in which putting themselves at risk of Covid-19 is against the norm. Some are already doing this. Just look at these TikToks of family quarantine hijinks -- including both young and old alike -- and Instagram posts of #quarantinecooking homemade meals (yum). Lastly, research on invincibility shows that we can make the risks of Covid-19 real by sharing fewer statistics and long-term consequences and showing more immediate, personal stories. We can start with the last words the 30-year-old man who attended the \"Covid party\" reportedly told his nurse: \"I think I made a mistake. I thought this was a hoax, but it's not.\" The last five months notwithstanding, I continue to believe that the more people understand about Covid-19, the more lives will be saved. And I continue to hope that through reaching young people (who are often trendsetters), we will be able to also influence the wider population and not just flatten the curve but crush it.",

    "Opinion: The magic virus hypothesis": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "Dr. Stephen Kessler is a physician in Phoenix, Arizona. He and his wife wrote an open letter to Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey regarding the reopening of schools that received coverage by CNN, NPR, and The Arizona Republic. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his. View more opinion articles on CNN.\n\n(CNN)Sometime in the spring of 2020, an intriguing idea started circulating in epidemiologic circles. As the early literature started trickling in regarding the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 by children, some prominent academics began espousing what can fairly be referred to as the \"Magic Virus Hypothesis.\"\n\nThe thinking went something like this: In addition to children generally having very mild disease with Covid-19, they were also very unlikely to spread the virus.This was an astonishing hypothesis because it ran contrary to everything we know about the transmission of traditional respiratory viruses, such as influenza and the common cold, which, of course, is often caused by a type of coronavirus. With these traditional viruses, children are recognized as significant drivers of transmission.The radical nature of the hypothesis should have resulted in a pause for serious reflection by responsible scientists and physicians. Instead, it was quickly seized upon and amplified by highly respected medical journals.On May 5, the normally staid British Medical Journal (BMJ) published an editorial titled \"Children are not Covid-19 super spreaders: time to go back to school.\" The official journal of the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) quickly followed suit with a similar commentary, \"Covid-19 Transmission and Children: The Child is Not to Blame.\" Both advocated for the reopening of schools, with the editorial from the BMJ going so far as to argue that, \"Governments worldwide should allow all children back to school regardless of comorbidities.\"Read MoreNever mind the paucity of the available research at the time, nor the fact that the few existing studies had serious deficiencies in their methodology. Not to mention the presence of conflicting evidence.The magic virus evangelists marched on.On June 25, the AAP issued a statement in which they forcefully advocated for the reopening of schools. They noted that, \"Although children and adolescents play a major role in amplifying influenza outbreaks, to date, this does not appear to be the case with SARS-CoV-2...children may be less likely to become infected and to spread infection.\" Phrases like \"does not appear\" and \"may be less likely\" were technically accurate but dangerously cavalier. It is reckless to rely on a handful of small, inconclusive epidemiologic studies to overturn the acquired knowledge of a century of research on virology.Politicians bent on reopening schools seized on these recommendations, culminating in Secretary of Education Betsy Devos' claim on July 15 that \"more and more studies show that kids are actually stoppers of the disease and they don't get it and transmit it themselves.\" Devos received widespread criticism for her remarks, but, in essence, her comments were merely a rearticulation of those of the AAP without the qualifiers.In mid-July, researchers in South Korea published what is perhaps the largest and most well-designed study to date on the transmission of Covid-19 by children. They found that children aged 10-19 do, in fact, spread Covid-19 just as effectively as adults, with children younger than 10 contributing to a lesser degree.This was quickly followed by research demonstrating significant peer-to-peer spread among pediatric populations in Israel and Georgia.What effect did this new research have on the magic virus evangelists? They merely adjusted the magic virus age demographic downward to accommodate the latest findings.This included the AAP, who, as of August 21, amended their initial statement to read, \"Children younger than 10 years may be...less likely to spread infection.\"What caused the initial embrace of the radical idea that children under 18 do not contribute to the spread of Covid-19, as well as its equally radical revision? I don't have the answer, but my guess is that it is a combination of things.First, society is rightfully eager for children to return to school -- possibly causing undue optimism to ensue from a handful of early, deeply flawed studies.But equally to blame is a lack of intellectual rigor in examining the methodologies of the existing research on the spread of Covid-19 by children. Any physician or scientist can tell you that the strength of the conclusions that can be drawn from a piece of research rely firmly on the methodology of the study. And the existing research has plenty of flaws.Put differently: Why might studies find lower transmission of SARS-CoV-2 by children if the transmission rate were in fact the same as that by adults? In general, the reason lies in the fact that children with Covid-19 often have very mild symptoms, if they have any symptoms at all. As a result, they are much less likely to be tested during the acute phase of the virus, when they are most likely to test positive. And if they were to pass the virus on to their parents or other adults in the household, their nasal passages may be clear of viral RNA by the time they are tested, in which case the virus may be presumed to originate from an adult host.Couple this with the fact that pediatric testing is incredibly difficult to come by in many communities, and it is easy to see why it is challenging to get an accurate accounting of the amount of Covid-19 infection in children, as well as its spread.Of course, it may turn out that SARS-CoV-2 is indeed a magic virus, in which transmission by children is exceedingly rare. If that happens, no one would be more delighted than I. But currently, there is no one alive who can declare that with any certainty. Not the experts at the Centers for Disease Control, nor the World Health Organization. Not even Dr. Anthony Fauci himself.And that is exactly the point.If you are going to argue that a novel respiratory virus is transmitted in a radical new way, the bar to making that claim should be formidable.It has been shown that young children harbor similar or higher viral loads of SARS-CoV-2 in their upper airways as those found in older children and adults. Given this, as well as our acquired knowledge of the transmission of other respiratory viruses, the default assumption must be that children are equally as infectious as adults. The responsibility of the researcher is to prove that hypothesis wrong, not vice versa.To argue otherwise is potentially dangerous. Especially when those arguments are being used by policy makers to guide the reopening of schools and other children's activities.With that being said, here's hoping the magic virus hypothesis holds.",

Read more opinion articles at CNN.\n\n(CNN)For many of the nearly 28 million Americans without health insurance, complying with the CDC guidelines to stay home and in touch with a doctor when Covid-19 symptoms are present is an impossibility.\n\nAs acting director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) during the H1N1 pandemic in 2009, I learned that the agency's guidelines were only as effective as the public's ability to follow them. Today, millions of Americans lack the means to do so because of housing and economic insecurity, a lack of sick leave or family medical leave, or no transportation to drive to a clinic or testing site. But the inability of many people to afford health insurance -- particularly people of color or those in low-wage jobs -- is one of our nation's clearest vulnerabilities during this pandemic. There will be a reckoning and a reassessment of American priorities after the pandemic recedes. When this happens, lawmakers must have the vision and courage to look beyond the political wreckage of past health care battles and consider how to build a better system. There are many means to a better end, but the path forward must include both increased eligibility for subsidized coverage and cost containment measures. We should look to build on the promise of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) to extend coverage and fill the gaps that still exist. The coronavirus has exposed this nation in many ways, and we must find the will to address the inequitable, incoherent and inefficient health insurance system that plagues us today.Our employer-based system -- formed almost as an accident of history after World War II -- has become increasingly ill-suited for our times. Costs are too high, as is the number of uninsured, and the system is complex, unwieldy and ailing. Despite the 2010 coverage expansion of the ACA that has become a lifeline for millions, a population near that of Texas is still uninsured, and this could grow by millions as a result of the current economic dislocation. It is hard to find anyone who defends this status quo.The unreliable link between jobs and coverage, combined with ideologically driven state variations on whether to expand Medicaid, results in a country where access to health care depends on where you live and work. This sad truth is not new, but it has been put on display during a pandemic that has served as both an illustration and an accelerant of the unequal opportunities and systemic barriers that leave Black, Hispanic and Native Americans exposed and disproportionately vulnerable.Read MoreAt a time when health care needs are swelling alongside federal and state deficits, a moral and fiscal case can be made for dramatic structural change. The moral case is implicit, as any society that purports to value its people -- all of its people -- cannot be satisfied with a status quo that leaves tens of millions of people exposed and uncared for as Covid-19 rages on, with both physical and mental health needs growing by the day. The fiscal case has perhaps never been more evident than it is today, as health care costs unrelated to the pandemic are straining workers, businesses and taxpayers amid a historic economic downturn. People with employer-sponsored insurance are considered the lucky ones. However, a closer look reveals a different truth: higher premiums devour ever-larger portions of take-home pay, and copays and prescription drug costs chip away at the remainder. According to research from the Kaiser Family Foundation, the average premium paid by workers for family coverage has increased 71% over the past decade, while the average deductible has increased 162%. Not surprisingly, many Americans are deeply worried about paying for their health care in the months ahead. For countless small businesses, devastated by the pandemic, annual plan renewals have likely become a grueling exercise to see whether the math will work. In some states, employer-sponsored insurance pays health care providers rates that are as much as 300% higher than those paid by the Medicare program -- a reality that has led more small businesses to end employer-sponsored plans altogether. Pharmaceutical companies have been driving costs higher, health systems dictate prices, and employers -- unlike the government -- have little power to effectively negotiate. The federal tax incentive for businesses dulls the pain of exorbitant costs, a fiscal illusion that helps obscure the need for change.Though I now run the nation's largest philanthropy focused solely on health, I don't have the hubris to suggest that I or our foundation can provide the single answer to solve America's health insurance challenges. But the evidence clearly demands a new path toward a better system that will give every person access to affordable, high quality, comprehensive health care. Doing so could save suffering, lives and our scarce dollars. The CDC, an agency I called home for 13 years, is uniquely equipped to provide sound, science-based guidance for our nation during this public health emergency. But if millions of people can't follow this advice or have their basic medical needs met, we will all continue to pay the price during this pandemic and for however long we tolerate this broken and unjust system.",

        "body": "This medical worker used to be a 'hero.' Now he feels hated\n\nOpinion by Thomas Lake\n\nUpdated 1004 GMT (1804 HKT) September 4, 2020\n\nIn a series of essays called The Distance, Thomas Lake is telling the stories of Americans in the pandemic. Email thomas.lake@cnn.com if you have a story idea.\n\n(CNN)I remember how it felt in March, as the shadow began to fall. Empty shelves at the grocery stores. Sirens wailing in New York. And with the dread came a fleeting glimpse of national unity. We cheered from the balconies as the nurses changed their shifts. In Irvine, California, a medical worker saw a message in chalk from neighbor children: \"Thank you so much for what you do.\" Someone put a sign outside his apartment. It said, \"A hero lives here.\"\n\nThat was five or six months ago, or perhaps another lifetime. When I talked to Parsia Jahanbani in mid-August, the warmth and goodwill were gone.\"Last week,\" he said, \"I had somebody flip me off.\"Parsia works at Families Together of Orange County, a non-profit that provides medical and dental care to the underprivileged. He's an expanded-function dental assistant -- basically a dental nurse practitioner -- and he drives a giant bus called a mobile medical unit to various homeless shelters. His organization lost about one-third of its staff early in the pandemic to furloughs, resignations and other factors. The pandemic makes dental work especially dangerous.One morning, as colleagues departed, Parsia saw his 80-year-old father, the dental director, sitting behind his desk.Read More\"And I go to talk to him, 'I'm like, 'Why aren't you going home?' He's like, 'This is my ship. I'm the captain...I can't go home.' Like, 'You're 80. You're at risk. You -- if you get sick, this is it. Do you understand that?' And he starts crying.\"His father reluctantly went home, leaving Parsia to face his own dilemma at age 36. He has a rare and mysterious neurological condition called cluster headaches. These sporadic headaches come with seizures, and they've put him in the hospital several times. His treatment for the intermittent symptoms include immunosuppressive drugs that could increase his vulnerability to the coronavirus.More than 30 million Americans have lost their jobs this year. Millions more, including Parsia, have been forced to answer a horrifying question: Do I want or need my job so much that I'll keep doing it even if it might kill me?Parsia could recall a moment from a few years earlier, when his seizures were incapacitating. He says he made a deal with God: \"Give me the health to do this and I promise to serve.\" And so, when the coronavirus question posed itself, Parsia answered yes.Now he wouldn't just do dental work. He'd be the one giving coronavirus tests. Sweating in his face shield and goggles and mask and full-body Tyvek suit, jamming swabs into the throats of strangers who coughed and sneezed all over him.\"We knew that we were risking our lives going back to work,\" he said. \"But I remember one day we showed up to the Salvation Army's emergency shelter and a group of our patients that are homeless, they were on a lockdown. They couldn't leave the shelter...And as I'm pulling up in the parking lot, I see five or six people standing behind the chain-link fence. And one of them was holding a pizza box. As we get closer, he kind of opens the lid of the pizza box. And on the top part of it, on the lid part of it, he had written, 'Thank you.' And the bottom part was, 'Our medical workers.' And he opened the box and kind of showed me the sign and the other four kind of clapped for us. And as I'm driving, I started crying. I started bawling. I couldn't hold it back. And I turned around and told the doctor, you know, 'This is why we're here.'\"April, May, June. President Donald Trump encouraged armed protesters to rebel against mandatory shutdowns in Michigan. George Floyd was killed in Minneapolis. More than 1,000 health professionals signed a letter supporting the mass demonstrations that followed, leaving some Americans confused about which gatherings were safe. The coronavirus death toll surpassed 50,000; 100,000, 150,000. Across the political spectrum, people were some combination of sad, angry, tired, bored, sick of this whole nightmare of a decade of a year. National unity? A distant memory. Parsia kept working, although no one called him a hero anymore. Among the patients who had to get tested for work, some called the pandemic a hoax. One called Parsia a communist.\"He pulled up with his car through the drive-through testing,\" Parsia told me. \"I'm like, 'You are in the testing facility. You came to me. I didn't, like, force you to come get tested. And moreover, I -- if you don't believe in the virus and everything, then why are you getting tested?...You need to wear a mask. You need to follow the instructions.' The moment that we go to pull the swab to his face, here we go again. 'What the f**k are you doing?...Is there something on the swab? Where are you getting the swabs from? Go grab a new one. Open it in front of me. Want to make sure that you're not putting anything in my body.'\"Some of the anger was justified. Test kits piled up at the lab. Some patients waited a month for results, which meant the tests were useless. If they were sick, they'd been spreading it for weeks by the time they knew. Parsia was exhausted, dehydrated, sweating in the suit for 12 hours a day. One day in August he collapsed and had to go to the hospital. Back at home, he lay awake in bed with his mind racing. He worried about infecting his wife, her parents. He thought about dying. He wrote out his will.And as he summoned the resolve to put on the Tyvek suit, Parsia thought of his father, Safaeddin Jahanbani. The captain of the ship. He'd been told to go home for his own safety at the start of the pandemic. Here's what happened next.\"Every morning he would get up, shower, shave, put on his tie, and just sit by the dining table waiting for a call for him to go back to work,\" Parsia told me. \"He wanted so bad to be a part of this and help in some way...He stayed home less than a month. Towards the end of it, he was telling me, like, 'If I don't work for much longer, you know, then I'm gonna die.' Right. Like, 'No, you're not, Dad. Come on.' Like, 'No, it's this, having a purpose in life that's keeping me going.' And I understood that. 'Cause even at 36, I feel the same...He says that's the oath that he took as a doctor, to serve, to protect. To be there for patients. Because he's like, 'Till my last breath, I'm going to be there. I'm going to see patients. I'm going to help people.'\"And so they both went to work. I spoke with the father, Dr. Jahanbani, and he confirmed what his son told me. The signs didn't matter to him. Only the mission did.\"This is not something to boast about, or to feel heroic,\" he said. \"We do it very humbly.\"He said other workers deserved appreciation: airline pilots, cashiers in grocery stores, anyone clearing tables in restaurants. And he's right. I think of them often. All these people risking everything on a Monday morning or a Thursday night.Firefighters and meatpacking workers. Janitors, bus drivers, schoolteachers. A courageous multitude in a fracturing nation, holding us all together.",

According to Coombs, 116 students that have been considered in \"close contact\" of a positive case have been sent home to quarantine for 14 days. The student population in the district is 2700. The Corinth School District told parents in a letter posted on Facebook Wednesday that an individual from Corinth Middle School tested positive as well as an employee at Corinth Elementary School. The letter said the school has done contact tracing and is asking anyone who had contact with the individuals to quarantine for 14 days. While in quarantine, children cannot attend school or any activities, the letter said.Read MoreIn-person classes resumed in the district on July 27, according to the school calendar. The disclosures came as parents and teachers across the US debate whether to return to the classroom, and whether to wear masks, socially distance, or try and make the 2020-2021 school year look like any other. While most schools are yet to return -- New York is looking at the first week in September -- some have already welcomed students back. Corinth parents were able to choose for their child to return to the traditional attendance schedule or do virtual learning, and students can only enter or exit the virtual learning model at the end of a nine-week period, according to the district.Students and staff are screened daily upon entering the building with temperature checks, according to the district's reopening plan, and staff has to answer questions daily about if they have had symptoms in the past few days.Guidance from the district says that all staff, parents and volunteers must wear a face covering in the school buildings, while teachers must wear a face covering in all common areas and during all student interactions.Masks are now mandatory in schoolMississippi Governor Tate Reeves issued a mandatory mask mandate for the state which went into effect Wednesday.After a summer surge, the state with a relatively low population now has the fifth-highest recorded case count per 100,000 people, behind only Louisiana, Arizona, Florida and New York.It also has the nation's highest test positivity rate, at a weekly average of 25.8% as of Wednesday, according to Johns Hopkins University and the Covid Tracking Project.\"I believe that there is enough motivation (now) to safely get our kids in school that we can really juice the participation of mask wearing throughout our state for the next two weeks,\" Gov. Tate Reeves said in announcing the new measures, acknowledging the earlier \"piecemeal approach.\"\n\nCNN's Jason Hanna contributed to this story.",

Her symptoms were mild enough to avoid hospitalization, he said.\n\n\"We were able to genetically sequence the virus in the two cases,\" Van Ranst said in a television interview on Monday night. \"And there is indeed enough difference to be able to say that this is another strain, a second infection.\"\n\n\"Good news, it is not,\" he said. \"Because you hope of course that when you're infected, that you're then out of the danger zone for a long while. And hopefully that is so in most cases. At the very least, there appear now to be exceptions.\"\n\nMeanwhile, a patient was infected twice in the Netherlands, virologist Marion Koopmans told NOS, the Dutch national broadcaster.\n\nKoopmans said it was an \"older patient with a compromised immune system,\" according to NOS. Koopmans confirmed to NOS that the RNA profiles of the two viruses that infected this patient differed.\n\nThe news comes after a 33-year-old man living in Hong Kong was reported to have had Covid-19 twice this year, according to preliminary research.\n\nThe pre-print study -- which the University of Hong Kong said on Monday has been accepted to publish in the journal Clinical Infectious Diseases -- found that the man's second case of Covid-19 occurred 142 days after the first.\n\nThe study also noted that in the first case, the man showed symptoms but in the second case he was asymptomatic, in that he did not show any noticeable symptoms.\n\nThe genetic analysis showed that the first infection was from a strain of the coronavirus most closely related to strains from the US or England, which were collected in the spring, and the second was most closely related to strains from Switzerland and England, which were collected in July and August.\n\n\"This case illustrates that re-infection can occur even just after a few months of recovery from the first infection. Our findings suggest that SARS-CoV-2 may persist in humans as is the case for other common-cold associated human coronaviruses, even if patients have acquired immunity via natural infection or via vaccination,\" the researchers wrote in their study.\n\nThe researchers called this the \"first case\" of re-infection of Covid-19 in their paper, but other experts are calling for more research before naming this case truly the world's first.",

Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds.\n\n(CNN)While commercial labs across the country have pushed hard this year to scale up their coronavirus testing capacity, the number of tests they conduct each week has fallen over the last month.\n\nSome of those major labs now report unused capacity, and one of the largest diagnostic companies has recently only been using about half of its total testing capabilities.Though the dip in testing overlaps with an overall decrease in the rate of new coronavirus cases, some public health experts continue to say the US should do more testing to effectively trace the virus' spread. Quest Diagnostics' figures show the company performed an average of about 86,000 tests per day over the last week, though its labs now have capacity to conduct about 165,000 tests per day. \"We continue to intend to scale up our capacity to 185,000 tests a day by Labor Day with further gains possible after that,\" Quest said in a statement. Read MoreLabCorp can run 200,000 tests per day but the company said in a statement that \"volumes received are currently below that number.\"Data from the American Clinical Laboratory Association, whose members include LabCorp, Quest and other commercial labs, show that weekly tests performed by ACLA labs have dropped from about 2.8 million the week ending July 26 to about 2.1 million the week ending August 23 -- about a 25% decrease. ACLA labs on Monday performed about 180,000 tests, the lowest number since early June.Tracking Covid-19 cases in the USACLA President Julie Khani said in a statement that demand for testing fluctuates but labs across the country are still developing new tests and methods \"to make sure that our capacity can be utilized where it is most needed.\"'A dramatic decrease'The decline among commercial labs' testing in part reflects downward trends in national coronavirus testing. The average of new tests was about 706,000 for each day in August, whereas the daily average was about 744,000 in July, according to data from the COVID Tracking Project. Some public health experts describe the trend as alarming. \"You've got a clear need for more testing and yet a dramatic decrease,\" said Dr. Jonathan Quick, who directs the pandemic response for the Rockefeller Foundation, which has said the US should expand capacity to be able to perform 30 million tests per week by October. Quick said that a decrease could in part be driven by some people deciding not to get tested due to long wait times for results in preceding weeks, among other factors, but he added, \"I see the pattern and some of it from a public health point of view just doesn't make any sense.\"Dr. William Morice, president of Mayo Clinic Laboratories, said that while his company's labs have most days been running at close to capacity, he believes there are multiple causes for the national dip in testing. He cited the decline in the daily rate of new infections this month as one reason. \"Clearly, when there is a drop in cases, there is going to be a drop in demand for testing,\" Morice said. He also said changes in the rates of infection can have exponential effects on testing.\"As the community rate of infection starts to go down, not only do the number of people who are symptomatic and therefore need testing go down, but the number of their contacts that need testing goes down as well.\"Change in guidelinesThe unused testing capacity at some labs comes as the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has changed its Covid-19 testing guidelines. The agency no longer recommends testing for some people without symptoms, even if they've been in close contact with an infected person. Although a reduction in testing could result in fewer infections detected, Dr. Ferric Fang, a University of Washington professor of laboratory medicine, said that a national decline in hospitalizations indicates that the number of new infections is truly falling. He attributes this to the effectiveness of social distancing, mask wearing and other preventative measures in states with recent surges. \"With fewer people presenting with symptoms suggestive of infection, there will be a reduced demand for testing and fewer tests performed. That is a good thing,\" Fang said. But David Grenache, president of the American Association for Clinical Chemistry, described the decline in testing as \"unusual and inconsistent\" across the country. He called that decline, \"concerning given the importance of testing during a pandemic.\"",

        "body": "Chat with us in Facebook Messenger. Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds.\n\n(CNN)In early February, my partner and I discovered that I was pregnant.\n\nLooking back, that feels like one of the last big milestones of the Before Times -- a wonderfully blissful and uncomplicated period. I'd skimmed a few headlines about a scary-sounding disease called Covid-19 but didn't worry too much about it. The virus seemed so far away on the other side of the globe. My biggest concern was adjusting to the idea of carrying a child.Our first ultrasound was scheduled for March 3. At eight weeks, our baby didn't yet look like a baby. According to the pregnancy website we consulted each week, she was only as big as a raspberry. Still, she had a heartbeat -- and when we heard it, my partner, Billy, excitedly grabbed my hand. We laughed in surprise and flashed giant smiles at the ultrasound technician, who grinned back at us. Read MoreThat was our last prenatal appointment of the Before Times. On March 11, Covid-19 was declared a pandemic. At every clinic visit since that declaration, I've been greeted at the front door by a staffer who asks a series of questions about any potential contact with the virus and symptoms I might be experiencing. Billy is no longer allowed to attend appointments with me. Like everyone else at the doctor's office, I wear a mask. Now when I hear our daughter's heartbeat, there's no one to grab my hand. My smile stays hidden behind the fabric that covers my face.Prenatal appointments aren't the only thing that's different about what I imagined pregnancy would be like. Billy and I won't have a traditional baby shower, take a \"babymoon\" trip or enjoy any last hurrahs on the town with our childless friends. I haven't been able to attend in-person birth classes or visit friends who have recently welcomed their own babies to the world. I don't get to hold another infant and take notes ahead of time about how to wrap a proper swaddle or change a diaper like a pro.Instead, Billy and I are learning what we can from the safety of our home. We've read articles and books, signed up for online courses and accepted advice from friends. There's a stack of parenting and pregnancy books in the room that will soon be our daughter's nursery. The ubiquitous \"What to Expect When You're Expecting,\" is among the paperbacks. Funny enough, there's no chapter on what to expect when you're expecting in a pandemic.Like so many of us, Dr. Lucy J. Puryear has had to adjust how she works in the pandemic. Puryear, a psychiatrist specializing in the emotional health of pregnant women and new mothers, and author of \"Understanding Your Moods When You're Expecting,\" now sees all of her patients virtually. She has to help new parents readjust expectations around what their postpartum support systems might look like. And, more than ever, she has to take her own advice.\"I tell patients to try not to get overwhelmed with when this is going to end,\" Puryear said. \"Look at a week at a time -- that's about the best we can do at the moment. Focus on what doctor's appointments you have, what's going on with your body, things like that that are tangible.\"\"Pregnancy, even without a pandemic, is a time of unknowns and uncertainties,\" added Puryear. \"The fear of the virus has heightened that.\" She's seen many pregnant mothers who have concerns about their own health and safety, and the health and safety of their unborn children. \"They're also dealing with immediate fears about things like whether their partners will be allowed in the hospital or whether they'll be giving birth alone,\" she said.I worry about these things, too. At this point, my midwife tells me that Billy will be allowed in the hospital -- but we won't be able to tour it in person beforehand. I worry about what it will be like to be in a medical setting for so long, and how many precautions we'll have to take to protect ourselves.That's not to say that everything is terrible. I've found some surprising silver linings to being pregnant during a global pandemic. I get to spend more time at home, and I don't have to worry about unwanted comments or belly touches from strangers. Billy and I have enjoyed more time to nest and more opportunities to focus on becoming parents.There are also plenty of things that aren't that different. In a very clich\u00e9d move, I've been craving pickles and ice cream. People still get excited to see the baby bump -- even if it is over video calls. And I've already had to tell my mom to stop buying too many tiny clothes for her first grandchild.Puryear pointed to another benefit of having a baby during this time: So many people working at home has resulted in a more equitable split of parenting duties. \"Many dads or partners are getting to spend more time with the baby than they would otherwise,\" she said. \"Lately, we're seeing more sharing of responsibilities than we would have normally, when only one parent was on traditional maternity leave.\"Every other week or so, I meet with a group of other new-moms-to-be via Zoom. A mutual friend had the smart idea of connecting all of us. We're scattered across the country but share the unique experience of being pregnant during such a surreal time. We talk about \"normal\" pregnancy topics, like the baby kicks and discomfort we're each feeling, and we also discuss the various bits of Covid-related information and advice we've gleaned from our doctors and the internet. Lately, we've spent a lot of time comparing our plans for allowing (or not allowing) family members to visit after birth. Billy and I are still figuring out the logistics of it all.The pandemic, Puryear said, has provided a useful metaphor for parenting. \"This is a really good way to learn that you have to let go of your sense of control,\" she said. \"That's going to be true for the rest of your life as a parent. You do the best you can, with the information you have.\"I'm due in mid-October. Based on the spread of cases, especially in Florida, where I live, I fully anticipate that the virus will still greatly affect daily life by then. Just as my pregnancy hasn't lined up with expectations, I doubt that giving birth will be like I imagined it to be either. I don't know exactly what I envisioned, but it didn't involve laboring through contractions while wearing a mask.Still, as long as I can give birth to my daughter safely, I'm good. \"The best piece of advice I have is to take this all a day at a time and a week at a time,\" said Puryear. \"It's OK to have wishes and desires about how your pregnancy should go, but at the end of the day all you want is a healthy baby. No matter how that happens, it's what matters most.\"The exciting thing about babies is that everything is brand new for them. This time, it's brand new for all of us. The world may not look like I imagined it would, but our little family will figure out how to navigate it together.\n\nKatie Hawkins-Gaar is a writer and journalism consultant based in St. Petersburg, Florida.

        "body": "(CNN)As US leaders work to control the spread of coronavirus, researchers across the globe are working to answer the mysteries that remain around infections.\n\nOne of those mysteries: why the experience can be so different from person to person. One expert says the answer may involve looking at previous vaccines individuals have had. \"When we looked in the setting of Covid disease, we found that people who had prior vaccinations with a variety of vaccines -- for pneumococcus, influenza, hepatitis and others -- appeared to have a lower risk of getting Covid disease,\" Dr. Andrew Badley, an infectious disease specialist at Mayo Clinic, told CNN's Anderson Cooper on Monday night. It's what immunologists call immune training: how your immune system creates an effective response to fight off infections, Badley says.\"A good analogy is to think of your immune system as being a muscle,\" he said. \"The more you exercise that muscle, the stronger it will be when you need it.\" Read MoreThere's been no definitive evidence of any other vaccines boosting immunity against Covid-19. But some researchers have suggested it's possible. In June, a team of researchers in the US proposed giving a booster dose of the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine to people to see if it helps prevent the most severe effects of coronavirus infections. And last month, researchers found that countries where many people have been given the tuberculosis vaccine Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) had less mortality from coronavirus, a finding that fits with other research suggesting the vaccine can boost people's immunity in general. But once you're infected, how much of the virus made it into your body could also have an impact on what your experience is, another expert told CNN on Monday. Dr. Monica Gandhi, an infectious disease specialist at University of California, San Francisco, has been working with a team of researchers to understand how more people could go through their infections with minimal or no symptoms. About 40% of people infected with the virus don't have symptoms, according to an estimate last month by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Gandhi's team found masks make a difference.\"What the mask does is really reduce the amount of virus that you get in, if you do get infected,\" she said. \"And by reducing that ... you have a lower dose, you're able to manage it, you're able to have a calm response and you have mild symptoms or no symptoms at all.\"Coronavirus: Your questions, answered'We have nothing to celebrate' about current case levels, physician saysSo far, more than 5 million Americans have tested positive for the virus and at least 164,000 have died, according to Johns Hopkins University data. The average number of daily new cases in the US is more than 54,000, down from more than 65,000 per day in mid- to late-July. Average daily Covid-19 deaths, however, have hovered above 1,000 for more than two weeks. The country had been below that level for seven consecutive weeks before that.\"We have nothing to celebrate (just) because we're going to 50,000 cases per day. We have a huge amount of morbidity and mortality at our feet right now and in the weeks ahead,\" Dr. Rochelle Walensky, chief of infectious diseases at Massachusetts General Hospital, said Tuesday.\"Even at 18,000 cases per day (as the US had) in mid-May, we were unable to really squelch this,\" Walensky said. These states require face masksStudy: Many Americans weren't infected because of distancing ordersUp to 80% of Americans would have been infected with Covid-19 had states not implemented physical distancing policies, according to a recently published modeling study.Researchers from Harvard University and University College London found that every state in the US passed at least one physical distancing measure in March to slow the spread of the pandemic.The policies resulted in the reduction of more than 600,000 cases within just three weeks, according to the study published Tuesday in the journal PLOS.\"The results show the timing of government-issued orders correlated strongly with reductions in both cases and deaths. In short, these measures work, and policy makers should use them as an arrow in their quivers to get on top of local epidemics where they are not responding to containment measures,\" said Dr. Mark J. Siedner, a co-author of the study from Harvard Medical School and an infectious diseases doctor at Massachusetts General Hospital.The death rate decreased by 2% per day beginning a week after a physical distancing policy started, the study says.Cases spiked in nursing homes due to community spread, group saysCovid-19 cases rose rapidly in US nursing homes in July after a steady decline in June -- signaling a serious risk to an especially vulnerable group of people, a health organization said Tuesday.The jump in nursing home cases was due to an overall jump in cases in the general population, and it should spur the US government to take steps to protect the homes, the American Health Care Association and National Center for Assisted Living said.\"We need public health officials to\u202ffocus on\u202freducing spread within the larger\u202fcommunity and prioritizing long term care for resources,\" including personal protective equipment, testing and staff support, Mark Parkinson, CEO of the AHCA/NCAL, wrote to CNN on Tuesday.New weekly Covid-19 cases in nursing homes dropped from 9,072 at the end of May to 5,468 by June 21 -- but then rose to 8,628 for the week of July 19, the last week for which data is available, the group said. The group cited data collected by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services.The report said this confirmed fears the group had: That cases would rise in nursing homes as they spiked in the wider community across the country from June to July. Older adults and people with certain underlying medical conditions increase the risk of severe illness, the CDC says.\n\nCNN's Jen Christensen, Andrea Kane, Jamiel Lynch and Jason Hanna contributed to this report.",

        "body": "Harare (CNN)After more than a month in prison, multiple court appearances, and fears of Covid-19 infection, prominent Zimbabwean journalist Hopewell Chin'ono was granted bail Wednesday.\n\nChin'ono is charged with inciting violence ahead of a planned anti-government protest -- a charge his lawyers deny. He is banned from social media and is not allowed to leave the capital Harare as part of his stringent bail conditions.The journalist was most recently working on allegations of corruption relating to the procurement of Covid-19 supplies by the health ministry, according to Amnesty International which accused the Zimbabwe government of using state's security forces to silence critics. Opposition leader Jacob Ngarivhume, who faces similar charges, was also granted bail. The duo were denied bail when first arrested on July 20 and transferred to the Chikurubi maximum security prison, notorious for holding political prisoners.Read MoreAccording to the Zimbabwe Lawyers for Human Rights (ZLHR), both men were strip-searched and bound in leg chains before being transferred. \"We are happy that they have been granted bail. But the bail conditions clearly curtail their constitutional rights,\" said Doug Coltart, a lawyer with ZLHR who is representing the two men. Coltart said they are awaiting Covid-19 tests for Chin'ono after he developed symptoms of the virus over the weekend at the prison. International condemnationZimbabweans have been staging solo protests on social media in recent weeks to challenge human rights abuse in the southern African country.They created a trending hashtag #ZimbabweanLivesMatter following mass arrests of protesters in July and the continuing crackdown on dissent by President Emmerson Mnangagwa's government. The hashtag has gained momentum with celebrities including rappers, AKA, Ice Cube, actresses Pearl Thusi, and Thandie Newton joining in to call for an end to the human rights abuses in the southern African country.Award winning author and filmmaker Tsitsi Dangarembga, who was arrested during the demonstrations, encouraged her followers to stage online solo protests and carry placards using the #ZimbabweanLivesMatter hashtag. The image also added that solo protesters should take pictures with the Zimbabwe flag and placard to post online for awareness.Some protesters covered their faces or submitted their photos to a trusted account to post on their behalf, out of fear of being targeted by the Zimbabwean government.Former President of Botswana, Ian Khama also joined the campaign. In a Facebook post, he called on his followers to pray for Zimbabweans as \"the situation is deteriorating every day\".Human rights abusesWhen Chin'ono was first denied bail, the United Nations High Commissioner called for an end to the \"pattern of intimidation\" seen in Zimbabwe, warning that authorities may be using the coronavirus pandemic as a pretext to \"clamp down\" on freedom of expression. \"We are concerned at allegations in Zimbabwe, which suggest that the authorities may be using the COVID-19 pandemic as a pretext to clamp down on freedom of expression and freedom of peaceful assembly and association,\" a spokesperson for High Commissioner Liz Throssell said in a statement at the end of July. \"The arrests of Hopewell Chin'ono and Jacob Ngarivhume are designed to intimidate and send a chilling message to journalists, whistleblowers and activists who draw attention to matters of public interest in Zimbabwe,\" said Deprose Muchena, Amnesty's director for east and southern Africa in a statement.Mnangagwa's government maintains that there is no human rights crisis in Zimbabwe. In early August, South African leader Cyril Ramaphosa - who is the current leader of the African Union - dispatched envoys to assess the situation in his neighboring country.Mnangagwa has responded to critics by promising to \"flush out bad apples\" trying to divide the country as pressure mounted on the government to stop human rights violations.\n\nCNN's Eoin McSweeney, Anita Patrick, and Sarah Dean contributed to this report",

        "body": "Chat with us in Facebook Messenger. Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds.\n\nWashington (CNN)An antibody treatment designed to protect against coronavirus could be available as early as this fall -- but only for a fraction of the millions of Americans who might benefit from the treatment.\n\nCompanies are already testing monoclonal antibody therapies -- antibodies created in a lab to target Covid-19 -- in humans. The trials are determining whether the antibodies can prevent people from becoming infected and whether the treatments can stave off the worst symptoms of coronavirus when a patient does become infected. There's no guarantee they will work. If they are proven effective, they could be available to Americans months before a vaccine is ready. But according to drug-makers, the initial distribution will most likely be left up to the federal government, whose shoddy track record on setting up widespread testing, distributing personal protective gear and dispensing other drugs such as remdesivir to fight coronavirus is already setting off alarms.\"This will be a test run for allocation of vaccines,\" said Rep. Bill Foster, an Illinois Democrat who has asked the Government Accountability Office for enhanced oversight, and regular updates, on the therapeutic manufacturing process. \"This scramble for monoclonal antibodies could happen two months from now or even earlier.\"Read MoreIt's not clear who will make the decisions about where the initial antibody doses go. And the Trump administration's record is littered with allegations of unfair distribution and political favoritism. Foster, a member of the House coronavirus subcommittee, imagines a potential nightmare scenario where \"poor people are dying in overcrowded hospitals because they can't get the adequate doses of the curative antibody therapeutics, while rich people are getting preventative doses by signing up for the week stay at the presidential suite at Mar-a-Lago,\" he said. \"There's really very little public trust of Jared Kushner and Donald Trump and the White House to make a fair allocation of emergency medical treatments.\" Drug-makers insist they're committed to making sure their products wind up with the patients who need them most. Government officials, meantime, say they're still working out their manufacturing and distribution plans. Enormous demand Drug-makers and policymakers alike envision enormous demand for antibody treatments. They could be a lifesaver in stopping the spread of coronavirus among staff and patients in nursing homes, which have seen devastating death rates. They could also limit the worst effects of the virus, before patients wind up on ventilators, and be used preventatively for frontline workers or even their family members if a worker is exposed to someone with coronavirus. But even in the best-case scenario -- even if such an antibody treatment proves effective -- there will likely be only a few hundred thousand doses initially available. The early supply is expected to fall far short of the tens of millions of Americans who could potentially benefit from the treatment. A study from researchers at Duke University determined the US would need more than 60 million doses of antibody therapies over the next year to treat every American hospitalized with coronavirus, fighting it at home or exposed to it by someone in their household. \"We won't have enough capacity to make enough of these. So, a vaccine ultimately has to be the broadest solution for the entire public,\" said Dr. Len Schleifer, the chief executive of Regeneron, one of the companies currently running human trials of monoclonal antibodies and one of the only companies with a US government contract for this type of therapy. \"We'll have to direct these antibodies where we can do the most good, assuming that they work.\"Under Operation Warp Speed, the public-private partnership working to produce vaccines, drugs and tests to fight coronavirus -- the federal government has begun stockpiling vaccines and related supplies. It has charged panels of scientists and medical experts with deciding which Americans should get inoculated first. But the federal government isn't buying up potential drugs in the same way it's pre-ordering vaccines, partly because it's harder to stock up on therapeutics when there are so many still being tested.\"Advanced purchasing of therapeutics is going to be slower,\" Dr. Janet Woodcock, a Food and Drug Administration official who leads therapeutics development for Operation Warp Speed, said in a recent media briefing. \"We have to select the most promising ones. We can't just buy advanced purchases of 600 different agents.\"US health experts have been particularly optimistic about the odds of monoclonal antibody treatments being effective, in part because the healthcare industry already uses such therapies to treat illnesses like HIV, asthma, Ebola and some types of cancer. \"If I had to pick one, I think the monoclonal antibody cocktails have a lot going for them because we know they worked for Ebola,\" National Institutes of Health Director Dr. Francis Collins told Congress last month. \"There's all kinds of reasons to think this is the kind of virus it should work for, too.\"Scientists studied early coronavirus patients to determine what kind of antibodies they produced to fight off the virus. Then, they mimicked those antibodies in a lab setting to create monoclonal treatments. The treatments aren't as long-lasting as vaccines and potentially wear off after a month or two. But they take effect quickly and are useful in temporarily protecting vulnerable populations or helping sick patients ward off the worst of the virus.'How do you allocate this?'Companies like Regeneron and Eli Lilly have already started ramping up production in the hopes their antibody treatments will prove effective. They're also conferring with others in the industry about pooling manufacturing resources if one or more treatments prove effective and are authorized by the government. But it's no small feat to scale up production and the federal government has not made the kind of investment in manufacturing capacity for drugs as it has for vaccines. \"Obviously we are trying to get as many doses available as possible for as many people,\" Woodcock said in a July briefing, noting that across the globe there's limited capacity to manufacture monoclonal antibody treatments. \"We have manufacturing experts in [Operation Warp Speed] who are really surveilling the whole field and seeing what we can do.\" Adding to the supply challenge: It's not clear what dose size will work best to fight the virus and what dose size will be effective in preventing infection. Sick patients trying to beat the disease will likely require a higher dosage than people trying to prevent infection. Regeneron believes it can potentially make tens of thousands of treatment doses per month or hundreds of thousands of preventative doses. Eli Lilly expects to produce roughly 100,000 doses this year. Where those doses go is a question that will most likely fall to the federal government. \"The big challenge at that point is going to be making sure that the drug is distributed thoughtfully and is used in the way we can make the best possible use of the limited supply,\" said Adam Kroetsch, a co-author of the Duke study estimating the need for tens of millions of doses. Marta Wosi\u0144ska, another co-author of the study at Duke, noted that institutions like hospitals would be tempted to snap up more of the drug than they need, just to ensure they won't run out. \"You really need somebody to kind of say what is really needed and how do you allocate this?\" Wosi\u0144ska said. \"Everybody has an incentive to just stockpile.\"Operation Warp Speed \"is focused on the development, manufacturing and distribution of FDA approved, safe and effective vaccines and therapeutics, not policy,\" Woodcock said in a written response to questions from CNN. \"The allocation of any COVID-19 countermeasure that is in short supply will be a policy decision made by subject matter experts who receive input from external parties including medical ethicists.\" Woodcock said the administration learned lessons from its distribution of remdesivir earlier this year, which left some hospitals with no doses and others with too many. \"Every effort will be made to assure maximum transparency,\" said Woodcock, who added that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Department of Defense are working on plans to distribute vaccines and therapeutics.While drug-makers aren't sure how the administration could allocate their products, executives insist they are committed to ensuring the distribution is fair and weighted toward the most vulnerable populations.\"I don't think we're going to have an auction market where people who can pay the most are going to get access to it,\" Regeneron's Schleifer said. Eli Lilly's Skovronsky said, \"we're committed to the equitable distribution of medicine. And that should not involve the patient's ability to pay, it should not involve their status in society or their political connections or anything like that. It should be determined solely on a medical need.\"Skovronsky said he hoped the administration had learned some lessons from its previous distribution fumbles.\"We've watched I think, allocation distribution of other things during this pandemic...testing, PPE, masks, ventilators. All of those have been with controversy,\" he said. But even setting aside fears of treatments going to the highest bidders or the most politically connected, there will still be early tradeoffs in deciding which of the most vulnerable Americans deserve the first doses. \"How do we split the allocation between the people in nursing homes who are at tremendous risk and the first responders who are at tremendous personal risk and are potential spreaders of this disease?\" Rep. Foster said. \"Both groups have an extremely strong moral call on the first doses of therapeutics or vaccines.\"Hope for nursing homesAdministering antibody treatments is also a challenge. Drug makers are looking at injecting the drugs through IVs or, in the case of preventative doses, possibly via syringe, similar to an insulin injection. That's easy enough to do in a hospital setting. But senior homes, which have been ravaged by high infection and death rates during the pandemic, are ill-equipped. They don't have pharmacies or an abundance of IVs or enough staffers to provide infusions to every patient. In order to pull off a clinical trial at Symphony Care Network's facilities across the Midwest, Eli Lilly brought in reinforcements. The company set up RVs that are being outfitted as mobile pharmacies. It dispatched trucks full of equipment for IVs and infusions. And it provided staff to start the IVs, administer the infusions and follow up with patients. \"All those logistic elements will need to be addressed,\" said Dr. Alexander Stemer, an infectious disease expert and co-chair of Symphony's Covid-19 task force.This week, the network of assisted-living homes identified its first outbreak and began briefing patients and staffers on the details of the clinical trial. A number of people have already enrolled.\"If Covid-19 is a 1,000 page textbook, we're on page five. And we are learning about this disease every day,\" said Dr. Alexander Stemer, an infectious disease expert and co-chair of Symphony's Covid-19 task force. \"The positive of this study is that it gives the patients and the staff hope that they may be getting a treatment that can help.\" There was widespread agreement, among experts, drug-makers and policymakers, that an effective antibody treatment could be a godsend for nursing homes in particular. \"The sense of doom and fright and death that's happening in these places is heartbreaking. So if we can, if we can change that, that's great,\" Eli Lilly's Skovronksy said. \"And then we turn to other populations that are also vulnerable and work our way down.\"",

        "body": "(CNN)The daughter of Rep. Louie Gohmert publicly rebuked her father for not wearing a mask and ignoring medical expertise before he tested positive for coronavirus last week.\n\n\"Wearing a mask is a non-partisan issue. The advice of medical experts shouldn't be politicized. My father ignored medical expertise and now he has Covid,\" said Caroline Gohmert, a musical artist who goes by Caroline Brooks and also uses the stage name BELLSAINT, in a pointed statement on Twitter Friday, two days after her father's diagnosis was made public.\"This has been a heartbreaking battle bc I love my dad and don't want him to die,\" she continued. \"Please please listen to medical experts. It's not worth following a president who has no remorse for leading his followers to an early grave.\"CNN has reached out to Gohmert's office for comment. His daughter's comments -- which her agent, Ryan Vaughn, confirmed to be authentic on Monday -- come after the Texas Republican tested positive for the virus last week, prompting House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to announce new rules requiring masks on the House floor and renewing a debate about access to testing for members of Congress and their staff. Read MoreGohmert had been scheduled to fly aboard Air Force One on Wednesday with President Donald Trump to Midland, Texas, but he tested positive for coronavirus during a pre-flight screening at the White House, a person familiar with the situation told CNN.A senior Republican aide told CNN the test results caused issues on the Hill where \"a lot of staffers\" were ordered to get tests before they can go to meetings and resume activity.Gohmert released a video statement on Twitter saying, \"The reports of my demise are a great deal premature\" and noted he was asymptomatic.\"I don't have any of the symptoms that are listed as part of Covid-19, but apparently I have the Wuhan virus,\" he said.Before his diagnosis, Gohmert had told CNN in June that he didn't wear a mask because he had been tested and he didn't yet have the virus. \"But if I get it, you'll never see me without a mask,\" he offered.Told that health experts say that people who don't have symptoms may be carrying the virus and can unknowingly spread it to others, Gohmert responded: \"But I keep being tested and I don't have it. So I'm not afraid of you, but if I get it I'll wear a mask.\"\n\nCNN's Ashley Killough, Kevin Liptak, Haley Byrd, Manu Raju and Priscilla Alvarez contributed to this report.",

The robot also is equipped with an infrared camera, along with three monochrome cameras that are capable of filtering different wavelengths of light, the release states. Read MoreThese four cameras can measure skin temperature, breathing rate, pulse rate and blood oxygen saturation from as far as 6 1/2 feet (2 meters) away.\"We didn't really develop new technology to do the measurements,\" Huang says. \"What we did is integrate them together very specifically for the Covid application, to analyze different vital signs at the same time.\"The researchers expect to focus on triage applications in the short term, with the goal of ultimately deploying robots like this to patients' hospital rooms to continuously monitor them and let doctors to check in on them without ever having to step into the room.",

        "body": "Chat with us in Facebook Messenger. Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds.\n\n(CNN)Plasma Technologies LLC has signed a defense contract worth $750,000 to develop scaled-up Covid-19 convalescent plasma technologies, according to an announcement on the Department of Defense website Monday.\n\nIt's the latest development in the effort to use a 19th century treatment to help 21st century patients.The contract with the DoD's Joint Acquisition Task Force is to develop a new convalescent blood plasma process that makes more serum-derived products, and faster. President Donald Trump and US health leaders have done a full court press to encourage people who survived Covid-19 to donate plasma to help those who are sick.Two weeks ago, on a tour of the Red Cross, Trump implored people to volunteer to donate plasma \"as soon as you can.\"Read More\"We have a lot of people that would heal, would get better. As soon as you can, please,\" Trump said.While nearly 67,000 people have been infused with the treatment and nearly 14,000 physicians are using it, according to UScovidplasma.org, it's still not clear if it works. Several studies are under way.A Victorian solution to a modern problem?Convalescent plasma is a treatment created out of blood from people who have recovered from an infection such as Covid-19. Plasma is the liquid portion of blood containing immune cells and antibodies -- proteins the body makes to fight infection. The plasma can be infused into a sick person to help recovery. Since the Victorian era, doctors have used this treatment to fight severe cases of the flu. The treatment has also shown success with two other deadly coronaviruses - MERS and SARS. Yet it will take studies to prove that it works to treat Covid-19. Absent other treatments, doctors have opted to use the treatment as it was still being studied.Doctors try the old treatmentWhen the Covid-19 pandemic hit New York City hard in March, doctors desperate to save patients weren't sure what might help. Plasma from recovered Covid-19 patients showed some early promise. For professionals used to relying on scientific evidence and established facts, there was -- and still is -- little to work with.\"It was sort of like learning to fly the plane when we were in midair,\" Dr. Nicole Bouvier, an infectious disease specialist at Mount Sinai, said. \"There are basic things that you know about human physiology, but you don't necessarily know how this particular virus is going to behave and what the best treatments are,\" she said.\"We probably changed what we were doing on a daily basis.\"To see what worked, Bouvier and team did a retrospective analysis on data collected from 39 patients. Even in that small group, convalescent plasma stood out.Bouvier published the results in a small pre-print study, meaning it isn't peer reviewed yet, in May. Patients treated with convalescent plasma improved more than those who were not transfused, and more patients survived.\"We don't have definitive answers yet, but we are on the way to getting definitive answers and, I would say, that the evidence, while imperfect, is promising,\" Bouvier said.Dr. Janet Woodcock, who's heading up the therapeutic efforts under Operation Warp Speed as the director of the US Food and Drug Administration's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, recently called vaccines the \"permanent hope,\" but she said vaccines are not the only approach that will get this country out of the Covid-19 pandemic. Convalescent plasma, Woodcock said, is an option that can be \"feasible fairly quickly.\" Woodcock, said it's a treatment the government is trying to accelerate, even before the government knows if it works. Early results in ChinaEarly on, a handful of small studies in China looked promising. A small study published in JAMA in March showed four of five patients given convalescent plasma improved. A second small study of 10 Chinese patients published in May in the journal PNAS saw improvement in patients treated with convalescent plasma, with no safety issues. Two other small pre-print studies from China showed similar results. One additional observational study from Chinese researchers published in June did not see an improvement in the mortality rate among six critically ill patients, but the authors did not dismiss convalescent plasma completely. Instead, they suggested it may work if patients were treated earlier.Trying the treatment in the USThe US Food and Drug Admnistration has not yet approved its use for the treatment of Covid-19, but at the end of March, the FDA created a pathway for scientists to try convalescent plasma with patients and study its impact. Doctors at Houston Methodist immediately performed what it says were the nation's first plasma transfusions. They published their results in the American Journal of Pathology in May. Among 25 hospitalized patients with Covid-19, seven days after the convalescent plasma treatment, nine showed some improvement and seven were discharged from the hospital. By day 14, 19 had improved and 11 were discharged. There were no safety issues. Still, it's not clear if the treatment was the reason these patients improved; the study results would need to be reproduced in a larger group of patients.As evidence mounted that it had shown some success, the FDA put out a call in April to urge recovered patients to donate plasma. The government launched a website instructing Americans on how they could donate, as did the American Red Cross. First 'maybe,' then 'possibly,' now 'probably'In June, a larger study of 5,000 hospitalized patients published in the Journal of Clinical Investigation showed that the treatment was safe. Dr. Arturo Casadevall, one of the researchers, called convalescent plasma the \"good news story\" of the pandemic.The chief of molecular microbiology and immunology at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Casadevall thought the practice held promise and helped spearhead the national push to understand if this therapy works in March, when he and a colleague wrote about its possibilities in the Journal of Clinical Investigation and created the National Covid-19 Convalescent Plasma Project. It's a national network of providers at 57 institutions in 46 states. More than 100 people joined the group's first conference call.The organization quickly published a guidebook of convalescent plasma best practices for physicians. It created a website collecting the latest science. The physicians started clinical trials. One that's underway looks at the impact of the treatment on health care workers. Another is looking at the effect of convalescent plasma on patients who have not been hospitalized. \"When we first started this effort if you had asked 'do you think it's going to work?' I would have said 'maybe,'\" Casadevall said. \"Since then I progressed to 'possibly,' and now, I am at 'probably.'\"Casadevall wants more research to prove it works. \"To really be certain you need to complete the randomized clinical trials,\" Casadevall said. \"But the good thing has been that there have been multiple reports that have been encouraging, including my clinical trials from Wuhan that had to be stopped prematurely.\"That trial was stopped when the flood of patients slowed to a trickle and there weren't enough patients to test the therapy. The challengesThe number of cases can also impact how much of the therapy is available. Unlike with a monoclonal antibody therapies that can be made in the lab, this treatment relies on volunteers.\"It is a limited resource,\" Woodcock said Monday. That's why there has been a concerted push to get more donors. Even Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson has been enlisted to urge people to donate.Typically, one donor's plasma can treat two or three people and the original donor can come back and donate again within a couple of weeks. But there are only so many donors, Woodcock said, and scientists are starting to think there is only a month-long window in which people have enough antibodies in their blood to help someone else fight the disease. But again, they need more research to know for sure.An August study of 35,000 patients that has not yet been peer reviewed found that giving people the plasma treatment early seemed to reduce deaths more. People who got the transfusions within three days of diagnosis had a seven-day death rate of 8.7%, while patients treated four or more days into the course of illness had a 11.9% mortality rate.But there was no placebo group. Without that comparison, it's hard to know if the treatment made the difference.The treatment be a difficult one to get right. Monoclonal antibody treatments, by contrast, are made by scientists in the lab. They pick the antibody that works best in the lab to neutralize the virus and reproduce it in the lab. Such Covid-19 antibody therapies are in clinical trials now, too.With convalescent plasma, patients get all the antibodies in that plasma, not just those carefully engineered to fight the virus. Every donor's plasma is a little bit different and some may have more antibodies that protect against the virus better than others. \"Convalescent plasma, I think we need to have more caution about that,\" Dr. Anthony Fauci said recently. \"You want to make sure you do it right.\"The pushEven before scientists know for sure, the US Department of Defense said it wants to collect 8,000 units by the end of September. Casadevall said the government is also stockpiling 200,000 units, something he says is a sign that the experimental treatment is here to stay. Plasma can be stored frozen for about a year. Woodcock, who said the US government is trying to accelerate these plasma drives, thinks there may be an additional benefit to convalescent plasma that goes beyond treating someone's symptoms. \"I think people feel very helpless in the face of this,\" Woodcock said. \"This is something that everyone can contribute who's been infected.\"",

        "body": "(CNN)For decades, Teme Ring was cut off from her Jewish faith.\n\nThe former lawyer was forced to give up her career in 2000, after an onslaught of autoimmune diseases and dysautonomia, conditions that also made her too weak to step into a synagogue for in-person services.\"I'm in my own personal diaspora,\" she said. In recent years, Ring had hoped to reconnect with faith through a synagogue in downtown Chicago. \"I realized I really missed it,\" she said. \"But it seemed ridiculous to belong and never show up.\" She only dragged herself to synagogue once, and her symptoms were such that she was physically present but spiritually absent.Now, however, during the pandemic, with many Jewish congregations taking services online for the first time, Ring's faith has undergone its long overdue blossoming.Read MoreEmpowered by technology, she can now regularly attend Shabbat and classes at two different synagogues in Chicago, and at a third in Southern California, where her parents live.\"I've gone from no Jewish contact for 20 years to now being a member of three congregations,\" she said. \"I don't feel isolated anymore.\"A weekly holiday finds a new virtual homeRing's experience reflects a growing trend in Judaism, as several branches of the faith, long resistant to technology, find ways to adapt during the pandemic.A traditional way to gather with fellow Jews is through weekly dinners over Zoom, which mark Shabbat (Hebrew for the Sabbath). The holiday begins each Friday at sunset and ends at sundown the following day.One group that has embraced the virtual possibilities for faith is Lab/Shul, which describes itself as an \"everybody-friendly, artist-driven, God-optional, pop up community for sacred Jewish gatherings in New York City.\"Prior to the coronavirus pandemic, Lab/Shul had regularly organized robust in-person community dinners. But since March, the group has moved its weekly gatherings online, in a format called ShaBasics, stripped down to the fundamentals of bread, wine, candles and a blessing.\"What the Sabbath is about is an invitation to tap into the sacred specialness of life,\" Rabbi Amichai Lau-Lavie, who leads Lab/Shul, said. \"It helps us transcend the anxiety of the every day.\"The irony of gathering online for the Sabbath is that the weekly holiday is often seen as a time to unplug from screens, not reattach ourselves to them. But as much of the world moves work, school or social events onto virtual meetups, merging the sacred with the virtual is the only way we can make it through this global crisis.\"The Sabbath is the weekly opportunity to breathe whether you believe in God or not,\" Lau-Lavie said.Shabbat is an ancient ritualIt's a tradition nearly as old as time itself.Shabbat celebrates the seventh day of creation in the Book of Genesis, a holy day of rest and reflection after the labors of the week.During the tedium of quarantine, Shabbat assumes a kind of \"anti-blursday\" quality, Lau-Lavie said. \"It's one of the ways to make days distinguishable from each other.\"Dressing up, putting a tablecloth on the table, seeing your friends and reflecting on your larger values help the day be more than just a regular day.\"Shabbat is fun. It's this awesome holiday we get every week to rest, to pray and to sing,\" said Rabbi Sandra Lawson, associate chaplain for Jewish life and a Jewish educator at Hillel at Elon University in North Carolina.And perhaps, mostly importantly, it's a day dedicated to connection.\"A lot of the things we do are centered on community,\" said Lawson, who has become a Jewish digital leader of sorts, viewing social media as a way to welcome others into the faith. \"We're never designed to be alone and to pray alone.\"In order to perform certain rituals or prayers, Judaism calls for a gathering of at least 10 people to form a minyan, or quorum. But with physical gatherings of 10 people prohibited in many areas due to the coronavirus pandemic, serving communities virtually during quarantine presents a conundrum in how to uphold Jewish tradition while taking public health into consideration.Thousands of years of tradition collide with a 21st-century pandemicLau-Lavie, who was previously a member of the Conservative movement's Rabbinical Assembly, isn't a stranger to using technology to break new ground in the faith.Five years ago, when his father passed away, Lau-Lavie was away in Jerusalem, while his spiritual community was back in New York. Skirting tradition, he issued a call for others to engage with him in the mourner's prayer over Zoom.\"I got a lot of flak from rabbis,\" he said. But perspectives like his are now becoming accepted within his strand of Judaism, thanks to an extra nudge from this year's pandemic.Like other monotheistic religions, Judaism has many movements, including the strictly ultra-Orthodox, Conservative, Reform and Reconstructionist wings, all of which are grappling with limits set by the pandemic.In May, the rabbinic arm of the United Synagogue of Conservative Judaism issued a 30-page opinion formally allowing the use of electronic devices to stream services for Shabbat and other Jewish holidays. That decision -- one of several by different movements -- carves out some new space in millennia-long debate about how and when to adapt faith and technology. It also empowers congregations such as B'nai Torah in Sandy Springs, Georgia, which is part of the Conservative movement, to continue with the kind of virtual services that became a practical necessity in March. Strictly Orthodox communities have opposed the use of technology during Shabbat and holidays, and each individual Jewish community is adapting in its own way.\"How many of the digital offerings will actually become the way we do religious business?\" Lau-Lavie wondered. \"Jewish law can take a backseat to the need to connect. We are in triage. When this is over, we can debate Jewish law.\"Lawson, the rabbi from Elon University, likened the current need for evolution to actions early radical Jews took after the destruction of the Second Temple in Jerusalem in 70 A.D. Jewish communities needed to establish how to interact without a physical grounding space. Out of that spirit the concept of rabbinical Judaism, which permeates the faith today, was born.Coronavirus forces a similar rethinking of how we gather spiritually and what we think of as a sacred space, she argued.\"We're going to emerge into something beautiful. Our history is one of evolving,\" Lawson said. \"Many are going to like this and they aren't going to want to go back.\"High holy days are comingThis is all good practice for the most sacred of Jewish holidays. Rosh Hashana beginning on September 18 leads into Yom Kippur on September 27. Rabbi Joshua Lesser, who leads Congregation Bet Haverim in Atlanta, has dedicated himself to providing the best possible virtual high holiday experience for his congregants, while taking into account the need for social distancing or quarantine.\"A lot of folks are wondering if their community's endurance is on the line,\" he said. \"It's an experiment we have to get right.\"One way he's doing that is asking members of the congregation to think of their homes as sacred spaces, and to consider creating a small sanctuary in one corner. The rabbi is creating boxes to deliver to members with holiday candles, apple snacks, honey and notebooks for them to jot down their reflections so they can mark the high holidays at home.And he plans to highlight a particular prayer, the Yizkor, which remembers those who have died in the last year. Many in his congregation are aching over not being able to attend in-person funerals for loved ones during the pandemic.Lesser co-leads a Facebook group called \"Dreaming Up High Holy Days 2020,\" in which nearly 2,500 cantors, rabbis and lay leaders exchange ideas on how to celebrate the holy days during the pandemic, either virtually or with in-person modifications in place.\"This shaking up of things has created a Jewish creative revolution,\" he said. \"This has been an incredible creative, generative moment.\"Friday nightEvery Friday night, congregants have another chance to connect. At Lab/Shul's Shabbat dinner on July 31, Rabbi Lau-Lavie asked those in attendance to think about something in their life that they regret, and to meditate on how to move past it.He used his own digital addiction as an example, noting that he planned to switch his phone off for 24 hours that weekend. It was a choice that illustrates the universal paradox of finding meaning in the time of coronavirus, using a digital medium for life-sustaining connection to others while also issuing a critique of a digital medium.It's something that nearly anyone who attends one of the virtual Shabbat dinners could relate to whether they're atheist, agnostic, Jewish or \"Jew-ish,\" as Lau-Lavie said.Nearly 800 miles away in a Chicago suburb, Ring was also celebrating Shabbat, comfortably at home and using a digital technology to spiritually connect with her community. She has found in Zoom a blessing to help undo decades of feeling cast out.\"I did feel very isolated. I felt Judaism was lost to me and I was lost to it, like I didn't have a physical place in it,\" she said. Now, though, she has at least three virtual places in the faith.\"They all treat me as their spiritual neighbor,\" she added. \"Now nobody has to be invisible.\"",

        "body": "(CNN)There is no denying that vaping is popular among teens, with one-third of US high school students reporting they have vaped or used other electronic nicotine products recently, according to a 2019 study.\n\nIt doesn't stay cool for all of them, with almost half of surveyed teens reporting they seriously tried to quit, according to new research. Nearly 25% said they tried to quit but failed. That's dangerous for teens, who are at high risk of nicotine addiction and switching to cigarettes. And people who are addicted to nicotine have a higher risk of complications from Covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus. The findings align with \"other research indicating that there is a significant risk of developing nicotine dependence symptoms among teens that use e-cigarettes,\" said Adam Leventhal, the director of the University of Southern California Institute for Addiction Science, who wasn't involved in the study. The research also \"highlights the urgent need for treatments that can help youth who are trying to quit stay quit,\" said research coauthor Jennifer Dahne, an assistant professor in the department of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at the Medical University of South Carolina.Read MoreThe research letter precedes the upcoming September 9 deadline for e-cigarette manufacturers to apply to the US Food and Drug Administration to keep their products on the market. Companies are responsible for demonstrating the appropriateness of their products for the protection of public health. The new research is \"the clearest sign that once (kids) get hooked, they realize what's happening to them,\" said Matthew Myers, president of the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, who wasn't involved in the study. \"The absence of regulation has meant the e-cigarette industry has marketed highly flavored products that appeal to kids (and) deliver nicotine that rapidly leads to intense addiction.\" Products that come in a variety of sweet flavors and sleek shapes and deliver high doses of nicotine \"should not be allowed on the market because of their proven appeal impact on youth,\" Myers added. \"How the FDA deals with the applications it will receive over the next month will directly affect the number of our kids who become addicted to tobacco products over the next 10, 20, 30 years.\" Addiction refers to a person's loss of control over use of substances and is associated with changes in your brain's \"reward center,\" said Dr. Sharon Levy, director of the Adolescent Substance Use and Addiction Program at Boston Children's Hospital and an associate professor of pediatrics at Harvard Medical School. Levy wasn't involved in the research. A teen or adolescent's developing brain is more susceptible to these changes than mature adult brains. \"When these changes occur,\" Levy explained, \"the rational decision-making part of the brain loses out to the more instinctual parts and people find themselves using nicotine even when they really want to quit.\" Addiction doesn't go away on its own, but quitting can be easier when people prepare in advance and receive professional help. Read on to learn how to begin the journey.Know why you're quittingYour awareness of the dangers associated with nicotine hasn't made you successfully quit vaping. Knowing why you want to quit can empower you to make choices that lead you to your goal, according to Smokefree Teen, a US National Cancer Institute initiative.Think about what really matters to you and how vaping gets in the way of those things. Is vaping affecting your feelings, money or relationships with people who are important to you? Answering these questions can help you see how vaping is affecting your life, maybe in ways you hadn't realized. Keep a list of the reasons you want to quit on your phone and read it when you feel the urge to vape. Commit to an end dateSetting a quit date is good so that you can mentally prepare, Levy said. A date no more than one to two weeks away is best -- it's enough time so that you can feel confident, but not too much time that would allow you to change your mind. Don't pick the day before anything stressful, like an exam. On your phone, set an alert for the day. Create your quit plan Once you have your date, talk with your doctor about your concerns and goals. Smokefree Teen has a tool for creating a personal quit plan based on your everyday life. The tool can help you prepare to quit, track your experiences and stay on course.Know what to expectKnowing the possible challenges ahead can help you stick to your plan. \"Nicotine is a stimulant and lots of teens who use it like the feel or the 'buzz' they get from it,\" Levy said. \"But over time, most people find that the buzz is harder and harder (to reach) as you develop tolerance and your body starts to accommodate to the nicotine.\" Withdrawals can make quitting uncomfortable and especially for the first week or two. If you experience symptoms and cravings, talk with your doctor about medications that could help. \"Hang in there because the withdrawal symptoms pass in time and cravings become less and less intense over time,\" Levy said in an email. Maybe you vape with friends and vaping is part of how your group spends time together. Since hanging around them while you're quitting can be challenging, you might want to see other people for a while. Some people find they are eventually able to spend time with friends who vape without being triggered to follow suit, Levy said. If your friends don't understand you, explain why quitting is important to you and ask them to respect your decision. Because of the risks associated with vaping, there are many health benefits to gain by quitting. Depending on the dose, Levy said, nicotine and other chemicals in vaping devices can cause: Lung damageDizziness, vomiting or seizuresDifficulty concentrating and learningSymptoms of depression Greater risk of using cigarettes, marijuana and other drugs Hindered or abnormal brain development\"Being addicted to tobacco products means that adolescents don't have full control of their use,\" said research coauthor Tracy Smith, an assistant professor in the department of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at the Medical University of South Carolina. \"If they are able to quit, they get that control back.\"Identify triggers, seek social support and have some self-compassionTriggers -- certain people, situations or feelings -- can lead you to act in ways that might be bad for your health.\"Identifying yours and thinking through new coping strategies can prevent you from reaching for a vape,\" Levy said. If your trigger is seeing other people vaping, maybe take a break from social media. The study also found that 57% of adolescents who currently vaped nicotine had depressive symptoms in the last year, and 61% had anxiety symptoms, Dahne said. If you're vaping to relieve troubles, psychological treatment and healthy activities such as walking or listening to music can help manage your stress and take your mind off vaping. You can also find a replacement behavior, like chewing gum or calling a friend.Doing this on your own can be hard, Levy added, so ask for support from your doctor, family and friends. Be specific about what you need -- maybe they can keep you distracted so you don't vape. Others can help keep you accountable while you're trying to change, Levy said. And don't be too hard on yourself if you slip up, which can happen several times. \"Acknowledge that relapse is normal when trying to change any behavior, including quitting vaping,\" Dahne said. \"It's important to learn from what worked and what didn't work during past quit attempts and to try to quit again.\" Imagine your vape-free selfIf vaping is something you regularly do, imagining your life without it might be hard. The you who feels weird at first will eventually become your new normal. Thinking of yourself as someone who doesn't vape can separate you from vaping and give you the confidence to move forward. Write a list of all the great things about yourself that don't involve vaping -- vaping doesn't define who you are. Picture the future you who you want. How does that person compare with who you are now? How does vaping stand in the way? All of these steps can help you bridge that gap.",

        "body": "(CNN)Desks are spaced 6 feet apart, temperature checks are routine and students lunch together in small groups.\n\nThis overhaul of the traditional school day has become reality in the last two weeks, as schools in Georgia, Mississippi, Tennessee and Indiana opened their doors for the first time since the coronavirus pandemic abruptly shuttered classrooms across the United States -- all while the virus remains largely uncontrolled. Here's what we've learned from the schools that have already reopened, as most US schools prepare for their own first day of classes. More students and teachers are testing positive for Covid-19Over the last four weeks, there has been a 90% increase in the number of Covid-19 cases among children in the United States, according to a recent analysis by the American Academy of Pediatrics and the Children's Hospital AssociationRead MoreSeveral clusters of coronavirus cases emerged in Florida, Georgia and Mississippi schools within days of starting classes. While most of the nation's largest school systems are planning to start the school year completely online, some educators welcomed students back to campus full-time or at least part-time. North Paulding High School in Dallas, Georgia, attracted national attention after a student posted a photo on Twitter showing a crowded school hallway with few visible face masks. \"We could have just delayed opening like many other schools,\" the student, Hannah Watters, told CNN last week. \"They kind of sent us to school and used us as guinea pigs to see what would happen later on.\"The high school closed for cleaning after six students and three staff members tested positive for Covid-19. As of Wednesday, at least 35 cases had been reported.School districts in several states, including Alabama, Georgia, Indiana, Missisippi and Oklahoma directed students, teachers and staff members to quarantine following reports of at least 230 cases of Covid-19 linked to their institutions, according to a CNN tally.Dr.Thomas Dobbs, Mississippi's health director, said earlier this week that at least 22 schools in the state reported Covid-19 cases among students and staff members since classes began.Some schools were forced to suddenly change plans Fears of coronavirus infection among tens of thousands of students and teachers in multiple states is pushing officials to switch to a full or partial schedule of online classes. Students at the North Paulding High School will be alternating days on campus starting Monday. Students attended classes on campus for a week before going into full virtual learning this week. Despite the change, school officials say they intend to return to full in-person instruction as soon as possible. Two other high schools in Georgia -- Woodstock High School and Etowah High School -- temporarily moved to remote classes after 14 cases of Covid-19 were confirmed in each school and 15 people were awaiting test results, according to the Cherokee County School District.More than 1,100 students, teachers and staff members at more than a dozen Cherokee County public schools have been placed in two-week quarantines, the school district said.\"We are not hesitating to quarantine students and staff who have had possible exposure -- even if the positive test was prompted by possible exposure rather than symptoms, as all positive cases can lead to the infection of others,\" Superintendent of Schools Dr. Brian V. Hightower said in a letter to parents on Tuesday. The other schools are being asked to social distance and use masks. \"As your Superintendent, I wear a mask whenever I cannot social distance. We know all parents do not believe the scientific research that indicates masks are beneficial, but I believe it and see masks as an important measure to help us keep schools open,\" Hightower said.Other schools are pushing the start of school againDeciding when and how to open schools has been a daunting task, and some officials have opted to delay the start of the school year.On Wednesday, Rhode Island Gov. Gina Raimondo announced she is delaying the scheduled start of the school year two more weeks until September 14 because educators need more time to prepare for in-person classes.Schools haven't finalized their social distancing guidelines for buses and classrooms, and they haven't acquired enough personal protective equipment (PPE), Raimondo said.Raimondo said the situation in Georgia schools, including photos posted online that show students not wearing masks, were a \"cautionary tale\" for her.\"That's not Rhode Island. We are in a much better place in Rhode Island,\" she said during a coronavirus briefing on Wednesday. \"I see those pictures and that to me is a cautionary tale. That's what we won't do. We're not going to open schools until they're safe.\"Rhode Island's school opening delays are not an exception. At least 27 of the largest 101 school districts in the country decided to delay their first week of classes, according to a CNN analysis. The delays in small and large districts have been prompted by the lack of preparedness, the ongoing impact of the virus and what other schools are experiencing, school officials said.Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear is asking schools to wait until late September to begin in-person classes. Beshear says he took the decision after seeing an increase of coronavirus cases, families traveling to hot spot states for vacation and seeing reports of Georgia and Tennessee students being asked to quarantine within days of starting school.\"What we do know is children have a harder time social distancing. And we can't put a whole bunch of them in a classroom with a teacher right now,\" Beshear said in a briefing earlier this week. \"Other states that have tried to open this new school year are now having to close. We don't want to start and stop. That may be more difficult on our children.\"Reopening schools remains a politically charged issueThe debate over in-person schooling remains at the forefront of the national coronavirus crisis, fueling tensions between state and local officials.In Florida, Hillsborough Public Schools revised its original plans last week and decided to only offer virtual classes, defying state orders. Last month, the state's department of education issued an executive order requiring all \"brick and mortar schools\" to open \"at least five days per week for all students\" by August 31. \"The Hillsborough County School Board needs to follow the law -- it's that simple,\" Richard Corcoran, Florida's education commissioner, told CNN in a statement this week. \"These are urgent circumstances and we cannot, and will not, ignore it.\"After talks with state officials, the school district is planning to begin virtual learning on August 24 and \"transition to brick and mortar a week later for those who want to come back on August 31,\" the district said in a statement released Thursday.Taryn Fenske, a spokesperson with the Florida Department of Education, told CNN on Thursday that the agency was \"glad\" to see the school district \"worked hard\" to ensure it could provide families with a choice.\"The key principle we've said time and time again was to give a real choice and flexibility to families and students to provide for the needs of all students, and we're glad they accomplished that,\" Fenske said in a statement to CNN.Some school districts in central Iowa, including the Des Moines Public Schools, are also rejecting their state's guidance because it doesn't support full virtual learning.The Des Moines Public Schools had announced its plans to offer all classes online before Gov. Kim Reynolds signed an order last month, requiring schools to teach at least half of all classes on campus. Reynolds said this week that state officials are in talks with several suburban Des Moines school districts to \"get them into compliance\" after educators said they are concerned the pandemic may later drive them to full online learning.The governor said in a briefing on Tuesday that she wants to go over the state's mitigation efforts with those districts because \"every expert\" has said \"we have to get our kids back in school for a whole host of reasons.\"\n\nCNN's Elizabeth Stuart, Pamela Kirkland, Melissa Alonso, Rosa Flores, Sara Weisfeldt and Laurie Ure contributed to this report.",

        "body": "(CNN)The family of an Indiana student who learned of a positive Covid-19 test on the first day of school sent the child to classes knowing the result of the test was pending, the school superintendent said Monday.\n\nAs students return to the campus just outside Indianapolis, some teachers are anxious, Superintendent Harold Olin of Greenfield-Central Community School Corp. said, but there were no new cases Monday and the school district has followed protocols to make the school safe for students and faculty. \"Not exactly the start we were looking for in that specific school,\" he said. \"We will continue to control the variables we can control. We need families to control the variable they can control, which is the self-screening piece.\"Student had test days before school beganThe news came as educators across the nation debated -- and differed significantly -- on whether it's safe for kids to return to school amid a pandemic. Greenfield-Central Junior High School kicked off the school year Thursday. Read MoreThat afternoon, the Hancock County Health Department notified the district that a student there had tested positive for Covid-19, Olin wrote in a letter to parents. As part of the district's protocols for the virus, officials isolated the student in the school clinic and reviewed the student's schedule, modes of transportation and extracurricular activities to determine with whom the youngster had come in contact, according to Olin's letter. \"We obviously were a little disappointed when we received a phone call from the health department telling us one of our students had tested positive,\" the superintendent told CNN on Monday. \"The student had tested a few days before. The family had not waited to get the results, and the student came to school.\"The school is already professionally disinfected each evening, in accordance with the school district's plan to return to in-person learning, but special attention was paid to areas and classrooms the infected student visited, Olin told parents. \"We understand that this information will cause concern for some of you. It was very evident today that nearly all of our families and students were prepared to properly follow the safety protocols we have established,\" Olin wrote.'That does create additional anxiety'Officials examined seating charts, and students who had been within 6 feet of their infected classmate for more than 15 minutes won't be allowed to return to school, Olin told CNN. Their families received phone calls informing them their children must stay out of school for 14 days, he said. Olin added guidance that students should not come to class if they're awaiting the result of a Covid-19 test. Students, families and staff were asked to self-screen for Covid-19 symptoms, he said, and school officials also spoke with the infected student's family about putting others at risk, he said. \"That does create additional anxiety for some of our teachers who are kind of on the fence about being back anyway, and we're certainly trying to work through a few of those,\" Olin told CNN. The staff is disappointed, he said, but \"rolling with it very well,\" and none of the school's staff members appear to have had close contact with the student. Olin, whose wife is an educator and whose daughter is in high school, said there are risks in life, whether driving to school or going to the mall, and the student's diagnosis doesn't lead him to believe returning to school was a bad idea. \"I do believe that schooling on site is our best option in America in terms of the best quality education that we can deliver,\" he said. While most parents in the district have indicated they want their kids on campus with their teachers, about 15% of families have opted for virtual learning, and the district is accommodating both preferences, Olin said, leaving open the possibility families could shift between the two camps. Other Indiana casesGreenfield-Central Junior High isn't the only school in the state, or the county, to navigate a positive coronavirus test so early in the school year. In the southern portion of the county, a football player at New Palestine High School tested positive last week. The high school followed sanitation and contact tracing protocols, canceled Friday's football practice and planned to proceed with classes Monday, said Wes Anderson, spokesman for the Community School Corp. of Southern Hancock County. About an hour's drive north of Indianapolis, in Elwood, staff members at Elwood Junior-Senior High School came into contact with an infected staff member, spurring school officials to move classes online this week while custodians disinfect the building, Elwood Community School Corp. Superintendent Joe Brown said. No students came in contact with the staffer, he said. In the Indianapolis suburb of Avon, a staff member at Avon High School, which reopened Wednesday, tested positive but had no contact with students or other staff members, Avon Community School Corp. spokeswoman Stacey Forcey-Moore said. Indiana has almost 68,000 cases, roughly 3,000 of them deadly, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. The numbers put the state in the middle of the pack for coronavirus infections (Vermont has fewer than 1,500 cases; California has more than a half million).\n\nCNN's Rebekah Riess, Erica Hill, Laura Ly and Taylor Romine contributed to this report.",

        "body": "(CNN)A new model often cited by top health officials raised its projections Friday, predicting over 410,000 coronavirus deaths nationwide by January 1.\n\nThat would mean an additional 224,000 Americans lost in the next four months -- more than double the 186,000 deaths reported by Johns Hopkins University. The model from the University of Washington's Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation points to declining mask use in some regions from a peak in usage in early August. The scenarios in the model suggest 122,000 of those lives could be saved with near-universal mask use. It also warns the death toll could be much higher -- over 620,000 -- if all restrictions are eased.\"If a herd immunity strategy is pursued, meaning no further government intervention is taken from now to Jan 1st, the death toll could increase to 620,000,\" according to IHME's briefing.IHME expects the death rate could reach an unprecedented 3,000 a day by December, due in part to \"declining vigilance of the public.\"Read MoreThe IHME model is more aggressive in its predictions than others. It comes a day after a new CDC ensemble forecast predicted 211,000 US deaths from Covid-19 by September 26.Campuses urged to ban tobacco use in the fallLawmakers are reiterating a call for universities and college campuses to prohibit tobacco use this fall due to the coronavirus pandemic. In a letter to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Democratic lawmakers urged the federal health agency to review its Covid-19 guidelines and recommend no smoking, vaping or chewing tobacco in schools. The letter cites a study suggesting that young people who've used e-cigarettes can be five times more likely to be diagnosed with Covid-19. Stanford University researchers published the report last month in the Journal of Adolescent Health. \"Following the Stanford study, the University of Nevada, Las Vegas (UNLV) announced that it was banning tobacco use on campus in the fall ... In making that decision, UNLV took into account that if someone is smoking, vaping, or chewing tobacco, they cannot be complying with requirements to wear a mask,\" Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi and Senate Democratic Whip Dick Durbin wrote in the letter.With the public health risk posed by coronavirus, they said, the CDC should \"act quickly and forcefully.\"Coronavirus has infected over 6.1 million nationwide, according to Johns Hopkins University.Last month, Krishnamoorthi wrote a letter to the Food and Drug Administration asking it to temporarily clear the market of all e-cigarettes during the coronavirus crisis. He wrote it on behalf of the Subcommittee on Economic and Consumer Policy. Young people urged to be cautiousMore young people are getting infected with coronavirus at higher numbers. Experts fear that will only grow as many colleges and schools reopen.In August alone, for example, nearly 7,000 people between ages 18-24 tested positive for coronavirus in Missouri, Gov. Mike Parson said. About 30% of the new cases in the state are among that age group. \"While young, healthy people are likely to have mild symptoms and quick recoveries ... they may unknowingly carry Covid-19 to someone older or with underlying conditions, who is unable to fight off the virus. This is why it is so important for young people to take precautions and understand the responsibility,\" Parson said.While more young people continue to test positive, the vast majority of them have not required hospitalization. \"I know there is a lot of concern right now regarding college students. But I want to assure you that our colleges, and our universities, have plans in place, and are taking all steps necessary to keep their students and communities as safe as possible,\" Parson said.College campuses in at least 40 states have seen outbreaks of the virus and officials are urging caution as we head into the holiday weekend.\" I understand many will probably not be going home since they just got on campus. So they'll be around and they'll have some free time,\" Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson said. \"You've got to be cautious over this weekend.\" Over 200 of the 969 new cases reported in the state are from Washington County, home to the University of Arkansas, he said.In the county, four out of every five positive tests were among people between the ages of 18 and 24.Dr. Anthony Fauci pointed out measures that colleges and universities should take to open successfully. In a phone interview with CNN, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases said that colleges should only consider reopening if they have several protocols in place. They include testing every student, surveillance testing at various intervals and readily available quarantine spaces.\"They've got to have the capability of doing the testing to begin with,\" said Fauci, who emphasized testing upon arrival. \"They've got to have the capability of doing surveillance testing as you get into the school year, and they have to have a plan of how they handle the inevitability of some students who are going to wind up getting affected.\"He said it would be unrealistic to assume that there are no Covid-19 cases on campus and that planning should include designated specific quarantine spaces for students who contract the virus.Pressure for a vaccine grows as election nearsWith a persistent polling deficit and a struggling economy, President Donald Trump has cranked up pressure on federal health officials to expedite work on a coronavirus vaccine and treatments.In his public remarks and through private prodding, Trump has pushed for more good news on the pandemic, insisting that even developments considered minor by health experts be expanded into major announcements for which he can claim credit.In the last week alone, FDA Commissioner Dr. Stephen Hahn was forced to apologize for an overhyped plasma announcement, subsequently removed a new communications aide and found himself on the receiving end of criticism from the West Wing.And officials inside the FDA have told CNN that Trump has consistently pressed agencies to speed up their timeline for developing a vaccine so he can have a vaccine victory by Election Day.While the CDC has asked states to get ready to distribute a coronavirus vaccine by as early as next month, health officials have said this timeline is unlikely.\n\nCNN's Jacqueline Howard, Maggie Fox, Chuck Johnston, Annie Grayer, Kevin Liptak and Kaitlan Collins contributed to this report",

        "body": "(CNN)It's been almost five months since Shelby Hedgecock tested positive for Covid-19, and the former personal trainer said her symptoms are still debilitating.\n\nHedgecock is among patients who call themselves \"long-haul survivors\" -- those who experience symptoms long after testing positive. And long-term effects like theirs need to be taken seriously, a doctor researching these symptoms told CNN on Monday night.\"This is the conversation that needs to be had in the medical and the research community, not just in the sufferers who are actually dealing with it,\" Dr. William Li said.Covid-19 can be a prolonged illness, even among young adults without underlying chronic medical conditions, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported in July. Thirty-five percent of patients surveyed by the agency said they still weren't back to their usual good health even two to three weeks after testing positive for the disease. The rest said they'd returned to their usual state of health five to 12 days after a positive test.Hedgecock first tested positive in April. And though she tested negative in May, she is still having neurological issues, cognitive issues, shortness of breath, chest pain, loss of smell and body aches and pains that send her to her bed for days if she participates in even gentle yoga, she told CNN.Read MoreHedgecock's experience is not unique, Li said. His team is looking to connect the symptoms, with data pointing to the virus not just affecting the lungs but the blood vessels that connect the whole body, the doctor said.\"We think that this long-term damage may in part be due to vascular damage, kind of a footprint that the virus leaves even when it's gone from the body,\" Li said.With still so much medical professionals don't know about the virus and its impacts on the body, they can't say how or if patients like Hedgecock will recover completely.\"I think what is really humbling to those of us in medical research and clinical care is when we confront something we just don't know enough about,\" Li said. \"But we need to take it seriously, and we need to have the humility to recognize that were just starting to observe and collect the data right now.\"The not knowing is terrifying, Hedgecock said, but she is confident long-haul coronavirus is going to leave a mark on the US.\"This is going to be a public health debacle that is going to last for decades to come,\" she said.",

Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds.\n\n(CNN)Every Friday, Carolyn Freyer-Jones encourages her family and friends to participate in #thefridayminute to honor her father Hugh and others who have died from the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nThe idea came out of a discussion with her brother about how sometime down the road, there may be a national day of mourning for those who have lost a loved one to Covid-19. \"Let's not wait. Let's not wait for a national day of mourning in the future when we all get a day off and it's after hundreds of thousands of lives are gone, homes lost, jobs and businesses gone.\" Carolyn Freyer-Jones recalls telling her brother. \"Let's create something now that we can share and that can be shared with everyone, that people everywhere can do right now.\" At noon eastern time, she wants people to take a minute to reflect and pray, and even send love and support to families who have been affected by coronavirus this year.\"The minute is a way to remind ourselves that we are all connected regardless of situation or circumstance. My father is everyone's father, or husband, or grandfather, or friend,\" Carolyn Freyer-Jones told CNN. Read MoreDuring this minute and several times throughout the past few weeks, Carolyn has been thinking about her own father, who she said died from coronavirus complications on his 86th birthday.Remembering their father's legacyHugh Freyer, a native New Yorker, was born July 14, 1934. His father, also named Hugh Freyer, was born in South Africa, and his mother Josephine Freyer was an Irish immigrant. Hugh Freyer was raised in the Washington Heights neighborhood in New York City, where he attended George Washington High School. Hugh Freyer met his future wife Gertrude Flexer when they were 16 years old in Washington Heights. At the time of Hugh's death, they had been married for more than 64 years. He began working at Citibank as a bank teller in 1959. The devoted father of three worked at Citibank for over 40 years and finished his professional career as an independent consultant and financial adviser. An avid New York sports fan, Hugh Freyer also had a large collection of baseball caps for his beloved sports teams that are being distributed to his children and grandchildren. One of his favorite hobbies was participating in a sober poker game in the Bronx with other men he had met when he was in Alcoholics Anonymous. He was involved with the Alcoholics Anonymous community for over 50 years, and he would regularly go to hospitals to talk to people about rehabilitation programs. \"My dad was one of the longest running members,\" Carolyn said of her dad's Friday night poker game. \"They kept each other sober.\" Hugh played in his poker game for more than 30 years but would always come in with a budget as not to exceed his means, his daughter Carolyn told CNN. Hugh Freyer also leaves behind seven grandchildren. He was known for buying each of his grandchildren their first cars; his daughter says it was nothing expensive but just a solid used car. He made sure that there was money set aside so that his youngest grandchild, who is 12 years old, can get her first car as well. \"That's the kind of person he was. He paid everything on time, he helped people, he was really funny and he was smart,\" his daughter Carolyn said. Hugh Freyer originally went to the hospital for an unrelated medical issue on June 20. His doctors ruled out coronavirus after having him tested for it. His daughter said that on July 5, the day before he was supposed to be released to a rehabilitation facility, he was tested again. This time he tested positive for coronavirus, despite not initially showing any symptoms. His daughter said he died nine days later, on July 14, from coronavirus complications. Now, each Friday, Carolyn hopes everyone takes a moment to remember her dad and his legacy.\n\nCNN's Chiamaka Ofulue contributed to this report.",

Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds.\n\n(CNN)Catastrophic conditions in chaotic ill-equipped hospitals overflowing with Covid-19 patients -- patients forced to wait for others to die so they can be put on ventilators that could save their lives.\n\nThis is the situation in government-controlled parts of Syria, where medics say the coronavirus pandemic has reached crisis levels with health workers and facilities overwhelmed by the surge of cases across the country in recent weeks. The Syrian Health Ministry has only confirmed 112 Covid-19 deaths in the country since March, with a total of 2,765 cases in regime-held areas.Just in the last three weeks, the official number of cases has doubled but, according to health workers in Syrian regime-held areas, the figures do not begin to reflect the real scale of the outbreak. CNN spoke to three doctors in Damascus and Aleppo on the condition of anonymity, for fear of retribution from a government that tightly controls information. Read MoreAccording to all three doctors, the number of cases exploded at the end of July. One doctor in Aleppo said his hospital went from receiving four to five suspected Covid-19 cases in April to being swamped with 90-100 patients daily at the end of July and early August. CNN contacted the Syrian ministry of health with a list of questions about the ongoing Covid-19 crisis in the country but has not received a response. With serious equipment shortages, doctors say they are scrambling to save lives. Doctors in Damascus described recent scenes of panic with health workers making frantic calls to try to secure beds with ventilators for their patients. The struggle has been compounded by a lack of protective equipment for medical professionals.\"Patients are literally waiting for other patients to die so they can be on a ventilator with people using contacts to pressure hospitals to move their loved ones up on the ventilator waiting list,\" an Aleppo doctor using the name Ihsan told CNN. \"In all of this pandemic the hospital gave me only six N95 masks and I am sometimes working for 14 hours straight,\" Dr. Ihsan said. Some doctors and nurses are not even wearing masks in his hospital. \"I see that daily and I have to say this is completely the fault of hospital management for not providing (masks); don't expect staff to buy $60 masks when they make about $35 a month,\" he said. In Damascus, another doctor, who called himself Abd, said he was forced to sterilize his own disposable mask, and only following a social media campaign did some medical companies step in to provide additional supplies. The lack of protective equipment has meant the country's medical system -- already drained by years of civil war -- is losing doctors and healthcare staff to the virus. While there has been no confirmation of the total number of deaths of health care workers since the start of the pandemic, a list with the names of 61 medical professionals who have reportedly died has been circulating on pro-government sites. A senior Damascus health official confirmed some of the names on the list, but he could not confirm the total number of deaths. There is a \"loss of lives among the best doctors and nurses in Syria due to coronavirus,\" Dr. Shadi al-Najjar, the director of the Damascus Health Department told pro-government Sham FM. One doctor in Aleppo who spoke to CNN also confirmed the names of five doctors on the list. \"They forced us to work the entire week and expose the crew to danger, and the doctors, in this case, also became virus transmitters to others,\" another medic, who asked to be called Dr. Ahmad, told CNN. Officially, at least 76 health workers have tested positive for coronavirus as of August 21 -- according to ministry of health figures. That is nearly 4% of all test-confirmed cases. \"This highlights the particular risks faced by health care workers; and underscores -- given Syria's fragile healthcare system with already insufficient numbers of qualified health care personnel -- the potential for its overstretched health care capacity to be further compromised,\" the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, and the World Health Organization said in an August 24 report.The emotional impact of the crisis has been devastating for the country's health care workers who say they feel powerless and helpless as they watch patients, sometimes their own family members, die. Dr. Abd recalled the most shocking experience after he witnessed four colleagues in his hospital unable to save the lives of their own fathers. \"The worst feeling is the feeling of helplessness and inability to help,\" said Dr. Abd. \"This made me feel concerned about my family, as a doctor who is in direct touch with corona cases every day. I could bring this back to them. Many doctors sent their families outside Damascus,\" he said. For supporters of the regime like Al-Najjar, from the Damascus Health Department, the low official case count is due to a lack of testing capacity, not a concerted effort to hide the numbers. \"We are suffering from shortage of PCR testing kits ... there is no capacity to do major testing,\" he said in an interview with Sham FM.But even some vocal supporters of the regime like Dr. Bassam Zwan, a London-based Syrian doctor who is a frequent guest on Syrian government media, are critical of the Syrian health authorities' handling of the pandemic. Zwan warned that concealing the true extent of the spread of the virus is \"dangerous.\"\"We should announce that we have a high number, we should not hide the real numbers ... even if they have not been diagnosed, because we should be sounding the alarm, we would be placing the responsibility on international organizations. It is not something to be ashamed of, this is a pandemic that is spreading,\" Zwan said in a video message last month.The World Health Organization (WHO) says Syria poses a challenging operating environment for mitigating the impact of the pandemic. Syria's testing capacity, for example, is low although the country has made considerable headway since the outbreak. Current testing capacity is around 500 tests per day with plans to increase to 3,000 daily, according to WHO. The virus has hit Syria at a time when the country is already on its knees after more than nine years of civil war, facing an economic crisis and the harshest US sanctions to date. Its currency, the Lira, has lost much of its value in recent months and with rising unemployment and inflation, most of the population can no longer afford basic goods.\"Syria is in its 10th year of complex emergency with four concurrent crises affecting the capacity of the country and its health system to cope with the effects of the pandemic,\" WHO said. The socio-economic impact of the pandemic is compounded by the overall emergency context created by years of conflict, the financial crisis in Lebanon, and international sanctions, \"which despite having exemptions for humanitarian aid are greatly affecting the relief operations,\" according to WHO. The governments initially imposed a brief lockdown but faced with unprecedented economic pressure and a large part of its population depending on daily wages, the country reopened for business. The government has been promoting mask wearing and social distancing in awareness campaigns but so far enforcement and adherence has been low.There is still time to flatten the curve and prevent a complete collapse of the health sector through more testing, effective contact tracing and raising more awareness, according to the United Nations. \"It is absolutely not too late to take action that can at least mitigate the spread of COVID-19 in Syria\" Imran Riza, UN Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator for Syria told CNN.But for Syrians like Diaa, it feels like death lurks around every corner. \"There isn't a single street in Aleppo that doesn't have several houses with multiple coronavirus cases,\" the 31-year-old who asked to be identified only as Diaa for fear of government retribution told CNN. Diaa's sister began showing Covid-19 symptoms earlier this month, but she was turned away by the hospital. When her family asked for a test, hospital staff told them she would have to travel to Damascus. Since then the Syrian government has said they have opened up new facilities in cities outside the capital and will allow private laboratories to ramp up testing but time is running out.",

Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds.\n\n(CNN)Going off to college is, for many young adults, their first real plunge into freedom and adulthood. It's where they're encouraged to take risks and find new connections in dining halls and laundry rooms.\n\nBut those collegiate rites of passage aren't possible if they're largely confined to an extra-long twin bed in a stuffy dorm room, peering out at the world through barred windows. The fall 2020 semester looks a lot like that for some undergraduates who've returned to campus during the pandemic. And as anticipated, some of those undergrads have already started to rebel. Social students have packed fraternity houses and dorm hallways and snaked their way through bars -- all venues for coronavirus transmission. Schools including the University of North Carolina - Chapel Hill and the University of Notre Dame have had to send students home for virtual classes after clusters of coronavirus cases cropped up just days into the semester. Read MoreIt's easy to blame the clusters of cases solely on the students -- it plays perfectly into the stereotype of teenage recklessness and vanity. But their risky decisions have more to do with their development and mental resilience than conscious rule-breaking, three developmental psychologists told CNN. Meet the expertsCNN spoke with the following experts about the drivers behind these risky decisions: Hannah Schacter, an assistant professor and developmental psychologist at Wayne State UniversityBen Locke, the senior director for Counseling & Psychological Services at Pennsylvania State UniversityMary Karapetian Alvord, director of the private practice Alvord, Baker & Associates who mostly counsels children, teens and young adults. All three experts know college students well. Schacter teaches them; Locke counsels them on campus; Alvord is their psychologist back at home.Collegiate life doesn't look at all like what it used to, but many of the exciting firsts college promises -- freedom, independence and friendships -- are still there, and they're still luring students to act in ways that can expose them or others to coronavirus, they said. Teens are wired to take risksThere's some truth to the teenage stereotype of risk taking. Young adults are more prone to make in-the-moment decisions because they're wired that way. During adolescence and into adulthood, the brain region most sensitive to social rewards -- the amygdala -- develops at a much faster rate than the frontal cortex, the part of the brain responsible for rational, consequence-driven decision making. That imbalance may drive them to make decisions others deem risky, like visiting friends or attending a party, Locke said. \"Their decision making ... is more about 'what's in the moment, what am I missing out on, what is the thing that would make me happiest in this moment?'\" he said. Teens are also particularly sensitive to the potential rewards of risky decisions at this stage in their life. It's not that they don't understand the negative consequences, but they struggle to regulate those impulses that lead them to take risks because the potential reward is too great, said Schacter, who leads a lab at Wayne State University on adolescent relationships. \"It's this combination of being restricted from social contact for a while at an age where spending time with peers is so essential to development, to making teenagers feel good, and so, there's some sort of calculation going on where the perceived benefit -- 'I get to spend time with friends' -- seems to be outweighing the potential costs,\" Schacter said.When you plop students back on campus after a spring and summer spent cooped up in their childhood bedrooms, many of them will take those opportunities to connect with their friends and strangers. Their fear of the virus may be overtaken by their eagerness to connect, she said. They depend on social connections to build their identitiesThe pandemic hasn't dulled young people's desire to belong. \"No one's going back to college because they want to sit in their dorm all weekend by themselves,\" Schacter said. Peer approval is increasingly important throughout adolescence, and young adults depend on their social connections to build their identities. They still want to see their friends and meet new people, a hallmark of college that's become increasingly difficult when classes are conducted with students six feet apart -- or states apart, over Zoom. So some will party. \"Peers are so essential that it's no coincidence that we're seeing these behaviors more and that they're particularly peer-oriented,\" Schacter said. And there is a risk teenagers take quite seriously -- the risk of rejection. So if they see someone they respect or admire, or with some sort of perceived social power, ignoring social distancing guidelines or attending a party, they may hesitate to call that person out -- criticizing another student could mean their ostracization, Locke said.Alvord studies resilience, or the ability to cope with crises. Social connections, she said, build resilience. Having strong bonds and strong friendships helps us get through difficult times -- including times like these. For some students, isolation may feel scarier than the virus itself. \"The sense of belonging and peer acceptance, I think, outweighs judgment,\" Alvord said.They are getting mixed messages from adultsColleges can't seem to decide whether it's safe for students to return to campus. Many universities gave students mere days to move off-campus in March and resume classes virtually. Months later, they're canceling in-person classes after clusters of coronavirus cases appeared. But because schools have reopened, students may assume that they'll be safe to resume life as they knew it, Alvord said. They may also have internalized the general advice toward the beginning of the pandemic, Alvord said, which government officials have repeated in bids to reopen schools -- that children and teens are far less likely to get sick from coronavirus. (The risk of death is still relatively low, but some teenagers have died from Covid-19). \"The knowledge base has shifted, but I think it's sort of reinforced for a lot of them that they were not part of the high-risk group,\" Alvord said. Reopening schools and bringing students back to campus open up opportunities for exposure they wouldn't have had at home. The very act of resuming in-person classes makes it more likely for some students to do risky things, Schacter said. \"We can't control much, but we can control what sort of opportunities students have to break these rules,\" she said. \"Most college campuses are literally engineered to promote social interaction. Students coming back ... must navigate this in a way it wasn't built for.\" Universities host students from across the US and the world. Every family, city, state and country is handling coronavirus in unique ways. Bring them all back to campus and there are bound to be disconnects in whether they obey social distancing and mask guidelines, Locke said. \"The polarization of mask wearing as a public health expectation is something that's embedded in the arrival of students,\" he said. They're still processing the pandemicDisappointment is inevitable in times like these. Dashed expectations coupled with the challenges brought on by the pandemic that affect students in different ways leave them to navigate the uncertain present on their own.\"This is incredibly hard,\" Locke said. \"None of this is normal, none of this is baseline, all of this has elements that are disappointing in it.\"Preliminary health data has already confirmed what Locke and other psychologists feared was true -- that young people have been overwhelmed by anxiety and depression since the start of the pandemic. The National Center for Health Statistics and the US Census Bureau estimate that more than a third of Americans have experienced symptoms of depression and anxiety since spring. Some students may seek out activities that restore a sense of normalcy, or they could seek out the experiences they longed for that the pandemic threatened to cancel. \"There's this desire to hold on to the way that it used to be, the way they wanted it to be,\" Locke said. \"It's one of the hardest parts of the pandemic -- to reckon with a reality that none of us developed knowing about.\" Young people whose experiences with coronavirus are more personal may be more willing to obey those safety guidelines. But many Americans, luckily, have been spared by the virus. It may still seem foreign or improbable to young people who haven't experienced the virus, which could it seem less serious, the psychologists said. \"People often talk about how adolescents feel invulnerable,\" said Locke. \"And that may or may not be true. But that sense that your behavior impacts your entire community, or could cause your neighbor to die two months from now, is a really hard thing to take in.\" Schools may be taking the wrong approachAll three psychologists said they believe the majority of students are taking the pandemic seriously and acting accordingly. Viral videos of maskless parties and packed bars account for hundreds out of the nearly 20 million college students in the US, they said.The trouble with the Covid-19 pandemic, though, is that even a few students who break pandemic guidelines could set off a chain of infection that can -- and has -- canceled classes and activities, Schacter said. Schools have struggled to figure out what methods work to convince students to stay safe. And it's not a problem unique to college students -- adults are ignoring the advice of public health officials, too. It's already apparent, though, that schools telling students to abstain completely from social interaction or threatening them with suspension or worse doesn't work. It hasn't worked with other risky behaviors like drinking and driving or unprotected sex, either, Schacter said. Alvord said universities need to share that responsibility of keeping those on campus safe with students. Shifting blame onto students could stir up rebellion. At Penn State, Locke said he and his colleagues have tried to \"shift [the students'] culture of thinking\" to one of mutual benefit and sacrifice, one that requires everyone's buy-in to take care of each other. Getting 100% of students to obey safety guidelines is one of the challenges of Covid-19 that feels unsolvable -- how can a school keep thousands of students in line when sports teams with fewer than 50 members aren't even immuneRegarding students with empathy, the psychologists said, and acknowledging the sacrifices they've already made could be a good, if imperfect, place to start.",

        "body": "(CNN)As the nation focuses on safety issues around going back to school during the pandemic, a new report found a sharp increase in the number of Covid-19 cases among children in the United States.\n\nThere has been a 90% increase in the number of Covid-19 cases among children in the United States over the last four weeks, according to a new analysis by the American Academy of Pediatrics and the Children's Hospital Association that will be updated weekly.Dr. Sean O'Leary, vice-chair of the American Academy of Pediatrics Committee on Infectious Diseases, told CNN's Anderson Cooper on Monday that coronavirus cases in children should be taken seriously. \"It's not fair to say that this virus is completely benign in children,\" said O'Leary. \"We've had 90 deaths in children in the US already, in just a few months. Every year we worry about influenza in children, and there are roughly around 100 deaths in children from influenza every year.\"Leary said that multiple factors have led to a recent increase in the number of coronavirus infections in children in the past couple of weeks, including increased testing, increased movement among children and a rise in infection among the general population.Read More\"When you see a lot more infections in the general population, you're going to see a lot more infections in children,\" said O'Leary.\"We all have to take this virus seriously, including taking care of our children,\" said O'Leary.Deaths still rare The new report uses case numbers provided by state health departments of 49 states, New York City, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and Guam. There were 179,990 new Covid-19 cases among US children between July 9 and August 6, according to the report. At least 380,174 total child Covid-19 cases have been reported as of August 6. As of now, it still appears that severe symptoms are rare among children with Covid-19 infections. Children were between 0.5% and 5.3% of total hospitalizations, according to data from the states that record that information. Children were 0% to 0.4% of all Covid-19 deaths. Nineteen states have reported no child deaths. In states that tracked the details, 0% to 0.5% of all child Covid-19 cases resulted in death. However, experts worry those numbers may increase as cases in children rise and more children with autoimmune disorders and other risk facts are impacted.\"As case counts rise across the board, that is likely to impact more children with severe illness as well,\" O'Leary said in a news release from the AAP.The AAP called for an effective testing strategy so that communities can make the right choice about opening schools. \"In areas with rapid community spread, it's likely that more children will also be infected, and these data show that ... It is up to us to make the difference, community by community,\" AAP President Dr. Sally Goza said in the news release. \"To protect everyone in our communities -- children, teens, and older adults -- we must follow all the public health measures that we know can contain the virus. This includes physical distancing, wearing cloth face coverings, washing our hands, and avoiding large gatherings,\" O'Leary said.Children easily spread virusWhile some US leaders -- including President Trump -- have said the virus doesn't pose a large risk to children, one recent study suggests older children can transmit the virus just as much as adults. Another study said children younger than 5 carry a higher viral load than adults, raising even more questions about their role in transmission.\"Children ages zero to five can be \"highly infectious to other people. It turns out they have a thousand times more virus in their nose than you need to infect, so they're very, very contagious,\" said William Haseltine, a former professor at Harvard Medical School during an interview Monday on CNN.\"There's every reason to suspect that this virus, even though it can kill you, behaves pretty much like a cold virus, in terms of transmission. Who drives colds? Children drive colds,\" said Haseltine, known for his groundbreaking work on HIV/AIDS and the human genome.\"And that's true of almost all respiratory diseases, including the colds and including the colds that are caused by coronaviruses. And this is one of those cousins,\" Haseltine added. \"It even uses the same receptor in the nasal passages as one of the cold viruses. It just happens to be a cold virus that also kills.\"Need for ICU same as adultsA new report released Friday by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that when children are hospitalized due to Covid-19, they need the intensive care unit as often as adults do.The report looked at hospitalization records from 14 states and found 576 Covid-19 cases among children who needed hospitalization from March through July 25.Although not many children needed care in the hospital, if they were admitted, one in three needed to be treated in the intensive care unit, the CDC team reported. That's the same rate as for adults.\"Children can develop severe COVID-19 illness; during the surveillance period, one in three children were admitted to the ICU. Hispanic and black children had the highest rates of COVID-19--associated hospitalization,\" the team wrote.The CDC didn't have complete data on every child, but for the 208 that the CDC was able to do a complete medical chart review, it found 69 were admitted to the ICU and nearly 6% of them needed to be put on a ventilator. One of those children died.Children age 2 and younger were the most likely to be hospitalized. Hispanic and Black children were more likely to be hospitalized than White children. More than 40% had one or more underlying condition. Obesity was the most common underlying condition, followed by chronic lung disease.While Covid-19 symptoms tend to be mild in children, they can spread the disease. To slow the pandemic, the CDC said children should be encouraged to wash their hands often, keep a good physical distance away from others, and if they are 2 years of age or older, they should wear a mask when they are around people outside of their family members.",

        "body": "(CNN)When James Giannetta first called his brother Russ in late June to tell him that the coronavirus was beginning to spread in his Texas federal prison, Russ could hear the fear in his voice. \"This place is exploding,\" James warned.\n\nRuss soon got another call: James, a 65-year-old inmate with diabetes and HIV, had tested positive for the virus himself. Within days, he was rushed to a hospital as his oxygen levels plummeted. A few weeks later, after his condition deteriorated and he was placed on a ventilator, he was dead. As coronavirus has spread rapidly through prisons and jails around the country in recent months, the Texas lockup where Giannetta spent his last days has emerged as the hardest-hit federal prison in the United States. More than 1,300 of the roughly 1,750 prisoners at FCI Seagoville prison and camp have tested positive for the virus, according to data from the federal Bureau of Prisons -- a stunning three out of every four inmates. So far, three inmates at the prison, including Giannetta, have died from Covid-19. Five Seagoville inmates told CNN in phone interviews from behind bars that they feared for their lives as the virus rushed through the Dallas-area prison, and that the crowded conditions made it all but impossible for them to stay socially distanced. \"It came through here so fast that it's out of control,\" said Bobby Williams, an immunocompromised inmate who has about three years left on a more than two-decade drug sentence. He said he came down with severe pneumonia after contracting Covid-19 in June. \"We're packed like sardines.\" Read MoreAs the BOP has scrambled to stanch the spread of the virus in its facilities, the toll at Seagoville and elsewhere raises questions about whether the Trump administration is doing enough to release elderly and medically vulnerable prisoners -- even as several high-profile inmates like former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort, former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen and the rapper Tekashi 6ix9ine have been released from prison to home confinement. The BOP declined repeated requests for an interview with officials at Seagoville or national officials involved in setting coronavirus policy. A spokesperson said the agency distributed cloth masks to every inmate and guard, began mass testing of inmates in the prison by late June and stepped up sanitation procedures, among other policy changes. But the low-security men's prison -- which once held Japanese and German detainees during World War II, among others -- is now a cautionary tale for how quickly the coronavirus can take deadly hold in correctional facilities. Since the beginning of May, when there was only a single coronavirus case at Seagoville, the number of inmates who have tested positive has soared to 1,333, according to BOP data (including prisoners at a minimum-security camp next to the prison). Twenty-eight of the roughly 300 prison employees have also tested positive. The outbreak means that the facility has more coronavirus cases than about 85% of the counties in the US. Dr. Homer Venters, the former chief medical officer for New York City's jail system, who has inspected federal prisons' coronavirus response plans, said outbreaks at Seagoville and other prisons were like \"popcorn kernels popping off over an extended period of time.\"\"There are many facilities that either have gone through the same thing or will,\" he predicted. \"This is really a tragic situation that's playing out all over the country.\"Early release programs fall shortPrisoner rights advocates say that the BOP has fallen short on the most effective way to save inmate lives: reducing the number of vulnerable people inside the prisons. Federal inmates have two paths to early release during the pandemic. The BOP is evaluating inmates for home confinement, which is granted based on factors like inmates' age, risk factors for Covid-19, the seriousness of their offense and their conduct in prison. Manafort and several other high-profile inmates were released under this method, which was expanded under the CARES Act earlier this year.The agency has released 7,444 inmates to home confinement nationwide over the last four-and-a-half months, according to data released by the agency, out of the more than 157,000 total in the federal system. A spokesperson declined to provide specific numbers for Seagoville or other individual prisons, citing \"the fluid nature of the pandemic situation.\" Inmates can also apply for compassionate release, a procedure that was streamlined with the passage of the First Step criminal justice reform act in 2018. Inmates with health issues can ask a judge to reduce their sentence; they can also apply to their warden for the federal government to file a court motion for release on their behalf. So far, roughly 900 additional inmates have been released through that track this year, according to Families Against Mandatory Minimums, a criminal justice reform group that has helped recruit attorneys to represent inmates in coronavirus cases. But criminal justice experts call the releases so far a drop in the bucket compared with the vast numbers of elderly and medically vulnerable people in federal custody. Kevin Ring, the president of FAMM, said federal officials had been arguing in court against many inmates who have petitioned for compassionate release. \"It's been disappointing because most of these people were elderly and sick and now they're the most at risk from this disease,\" Ring said, arguing that the Trump administration \"should have been clearing these people out.\" Instead, he said, officials were \"slow to react\" when the coronavirus started its deadly march through prisons around the country. \"We've watched it hop from facility to facility -- when it hits one, it ravages it,\" Ring said. \"It has been terrifying to watch.\"Nationally, more than 10,000 federal inmates and 1,300 BOP employees have tested positive for coronavirus, while 111 inmates and one staffer have died. Several other federal prisons have also faced dramatic outbreaks, although none that infected as many inmates as Seagoville's. In Ohio, a judge ordered officials to release or transfer more than 800 vulnerable inmates at another federal prison ravaged by the virus, saying the conditions in the facility had possibly reached the level of \"cruel and unusual punishment.\" But an appeals court struck down that order in June, finding that the inmates did not prove the BOP was \"deliberately indifferent\" to the risks presented by Covid-19.Some Democrats in Congress have pointed to Manafort's release to argue that the administration isn't treating inmates equally. If the coronavirus was \"deadly enough of a virus that you needed to protect the former campaign manager, why not all of these Americans who also are vulnerable and have at-risk conditions?\" Rep. Sylvia Garcia, D-Texas, asked Attorney General William Barr at a House hearing last week. Barr said he had nothing to do with the decision to send Manafort home but noted that the department had released thousands of inmates.All five of the Seagoville inmates interviewed said they had been denied compassionate release or home confinement, and some said their families were planning to go to court. In a message denying his request for compassionate release, the prison's warden wrote that \"at this time COVID-19 is not considered extraordinary compelling circumstances\" under the BOP's compassionate release policy, inmate George Reagan told CNN.The BOP spokesperson said the agency didn't comment on specific inmates' requests for early release. For some inmates, the potential of early release came too late. Giannetta, a Massachusetts native who was serving a 14-year sentence for selling methamphetamine and other charges, applied for an early release from the warden and was denied, according to a filing by his court-appointed lawyer. The lawyer submitted an expedited motion for compassionate release on July 3, after he had already tested positive and been sent to a hospital. A judge dismissed the petition as moot after Giannetta died at the hospital on July 16. Giannetta's older brother Russ, a physics professor at the University of Illinois, said in an interview that he had sent medical documents outlining his brother's myriad health issues to officials at the prison and even wrote a letter to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, but his pleas for help didn't seem to have any effect.The Seagoville facility was a \"petri dish,\" Russ said. He said James knew even before he tested positive that he was in real danger: \"He had a pretty good premonition that this was not a place that was going to be able to contain this virus if it broke out.\"Prison struggles to respond to outbreakIn interviews, inmates at Seagoville described a chaotic response to the outbreak by prison officials, whose efforts to slow the spread of the virus were hampered by delayed test results and a lack of enforcement of mask-wearing policies. Bobby Williams, who has skin cancer and takes medicine that reduces his immune response, said he came down with pneumonia after testing positive for the virus. \"I thought I was going to die,\" he said. \"I was passing out, I couldn't breathe.\"He said doctors at the prison gave him steroid shots and a nasal spray that helped, but over a month later, he still feels the impact from the virus. Williams, 56, has been in federal prison for 22 years and has about three-and-a-half years left to go on drug and money laundering convictions. Venters, the former New York jail medical officer, has conducted dozens of inspections of coronavirus response efforts in prisons and jails around the country, including BOP facilities. He said that while he hadn't inspected Seagoville, the numbers and stories shared by inmates were troubling. \"What I've found over and over is there is no special protections or special surveillance for high-risk patients,\" Venters said. In many BOP facilities, he said, \"I have observed very large numbers of people in very close quarters, which makes the spread of this virus inevitable once somebody becomes sick.\"One difficulty has been the delay in getting test results. Curtis Severns, a Seagoville inmate scheduled to be released next year after an arson conviction based on disputed evidence, said that he and other inmates faced a four-day delay between taking a test and getting the result last month -- which meant that the prison didn't move some positive inmates out of the general population until it was too late.The BOP spokesperson said Seagoville was using a rapid 15-minute test machine as well as commercial lab tests that have turnaround times of three to 10 days.Severns, who tested positive and was mostly asymptomatic, said he is now living with five roommates -- all of whom have also tested positive -- in a small former TV room converted to housing. \"I was amazed just how fast (the virus) went, once it started going,\" he said. \"I think everybody here's going to get it.\"Mask wearing has been spotty among both guards and inmates, several inmates said, although they added that more people in the prison are now wearing masks regularly in the last week or two as cases have shot up.Joseph Perrone, who said he is scheduled to go to a halfway house in a few weeks after about a decade in prison for selling cocaine, said he suffered headaches, a loss of smell and the worst muscle aches of his life after testing positive. \"It felt like somebody beat me,\" he said. Perrone, 55, who said he worked in the prison's food service at the beginning of the outbreak, said most of the guards overseeing him weren't wearing their masks at the time and \"they didn't make us wear ours.\"\"I was going to work and I'm sure I was infecting people,\" he said. Now, as the cases have reached a level that could result in a form of herd immunity in the prison, officials are starting to move operations back to normal, according to a memo to inmates that several described to CNN. Coronavirus-positive inmates who are symptom-free for 10 days will be considered recovered in most cases, and they will start to be moved back to their original housing locations soon, the memo said.According to BOP statistics, 1,287 inmates at the prison have recovered from Covid-19, while 46 still have active cases.Beyond the prison wallsVisitation has been shut down at Seagoville and other federal prisons for months -- but outbreaks behind bars can still spread to local communities as guards and other employees go back and forth to work. Correctional officers at the facility say they're scared to walk inside the prison's walls, especially because while the agency has tested most of the inmates, it hasn't done the same for the prison's 283 employees. Anthony Simon, a case worker at the prison and a representative for the local union, said he had appealed to the management for broader testing. When he comes home from working at the prison or attending to inmates at a local hospital, Simon said, he strips off his clothes, puts them in a bag and showers before even greeting his wife. \"Everyone's worried they could bring it home to their family,\" Simon said. \"But you're still required to go to work -- we can't leave the inmates by themselves and say we'll come back later.\"The BOP spokesperson said the agency couldn't require employees to get tested, but it's providing staff who come in close contact with Covid-19-positive inmates a letter to public health departments that can help them get prioritized for testing.Research has suggested that prison coronavirus cases can seed broader outbreaks in their local communities. A study of Chicago's Cook County Jail found that inmates going in and out of the jail may be linked with more than 15% of all the virus cases in Illinois as of April. Still, local officials in Dallas County said they didn't think that Seagoville was having a major impact outside the prison itself. The prison outbreak \"has not strained our local health resources as the facility has handled their own response and contact tracing,\" said Lauren Trimble, the chief of staff for the Dallas County Judge, the county's top executive. Family members of inmates have organized several protests in front of the prison in recent months. One of the protest organizers, Tabitha Wheeler-Reagan, a Dallas entrepreneur and activist whose husband is a Seagoville inmate, said she thought people in the community weren't paying enough attention to the human suffering in the prison. Her husband George Reagan, 55, who is scheduled to be released from a more than 5-year drug sentence next year, was sharing a cell with another inmate who got coronavirus in late June, she said. Reagan tested negative twice, so the prison didn't isolate him from the other inmates, Wheeler-Reagan said. Then, early last month, Reagan called his wife with ominous news: he had lost his sense of taste. She said she immediately called the prison and demanded he get tested again. Once he did, he tested positive. Wheeler-Reagan said she thinks the prison leadership didn't take the outbreak seriously enough early on and the guards didn't have proper training about how to respond. She was confused why prison officials rejected her husband's bid for home confinement during the pandemic, especially considering he has heart disease and he'll likely be eligible to go to a halfway house later this year, she said.\"I one hundred percent don't think that the federal government cares at all,\" Wheeler-Reagan said. \"This is one of those situations where they can't blame anybody but themselves.\"\n\nCNN's Collette Richards contributed to this report.",

        "body": "(Kaiser Health News)If all goes according to plan, Penn State University students who opt for an on-campus experience this fall will start in-person classes this week under the banner of a \"Mask Up or Pack Up\" campaign.\n\nBy returning to campus, students are agreeing to wear masks, adhere to social distancing practices and submit to random testing for Covid-19.But \"Mask Up or Pack Up\" also offers a less traditional, more proactive approach to virus containment: the smell test.\"Our message is, 'If you have sudden-onset smell loss, in the absence of other explanatory history like a head injury, the chance of you being infected is high,'\" said John Hayes, a professor in the department of food science at Penn State and director of the Sensory Evaluation Center in the College of Agricultural sciences. \"This is about raising awareness that smell loss is an early symptom of Covid-19.\"Hayes' department plans to send scented scratch-and-sniff postcards to students, asking them to monitor their sense of smell. There will be other reminders throughout campus, such as flower arrangements that invite people to \"smell the roses\" before entering a lecture hall.Read MoreBottom line, said Hayes: \"We're telling our community if you lose your sense of smell, you should self-isolate and immediately get tested.\"It's advice that might help people throughout the world contain the spread of the Covid virus.According to Danielle Reed, associate director of the Monell Chemical Senses Center in Philadelphia, the loss of the sense of smell is one of the best and earliest indicators of Covid-19.\"More Covid patients have loss of sense of smell than have a fever,\" Reed said. \"Yet fever is often first on the checklist of Covid symptoms and sense of smell is at the bottom, like an afterthought. We think it should be near or at the top.\"A recent study based on a worldwide survey of 25,000 patients by the Global Consortium for Chemosensory Research found that Covid-19 is more strongly associated with smell and taste than with fever, cough or shortness of breath, though the latter are the \"cardinal symptoms currently highlighted by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). \"The study has not yet been peer-reviewed.Several other studies have linked the loss of smell to the virus. Researchers at the Mayo Clinic reported in June that patients with Covid-19 were 27 times more likely to lose their sense of smell than people without the virus, while less than three times as likely to report fever and/or chills. Another analysis of medical records by Mayo researchers suggested that routine screening for those changes \"could contribute to improved case detection in the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic.\"Proteus Duxbury, former chief technology officer for the Colorado health insurance exchange, now lives in Northern Ireland and heads service delivery for a National Health Service trust. Suffering from what seemed a mild cold in early March, Duxbury noticed he couldn't smell or taste his meal. Luckily, a colleague passed along the then-brand-new hypothesis that Covid affected these senses, and Duxbury isolated, though he had no other disease symptoms.\"I didn't have cough, headache, fever or shortness of breath,\" said Duxbury. \"But everything tasted like cardboard. The first thing I did every morning was put my head in the coffee jar and take a real deep breath. Nothing.\"Two weeks later, his sense of smell began to return; three months after that, he had a positive antibody test. Today, nearly six months after his recovery from Covid-19, Duxbury reports his senses are back but slightly dulled.Scientists have hypothesized that the loss of smell is caused by damage to olfactory sensory neurons. The Covid virus actively attacks neighboring cells in the nasal cavity that express ACE2, a protein that acts as a receptor for the virus. In doing so, the olfactory cells may also become inflamed and \"paralyzed.\" Thus, the sudden inability to smell.Because the loss of smell is an early symptom, it may be helpful in screening otherwise asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic Covid carriers, according to researchers. It is often the only symptom present in people who otherwise feel fine and don't think of themselves as sick, leading them to unwittingly spread the virus. Though only 50% of Covid-19-positive patients list smell loss as a complaint, specific questioning leads to a significantly higher rate of around 70% to 75%, according to a study recently submitted by the Monell research team to the NIH.Loss of smell has been tied to other upper respiratory ailments in the past, so it is not a foolproof exercise. Still, E. John Wherry, chair of the department of systems pharmacology at the University of Pennsylvania and director of the university's Institute for Immunology, is cautiously optimistic about the potential for smell tests to help in the fight against Covid -- while noting results can be misinterpreted.\"The idea is very attractive because we need testing any way we can get it and there's just not enough to go around,\" Wherry said. \"The other side of the equation is that people who wake up with allergies or a hangover and can't smell the coffee as well as they did yesterday might panic and run to urgent care for a test. It would be good to understand the costs.\"That's why researchers stress that the loss of smell associated with Covid is not subtle. \"It's not a matter of degrees of discrimination,\" Reed said. \"This isn't something you miss.\"The smell loss associated with Covid-19 is swift and utter. It could involve waking up one morning and not being able to smell your shampoo, aftershave or coffee. And it may be disorienting because it's not typically accompanied by nasal congestion, which is how most people have experienced smell reduction in the past.It's also an extremely strong indicator, so there should be no second-guessing. Anyone who experiences an abrupt, unexplained loss of smell should take it seriously: Self-isolate and get tested for Covid-19.Johan Lundstr\u00f6m, a Swedish-based biologist with the Monell Chemical Senses Center, is using the evidence uncovered by the global consortium report to help track incipient Covid-19 outbreaks before they take hold.Working with the Edith Wolfson Medical Center and the Weizmann Institute of Science, both in Israel, Lundstr\u00f6m created smelltracker.org -- a website that provides users with a simple daily smell test they can self-administer using five household items. Once they have chosen their set of odorants -- such as cinnamon, peanut butter, mustard and coffee -- respondents rate the odors with respect to pleasantness and strength.Rather than collect personal data, smelltracker.org aggregates the responses in a neighborhood, region or city, so researchers see only trends. When an increasing number of people in those areas report they have a reduced, impaired or no sense of smell, public officials can move in with widespread PCR testing.\"This test is quick and very cheap, people like doing it, and it gives them some awareness and reassurance about their own health,\" Lundstr\u00f6m said. \"It's also very good at helping public health officials decide how and where to spend their resources to implement widespread testing using the proper COVID regime.\"Currently, smelltracker.org is being used by health officials in regions of Israel and in Italy, where citizens are encouraged to sign up. But the website is available worldwide, with instructions in 15 languages. Interest from other countries is beginning to grow.No one is recommending that smell tests replace traditional swab or saliva testing. But Reed, Hayes and Lundstr\u00f6m all believe that better education around this unique Covid-19 symptom will lead to greater engagement and care on the part of people who don't feel sick themselves.Perhaps the best part of smell testing is that it doesn't involve discomfort or stigma, and it can easily be turned into a game. Soon, Reed said, instead of being zapped with a digital thermometer, individuals who are entering a meeting or store may be handed a card with three peel-off stickers and asked which one has a scent.\"I'm an optimist and I believe people do not want to spread this disease,\" Hayes said. \"Our students don't want to. If we give them the tools to know when they might be sick, they'll help us keep our campus safe.\"\n\nKHN (Kaiser Health News) is a nonprofit news service covering health issues.

Athletes will continue to take classes online and be able to participate in workouts while following safety protocols, it added.UNC is a member of the Atlantic Coast Conference, which has announced plans to begin its football and other fall sports seasons the week of September 7.Moseley, however, questioned how the school can say it's safe to play sports if it's not safe to attend class.\"How is ACC going to be able to make a decision to bring people into these communities that are seeing a rise in cases already?\" he said.School's positivity rate soaredThe school has just a 5.5% capacity for on-campus students who need to quarantine, its tracking dashboard shows. Of 73 rooms available Monday afternoon, only four were available to students. The positivity rate among students rose to 13.6% of the 954 students tested during the week that ended Sunday, and five employees also tested positive, according to the university's Covid-19 dashboard. As of Monday morning, 177 students were in isolation and 349 were in quarantine, both on and off campus.Most had mild symptoms, Guskiewicz and Executive Vice Chancellor and Provost Robert A. Blouin said in a letter to the community.On Sunday, UNC announced a fourth cluster of Covid-19 cases on campus, defined as five or more cases in proximity. Two clusters were identified at residence halls, one as at a private apartment complex that houses some students, and another was among members of a fraternity.Two universities in Oklahoma have also seen a significant number of cases.An Oklahoma State University sorority house is under quarantine after 23 members tested positive for Covid-19, according to the university.Colorado College in Colorado Springs said 155 students are currently in quarantine for 14 days at a residence hall after a new student arrived on campus and tested positive for Covid-19.\n\nCNN's Alex Medeiros, Aleks Klosok and Artemis Moshtaghian contributed to this report.",

Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds.\n\n(CNN)The United States has what it takes to get Covid-19 case levels down to more manageable levels by Election Day in November if it uses masks and other \"fundamental tenets of infection control\" -- but it needs to get serious now, Dr. Anthony Fauci told CNN on Thursday.\n\n\"We can be way down in November ... if we do things correctly , and if we start right now,\" Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told CNN's \"New Day.\"Fauci's roadmap is the same one he's been preaching, including using masks in public, social distancing and washing hands.And he points to hopeful signs that this works. Arizona, which had a significant outbreak this summer, has \"started to really clamp down and do things right,\" he said.Arizona went from averaging near 4,000 cases a day in early July to below 2,000 new cases a day now, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.Read More\"I really do believe, based on the data we see in other countries, and in the United States, in states and cities and counties that have done it correctly, that if we pay attention to the fundamental tenets of infection control and diminution of transmission, we can be way down in November,\" Fauci said.\"Everybody on the team of American citizens needs to pull together. ... It's up to us,\" he said.The world may never eradicate coronavirus, but it can get it under control, Fauci saysA day earlier, Fauci said Covid-19 may never be eradicated completely, but states' efforts to enforce measures against the virus and the race to a vaccine could keep it from drastically disrupting life in the United States again.With 4.7 million cases and 158,249 deaths across the US alone, Fauci said Wednesday that the \"highly transmissible\" virus isn't likely to be eradicated from the planet. The conclusion drawn by the nation's leading infectious disease expert contrasts with that of President Donald Trump, who on Wednesday said the virus will \"go away.\"Fauci said the US can get on top of the virus with a good vaccine and prudent safety measures.\"We may need to go through a season of it and then by next season, if we have a vaccine, it won't be a pandemic, it won't be immobilizing the world, it won't be destroying the economy,\" he said.At least 39 states as well as Washington, DC, and Puerto Rico have put some type of order in place that mandates the use of masks, and vaccines are advancing through development in hopes of reaching the public in 2021, Fauci has said. Still, the nation still is missing the cohesive response to the virus he would like to see.\"We had a disparate response,\" Fauci said. \"But totally, as a nation, we are in that situation where we've got to get that control way down to a low baseline.\"States taking matters into their own handsWithout a strong national game plan in place, state leaders are taking control of coronavirus measures.Testing, contact tracing, masks and distancing have all been stressed by health experts as measures that could help reduce the spread of the virus and bring numbers down to the baseline necessary to reopen safely.To ramp up production of tests that can give results in 15 to 20 minutes, governors from Maryland, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Michigan, Ohio and Virginia reached an agreement to run a total of 3 million rapid antigen tests, according to a statement released Tuesday. Meanwhile, when people do test positive in Virginia, a new app announced by Gov. Ralph Northam on Wednesday will alert those they have been in close contact with of their potential exposure. COVIDWISE uses Bluetooth Low Energy technology, not personal information or location data, to detect when people have been in close enough range, according to a release.North Carolina is extending Safer at Home Phase 2 for another five weeks to reduce the number of people congregating and spreading the virus as schools reopen, Gov. Roy Cooper announced Wednesday. And Mississippi, which ranks fifth among states for highest cases per-capita, has gone from mandating masks in only the counties with the worst numbers to requiring them at public gatherings statewide.\"I (had) taken a piecemeal approach (to masks) because I believe firmly that this was the best way to get the most number of people to participate,\" Gov. Tate Reeves told reporters Tuesday. \"I believe that there is enough motivation (now) to safely get our kids in school that we can really juice the participation of mask wearing throughout our state for the next two weeks.\"Young and those without symptoms driving up casesCase numbers are being driven up by people who are not taking the virus seriously, Fauci told CNN's Dr. Sanjay Gupta.\"The good news about Covid-19 is that about 40% of the population has no symptoms. ... The bad news, for messaging, is that 40% of the population get no symptoms.\"That makes it difficult to present a clear and consistent message about the dangers of the virus.\"As long as you have any member of society, any demographic group, who's not seriously trying to get to the end game of suppressing this, it will continue to smolder and smolder and smolder,\" he said. \"And that will be the reason why, in a non-unified way, we've plateaued at an unacceptable level.\" Since the beginning of June, the case rate for people in the age group of 30 to 49 nearly tripled and the case rate for people between the ages of 18 to 29 nearly quadrupled, Los Angeles County Department of Public Health Director Dr. Barbara Ferrer said. \"This is also the age group that is most likely to be attending the large parties that we keep seeing,\" said Dr. FerrerAs a result, the county health officer has imposed a new \"legally binding\" order prohibiting gatherings, including parties.Schools facing tough decisions School districts have been at the center of a difficult debate about whether or not to reopen schools for in-person classes as infections continue to spread.Early in the outbreak, health experts believed severe infections and spread were less likely among children. But more recent data shows that while children are far less likely to die from Covid-19 than adults, they can still pass the disease on to others.But keeping students home could lead to millions of parents being forced to quit their jobs, according to economists from Goldman Sachs.Single parents, those whose jobs do not allow them to work from home and those without access to child care are at risk of having to choose between sending their children to school -- whether or not they think its safe -- or quitting their job to stay home with them, said Dr. Edith Bracho-Sanchez, a primary care pediatrician and assistant professor of pediatrics at Columbia University Irving Medical Center.\"We have failed the parents and the kids of this country,\" she said.Correction: An earlier version of this story incorrectly stated Mississippi's rank among states for coronavirus cases. It is the the fifth-highest per capita.\n\nCNN's Shelby Lin Erdman, Gisela Crespo, Rebekah Riess, Amanda Watts, Rashard Rose, Jennifer Henderson, Sarah Moon and Holly Yan contributed to this report.",

        "body": "(CNN)Two new trials soon will be underway in the United States to investigate antibody treatment approaches for Covid-19 patients.\n\nThe National Institutes of Health announced on Tuesday that it is launching two advanced trials to test monoclonal antibodies in patients with Covid-19, one for patients with mild disease and another for patients who are hospitalized.Monoclonal antibodies are immune system proteins that specifically home in on a single target. In coronavirus, they are targeted to a single structure on the body of the virus. The hope is to slow or even prevent infection.\"Studying the impact of this investigational therapeutic on multiple patient populations at the same time is critical to determining whether it can help Covid-19 patients with differing levels of disease severity,\" Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's top infectious disease expert and director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Director, said in the announcement. \"These concurrent trials have the potential to yield significant and comprehensive clinical data,\" he said.Read MoreNIH starts antibody treatment clinical trials In April, NIH announced the formation of the program Accelerating COVID-19 Therapeutic Interventions in Vaccine or ACTIV. Since then, the program has \"evaluated hundreds\" of therapeutic agents with potential application to Covid-19, NIH Director Dr. Francis Collins said on Tuesday. The two newly launched advanced trials are part of that ACTIV program.\"Today we are announcing the first therapeutic trial to be launched as part of ACTIV. ACTIV 2 is a Phase 2 trial of the Eli Lilly monoclonal antibody that can expand seamlessly to Phase 3,\" Collins said during a phone call with reporters on Tuesday. That Phase 2 trial will include people with mild disease who are not hospitalized for coronavirus treatment, Collins said.Fauci added that the \"fundamental strategy\" for a monoclonal antibody \"is to interfere with the virus's ability to infect,\" and the goal of the trial is to see if the treatment approach \"reduces the duration of symptoms.\"The ACTIV 2 Phase 2 trial will be done in eight weeks and researchers should know by October or November if the therapeutic works, Fauci said.ACTIV also will include a more advanced, Phase 3 trial, Collins said. \"ACTIV 3 is a Phase 3 trial in hospitalized adults, but also begins with Lilly's monoclonal, but allows for other types of therapeutics as well,\" he said.Specifically, ACTIV 3 will be for patients who require hospitalization but without end stage organ failure, Fauci said. \"The primary objective is a sustained recovery for 14 days at home, after hospital discharge,\" he said.Collins said that NIH is \"thrilled\" about launching the two trials.\"So keeping them straight: ACTIV 2 -- outpatient, ACTIV 3 -- inpatients,\" he said. \"We're thrilled to reach this point in record time.\"The monoclonal antibody treatment being studied in the two trials is named LY-CoV555. It was made by the pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly and Co. in cooperation with AbCellera from an antibody first identified in a blood sample taken from one of the first US patients to recover from Covid-19.The NIH trial of Eli Lilly's antibody treatment is just one of many. 'We don't have that time'In June, Lilly became the first company in the United States to start testing an antibody therapy in humans and now it has several antibody therapy trials that are ongoing. \"The creation, testing and approval of a novel custom designed monoclonal antibody medicine like this usually takes years, if not a decade. We don't have that time,\" Lilly chief scientific officer Dr. Dan Skovronsky said. One trial underway is a Phase 3 trial that is currently recruiting residents and staff in long-term care facilities that have a recent case of Covid-19. That trial launched Monday. US trials that Lilly launched in June have been looking at the impact its antibody treatment LY-CoV555 had in hospitalized patients and in people with mild to moderate symptoms. Eli Lilly also has a separate trial in China of another antibody treatment it developed with Junshi Biosciences, called JS016. The company said in the future it plans to test other antibodies, and what's known as a cocktail form of antibody treatment, that have shown to neutralize the virus well in the lab. Overall, there are at least 60 monoclonal antibody therapies and 12 convalescent plasma treatments for Covid-19 under investigation as of August, according to Bio, an association that represents the biopharma industry.Once proven to be safe and effective, how much a monoclonal antibody therapy could cost and how many doses the US government might buy remains to be seen.While the federal government may be buying up possible coronavirus vaccines ahead of time, buying treatments such as drugs and antibodies is a different matter, Dr. Janet Woodcock, a Food and Drug Administration official who leads therapeutics development for Operation Warp Speed, said during a phone call with reporters on Tuesday.\"The therapeutic landscape is much wider,\" Woodcock said, adding there are multiple different modalities of therapy.She said that advanced purchasing of therapeutics is going to be slower, because, \"out of these vast inventories of potential candidates, we have to select the most promising ones. We can't just buy advanced purchases of 600 different agents.\"With vaccines \"it's very clear what you're going to do,\" she said. \"The primary goal is to vaccinate people and protect them... with therapeutics it's a little more complicated.\"",

        "body": "(CNN)In a shift that perplexed some doctors, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has changed its Covid-19 testing guidelines to say some people without symptoms may not need to be tested, even if they've been in close contact with someone known to have the virus.\n\nPreviously, the CDC said viral testing was appropriate for people with recent or suspected exposure, even if they were asymptomatic.\n\nDr. Leana Wen, an emergency physician and public health professor at George Washington University who was previously Baltimore's health commissioner, said on CNN's New Day on Wednesday that the testing guideline changes make no sense.\"These are exactly the people who should be tested,\" Wen said, giving the example of a person exposed at work who wants a test so they can protect their family at home.Here's what the CDC website said previously: \"Testing is recommended for all close contacts of persons with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Because of the potential for asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic transmission, it is important that contacts of individuals with SARS-CoV-2 infection be quickly identified and tested.\" The CDC changed the site on Monday. Here's what it says now: \"If you have been in close contact (within 6 feet) of a person with a COVID-19 infection for at least 15 minutes but do not have symptoms, you do not necessarily need a test unless you are a vulnerable individual or your health care provider or State or local public health officials recommend you take one.\" Read MoreThose who don't have Covid-19 symptoms and haven't been in close contact with someone with a known infection do not need a test, the updated guidelines say. \"Not everyone needs to be tested,\" the agency's website says. \"If you do get tested, you should self-quarantine/isolate at home pending test results and follow the advice of your health care provider or a public health professional.\" The CDC guidelines say if someone has symptoms and they're mild, a health care provider \"may advise a COVID-19 test,\" and if symptoms are severe, people should contact a health care provider or seek emergency care.\"It is important to realize that you can be infected and spread the virus but feel well and have no symptoms,\" the updated CDC site says, noting that local public health officials might request asymptomatic \"healthy people\" be tested, depending on cases and spread in an area.In its pandemic planning scenarios, the CDC says its current best estimate is that 40% of infections are asymptomatic and 50% of transmission occur before symptoms occur.The CDC did not explain the change, and doctors were puzzled by it.\"I'm concerned that these recommendations suggest someone who has had substantial exposure to a person with Covid-19 now doesn't need to get tested,\" Wen said.\"This is key to contact tracing, especially given that up to 50% of all transmission is due to people who do not have symptoms. One wonders why these guidelines were changed -- is it to justify continued deficit of testing?\"A spokesperson at the US Department of Health and Human Services denied the change would affect contact tracing efforts, which most public health officials say is key to any eventual control of the virus. \"The updated guidance does not undermine contact tracing or any other types of surveillance testing,\" the spokesperson said. HHS said people should consult with their doctors or with local health officials to decide if they need to be tested.\"The guidance fully supports public health surveillance testing, done in a proactive way through federal, state, and local public health officials,\" the spokesperson said.",

        "body": "Chat with us in Facebook Messenger. Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds.\n\n(CNN)Are you ready to make your mark on history? When you exercise your right to vote on November 3, you will have done something that no American has done for more than 50 years: voted during a deadly pandemic.\n\nThe \"Hong Kong flu\" hit the United States in September 1968, and while it ultimately killed more than 100,000 Americans over the next two years, the impact on the 1968 election was minimal. Cases began to climb the week after the election, peaking during December, with another wave the following year -- mitigated by a vaccine that was already in place.That's not today's reality. There is no vaccine available. As of August 31, at least 183,598 people in the United States have died from the deadly novel coronavirus, according to the latest numbers from Johns Hopkins University's Coronavirus Resource Center.Over 6 million people in the US have been diagnosed with Covid-19, and the numbers are still rising in many parts of the nation.Considering these facts, is it safe to vote in person on election day 2020? Or should you choose early voting or a mail-in ballot? Read MoreExperts say the answer depends on a variety of factors unique to you -- your personal risk, the degree of Covid-19 transmission in your local area and your willingness to plan and execute personal safety precautions while casting your vote.\"Make a voting plan. Make that voting plan early and have a backup plan for your plan,\" advised Hannah Klain, an Equal Justice Works fellow in the democracy program at the Brennan Center for Justice in New York City.\"Having a plan so that you don't end up having to choose between your health and your fundamental right to vote is the most critical thing that that voters could do right now,\" Klain said.1. Check the dataIt's critical to know if the virus is spreading in your local area when you're about to go to the polls, said Dr. Marybeth Sexton, an assistant professor of medicine in the division of infectious diseases at Emory University in Atlanta.\"If you're in an area that has really gotten control of Covid-19, and it's having very little spread in the community, that's safer than areas that are having ongoing outbreaks in terms of being around people,\" Sexton said.Your county's virus status can be found in real time on several national trackers, such as the one maintained by Johns Hopkins or the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia's PolicyLab. Most state and local governments are also providing citizens with regular snapshots so you can also call or check online as well. Tip: To avoid being the victim of mis- or disinformation, rely on official tallies by trusted officials and institutions for these numbers on rate of viral spread before you make your decision.2. Know your riskRemember: Anyone can be infected by the novel coronavirus -- no matter your age or how healthy you are, although people with certain underlying conditions are at higher risk for serious complications such as being put onto a ventilator in the ICU.It's true that younger people are more likely to have mild symptoms, or no symptoms at all -- but a growing number of healthy young people are getting very sick. Some even die. Others may become members of the Covid-19 \"long-haulers\" club, unable to shake the aftermath of the virus for months.If you're not at high risk for the virus and community transmission is low, consider volunteering to be a poll worker, Sexton suggested.\"The more people they have staffing the location, the faster and more orderly the process,\" she said. \"Then they may be able to move people through so that people aren't standing in line for a long period of time.\"3. Mail it in If you live in an area where virus transmission has been high -- or you are in a high-risk group -- that may be a good reason to consider obtaining an absentee ballot and voting by mail, experts say.It's a breeze to get an application for your voting district at Vote.org -- or the U.S. Vote Foundation -- just fill in a short form and you'll be sent an email with the application. All you have to do is print it, sign it and send it to the address provided.When should your absentee ballot arrive to be counted? Vote.org also has a list of deadlines by state -- as does U.S. Vote Foundation -- but it's best to double-check in case your state has implemented changes due to Covid-19. Both organizations also have a list of resources by state you can use to verify your state's rules.4. Dropping off your mail-in ballotSome voters plan to deliver their mail-in ballot in person. If that's nothing more than opening a mail slot and inserting your ballot, you'll be fine as long as you immediately use hand sanitizer.If you have to wait outside -- be sure to wear a mask and practice at least 6 feet social distancing recommendations. If you have to enter a building, read on for specific advice.5. Voting in personVoting in person is a cherished right for many Americans -- and for people concerned that their ballot might be lost in the mail, this may be their preferred option.Standing in long lines at the polling center with people who may or may not be wearing masks, often inside buildings without good ventilation, certainly raises your risk of catching Covid-19.But there are things you can do to reduce risk if you vote in person.Protect your community -- starting now: We're only a couple of months away from the election, and experts say taking action now to make the community safer ahead of the election is one of the best things we can do to protect ourselves and our loved ones.\"I put voting in the same category as getting kids back to school -- these are things that should be really important to us,\" Sexton said. \"So this is a time to continue to limit large gatherings, avoid in-person dining and not be at bars and parties, because the level of virus in the community is going to determine how safe it is to vote in person. So everything we can do to make the community safer ahead of time will make voting safer.\"Check your polling station: What's the level of protection that will be in place at your assigned polling station? You should know in advance, for example:If you'll be spending the majority of your wait standing outsideIf masks are required of both voters and poll workersIf 6-feet spacing markers will be visible on floors to control social distancingIf there is a separate entrance and exit from the voting areaIf there will be a Plexiglas barrier between the voter and the poll workerIf poll workers will be wearing face shields, surgical face masks and glovesIf there will be adequate space between voting privacy booths If poll workers will sanitize frequently touched surfaces, such as door handles, voting booths and bathrooms regularly\"Outdoors is just dramatically safer than indoors because of the airflow,\" said infectious disease specialist Sexton, adding that any time spent indoors should be minimized.You also want to vote at a location that has a separate point of entry and exit to minimize crowds forming in the space.\"My polling place historically ends up with a two way line sneaking up and down a large enclosed hallway, which is not something that you would want to do right now,\" Sexton said.\"Talk to your local government about your local polling place and what they've thought through about safety,\" Sexton said. \"Some of these things can be rectified by limiting the number of people who come indoors at any one point in time, and really spacing out stations and spacing out the line, and then making sure that everybody is masked.\"The safest locations will be school gymnasiums, community recreation centers, convention centers and large parking lots, according to the Brennan Center and the Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines.Tip: Do not vote in person if your polling station is located at a high-risk facility, such as a senior care facility. Some districts plan to offer curbside voting, especially for those who are not feeling well or who are at extremely high risk, according to Klain.\"If election workers are doing curbside voting, we would want them to have additional PPE like gloves, a face shield and a face mask,\" Klain said.Vote early: If your district allows, voting early -- which begins as early as September in some states -- is an excellent way to cut down on your exposure to the virus as crowds will be reduced. You can find out if your state allows early voting on Vote.org or check with your state.Even if you can't vote on a different day than November 3, stay in touch with local friends on Facebook or a neighborhood site like Nextdoor. People will often post updates about crowds at different times of the day, which can be used to plan your trip.Carefully choose your mask (and be sure to wear it over your nose and mouth): Wearing a mask over the mouth but leaving the nose exposed defeats the purpose of a mask, studies have shown. Since the vast majority of us are not mouth breathers, the virus is mostly likely to enter as you take a breath through your nose. So cover both nose and mouth when wearing a mask, experts say.While any mask is better than nothing, studies have shown that cotton masks with two or three layers of fabric are more protective than single-ply masks or bandanas. In fact, a recent study found bandanas and gaiter masks to be least effective in protection.\"You don't want a mask that when you hold it up you can see your hand on the other side of it,\" she said. \"If you use a filter in your mask, be sure to change it regularly because it can clog. You can tell if it gives you a sensation that's a little harder to breathe.\"Be especially wary of the look-alike N95 type masks being sold at major retail distributors, Sexton said.\"Some of those community use N95-masks have exhalation valve in them,\" she said. \"They do make them more comfortable to wear, but you're not protecting the people around you -- it's putting your airflow right out in the environment. \"It may actually make things worse because it concentrates your breath into that valve, allowing it to come through with some force and the droplets may travel a little farther. So we strongly recommend that people don't wear a mask that has an exhalation valve.\"Vote alone: Unless you have a disability that requires assistance, vote alone, experts say. This is not the year to bring your children or other non-voting family members to the voting location. \"I remember going with my parents to vote, but this year that's probably not the best idea. We want to really minimize the number of unnecessary people at the polling place,\" Klain said.Come prepared: Along with that highly protective mask, you should definitely be wearing a mask and carrying tissues, along with a hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol or disinfecting wipes, the CDC says.\"It may be helpful to bring your own pen, too, because sometimes you have to sign the voter card or mark a paper ballot,\" Sexton said.If you and others are following the 6-foot rule, the most likely interpersonal contact during voting is between the voter and the polling workers checking you in.\"Ideally there'd be a Plexiglas barrier, and in states where voters have to provide ID, they'd be able to just show their ID through the Plexiglas barrier,\" Klain said. \"Minimizing the number of shared items that voters touch and election workers touch is really critical.\" If your voting station has touch-screen voting, you should bring along a cotton swab, finger cover or glove to cast your vote instead of using your finger. Be sure to immediately discard those aids (peel the glove off from your wrist inside out to avoid cross-contamination). \"There is a lot of excitement and enthusiasm around this election, and that is a wonderful thing,\" Klain said \"But no one should feel caught unawares by the election that's coming, and the best way is to make a plan. \"If you're going to vote by mail, request your mail ballot as early as possible, return it as early as possible. If you're going to vote in person, consider voting early, when the lines will probably be shorter so not everyone is going on the same day,\" Kalin added.And if you're going to vote in person on Election Day, wear personal protection and take any steps you can to keep not only yourself safe, but keep the election workers who are sacrificing their time and bodies for the sake of the election safe as well.\"",

Body mass index or BMI is a common measurement based on a person's height and weight to determine whether they are underweight, overweight or obese.\n\nThe researchers, who are from various universities in the UK, examined data on at least 334,329 UK adults ages 40 to 69, taking a close look at their BMI and weight and then whether they went on to be hospitalized with Covid-19.\n\nAmong those adults, 640 or 0.2% were hospitalized with Covid-19.\n\nThe researchers found that the crude incidence of Covid-19 hospitalization was 19.1 per 10,000 people among those who were overweight.

However, sex can be complicated in the time of Covid-19...\" the statement says, with risks increasing for partners engaging with people outside their household.\"The lowest risk sexual activity during Covid-19 involves yourself alone,\" Tam advises. But for Canadians choosing to \"engage in an in-person sexual encounter\" outside their bubble, she suggests a number of steps to reduce risk including \"avoiding face-to-face contact or closeness.\"A trusting relationship should first be established and partners should also consider using a mask that covers the nose and mouth, Tam says.Read More\"Current evidence indicates there is a very low likelihood of contracting the novel coronavirus through semen or vaginal fluids. However, even if the people involved do not have symptoms, sexual activity with new partners does increase your risk of getting or passing Covid-19 through close contact, like kissing,\" her statement.Sex should be avoided if either person has Covid-19 symptoms, the statement says, suggesting \"limiting your use of alcohol and other substances so you and your partner(s) are able to make safe decisions.\"Of course, the most common health advice was also echoed -- to continue to practice safe sex, including by using condoms and knowing the STI status of oneself and their partner. \"By taking these precautions and staying conscious of the risks we assume, Canadians can find ways to enjoy physical intimacy while safeguarding the progress we have all made containing Covid-19,\" Dr. Tam's messaged concludes. Canada has seen more than 129,000 cases of Covid-19, including 9,135 deaths, according to the Public Health Agency of Canada.",

        "body": "Chat with us in Facebook Messenger. Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds.\n\n(CNN)It has now been almost six months since Covid-19 was declared a pandemic in the United States. For all researchers have learned, there's still so much more to understand.\n\nThe key to moving forward is understanding where Covid-19 has spread around the country and what the science tells us about what to do next. What lessons can be applied in schools and universities? What can cities and counties learn from what others have already endured? Where are we in the search for treatments and a possible vaccine?Here's what's clear so far about who is impacted by the virus, how the virus has been controlled, and where the global race for treatments and vaccines stands.Who has been impactedThe human toll of the virus has grown by measures many could not imagine. When the pandemic first began little was known about who would be impacted and what factors might make people vulnerable. Those answers have shifted over time.Read MoreWhere things stand: As of Monday, at least 183,000 people have died in the United States and more than 6 million have been infected, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University. According to the CDC's best estimate, the average person has less than a 1% chance of dying from coronavirus. In the months since the pandemic began, public health experts have learned a few key things about who is more likely to become seriously ill. If infected, people 85 and older are 20 times more likely to die than people in their 50s, and 60 times more likely to die than people in their 40s.Underlying conditions have a huge impact on more serious cases or deaths.Those with diabetes were three times more likely to be hospitalized.Those who are obese have an increased risk of death three to four times relative to those of normal weight.The people most likely to be hospitalized with Covid-19 are minorities: Black, Hispanic and Native American people.In the largest review to date, 13% of those with both cancer and Covid-19 died within a month. Younger people are not immune to this disease. Over 60% of new infections in the United States are now in people under the age of 50. People ages 18 to 29 represent 22.3% of cases; ages 30 to 39 represent 17.1% of cases and ages 40 to 49 represent 15.7% of cases.Pediatric cases rose 90% In July, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics. And health departments in many states reported cases of inflammation overdrive in youngsters -- possibly as a reaction to coronavirus infection. This rare complication is known as MIS-C or multi-system inflammatory syndrome in children. Why that matters: Leaders at all levels need to know who to protect and how best to protect them. Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases has often repeated there are five things people can do to help stop the spread of the virus: Wear a mask, all the time, consistently, when you're outside and may be exposed; keep physical distance; avoid bars, or, if you can, or close bars; keep away from crowds or congregations; maintain hand hygiene. We are still seeing states struggle to contain rolling outbreaks of cases. As some states get their outbreaks under control, cases have risen in others. That's in part a factor of proper measures are being taken, and if people are following the guidance. To tackle this infection, the focus must be two-fold: protecting the populations most at risk and ensuring those who are younger understand the impact they have on keeping the disease from spreading.Reducing transmission among all groups -- even children and young adults, who are less likely to become seriously ill -- can have a huge impact on protecting more vulnerable populations. The state of testing Where things stand: The United States has come a long way since its early struggles with testing for Covid-19, but that doesn't mean there isn't still a long way to go. While some major bottlenecks have cleared, there is still not the adequate easy, rapid testing that many public health officials say is needed to stay on top of this virus.To diagnose Covid-19, there are two key types of tests available.PCR tests: Molecular diagnostic tests, also called PCR tests, are the most common tests in the US for coronavirus. The tests look for the virus' genetic material -- a sign of active infection. Shortages of some PCR test components have led to bottlenecks for the entire process since the start of the pandemic, frustrating patients, doctors and public health experts alike. Antigen tests: Antigen tests don't need complicated chemicals, viral transport media or RNA extraction kits. They don't necessarily require appointments at specialized labs, highly trained technicians, or certain machines. And they can provide an answer in minutes, rather than hours or days. They are often cheaper. They do not test for the full genetic code of the virus, but rather a part of it. That can mean they are not as reliable as PCR testing.Why that matters: There are still rolling outbreaks in cities, counties and states or superspreader events. Quick and effective testing is needed for public health officials to isolate, track and stop transmission of the virus.For many Americans, getting a coronavirus test has meant waiting several days -- often too many days to make it worthwhile, according to public health experts. Waiting too long can mean you've missed the opportunity to isolate someone and stop them from spreading the virus at their peak of infection. Rapid testing is one of the key tools South Korea used to help stop the spread of the virus so quickly. Which is why rapid tests, even if they aren't as accurate, are so important. Experts say that being able to take rapid tests more often, makes up for the fact that they aren't as accurate. For colleges to reopen, for example, students may need to be tested every two to three days and be able to get quick results within minutes or hours -- and that's in addition to continuing to wear masks, wash hands and keep their distance from others.According to data from the COVID Tracking Project, the U.S. conducted a little over 4.7 million tests last week. While that might sound like a lot, that still adds up to fewer than 20 million tests a month, and it's far less than the million-plus tests per day some public health experts say we should be doing.Treatments and vaccinesWhere things stand: There have been incremental advances strides with therapies for coronavirus. Three are approved and there were at least 270 active trials and 570 in planning stage for treatments as of August 31, according to the FDA. Remdesivir, an antiviral, has been approved by the FDA to treat hospitalized patients with severe Covid-19. The drug must be administered intravenously. Dexamethasone, a widely available steroid, has been found to help hospitalized Covid patients. One study found that it may be able to help the sickest in hospitals who require ventilation or oxygen. A low dose regimen for 10 days was found to reduce the risk of death by a third among those on ventilators or with oxygen.Convalescent plasma is the most recent Covid-19 treatment to be granted emergency use authorization by the FDA. It uses blood donated by people who have recovered from coronavirus infections. There's hope for this treatment -- it has been used to treat other deadly coronaviruses -- but many health experts said it needed more studies that prove its benefit. Much of the data publicly available does not include randomized control trials, the gold standard in research. The data that has been shared shows those treated with plasma were often treated with other drugs, too, making it hard to know the impact of the plasma.Monoclonal antibodies are currently being studied by several companies as a possible treatment for patients infected with Covid-19, and as prevention. Monoclonal antibodies are immune system proteins that specifically home in on a single target. In coronavirus, they are targeted to a single structure on the body of the virus. The hope is to slow, or even prevent, infection. The treatments can be expensive and difficult to manufacture, though.As for vaccines, 33 are in human trials around the world as of August 31, according to the World Health Organization.The US government's vaccine development effort, Operation Warp Speed, is supporting eight vaccines, six of which have been announced. Operation Warp Speed's goal is to have 300 million doses of a vaccine that's safe and effective by January 2021.Moderna: The vaccine developed by Moderna and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases began Phase 3 trials in the United States in late July. Early results from studies of the the mRNA-1273 vaccine showed it brought about an immune response and a T-cell response in all age groups, which is what researchers wanted to see. The higher the dose, the higher the immune response was in the people who got it -- but the side effects were worse, too. More than half of participants had side effects, including fatigue, chills, headache, muscle pain and pain at the injection site. Pfizer/BioNTech: A vaccine developed by Pfizer and BioNTech also began Phase 3 trials in the United States in late July. The companies moved into a combined Phase 2/3 trial with their vaccine candidate, called BNT162b2. In the combined Phase 1/2 trial, the vaccine also induced both a T-cell and antibody response, a \"double-arm\" effect that the companies hope will provide longer protection. Preliminary data from the Phase 1/2 trial showed \"a favorable overall tolerability profile\" for the vaccine, Pfizer said in a news release, \"with generally mild to moderate\" side effects that lasted one to two days, \"such as fever, fatigue and chills and no serious adverse events.\"AstraZeneca: A vaccine made by AstraZeneca and the University of Oxford launched its Phase 3 trial in the United States on Monday. Results from early trials released previously showed the vaccine prompted an antibody response within 28 days and a T-cell response within 14 days. Neutralizing antibodies -- so-called because they can neutralize the virus -- were detected in most participants after one shot, and in all of them after two. There were no serious adverse events related to the vaccine; fatigue and headache were the most commonly reported reactions. More vaccines in the works: The Johnson & Johnson vaccine is expected to begin Phase 3 US trials in mid-September. Novavax's vaccine is expected to begin US Phase 3 trials by the end of the September, and Sanofi/GlaxoSmithKline is expected begin Phase 3 later this year.Why they matter: Until a vaccine is approved it's important to note that of the treatments available, most are to be used in patients who are sick in the hospital. That leaves out a lot of people who are very sick with this disease, but perhaps not the sickest of all. In an ideal scenario, doctors would like to have treatments that can be used in all scenarios: for the sickest in the hospital, but also a treatment for people who are at home. Think about flu season and how those who test positive are given an option like Tamiflu. It can be taken at home and help reduce symptoms and reduce the need to be at a hospital. A medication like that would also help Americans feel more comfortable about \"resuming normal life.\" But so far, treatments are limited to the sickest who are in hospitals, or those who are currently using oxygen or ventilation.These treatments are the bridge or a stop gap until a vaccine is developed. And that won't likely be until spring 2021, according to most public health experts.A vaccine must first and foremost be safe, but it must also protect a wide swath of the population. That's why its so important to have trials that include older patients and minorities. There's been a discussion about both the importance of and the difficulty recruiting both of those groups. And that's a concern. One bit of good news is there has been data from Moderna's vaccine that shows an immune response in all ages and also no difference in symptoms across ages.",

Sign up here to receive the need-to-know headlines every weekday.\n\n(CNN)Masks aren't a burden, they're \"a patriotic duty.\" This was the message last night from Joe Biden, who promised to impose a national mask mandate as part of a beefed-up coronavirus strategy if he wins the US presidency in November.\n\nThe benefits of wearing masks are clear. Public health experts have spent months emphasizing that masks are one of the most effective tools to help fight the pandemic, and universal mandates will likely reduce the spread of the airborne virus in indoor and outdoor settings. But the mere act of donning a piece of cloth has become a hyper-partisan issue in many countries. On Thursday, Brazil's congress made masks mandatory in closed spaces, like workplaces and places of worship, in defiance of President Jair Bolsonaro, who has often refused to wear one.Bolsonaro derided Covid-19 from the start, undermining his health ministry's calls for social distancing with showy, unmasked outings. But even though Brazil has been hit harder than almost any other country -- it topped 3.5 million cases yesterday -- Bolsonaro is more popular than ever, according to a poll released last week.As mask mandates harden in Europe, with France requiring coverings to be worn in offices from next month, the continent's outlier is going in a different direction. Sweden's chief epidemiologist said this week that he would not recommend face coverings because it could encourage people to take more risks. Read More\"Face masks can be a complement to other things when other things are safely in place. But to start with having face masks and then think you can crowd your buses or your shopping malls -- that's definitely a mistake,\" Anders Tegnell told the Financial Times.The opposite is true, according to a new study published yesterday which found that mask-wearing leads to other protective behaviors, like physical distancing, hand washing and avoiding handshakes.Meanwhile in China, the latest sign that the country's epidemic is under control came Thursday, when Beijing's mask mandate was scrapped -- as long as residents do not have \"close contact with other people.\" YOU ASKED. WE ANSWEREDQ: Can germicidal ultraviolet lights stop coronavirus transmission?A: Lamps that use ultraviolet light to kill germs can inactivate coronavirus, but they are not always safe and it's not clear how good a job they do at killing the virus, the Food and Drug Administration said in a newly-posted advisory.The FDA said UVC wavelengths are better than UVA and UVB light at destroying viruses, but UVC lamps have their limits.The effectiveness is unknown \"because there is limited published data about the wavelength, dose, and duration of UVC radiation required to inactivate the SARS-CoV-2 virus,\" the FDA said in a newly posted statement.

WHAT'S IMPORTANT TODAYEarly CDC models had predicted up to 2.4 million US deathsEarly coronavirus models run by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention predicted that as many as 2.4 million Americans could be dead from the virus by October, Director Dr. Robert Redfield told the Journal of the American Medical Association ThursdayNow, however, CDC estimates that about 200,000 people will die by the end of the year, Redfield said -- significantly fewer than the early models projected. Redfield held up the lower death toll as proof that the nation's response to the pandemic had worked, though CDC and the Trump administration have been widely criticized for mismanaging the crisis. Redfield also said that as many as 60 million Americans could have contracted the virus, adding that while cases should start dropping around parts of the country by next week, many in middle America need to stay alert. The US has the biggest number of infections and deaths in the world, with more than 174,000 deaths and over 5.5 million cases, according to Johns Hopkins University.Europe's travel windows are slamming shutThe vacation lights are going out all over Europe. Just weeks after many countries opened their borders to travelers within the continent, some are closing again, often at such short notice that people are left scrambling to get home before quarantine orders are put in place, Tamara Hardingham-Gill writes. Such confusion, often coupled with acrimony and threats of reprisals from countries who feel unfairly added to so-called \"red lists\" of Covid-19 unsafe destinations, looks set to undermine efforts to salvage Europe's vital summer tourism economy well before the warm sunshine months have cooled into winter.The latest casualty is Croatia, which on Thursday was removed from the UK's safe list. Earlier this week Croatia was also red-listed by Slovenia, its second largest tourist nationality, and Austria. This comes as Belgium adds Malta to its higher risk list, along with Denmark, Finland, Lithuania, Bulgaria and the UK. Norway has added a number of destinations including Greece, Ireland, and Austria.It's a far cry from the excitement the news the European Union was throwing open its doors in July brought about.Ardern schools Trump, but questions grow over New Zealand's strategy Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern made a pointed comparison between New Zealand's coronavirus situation and the epidemic in the United States today, two days after US President Donald Trump said the island nation had a \"big outbreak.\"There were 11 new coronavirus cases reported in New Zealand on Friday, Ardern said, adding that the country has \"one of the lowest death rates\" from the virus, especially compared to the US. \"To give you just one example, the United States has 16,563 cases per million, we have 269 per million people,\" she said. Yet there are growing questions over Ardern's decision to seek the total elimination of Covid-19 from New Zealand by launching some of the world's toughest restrictions -- despite the economic damage that wrought. In light of the country's fresh outbreak, critics are asking whether the sacrifices were worth it.Protests across Latin America reflect a toxic cocktail of pandemic and recessionThe impact of Covid-19 in Latin America is igniting protests in several countries, as the economic fallout from the pandemic aggravates existing social tensions from the streets of Buenos Aires and Panama City to remote parts of Brazil and Bolivia.On Monday, at least 25,000 people marched through the Argentine capital Buenos Aires, protesting the government's continued lockdown, a deepening economic crisis and the government's plans for judicial reform. Protests were also held in the cities of Cordoba, Mar del Plata and Rosario.Argentina's experience echoes across the region, where discontent across a range of issues has coalesced with the pandemic and its economic impact. Hundreds of caf\u00e9s, bars and restaurants in its capital have been forced to close, pointing to a troubling new chapter for Argentina's battered economy.Australia discussing a \"No Jab, No Play\" vaccine policyAustralia's Health Minister Greg Hunt says a \"No Jab, No Play\" coronavirus vaccine policy is being discussed, after Prime Minister Scott Morrison announced that every Australian would be able to receive a potential Covid-19 vaccine for free.Hunt said he would like to see 95% of the population receive a vaccine once it becomes available, and that a \"No Jab, No Play\" policy would mean that people would be excluded from certain public events or services unless they had received a vaccination. When asked whether refusal to take one could impact a person's welfare payments, school attendance or travel, Hunt said it was possible. Meanwhile in Russia, officials said they would begin post-registration clinical trials for their Covid-19 vaccine candidate next week, amid persistent calls for more data on the jab to be released.ON OUR RADARAt least 15 US states are now reporting positive cases of Covid-19 at colleges and universities. California wildfires have killed four people, and many are being forced to weigh up the risk of whether to evacuate to shelters and risk catching Covid-19. When it comes to educating the world about coronavirus, public health organizations around the world uniformly exceed recommended reading levels, researchers have found. Another 1.1 million Americans filed initial claims for unemployment benefits on a seasonally adjusted basis last week, dashing economists' hopes for a second-straight week with fewer than 1 million claims. Costa Rica has joined a small list of countries reopening to US tourists. But there's a caveat -- only Americans from six US states will be allowed to enter. TOP TIPSCamping can inspire the most heavenly of thoughts. But in the middle of the pandemic, it inspires a sobering question as well: Is it safe? Here are some things to avoid, according to Dr. Matthew Sims, director of infectious disease research at Beaumont Health in Michigan.Singing around a campfire aerosolizes more virus. If you're going to sing around a campfire, that's a potential risk. So if you're having a moment and just need to burst into song, spread out.Smoke from a campfire. That can make you cough and help spread the virus. If you have a fire, don't crowd around it. Shared food. This can be a problem when you're camping, especially if you go with a larger group. If you make a big pot of stew and everyone goes and takes from the same pot and uses the same utensils and ladle, that's a risk.TODAY'S PODCAST\"The virus really affects the lungs and people get very, very hypoxic -- or their oxygen levels can get really low -- and the brain is the one organ that really can't tolerate that and can get injured very easily.\" -- Dr. Sherry Chou from the University of Pittsburgh Medical CenterFrom brain fog to the loss of smell to strokes, we've been hearing a lot about the neurological symptoms of Covid-19.

Sign up here to receive the need-to-know headlines every weekday.\n\n(CNN)President Donald Trump has spent the past four days trying to sell a reality that doesn't exist and denying America's dizzying coronavirus problems in a week that culminated, in one of the longest acceptance speeches in history.\n\nCapping off the Republican National Convention on Thursday evening, the President proclaimed his efforts to combat the virus were centered on \"the science, the facts and the data,\" yet he welcomed around 1,500 mostly maskless supporters to gather outside and sit shoulder to shoulder to watch his speech, many chanting, whistling and cheering. A senior White House official brushed off concerns about the lack of social distancing, telling CNN that \"everybody is going to catch this thing eventually.\" The result was a made-for-television world in which the pandemic had largely faded, as Kevin Liptak writes; a world in which Trump repeatedly referred to the virus in the past tense, as if it were a battle already won. Just hours before the President's remarks, Democratic vice-presidential nominee Kamala Harris offered a different reality on the Trump administration's handling of the pandemic. In her own speech in Washington, DC, she painted the President as \"scared,\" and \"petty and vindictive\" in the early stages of the country's outbreak.She added that Trump was \"fixated on the stock market\" and \"caved\" to the Chinese government, slamming the President for his lack of action. \"And here's what you have to understand about the nature of a pandemic: It's relentless.

WHAT'S IMPORTANT TODAYAmericans and Brits least happy with their governments' response, poll showsAmericans and the British ranked equal last out of 14 advanced economies when asked if they thought their governments had handled the pandemic well, according to a new Pew Research Center survey. Americans also come last, by a long way, when asked whether their nation was more united now than it was before the pandemic, Richard Allen Greene writes. In the United States, fewer than two in 10 people (18%) said the country is more united now. That's a full 21 percentage points below the next lowest-ranking countries, Germany and France, where just under four in 10 (39%) respondents expressed that opinion. Denmark had the highest percentage saying their country was more united now, with more than seven in 10 (72%) giving that answer. The pandemic has been brutal for refugees and migrants to EuropeBodies washing up on European beaches as desperate families make hazardous journeys in search of a safe home -- they are horrifying scenes in a year of tragedies. The economic hardship and effects of war are prompting more people to flee countries like Tunisia, Libya, Syria, Morocco and Iraq and head for European frontline nations, like Italy and Malta, Emma Reynolds writes. But European responses have often been brutal and alleged \"pushbacks\" at borders in countries like Greece, an absence of sea rescues in the Mediterranean, and unhealthy quarantine arrangements have created huge challenges, all the more complicated by travel restrictions, and the closure of transport routes and processing centers. Another week, another million Americans file for unemployment. And still no new stimulus.Another 1 million American workers filed for first-time unemployment benefits last week, the Labor Department reported Thursday. Since March, there has only been a single week -- at the start of August -- with fewer than a million claims, when the pandemic started to take its toll on America's job market.Meanwhile, a call between House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and White House chief of staff Mark Meadows on Thursday did nothing to break the ongoing impasse over negotiations for an eagerly awaited new coronavirus stimulus package, leaving talks stalled as the pandemic continues to take a dire toll on public health and the economy. Latin America's cases top 7 millionCoronavirus cases in Latin America surpassed 7 million on Thursday, according to data from Johns Hopkins University and CNN calculations. More than half those cases are in Brazil, which has confirmed over 3.7 million infections, the second-highest number in the world after the United States. Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro -- who has been widely criticized for prioritizing the economy over public health -- said the country's public finances are \"going to sink\" should the government scheme providing emergency coronavirus stipends to the poor continue in its current form. \"Some people criticize me ... but Brazil is accumulating a (huge) debt,\" he said. He added he had given the economy minister until Friday this week to come up with a new plan to provide the financial assistance.ON OUR RADARThe 2020 Tour de France scheduled to begin Saturday looks in doubt as the region of Alpes-Maritimes, where the world-famous race begins, is put on alert for the coronavirus.A new study in the British Medical Journal finds that severe illness and death remain rare in children with Covid-19, but there are disparities between kids who may require critical care or suffer complications.French football star Paul Pogba has tested positive for Covid-19, his coach says, and will not take part in France's next two Nations League games against Sweden and Croatia.

Sign up here to receive the need-to-know headlines every weekday.\n\n(CNN)Fourteen-year-old Indiana Evans is a promising dancer from Hertfordshire, southern England, who was doing 16 hours of practice a week on top of school before falling ill with coronavirus symptoms in March.\n\nMonths later, the teenager -- who planned to audition for prestigious dance schools -- can barely manage a trip to the supermarket.While awareness is gradually growing with regards to \"long Covid\" in adults, much remains unknown about any potential long-term impact in children, Laura Smith-Spark writes. Parents whose children have been battling symptoms as diverse as fatigue, breathlessness, chest pains, diarrhea and \"Covid toes\" for weeks say there is little information available to help guide their recovery -- a situation all the more worrying given the imminent return to school for many.Still, some politicians -- including US President Donald Trump and UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson -- have continued calls for schools to reopen, saying the virus doesn't pose a large risk to children, despite evidence to the contrary. In fact, recent studies have suggested that teenagers can transmit the virus just as much as adults, while children younger than five carry a higher viral load. Read MoreAs parents and teachers grapple with the dangers of reopening schools, cases are still surging across the country. More than 97,000 children in the US tested positive in the last two weeks of July, according to a new report from the American Academy of Pediatrics and the Children's Hospital Association. That's more than a quarter of all confirmed cases in children since the pandemic began in the US. But back-to-school season is still moving ahead -- regardless of the risks. A Georgia high school that came under scrutiny last week when a student shared a photo of a crowded hallway will temporarily move to virtual learning after it reported nine cases of Covid-19, according to a letter the school district sent to parents Sunday.\"We could have just delayed opening like many other schools,\" said Hannah Watters, the sophomore who was initially suspended for sharing the photo. \"They kind of sent us to school and used us as guinea pigs to see what would happen later on.\"YOU ASKED. WE ANSWEREDQ: What kind of face masks are the least effective? A: That's the question a group of researchers at Duke University set out to answer, given that wearing face masks continues to be the best option for the world returning to semi-normalcy. In the study, published Friday, researchers used a laser beam and cell phone to evaluate the efficiency of masks by studying the transmission of respiratory droplets during regular speech.Neck fleeces, also called gaiter masks and often used by runners, were the least effective. In fact, wearing a fleece mask resulted in a higher number of respiratory droplets because the material seemed to break down larger droplets into smaller particles that are more easily carried away with air. Folded bandanas and knitted masks also performed poorly and did not offer much protection.The most effective mask was the fitted N95. Three-layer surgical masks and cotton masks, which many people have been making at home, also performed well.Send your questions here. Are you a health care worker fighting Covid-19?

WHAT'S IMPORTANT TODAYTrump circumvents Congress with order on coronavirus reliefPresident Donald Trump's new executive actions to distribute coronavirus relief without congressional approval sparked confusion over the weekend, as the number of cases in the country topped 5 million.White House advisers struggled to explain Sunday exactly what the flurry of presidential actions, signed by Trump after the breakdown of talks with Democrats on a new rescue package, actually do or how quickly they might work. But it's already clear the measures fall well short of the President's billing, Stephen Collinson writes. Here's a breakdown of the actions, and what they mean for everything from unemployment benefits to evictions and student loans. US praises Taiwan's Covid response US health secretary Alex Azar praised Taiwan's handling of the coronavirus during a meeting on Monday with Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen, observing that the self-ruled island \"had tremendous success in detecting Covid-19, managing the outbreak, and sharing this valuable information with other nations.\"It was the highest-level discussion between Washington and Taiwan in decades, and comes as tensions between the US and China continue to grow.Taiwan -- which boasts a world-class health care system and universal coverage -- has had among the best responses globally to Covid-19. Eager to share its experiences in fighting the coronavirus, Taiwan is pushing for a greater voice in global health discussions. But that hasn't sat well with China, which regards the island as part of its territory and has for years blocked it from taking part in many global institutions, like the World Health Organization. Speaking about WHO's decision to exclude Taiwan from the World Health Assembly, Tsai said: \"China has prevented that from happening, we also believe that this situation is highly regrettable.\"How New Zealand went 100 days with no community coronavirus transmissionNew Zealand has marked an enviable milestone -- more than 100 days since its last coronavirus case was acquired locally from an unknown source. How did the country do it? It's strategy was simple: in the words of Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, the country had to \"go hard, and go early\" to eliminate chains of transmission.While other countries -- including Pacific neighbor Australia and the United States -- continue to battle outbreaks, New Zealand has been held up as an example of how to fight Covid-19. One key reason is that although the country appears to have the coronavirus under control, authorities are still testing thousands of people a day, Julia Hollingsworth writes.Europe's biggest countries are seeing Covid surges -- but not this oneA horrifying moment in the Covid-19 pandemic hit Italy on March 27, when the civil protection authorities announced that 969 people had died in just 24 hours. In the weeks before that, images of coffins stacked up in church parlors and being driven down the streets of the northern town of Bergamo in a caravan of military trucks poured into the homes of Italians, by then locked down for nearly three weeks.Now, just four months later, life in Italy -- the country Vice President Mike Pence once said \"no one wanted to be like\" -- is nearly back to normal, despite occasional spikes in cases.Barbie Latza Nadeau and Livia Borghese look at how Italy -- long known for its skepticism for anything that even looks like a rule -- has beaten back the coronavirus, as other European countries struggle to contain new spikes.ON OUR RADARAustralia recorded its deadliest day of the pandemic on Monday, with 19 fatalities. Meanwhile, a self-declared principality in the country's west, formed by a \"prince,\" is no more thanks to Covid-19. A former Indian president has tested positive for Covid-19, joining a growing number of politicians to be sickened by the virus. Cases in the country have surged past 2 million. Greece recorded its highest ever daily tally of Covid-19 cases on Sunday.The United Kingdom saw cases rise by 1,062 on Sunday, topping 1,000 for the first time since late June.Paris will make masks mandatory on certain crowded streets and busy public areas from Monday, amid a spike in new Covid-19 cases.Major League Baseball has postponed games between the St. Louis Cardinals and the Pittsburgh Pirates after additional members of the Cardinals' team and staff tested positive for Covid-19.Leaders from US college sports' \"Power Five\" conferences discussed postponing the country's football season and other fall sports over the weekend.TOP TIPSMany parents are anxious about their kids \"keeping up\" in remote learning environments. Stephanie DeMichele, an Ohio-based digital learning designer and distance learning expert, suggested managing expectations, including what parents expect of teachers, and what teachers expect of students.\"Whatever you think you can get done in a day or a class period, halve it and halve it again,\" she said. \"You can't expect a kid to sit at a computer for seven hours a day.\"Many online schools suggest that children have a \"learning coach\" in addition to their teachers -- most often a parent. This isn't easy when most are working. But, even for parents who aren't equipped to be teachers themselves, they may know best what style of learner their child is, how long they can focus or what stimulates them. The one thing that experts stress as most important: a schedule. Try making one, adhering to one and adjusting one as necessary.TODAY'S PODCAST\"We will have another pandemic for absolutely certain.\" -- Dr. Anthony FauciDr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease, hasn't been appearing at White House briefings as much lately, but he's still finding ways to connect with the public.

The coronavirus outbreak is complicating efforts to evacuate people as Hurricane Laura barrels into the Gulf Coast.\n\nMore than 1.5 million Texas and Louisiana residents were under evacuation orders after the National Hurricane Center warned of \"unsurvivable\" storm surges of 20 feet or higher. Laura, which made landfall as a Category 4 storm before being downgraded to a Category 2 as it made its way inland, could overwhelm coasts and lead to surges reaching some 30 miles inland.Evacuations have been hampered by Covid-19 safety protocols. Social distancing measures meant extra buses were needed to transport people out, and Louisiana residents were taken to hotels instead of shelters in an effort to keep numbers down, Theresa Waldrop writes.But the financial fallout from the pandemic may have affected some people's ability to pay for hotel rooms. \"They can't necessarily get a hotel room, or they can't afford the gasoline and the cost of traveling hundreds of miles out of town, or out of an evacuation zone,\" former Federal Emergency Management Agency Administrator Brock Long told CNN.A pre-print study by Columbia University and the Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS) warned in early August that a large-scale hurricane evacuation would increase Covid-19 cases in evacuees' origin and destination counties.

WHAT'S IMPORTANT TODAYCDC pressured by White House to change testing guidance The fallout from the CDC's change to its coronavirus testing guidance continues after it was revealed yesterday that pressure from the Trump administration led to the move. Earlier this week, the CDC announced that it was no longer recommending coronavirus testing for most people without symptoms of Covid-19. The administration's testing czar, Adm. Brett Giroir, told reporters the guideline change had approval from Dr. Anthony Fauci and other members of the White House coronavirus task force. But Fauci told CNN he was not at the meeting as he was undergoing surgery, and warned that the guidance would \"give people the incorrect assumption that asymptomatic spread is not of great concern.\" Asymptomatic people play a major role in spreading the virus, and the Infectious Disease Society of America and IDSA's HIV Medicine Association called for the immediate reversal of the revision on Wednesday. California said it would defy the CDC's new guidelines and announced a new partnership aimed at increasing testing to 250,000 a day.Inside China's push for a vaccineScientists globally are racing to find a way to stop the virus. CNN visited the sprawling Beijing plant at the center of China's vaccine drive, which was purpose-built in recent months to produce the country's CoronaVac vaccine candidate, David Culver and Nectar Gan report.\"If everything goes well, we hope that we can have some results around the end of the year,\" said Helen Yang from the Chinese pharmaceutical company Sinovac Biotech, which developed the vaccine. Meanwhile in the US, a experimental vaccine from Moderna appears to be safe and elicits an immune response in all age groups, including the elderly, the firm said. But concerns are mounting that the Trump administration could pressure agencies to speed along approvals of vaccines. Yesterday, the American Medical Association and the Infectious Diseases Society of America both called on the US Food and Drug Administration to develop a plan for greater transparency in the development of coronavirus vaccines.Woman may have caught coronavirus in airplane toiletResearchers say they have evidence that a woman caught the coronavirus on a flight -- perhaps in the plane's restroom. The 28-year-old woman was one of roughly 300 South Koreans evacuated from Italy at the height of the pandemic in March. She wore a mask on the flight, except when she used the toilet which was shared by passengers seated nearby -- including an asymptomatic patient.Officials who organized the flight had put into effect full infection control measures and tested everyone before they boarded. All the passengers and crew were quarantined when they got to South Korea. Six passengers tested positive soon after arrival, the woman developed symptoms eight days after the flight. There has been very little evidence about whether people can catch the virus on planes, although airlines have changed their policies -- and evidence already shows aircraft ventilation systems can clean the air thoroughly. Europe's second wave rustles feathers and takes down politicians In Spain, students have announced a national strike over the conditions for a return to school. The Sindicato de Estudiantes is demanding smaller class sizes and for more teachers to be hired. The students plan to strike in mid-September.In Berlin, authorities have banned a protest planned for this weekend over the government's coronavirus restrictions.

Sign up here to receive the need-to-know headlines every weekday.\n\n(CNN)\"As long as you have any member of society, any demographic group, who's not seriously trying to get to the end game of suppressing this, it will continue to smolder and smolder and smolder, and that will be the reason why, in a non-unified way, we've plateaued at an unacceptable level.\"\n\nDr. Anthony Fauci did not hold back during a conversation hosted by the Harvard School of Public Health Webcast. Fauci told CNN's Dr. Sanjay Gupta, who was moderating the event, that there was a \"a degree of anti-science feeling\" in the United States that is hurting the efforts to get the pandemic under control. But that anti-scientific skepticism around Covid-19 has also had personal consequences for Fauci, America's leading infectious disease expert. \"Getting death threats for me and my family, harassing my daughters to the point where I need to get security...I wouldn't have imagined in my wildest dreams that people who object to things that are pure public health principles are so set against it, and don't like what you and I say, namely in the word of science, that they actually threaten you,\" he said. \"I wish that they did not have to go through that.\"Fauci's comments came just as Facebook announced it had removed a post from President Donald Trump that falsely claimed children were \"almost immune\" to Covid-19. Twitter temporarily barred the Trump campaign from tweeting over the same false claim. Children are getting infected with the coronavirus. Florida said earlier this week that 38,000 minors have contracted Covid-19 in the state. And while they don't typically get as sick as adults, they can still become dangerously ill. Dozens of children have died in the US from Covid-19.Read MoreAmerica's adversaries are also actively stirring up confusion around the coronavirus. A new report from the US State Department accused Russia of conducting a sophisticated disinformation and propaganda campaign to push dangerous falsehoods about the pandemic as it spread across the globe. The report detailed attempts to stoke anti-vaccine sentiments and push conspiracy theories about the origins of the virus. Fauci has spent months trying to get across the message that simple solutions such as social distancing and masks will help slow down the spread of the potentially deadly virus. He hasn't shied away from publicly fact-checking the President on a number of issues. Yesterday, he warned that the \"highly transmissible\" virus isn't likely to be eradicated from the planet, directly contradicting the President who said the virus will \"go away.\"YOU ASKED. WE ANSWEREDQ: Is it true that kids aren't big spreaders of coronavirus? How much do children get Covid-19?A: While children are far less likely to die from the coronavirus than adults, more studies are showing that kids can contract and spread it -- contrary to claims made by Trump and Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos.A study out of South Korea shows children who are at least 10 years old can transmit Covid-19 within a household just as much as adults can.In the US, a CDC study showed more than half of the children ages 6 to 10 who attended a Georgia summer camp in June and got tested for Covid-19 tested positive. The study -- which examined test results following a camp that more than 600 children and 120 staffers attended -- found that 51% of those ages 6 to 10 tested positive; 44% of those ages 11 to 17 tested positive; and 33% of those ages 18 to 21 tested positive.Send your questions here.

WHAT'S IMPORTANT TODAYCoronavirus patients may develop skin rashes and discolorationAs Covid-19 started to spread across the US earlier this year, dermatology offices began to see suspicious signs on some patients' skin: Red or purple toes, itchy hives, mottled bumps on fingers, a lacy red rash that spread across legs and arms. The disease often triggers significant inflammation in its victims, in some cases producing a so-called cytokine storm, which appears to be causing the worst damage in advanced patients. Last month, researchers from King's College London called for skin rashes and \"Covid fingers and toes\" to be considered as a key symptom of the virus, even arguing that they can occur in the absence of any other symptoms. The researchers used data from around 336,000 people in the UK. They found that 8.8% of people who tested positive for the virus reported a skin rash as a symptom, compared with 5.4% of people who tested negative.Key coronavirus symptoms that are widely accepted include fever, cough and shortness of breath, but a range of other signs have been suggested. The loss of smell and taste, another outlier, was recently included on the list of most common symptoms by the US CDC.The 9 US cities Birx is worried aboutBaltimore, Atlanta, Kansas City, Portland, Omaha, Chicago, Boston, Detroit and Washington, DC, along with the Central Valley in California, are among the places the White House coronavirus task force coordinator Dr. Deborah Birx listed as new areas of concern in a private phone call with state and local officials Wednesday, the Center for Public Integrity reported.The rising case numbers appear to be driven by younger people who are not taking the virus seriously. Since the beginning of June, the case rate for people in the age group of 30 to 49 nearly tripled and the case rate for people between the ages of 18 to 29 nearly quadrupled. \"This is also the age group that is most likely to be attending the large parties that we keep seeing,\" LA County public health director Dr. Barbara Ferrer said. One man went to a church. Almost 100 others got infected. A 56-year-old man with Covid-19 went to church in Ohio in mid-June. The result of that outing: 91 other people got sick, including 53 who were at the service, according to Ohio's governor MIke De Wine.\"It spread like wildfire, wildfire. Very, very scary,\" De Wine said, urging everyone in the state to wear masks and practice social distancing.To illustrate how one infected person can spread the virus, state health officials released a color graphic showing how the cases radiated to some who weren't even at the service. One instance of spread was a family in which a 34-year-old man became sick. His 31-year-old wife also became infected, as did four children between the ages of 1 and 11. The wife and two children of the 56-year-old worshipper mentioned by the governor also got sick. Beirut hospitals were already struggling. Then a blast injured 5,000 people. Lebanon is setting up field hospitals in the capital of Beirut after a massive explosion killed 137 people and left 5,000 others wounded. The tragedy comes at a time when the health system was already struggling in the face of rising coronavirus cases. \"We in the health sector are suffering from a crisis in the face of the coronavirus, to which this human and health catastrophe has now been added,\" Lebanon's health minister said while calling for international assistance. \"We suffer from a shortage in the number of beds and a lack of equipment to help injured people and those are in critical conditions.\"Muslims are being blamed for England's coronavirus outbreaksMuslims in England have found themselves blamed for spreading the coronavirus after the UK government announced local lockdowns just hours before Eid al-Adha, one of the holiest festivals in Islam. The affected areas included Greater Manchester, Leicester and other places with a significant Islamic population.Craig Whittaker, a Conservative MP suggested that England's ethnic minorities were not adhering to pandemic guidelines. \"If you look at the areas where we've seen rises and cases the vast majority -- not, by any stretch of the imagination, all areas -- but it is the BAME [Black, Asian, and minority ethnic] communities that are not taking it seriously enough,\" Whittaker said Friday during an interview with LBC radio. When asked if he was talking about the Muslim population, Whittaker replied: \"Of course.\"Much of the recent blame placed on Muslims appears to be driven by the fact that Covid-19 has hit the country's ethnic minorities harder than the majority population. But according to Public Health England, the discrepancy was caused by a complex of range of factors, including the fact that BAME people were more likely to live in overcrowded and urban areas, and to work in jobs that put them at risk of catching Covid-19, Zamira Rahim reports.

New Zealand reported 9 new cases on Monday, while the US reported tens of thousands, as Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern was quick to point out today.There is no doubt that the Asia-Pacific region has entered a \"new phase of the pandemic,\" as one WHO official said Tuesday. But as experts have repeatedly pointed out, America seems unable to get out of the first phase of the pandemic. The US is the worst-hit country globally, and the virus is now the third-largest cause of death in the country -- killing more people than Alzheimer's disease, accidents and diabetes.

Former first lady Michelle Obama, the most anticipated speaker on the first night of a one-of-a-kind Democratic National Convention, said Trump had failed to meet the moment. \"More than 150,000 people have died, and our economy is in shambles because of a virus that this president downplayed for too long.\"And a woman whose father died after contracting the coronavirus also delivered a line that will likely echo through the rest of the campaign. \"My dad was a healthy 65-year-old,\" Kristin Urquiza told the convention. \"His only pre-existing condition was trusting Donald Trump, and for that he paid with his life.YOU ASKED.

WHAT'S IMPORTANT TODAYOne week in, university abandons in-person classesThe University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill abruptly decided it will no longer hold in-person classes on campus after about 130 students tested positive for Covid-19 in the first week since classes began.In the past week, the Covid-19 positivity rate among students rose to 13.6% of the 954 students tested, and five employees also tested positive, according to the university's Covid-19 dashboard. As of Monday morning, 177 students were in isolation and 349 were in quarantine, both on and off-campus.The stunning rise in cases, just a week after classes began, illustrates the speed of Covid-19 and the difficulties of bringing young people into proximity during the pandemic, even as students begin their return to college campuses.Wuhan hosts massive water park party as coronavirus concerns recedeThe central Chinese city of Wuhan, ground zero for the outbreak, appears to have moved on from the virus as thousands of revelers gathered in an open-air water park for an electronic music festival -- without any masks or social distancing measures in sight, Nectar Gan writes.Over the weekend, in scenes that remain unthinkable in many parts of the world, the Wuhan Maya Beach Water Park was filled with partygoers in swimsuits bunched together shoulder to shoulder.Life in Wuhan has gradually returned to normal since the metropolis of 11 million people in Hubei province lifted a stringent 76-day lockdown in early April. The city hasn't reported any new cases since mid-May. UK government makes dramatic exam results U-turn after a national outcryAfter exams were canceled in the UK due to the pandemic, students' grades were instead determined by an algorithm -- which caused a storm of criticism after many students' grades were downgraded from those predicted by their teachers.English, Welsh and Northern Irish regulators performed a U-turn on Monday, announcing students would receive the grades their teachers predicted for them in the critically important A-levels and GCSE exams.Vaccine skeptics are a roadblock to protecting Americans, says Dr. Anthony FauciVaccine skeptics and vaccine hesitancy can hurt efforts to protect Americans if and when a coronavirus vaccine comes out, America's leading infectious disease expert said Monday. \"We have our work cut out for us,\" Dr. Anthony Fauci said during an American Society for Microbiology briefing. \"Society is not just jumping around waiting to get a vaccine. It's not,\" Fauci added. \"We have got to change that.\"Fauci said there was some cause for optimism, and cited past experience with getting people to trust in treatments and preventions for HIV/AIDS as a roadmap for gaining trust. Clinical trial networks that get into the community, get the word out and generate enthusiasm will play a big role in improving the trust of Americans in an eventual coronavirus vaccine, he said.

Here's how better equip yourself to these mental stresses: It's important to recognize that this is a continuing situation and that flexibility is critical for getting through the pandemic. \"People are going to have to get comfortable with a lack of control.

That's one of the key lessons from the news that a man in Hong Kong contracted the coronavirus twice, in what has been billed as the world's first documented case of reinfection.\n\nThe 33-year-old man tested positive for Covid-19 in late March, then again in mid-August after arriving back in Hong Kong after a trip to Europe, according to a yet-to-be peer-reviewed study from a team at the University of Hong Kong. While he had symptoms the first time around, he didn't the second time.The findings are the latest sign that immunity to the virus may not be long-lasting, and underline the importance of having an annual Covid-19 vaccine to boost immunity, even for people who had previously caught the virus, according to Ivan Hung, one of the research team members.\"This virus is very smart, it keeps on mutating. So that means even though you recovered from a natural infection, you still need vaccination, need a mask, and keep your social distancing,\" Hung told CNN. The findings come as little surprise -- scientists have long warned that long-lasting immunity was not a given with this virus -- and nor should the findings be a cause of concern. The fact the man was asymptomatic during the second infection is \"all you want to see,\" Dr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center and professor of pediatrics at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, told CNN. \"It's encouraging for the vaccine that his first infection induced an immune response that protected against disease.\"Read MoreExperts have called for more research into the matter as it could be an outlier. But the case does call into question strategies to create herd immunity via community spread -- widely believed to have been applied in nations like Sweden. \"The only safe and effective way to achieve herd immunity is through vaccination,\" Akiko Iwasaki, of the Yale School of Medicine, wrote on Twitter. She explained that since reinfection can occur, herd immunity through natural infection is unlikely to eliminate the virus.That said, sources told CNN that White House officials have raised the possibility of early emergency authorization of a vaccine before late-stage trials are complete. Dr. Anthony Fauci warned against it on Monday, explaining such a step could damage efforts to develop other vaccines.\"To me, it's absolutely paramount that you definitively show that a vaccine is safe and effective, both,\" Fauci told Reuters. \"We would hope that nothing interferes with the full demonstration that a vaccine is safe and effective.\"YOU ASKED. WE ANSWEREDQ: What is the appropriate age for my kids to wear masks?A: New guidance from the World Health Organization (WHO) and UNICEF contradicts guidance currently in place from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), which suggests children two and older should wear a mask. The international agencies say children under five should not be made to wear masks as very young children are less susceptible to the virus and are less likely to spread it to others. Here's what its guidance says about other age groups: Ages 6-11: WHO says a risk-based approach should be applied, taking into consideration local intensity of transmission; social and cultural environments; the child's capacity to comply; availability of appropriate adult supervision; potential impact of masks on learning and psychosocial development; and additional considerations such as disabilities or underlying diseases.Ages 12 and over: Treat them like adults, the agencies say.

Globally, only a few trials have reported out their results, \"and the results are not conclusive,\" Dr. Soumya Swaminathan said on Monday, a day after the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued an emergency use authorization for the treatment. US President Donald Trump suggested he pressured the agency to fast-track that authorization, even though it has yet to be tested in a randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial. As WHO expressed concern, FDA chief Stephen Hahn wound back comments he made on Sunday, where he incorrectly said the data showed use of convalescent plasma reduced the risk of death by 35%, and said that meant if 100 people got coronavirus, 35 would survive because of the treatment. The study did not show that, and Hahn admitted he had been inaccurate on Monday. Racial inequality in the US may be as deadly as the virus, if not more, research saysEven amid a pandemic, life expectancy among Whites in the United States far exceeds what Blacks experience every year, according to a new study. The research, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences on Monday, uses national life expectancy data and demographic models to estimate how many White deaths from Covid-19 would be needed for the White death rate in 2020 to reach the levels of the year with the lowest Black death rate ever recorded, which was in 2014. That year, the rate of Black mortality was about 1,061 per 100,000, said Elizabeth Wrigley-Field of the University of Minnesota, who led this research. For perspective, the most recent White mortality rate, in 2017, was about 899 deaths per 100,000.Currently, the White Covid-19 age-adjusted mortality is about 28 deaths per 100,000 -- meaning \"US White deaths including Covid are still well below the best that Black mortality has ever been\" Wrigley-Field said. Covid-19's summer surge across US wanesDeclines in the average number of daily Covid-19 deaths and in new cases indicate that the virus' summer surge through the US is waning. The seven-day average of coronavirus deaths in the US dropped below 1,000 a day over the weekend for the first time since late July. Also, the average number of new cases had dipped to about 42,600 as of Sunday, well below a peak in mid-July of around 67,000 daily cases.Although the trends are in the right direction, the US remains the world leader in total cases and deaths.A concerning spike across EuropeMeanwhile, the European Union is experiencing a worrying surge in new coronavirus cases. On Sunday, all 27 EU nations reported a total seven day average of 17,000 new cases per day. Spain has recorded 19,382 new coronavirus cases since Friday, data from its health ministry showed on Monday, and some of Spain's 17 regions decided to tighten safety measures as cases continue to climb. Madrid's regional government is now asking citizens to \"avoid unnecessary gatherings,\" and Catalonia's president is banning gatherings of more than 10 people. The government of the Murcia region has gone even further, banning meetings of more than 6 people in public and private.Concerns mount about children's schooling worldwidePrimary and secondary schools are increasing measures to protect students worldwide. In a win for teachers' unions, a judge on Monday blocked Florida's requirement that all brick-and-mortar public schools must offer in-class education by August 31. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio announced a new outdoor learning plan for all city schools that includes not only public schools but private and charter ones as well. And in South Korea, almost 2,000 schools have suspended in-person classes due to the latest surge there. But the challenges with online learning came into sharp focus on Monday when a Zoom outage, starting in the East Coast before spreading to parts of the world, affected public schools in Atlanta on their first day back. ON OUR RADARThe world's largest nudist resort in southern France is at the center of a Covid-19 outbreak. Nearly 150 people tested positive after staying at or visiting the clothing-optional beach destination. A couple went to India, and now they're stranded by coronavirus rules set 6,400 miles away. They are among thousands of visa holders and Australian citizens who are stuck abroad and blaming it on limits Australia has imposed on international arrivals. China has been using an experimental coronavirus vaccine on people who work in \"high risk\" professions since July, including front line medical professionals and border inspectors, a senior official has revealed.

TOP TIPSWith the US elections a few months away, here's how to vote safely: States have received guidance from the CDC on how to keep voting locations clean. It's up to you whether you feel comfortable going. Many states that already held elections imposed measures to reduce contact between voters, increasing the distance between voting booths and rigorously disinfecting voting equipment. But if you go, remember to wash your hands before, during and afterward.If you're able to mail in your ballot, do -- just don't lick the envelope. If you think you have a fever or respiratory symptoms, the CDC advises that you stay home. It's unfortunate to skip out on your civic duty, but sick people shouldn't visit crowded locations.TODAY'S PODCAST\"The average American parent has some doubts about vaccines because the misinformation is so pervasive.\" -- Dr. Peter Hotez, a vaccine scientistAn alarming number of Americans hold negative views about vaccination.

Sign up here to receive the need-to-know headlines every weekday.\n\n(CNN)Two more teenagers, between the ages of 14 and 17, have died from Covid-19 in Florida -- bringing the total deaths of children and teens in the state to seven. More than 38,000 minors have contracted the coronavirus in Florida, a hotpot of the pandemic in the United States.\n\nThe deaths are a reminder that while younger people seem less vulnerable to the coronavirus, they are not immune. If the virus spreads more, more children will inevitably get sick and some may die. The news adds urgency to the debate happening all around the world right now: how to safely reopen schools. Several studies published this week highlight the strategies that could be key in bringing students back to the classroom: scaled-up testing for cases, effective tracing of the contacts of those who test positive, and isolation of those who test positive or have symptoms. Looking specifically at the United Kingdom, one group of researchers said the country's test--trace--isolate strategy isn't sufficient to reopen schools safely. One government adviser suggested the UK may need to choose between keeping pubs open or allowing schools to reopen it if it wants to keep coronavirus infection rates down. Globally, more than 1.5 billion kids -- 90% of the world's students -- have seen their schools and universities shut this year due to the pandemic, according to the United Nations. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has warned that school closures could cause a \"generational catastrophe\" and said getting students back into schools as safely as possible must be a top priority once local transmission of Covid-19 is under control. Read MoreThe US Centers for Disease Control pushed for reopening schools last month -- but only in areas that weren't seeing high transmission rates. Keeping schools shut may play an important role in squashing the pandemic in areas with high infection rates. A study published last week showed that school closures in the US from March to May might have led to a million fewer Covid-19 cases and saved more than 40,000 lives.Some communities say they are not ready, even as some parents and officials push for students to return. Many educators and other parents are calling for in-person classes to be postponed, fearing a return to school buildings will help fuel further transmission of the virus.In Georgia's largest school district, thousands have now signed a petition asking for teachers to be allowed to work from home. As of last week, around 260 of the district's employees had either tested positive for Covid-19 or been in contact with someone who did. \"It's a pandemic across the world. The globe. Everyone is dealing with the same thing. You can always catch up on education if need be, but you can't teach a dead child,\" one educator told CNN.YOU ASKED. WE ANSWEREDQ: Can you get Covid-19 through your eyes?A: We know that the coronavirus can enter the body through the nose and mouth -- hence the constant recommendations from doctors to wear face coverings and practice social distancing. But there is also \"emerging evidence\" that people are catching the virus from droplets floating in the air, the World Health Organization said. One of the ways those droplets can enter your body is through the eyes. It's also possible to get infected by touching a contaminated surface and then touching your eyes, according to the CDC.Does that mean you should wear goggles? Not necessarily. Experts say you should wear some sort of eye covering if you're in high-risk situations where you're likely to come into contact with the virus. And if you just want to be extra safe, goggles or a face shield can add an extra layer of protection. But for the average person, wearing a face mask and practicing social distancing should suffice.Send your questions here. Are you a health care worker fighting Covid-19?

Now they are strugglingSeveral countries celebrated for their handling of the pandemic are seeing a resurgence in Covid-19 cases. They were looked upon as examples, hailed for their no-nonsense approach, their clear messaging, their slick test-and-trace regimes, and the resulting low infection and death rates.Take Australia, where 5 million people in its second-largest city of Melbourne suddenly found themselves lining under some of the harshest restrictions ever imposed there after authorities declared a \"state of disaster\". Two months ago, the country appeared to have the virus under control. The renewed outbreaks serve as a stark warning to global leaders of how quickly an apparent success story can unravel. Tara John and Emma Reynolds report.Why you might have to wear a mask outdoorsGovernments around the world are reaching for a new tool that many public health experts have been touting for months: stricter mask mandates.In recent days, masks have become mandatory in all public spaces -- indoors or outdoors -- in Madrid, Greece, Portugal's Madeira Islands and Hong Kong. Those moves seemingly contradict the long-held understanding that Covid-19 is more dangerous indoors. But the reasoning behind the decisions is simpler than that: after months of mixed messaging from health authorities on face coverings, governments are opting for blanket rules to help make mask-wearing a cultural norm.\"There's been a lot of confusion about where people should wear masks, and where there's confusion, people just disengage and don't wear them,\" Melinda Mills, director of Oxford University's Leverhulme Centre for Demographic Science, told CNN. \"That's why (some countries) are moving to a broad, blanket policy.\"I'm for clarity in public messaging, and in many countries, I think it's been a mess,\" she added.Fauci steps up to defend Birx against Trump's attackDr. Anthony Fauci, America's top infectious disease expert, has defended his colleague Dr. Deborah Birx after she was criticized by President Donald Trump. Trump has previously publicly attacked Fauci, but has so far refrained from undermining Birx, the White House coronavirus task force coordinator. The President broke that silence on Monday, calling Birx \"pathetic\" after she warned on Sunday that the pandemic was \"extraordinarily widespread\" in the US. Fauci backed Birx up on her comments during a virtual news conference yesterday, saying the community spread that many states are fighting is \"much more difficult to get your arms around that and contain it.\"\n\nThe UK's troubled coronavirus response becomes more complicatedBrits have been left confused after the government rolled out coronavirus guidance that seems at odds with itself across England, pushing the four nations of the UK further apart, Luke McGee writes.Employers in England can now ask staff to return to workplaces if they believe they are Covid-19 safe. When the policy was announced by Prime Minister Boris Johnson last month, he was accused of \"passing the buck on this big decision to employers\" by the UK's Trades Union Congress. The TUC criticized the government for announcing such a move while the country's widely-criticized test and trace infrastructure was \"still patchy.\"Brits can now also take advantage of an eye-catching government scheme called \"Eat Out to Help Out,\" which is aimed at getting restaurants back on their feet. Throughout August, people dining out from Monday to Wednesday can get discounts on their meals. Both policies are part of a wider plan to get the UK economy moving after months of lockdown. But they come just as the Johnson warned that \"the risk is starting to bubble up again\" on the continent. Several localized mini-lockdowns have been implemented in England as fears of a second wave move from possible to probable.ON OUR RADARThe US Census Bureau will stop collecting field data a month earlier because of the pandemic. The census, conducted every 10 years, determines how many people live in America, and as a result how many representatives each state gets in Congress along with how billions of dollars in federal funding are spent. But the possibility of less time to count the population has concerned advocates for minority groups that have historically been under-counted in the census.Hong Kong-based designers have set to work reimagining the city's historic trams and the ever-popular ferries to see what public transit could potentially look like in a post-pandemic world.

The announcement has been met with widespread skepticism from global health experts.\n\nNo scientific data on the Sputnik V vaccine has been released, and the treatment is only entering crucial Phase 3 clinical trials, meaning there are huge unanswered questions over its safety and effectiveness.Members of the Russian elite have reportedly taken doses, however, including the daughter of Russian President Vladimir Putin and Kirill Dmitriev, head of the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF).A mass rollout among Russians is slated for October, Helen Regan reports, with frontline workers and high-risk Russians first in line to voluntarily receive the vaccine. At least 20 countries and some US companies have expressed interest in the vaccine, Russian officials say -- including Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte, who volunteered today to be \"the first to be experimented on.\"There need to be roughly 30,000 participants in a Phase 3 trial in order to give \"power in the analysis, to be able to document the vaccine works\" Dr. Francis Collins, the director of the US's National Institutes of Health, told CNN in June. Read MoreBut only around 2,000 people are slated to take part in that critical stage of the Russian vaccine, according to Sputnik V's website. Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, expressed serious doubts about whether the Russian vaccine is ready for widespread use. \"I hope that the Russians have actually, definitively proven that the vaccine is safe and effective,\" Fauci told ABC News. \"I seriously doubt that they've done that.\"The rushed process not only poses a threat to Russians but could lead to even more political grandstanding -- and may irk President Donald Trump, who only last week suggested that a US vaccine could be ready as soon as election day in November.There are also fears that the rushed out Russian vaccine risks inflaming growing anti-vaccination sentiment by giving the impression that speed is more important than safety. As Zachary B. Wolf puts it, would you trust a vaccine if Vladimir Putin told you it was safe? US Health Secretary Alex Azar said today that coronavirus vaccine development is \"not a race to be first,\" and said that any vaccine in the US would have to meet the Food and Drug Administration's \"gold standard\" before it was made publicly available. At best, trials will be completed in early 2021, say infectious disease experts.There are 25 vaccines currently in clinical trials and more than 100 more in development, according to the World Health Organization.

WHAT'S IMPORTANT TODAYUK falls into record-breaking recessionUK economic output shrank by 20.4% in the second quarter of 2020, the worst quarterly slump on record, pushing the country into the deepest recession of any major global economy.This crash in GDP in the April-June period is the worst since quarterly records began in 1955 and follows a 2.2% contraction in the first quarter. Industries most exposed to government lockdown measures to contain the coronavirus pandemic -- services, production and construction -- saw record drops.It comes a day after ONS announced the UK economy shed 730,000 jobs since the country shuttered businesses in March. The young, the old and the self-employed have borne the brunt of the unemployment crisis, CNN's Chris Liakos and Mark Thompson report.US government strikes $1.5 billion deal for potential coronavirus vaccineThe Trump administration has inked a deal with Moderna Inc. to manufacture and deliver 100 million doses of the company's Covid-19 vaccine once it is approved.The contract, worth $1.525 billion, means the doses would be owned by the US government and would be distributed and used as part of its Covid-19 vaccine campaign. If the doses are used, they would be provided to Americans at no cost.The government can also acquire up to an additional 400 million doses of this vaccine, the US health department said in a press release. The contract is part of the US government's Operation Warp Speed. The government already has deals with Pfizer, Janssen, GlaxoSmithKline, Sanofi Pasteur, Novavax and AstraZeneca, for doses of their vaccine candidates.The aim is to create \"a vaccine portfolio for Operation Warp Speed, the Trump Administration is increasing the likelihood that the United States will have at least one safe, effective vaccine by 2021,\" Azar, the healthy secretary, said in the release.New Zealand reinstates coronavirus restrictions Earlier this week, New Zealand announced it was reimposing coronavirus restrictions after it broke a 102-day streak without a single locally-transmitted Covid-19 infection. Now the date of the country's upcoming election has been thrown into doubt.On Wednesday, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said there would be a delay of \"at least a few days\" in dissolving Parliament -- a key step towards holding a national election on September 19. New Zealand's new outbreak is the latest example that the virus's resurgence can happen to even the best-prepared nations.

Schools should be flexible, with plans in place for virtual learning and the potential need for extra nurses, psychologists and social workers in schools.TODAY'S PODCAST\"Masks work and testing works.

This can result in them unknowingly passing on the virus to others,\" said WHO official Takeshi Kasai.University of Kentucky, East Carolina University, Iowa State University, North Carolina State University and North Carolina State University also saw their experiments with a resumption of in-person classes backfire. The pandemic has fundamentally changed higher education. More than 75% of the country's 5,000 colleges are expected to be partially or fully online this fall, according to a count by the Chronicle of Higher Education.Stuck at home, many American students and their families are starting to ask whether the new normal is worth the money. And while some universities have cut campus fees or reduced tuition, the majority of schools, from state institutions including Temple University and the University of Massachusetts, to elite universities like Harvard and Stanford, are keeping tuition as is. Scott Galloway, a professor of marketing at New York University who opposes high tuition costs, believes students are right to be outraged. \"Universities have backed themselves into a corner,\" he told CNN. \"We have raised tuition on average 2 1/2-fold over the last 20 years. I think Covid-19 was just the straw that broke the camel's back, where families across America are saying, 'Enough already. We're not going to pay $58,000 for Zoom classes.'\"YOU ASKED. WE ANSWEREDQ: Should I get a flu shot in the fall?A: Getting the flu vaccine this year is particularly important this year, experts at the World Health Organization said yesterday.Covid-19 hit the northern hemisphere as many places were coming out of flu season, according to Dr. Bruce Aylward, a senior adviser at WHO. A lot of the surge capacity used to manage critically sick Covid-19 patients initially came from resources available from dealing with the flu, he said. \"That highlights the reason it's so important to get the flu vaccination rates up this year, even relative to previous years,\" said Aylward. \"We need that capacity potentially to manage Covid.\" You also want to avoid having a personal double whammy of getting both flu and Covid-19. And yes, it is possible to have both at the same time.Send your questions here. Are you a health care worker fighting Covid-19?

WHAT'S IMPORTANT TODAYA historic mental health crisisMore than 400,000 people have died from the coronavirus in North and South America, according to a tally by the Pan American Health Organization. The Americas now account for 64% of the world's officially reported Covid-19 deaths, even though the region is home to only 13% of the global population.The organization's director Dr. Carissa Etienne said yesterday the US and Brazil were \"the biggest drivers of the case counts\" and warned the pandemic is causing a historic mental health crisis.Strict lockdowns and restrictions have reduced the resources available for mental health support. Many people are turning to alcohol and drugs to cope with the pandemic, causing them to be more prone to mental health issues, Etienne warned. Data from elsewhere is similarly worrying. Nearly a fifth of British adults likely experienced some form of depression during the coronavirus pandemic, according to official figures released yesterday -- twice as many as before the pandemic hit. Vaccine trials need more minority volunteers The first coronavirus vaccine trial in the US is moving along at a good clip, but needs more member of minority groups to enroll if it is to succeed, officials told CNN's Senior Medical Correspondent Elizabeth Cohen.While Black people and Latinos account for more than 50% of Covid-19 cases in the US, so far they make up only about 15% of participants in the nation's first large-scale clinical trial to test a coronavirus vaccine, according to data obtained by CNN from a government official.That discrepancy could potentially delay a vaccine from reaching the market. Federal law and National Institutes of Health policy mandate inclusion of minorities into clinical trials because vaccines and drugs might have a different effect on them than they do on White people.Los Angeles schools launch huge Covid-19 testing programThe second-largest school district in the US will provide regular Covid-19 testing and contact-tracing to all students and staff and to families of those who test positive -- a step the Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) described as \"unprecedented\" but \"necessary.\"LAUSD, which has more than 600,000 students, is beginning the new school year without in-person classes as Covid-19 continues to spread widely in California and the Los Angeles area.Superintendent Austin Beutner told CNN the district is simply following the science: \"If we want to keep schools from becoming a petri dish and we want to keep all in the school community safe, we need to test and trace at schools.\" The hope, he said, is to build a foundation for when LAUSD schools open for in-person learning.Australia strikes vaccine deal, but jab won't be mandatory after allAustralia has secured a deal with the UK-based drug company AstraZeneca for access to a potential Covid-19 vaccine should trials prove successful. Under the deal, Australians would receive the vaccine for free.Speaking to a local radio station, Prime Minister Scott Morrison said Australia would have a target of 95% vaccination, which would account for people with health conditions that prevented them being vaccinated. \"I would expect it to be as mandatory as you could possibly make it,\" he told Melbourne radio station 3AW. However, he later clarified his comments, telling a Sydney radio station that the government would not make vaccination mandatory. \"Nobody's going to force anybody to do anything as a compulsory measure, but we will certainly be encouraging people to take this up,\" he told the 2GB station.One solution to slow testing: SewageThe US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is not too shy to look at poop in order to slow down the spread of the coronavirus. Studies have shown the virus can be found in feces from people who are sick and also from people who don't yet have Covid-19 symptoms. Since about 80% of US homes are connected to some kind of municipal sewer system, sewage can become a great tool to track the spread of the disease across the nation. The CDC is hoping its new sewage monitoring program will complement America's still-inadequate testing and contact-tracing, giving a good big picture of how widespread the infection is and giving communities a few extra days to prepare for surge capacity in hospitals or to make lockdown decisions. A similar program has been tested in Germany earlier this year, but the idea of looking at sewage during epidemics isn't brand new even in the US -- it was used during polio outbreaks in the past.

Sign up here to receive the need-to-know headlines every weekday.\n\n(CNN)The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has changed its Covid-19 testing guidelines, prompting confusion and concern from some doctors.\n\nThe agency no longer recommends testing for most people without symptoms, even if they've been in close contact with someone known to have the virus. Previously, the CDC said viral testing was appropriate for people with recent or suspected exposure, even if they were asymptomatic.Asymptomatic carriers play a major role in spreading Covid-19. Testing and isolating these silent emitters are vital to providing a pathway out of the outbreak. Even the world's fastest man, Usain Bolt, tested positive this week despite not showing any symptoms.CDC's modified guidelines say people who were within six feet of a Covid-19 positive individual for at least 15 minutes, and are not showing symptoms, \"do not necessarily need a test.\" The change troubled health experts in America, which has been besieged by coronavirus testing failures and shortages. Asymptomatic testing \"is key to contact tracing, especially given that up to 50% of all transmission is due to people who do not have symptoms,\" Dr. Leana Wen, a public health professor at George Washington University, told CNN. \"One wonders why these guidelines were changed -- is it to justify continued [a] deficit of testing?\"Read MoreNew Covid-19 cases may be falling in many US states, but some officials across the heartland are reporting a worrying rise in numbers.

Managers were instructed to ask customers if they'd like a complimentary mask, and if they refuse, the talking points advise letting them to continue shopping.This week the CDC outlined a number of steps businesses can take, which include conflict-resolution training for their workers, installing security systems and identifying designated safe areas in stores employees can go to if they feel in danger.

WHAT'S IMPORTANT TODAYMelania Trump offers Covid-19 sympathies as polling shows deaths are a partisan issueFirst Lady Melania Trump struck a markedly different tone from many of the speakers at this week's Republican National Convention when she offered condolences to the Americans touched by the coronavirus pandemic.\"My deepest sympathy goes out to everyone who has lost a loved one and my prayers are with those who are ill or suffering. I know many people are anxious and some feel helpless. I want you to know you are not alone,\" she told the nation in an address from the White House Rose Garden last night.But pictures of her audience are the latest sign that the Trump administration is not taking things as seriously as it could be. Attendees in the Rose Garden did not observe social distancing. Few wore masks and some guests were not tested for Covid-19, according to a person who attended the speech. The First Lady's chief of staff told CNN that the people seated in the rows near the President and Vice President were tested, as was anyone who came into close contact with them. That kind of apathy towards the public health crisis is evident among many Republicans. A CBS/YouGov poll found that 57% of registered Republican voters say the Covid-19 death toll is \"acceptable,\" while only 10% of Democrats and 33% of independents would phrase it that way. What explains the discrepancy? Partisanship, mostly, Chris Cillizza writes.One US business conference linked to 20,000 Covid-19 casesOne superspreading event may be connected to about 20,000 coronavirus cases in the Boston area, a researcher said on Tuesday. That event, a biotech conference attended by 200 people in late February, is now well known as a source of Covid-19 spread very early on in the pandemic.The new study -- which has not yet been peer-reviewed -- claims to provide \"direct evidence\" that superspreading can profoundly alter the course of an epidemic, Jacqueline Howard and Carma Hassan write.More recently, a Covid-19 outbreak sparked at a wedding in Maine has been linked to cases at a nursing home and a jail. And now dozens of cases across several states are being linked back to a motorcycle rally in South Dakota in early August -- which experts warned at the time could become a super-spreader event.Coronavirus disrupting polio vaccination efforts in AfricaAfrica reached a milestone on Tuesday when the World Health Organization declared polio had been eradicated from the region. But vaccination will have to continue to keep the virus from coming back -- and the coronavirus is disrupting that effort, the WHO's regional director on Africa said yesterday. The oral polio vaccine uses a weakened but not completely inactive strain of virus that can mutate into a pathogenic form if it circulates among incompletely immunized people. Vaccination must continue to keep this strain from causing outbreaks, the WHO said. The Covid-19 pandemic means that some immunization campaigns are being postponed in 16 countries that are dealing with this type of polio. Countries strengthen their face mask mandates in Europe Countries and regions in Europe are strengthening their face mask rules as kids start the new academic year. The UK government made yet another U-turn on its coronavirus response on Wednesday, mandating that secondary school children in regions under lockdown will now be required to wear masks in communal areas. The Czech Republic has made face masks mandatory again, but not just in schools. On September 1 -- the same day schools reopen -- face masks will have to be worn in a number of settings, including health and social care facilities and public transport. Face masks will only be required in schools if the epidemiological situation deteriorates. The government said the national mask mandate was directly related to the reopening of classrooms. Spain's capital Madrid also announced Tuesday that face coverings would be mandatory at schools for children over the age of six. Similar rules were announced in the region of Catalonia for school children aged 12 and up. Latin American countries brace for more infectionsArgentina reported a record number of cases for a second day in a row on Tuesday, the same day Mexico said more than 1,300 healthcare workers had died from the virus since the pandemic began. Mexico is now preparing for marked rise in new daily cases after it widened the criteria for detecting Covid-19 from suspected cases. In Brazil, the virus continues to spread through its political class. Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro's eldest son, Fl\u00e1vio Bolsonaro, tested positive for Covid-19 on Tuesday. The development came as Butantan, one of Brazil's vaccine research centers and producers, said it expects to have 45 million doses of the experimental Chinese Covid-19 vaccine CoronaVac by the end of December.ON OUR RADARVirologists say two patients in Europe have been reinfected by the coronavirus, a day after researchers revealed that a man living in Hong Kong had caught Covid-19 twice.Arizona State University has sued Facebook after Instagram declined to take down an account that was advertising \"Covid parties.\" ASU said the people behind the account could be in Russia.

Experts have warned that a strategy based on the concept, which relies on allowing the virus to run rampant in order to develop community resistance, could lead to several million deaths in the long term.

Atlas, a contrarian doctor who caught President Donald Trump's eye after appearances on Fox News, has rejected the need for widespread community testing, arguing that the administration should focus almost exclusively on protecting and testing elderly populations.The shift comes amid fierce political pressure from the White House on government agencies to approve new treatments and even a vaccine before Phase 3 trials are complete.

WHAT'S IMPORTANT TODAYUS won't join global vaccine effort because it is led by WHOThe White House said it will not participate in an international effort to develop and distribute the coronavirus vaccine because the initiative is tied to the World Health Organization (WHO). The decision will keep the US isolated from more than 170 countries involved in the COVAX initiative working to provide worldwide access to an effective vaccine, Paul LeBlanc writes. Aside from underscoring Trump's long-standing distrust of global alliances and, in particular, his criticism of WHO, the decision marks a notable bet on Operation Warp Speed, the federal government's effort to speed development of drugs, vaccines and other measures to fight the pandemic. A first recession in nearly three decades for AustraliaAustralia has fallen into its first economic recession in nearly 30 years, and shutdown measures and other efforts to contain the virus are being blamed.The country's GDP contracted 7% in the second quarter compared to the prior one, the Australian Bureau of Statistics said Wednesday. It marks the second straight quarter of declines -- GDP shrank 0.3% in the first quarter -- and the largest drop since records began in 1959.Australia had also been wrangling with issues before the pandemic. The country was ravaged by wildfires earlier this year, which hampered consumer spending and tourism, according to the Australian Tourism Export Council. CDC broadens eviction protections, Iowa given a dire warning In an extraordinary move to stave off an impending eviction crisis across the US, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued an order that halted evictions for some Americans struggling to pay their rent due to the pandemic. It did so by broadening existing protections. But senior administration officials say renters will have to prove a number of things before qualifying, and will still have to pay back any missed rent payments. This comes as a White House task force report sent to officials in Iowa warned of a dire rise in cases across the state. The report calls for a mask mandate, the closure of bars and a plan from universities as the pandemic intensifies in the Midwest. Last week, the state had more than 100 new cases per 100,000 population, the report notes. The three counties with the highest numbers of cases also have large student populations.More research emerges about Covid-19 long haulersMonths into the pandemic that has infected more than 6 million Americans, the public and experts alike are learning the impacts of Covid-19 can drag on longer than expected, Madeline Holcombe writes. The CDC advises that most Americans who have tested positive for coronavirus can return to work or school 10 days after, but new research indicates the virus and its symptoms are far from over by that date. The study also suggests that about one in five negative tests are false negatives, meaning many are still spreading the virus after testing negative without knowing it. Even once patients do test negative, many patients are reporting that their symptoms -- from aches to loss of smell to brain fog and affected mood -- can last months longer.ON OUR RADARThe pandemic has reached crisis levels in government-controlled areas of Syria, with health workers and facilities overwhelmed by a surge of cases. A Detroit park has been transformed into a temporary memorial for more than 1,500 residents, with hundreds of large portraits of people who've died from the virus lining its roadways More than 25,000 coronavirus cases in 37 states were reported at US colleges and universities, illustrating the struggle of reopening schools as the virus surges on campuses. Hong Kong will relax some Covid-19 restrictions as the city's locally transmitted cases start to drop, officials said Wednesday, months after it saw a peak of 149 cases in July. Havana residents will face a nightly curfew and will not be allowed to travel to other provinces for the first time since the coronavirus pandemic hit Cuba. This comes weeks after officials said the virus was all but defeated on the island. When the US and Canada mutually agreed to shut down their border to mitigate the spread of the coronavirus in March, no one predicted it would be closed this long. There is still no specified date for its reopening. TOP TIPSDoctors are sounding the alarm about Covid-19 misinformation and conspiracy theories running rampant on social media. One such theory falsely links 5G networks to the spread of the virus, focussing on the radio frequencies that signals travel over. But experts point out that low-band and mid-band 5G networks operate at largely the same frequencies as existing networks. \"There's nothing different in terms of exposure,\" said Kenneth Foster, professor of bioengineering at the University of Pennsylvania, whose research focuses on the health and safety aspects of electromagnetic fields interacting with human bodies.Major advancements from 5G will come as a result of high-band networks, where signals travel over millimeter wave frequencies. But millimeter wave frequencies should prompt even less concern because they can't penetrate surfaces such as walls, trees or human skin (that's one of the reasons they don't travel well).TODAY'S PODCAST\"Well, I was wrong.

The state's infection rate, she said, \"continues an alarming trend in the wrong direction.\" The state's seven-day average for new daily cases was 561 Monday, up from about 100 in mid-June, according to Johns Hopkins University data.To make matters worse, Kelly said, as college students return to campus, several clusters have been reported at universities. Last week, the University of Kansas reported more than 80 cases of the virus. The college is among dozens across the country that have reported Covid-19 cases after students moved into dorms.Read MoreIn Kentucky, Gov. Andy Beshear warned cases could spike again as the state reported more deaths last week than \"in any other week battling the virus.\"Beshear said the state is seeing \"troubling signs\" and is at \"the same moment that Kentucky was at in the beginning of the summer.\"\"More people are trying to get out of the quarantine than the health department has recommended,\" the governor said. The governors' messages come as, for the country as a whole, case and death rates are dropping, offering hope that the summer surge may be waning. But, alarmed by grim forecasts for what the fall and winter could look like in the US, health experts say now isn't the time to ease prevention measures. US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Dr. Robert Redfield expressed concern last week about the heart of the country getting \"stuck,\" while other parts of the US, including across the South, were reporting improvements.\"That is why it's so important for Middle America to recognize the mitigation that we talked about ... it's for Middle America too, the Nebraskas, the Oklahomas,\" Redfield said. \"We don't need to have a third wave in the heartland right now.\"The US has recorded more than 5.7 million infections and at least 178,140 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University. New daily cases over a week averaged about 43,000 as of Monday, down from a peak average of 67,317 on July 22, according to Johns Hopkins University data.The country's Covid-19 death rate also has dipped. The daily average across a week hovered above 1,000 for 25 straight days from late July into mid-August -- but it's been below 1,000 since Friday. The role super spreading events playThroughout the summer, US leaders and health officials have cautioned against large social gatherings saying it was those types of events that helped fuel a surge in positive cases. Earlier this month, a Georgia study showed super spreading events have been especially important in driving the pandemic in rural areas. But the warnings haven't brought gatherings to a halt.In South Dakota earlier this month, thousands from all over the US gathered for the Sturgis Motorcycle Rally, a massive annual event that usually brings in about 500,000 tourists. Experts said the event had the potential to become a super-spreader event. Now dozens of cases across several states are being linked back to the rally.In Minnesota, at least 27 cases were linked to the rally, two of which were people who worked or volunteered at the event, according to Kris Ehresmann, the infectious disease division director at the state's health department.At least seven cases in Nebraska's Panhandle region have been tied to the rally, and so were at least two cases reported by South Dakota officials. One positive result was a person who worked at a tattoo parlor in Sturgis, while the other was an individual who spent hours at a bar during the rally.Last week, Maine CDC officials issued a citation to a venue that exceeded the indoor gathering limit of 50 individuals when it hosted a wedding reception earlier this month that has since been linked to a Covid-19 outbreak. More than two dozen confirmed cases were associated with the wedding and reception. One of the individuals that tested positive following the wedding reception has died, Robert Peterson, the CEO of Millinocket Regional Hospital, said in a statement. FDA commissioner acknowledges error in his claims about convalescent plasma dataThe US Food and Drug Administration's commissioner acknowledged Monday that he mischaracterized data about the potential benefits of convalescent plasma in treating Covid-19.The FDA on Sunday said it issued an emergency use authorization for convalescent plasma, which is made using the blood of people who have recovered from coronavirus infections.While explaining that decision, Commissioner Dr. Stephen Hahn said Sunday that data from a Mayo Clinic study showed use of plasma reduced the risk of death by 35%, and said that meant if 100 people got coronavirus, 35 would survive because of the treatment. That's not what the study showed. This study, released August 12 in a preprint, meaning it had not yet been peer-reviewed, showed that those treated with plasma containing the highest levels of antibodies had a 35% lower risk of dying within a week compared to those treated with less-rich plasma. The study did not show the use of plasma reduced the overall death rate by 35%. Hahn admitted Monday he had been inaccurate.\"I have been criticized for remarks I made Sunday night about the benefits of convalescent plasma. The criticism is entirely justified. What I should have said better is that the data show a relative risk reduction not an absolute risk reduction,\" he tweeted Monday.He also has defended the emergency use authorization for convalescent plasma as data-driven, after several top health officials expressed skepticism there was enough data to justify it.Iowa officials confirm first child death Iowa's health department confirmed the state's first death of a child from Covid-19 complications in a news release this week. The child was under the age of 5 and died in June, according to the release. The child also had \"significant underlying health conditions,\" health officials said. Earlier this month, a 6-year-old girl became the youngest person in Florida to die of Covid-19 complications. In July, health officials reported the death of a 9-year-old girl who died of Covid-19 complications. Kimora \"Kimmie\" Lynum had no known underlying health conditions, her family said. The children's deaths come as many schools across the country have welcomed students back to class, while others have opted to begin the year remotely. Last week, the CDC updated its school guidance in order to better inform administrators' decisions about opening schools and limiting risks. The guidelines say in general, children are less likely to have severe symptoms than adults. The risk of teachers, school administrators and other staff will, however, \"mirror that of other adults in the community\" if they get sick, the guidelines said.Some colleges have also opted to go online while others, who welcomed students back to campus, have -- in some cases -- reported hundreds of Covid-19 infections.\n\nCNN's Jennifer Henderson, Jason Hanna, Maggie Fox, Jason Hoffman, Gisela Crespo, Laura Ly and Pierre Meilhan contributed to this report.",

        "body": "(CNN)Last month, researchers in one of India's largest cities made a surprising discovery. Of the nearly 7,000 blood samples taken from people in Mumbai's slums, 57% tested positive for coronavirus antibodies.\n\nWhile some were alarmed by the results of the study conducted by the Mumbai authorities and the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, others were optimistic. Mumbai's slums, where social distancing is nearly impossible, might now have some of the highest levels of immunity in the world -- only 23.5% of samples taken by India's National Center for Disease Control tested positive for antibodies in Delhi and 14% tested positive in New York, in a study sponsored by the New York State Department of Health.Scientists believe it's likely that recovering from coronavirus leaves a person with some immunity, but it's not clear how strong it is or how long it lasts. Herd immunity is the idea that a disease will stop spreading once enough of a population becomes immune -- and is appealing because, in theory, it might provide some protection for those who haven't been ill.If more than half of people in Mumbai's slums had contracted coronavirus, could they be approaching herd immunity -- without a vaccine? One expert thought so. Read More\"Mumbai's slums may have reached herd immunity,\" Jayaprakash Muliyil, chairman of the Scientific Advisory Committee of India's National Institute of Epidemiology, said, according to a Bloomberg report. \"If people in Mumbai want a safe place to avoid infection, they should probably go there.\"But others have been more cautious. David Dowdy, an associate professor in epidemiology at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, said it was possible that the researchers had used a test that created false positives. And Om Shrivastav, an infectious diseases expert in Mumbai, cautioned that, less than eight months into the virus' existence in society, it was too early to make any \"decisive, conclusive statements.\" If Mumbai's slums are on the brink of herd immunity, it has come at a cost. Of India's more than 2 million coronavirus cases, about 5% of those infections were reported in Mumbai, the country's commercial capital. As of Monday, more than 6,940 people had died in the city, according to the city's health authorities. The risk of a high death toll is exactly why India's health authorities say the country is not aiming for herd immunity. \"Herd immunity can be achieved through immunization -- but that is in future,\" health official Rajesh Bhushan told reporters last month.What is herd immunity?Herd immunity works like this: Assume that each infected person infects three more people. If two of those three people are immune, then the virus is only able to make one person sick. This mean that fewer people are infected by the illness -- and over time, even people who aren't immune end up being protected as they are less likely to be exposed to the virus.The level of immunity needed in a population depends on the disease. Scientists don't yet know what proportion of a population needs to be immune to achieve herd immunity for the novel coronavirus.Currently, scientists believe that each person infected with coronavirus infects between 2 to 2.5 people, according to the World Health Organization. But that number can be affected by other measures -- a lockdown, for instance, could bring down the number of people that each person with coronavirus infects. It's hard to know what the threshold is for herd immunity. Initially, some estimates put the figure at 70% to 90%. Adam Kleczkowski, a professor in mathematics and statistics at the University of Strathclyde, Glasgow, calculates it at 50% to 75%, based on what scientists know about how the virus transmits. With measles, for instance, researchers at the start of the 20th century noticed that infections declined when 68% of children had immunity. But Dowdy points out that measles outbreaks in areas where people are opting not to get vaccinated against measles shows how immunity can be lost.Building up the level of immunity in a population can happen in two ways. People can become immune by being vaccinated, or they catch the virus and develop natural immunity by recovering from it.And that's where things get controversial.The United Kingdom initially said that it would allow the spread of coronavirus within the country to build up to herd immunity. That approach came under fire, with critics warning that it would come at a heavy price: overburdened health systems and unnecessarily high death tolls. The UK -- which backtracked on its herd immunity strategy -- now has more confirmed coronavirus deaths than most countries. Of the 20 countries most affected by coronavirus, the UK has the highest mortality rate, with 69.63 deaths per 100,000 compared to the US' 52.28, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. Most other countries -- including India -- have taken a different approach. \"Herd immunity in a country with the size of population of India cannot be a strategic choice, it can only be an outcome and that, too, at a very high cost,\" said the health official, Bhushan.As Dowdy puts it: \"We could very rapidly develop a population immunity to the coronavirus simply by exposing every single person in the population to the disease ... it's just that millions and millions of people are going to die in the process.\"Can we build natural immunity?The science around immunity to Covid-19 is still developing.A paper released last month -- which has not yet been published in a peer-reviewed medical journal -- found that antibody responses may start to decline 20 to 30 days after Covid-19 symptoms emerge. The fact that antibody levels decline over time doesn't necessarily mean that immunity doesn't last, Dowdy says. In other viruses, antibody levels decline over time, too, but the immune response is still able to ramp up again if a person is re-exposed to the virus. According to Dowdy, our immunity to other coronaviruses tends to last a few years, rather than being life-long. \"If those are a guide, then that's what we might expect from this new coronavirus,\" he said. \"But it's hard to say. We don't have any data on this particular virus.\"Antibodies are only one part of the body's immune system -- there are also T cells, which help protect the body from infection, and B cells, which produce the antibodies. \"It is a well co-ordinated orchestra,\" said Anthony Tanoto, a senior research fellow at Duke-NUS Medical School in Singapore, who worked on research into T cells in Covid-19 patients. In a paper published in science journal Nature in July, Tanoto and his co-authors found evidence of T cells from people who had recovered from SARS -- a coronavirus which spread in 2003 -- indicating that the cells can last for at least 17 years.The common cold is a coronavirus and scientists believe that almost everyone has been infected with a coronavirus in their lifetime. That could mean that many people have T cells that might respond to Covid-19.But for now, Tanoto says we don't know how much -- if at all -- these T cells are helping fight off Covid. In reality, once there is herd immunity -- whether naturally or through vaccines -- it probably won't be the impenetrable shield some people might imagine. Tanoto's co-author Nina Le Bert, a senior research fellow at Duke-NUS Medical School in Singapore, points out that it's rare to have complete immunity from infection. Instead, immunity often means that a person's body is able to respond fast enough to the virus so that it doesn't gain a foothold -- and doesn't develop enough to infect other people.\"That will be good enough, but that doesn't mean you don't get infected,\" Le Bert said. What does this mean for herd immunity?Even if certain areas do achieve herd immunity, it might not last.The virus could mutate, meaning people who previously had immunity are no longer immune to the new version of the virus, or a person's immunity to the virus might not last long, according to Kleczkowski, from the University of Strathclyde.\"Even if we reach herd immunity at some point in time, we might lose it again,\" he said. \"I don't think it's a silver bullet.\"Dowdy says that herd immunity \"isn't a magic number\" to solve coronavirus.\"It doesn't mean that the disease is going to go away. It means that if you gave it 1,000 years, it would go away.\"And he notes that how long herd immunity lasts -- whether it's in a slum or a whole country -- partly depends on how much movement there is in and out of that population. If people without immunity come into the area, that lowers the population's overall level of immunity. If enough people come in, that could mean that there are enough people without immunity for the virus to spread again. In a Mumbai slum, for instance, people are likely to be coming and going, which could impact how long herd immunity -- if there is any -- lasts. Utture Shankar, the president of the Maharashtra Medical Council, said people outside slum areas were dependent on those living in slums for services such as gardening, cleaning and driving, so will be exposed beyond their residential community. In 10 years' time, Kleczkowski expects that some places in the world will still have coronavirus. Even if there is herd immunity in some places, there may still be an issue with the virus resurfacing, especially if people refuse to get vaccinated. He points out that, although humans have had vaccines for 200 years, we have only successfully eradicated one disease affecting humans -- small pox, thanks to a global vaccination program led by the World Health Organization. But it took a long time. A vaccine was discovered in the late 18th century, but smallpox was only officially declared eradicated in 1979. When it comes to coronavirus, vaccines are the key to herd immunity -- and controlling the virus, Dowdy says.\"I think this is a disease that's going to be with us for a while,\" he said. \"But I don't think it's going to be a disease that causes the same level of deaths and suffering as it is right now.\"\n\nCNN's Esha Mitra contributed to this story from New Delhi.",

Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds.\n\n(CNN)Michelle Obama recently revealed that because of the pandemic and racial injustice in the US, she has been experiencing low-grade depression.\n\nFor the former first lady -- perhaps the most well-known Black woman in the world -- to be so candid about her mental health is hugely significant, two psychiatrists told CNN.\"It allows other Black women and women of color to understand that we all can essentially not feel great,\" said Dr. Michelle Durham, an assistant professor of psychiatry at the Boston University School of Medicine. \"It normalizes that mental illness can happen to anyone at anytime, and that we can all struggle.\"Americans are experiencing more mental health consequences related to Covid-19 than people in other countries, a new report found. Since the coronavirus pandemic began, one in three adults in the US report symptoms of anxiety or depressive disorders, according to a June survey from the Kaiser Family Foundation. And numerous studies have shown that the pandemic has hit people of color, particularly Black people, the hardest.Add to that the trauma and stresses caused by the killings of Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery, George Floyd, Rayshard Brooks and other Black people, and it's especially evident that for Black people in America, mental health is a serious concern.Read More\"[Michelle Obama] makes it okay to talk about, and I think that will open the discussion up for so many people, especially during the pandemic, who are really struggling with trying to understand the emotions that they're experiencing,\" said Dr. Erica Richards, assistant professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine.Some Black women can be reluctant to seek helpThough there has been increased awareness and discourse around mental health among Black people in recent years, conditions like depression can still be stigmatized.People who seek out the help of a mental health professional are sometimes concerned that others may view them as \"weak\" or \"broken\" -- concerns that research suggests are prevalent among African Americans. \"In the Black community, a lot of times mental health is really not the focus of discussion,\" Richards said. \"And what that leads people to believe is that, 'Well, it's not something that my race, my culture, my people, identify with.'\"Black women in particular often face pressures to stay strong in the face of everything they're dealing with, said Durham. And that can make them reluctant to seek help.\"There's been this narrative historically that [Black women] can take on a lot of stress,\" she said. \"You work, take care of families, kids, communities and that you're superhuman in some way.\"That's why Obama's decision to open up is so important, Durham added.\"I don't think society has always allowed a Black woman to be vulnerable in that way,\" she said. \"[Obama] demonstrated to us the vulnerability we don't always get to see.\"Black people are less likely to receive careBlack adults are more likely than white adults to report persistent feelings of sadness, hopelessness or that everything is an effort, according to the Health and Human Services Office of Minority Health. There's also a gender gap: women are about twice as likely as men to develop depression.Still, only about one in three Black or African American adults who had a mental illness received care for it, according to data from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration.Even when Black women do seek mental health services because of their stresses and emotions, they're sometimes dismissed, misdiagnosed or underdiagnosed, Durham said.That can be due to a lack of cultural competency among health care providers, according to the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI). For example, a provider without an understanding of African American populations might not recognize that when a Black individual is describing symptoms such as body aches and pains, they could be experiencing depression.\"That's part of racism and discrimination that's happened not only in our communities but also in medicine,\" she said. \"And so I would encourage all of our providers in the medical field to not under or misdiagnose or undertreat when Black women are presenting with these symptoms and they're asking for help.\"How to spot symptoms of mental illnessThe Covid-19 pandemic and the ongoing protests over systemic racism have brought to the forefront how important mental health is to a person's well-being, Durham said.Everyone feels a little down sometimes. But if you haven't been feeling like yourself lately, that's a sign that you may be experiencing a mood disorder, she said. Look out for changes to your usual sleep patterns or quality, difficulties in concentrating, not finding joy in the things that used to make you happy or persistent feelings of sadness or hopelessness, Durham said. And if you start to notice changes from your normal behavior, seek medical advice.Richards added that it's important to remember that you can say no to certain commitments and responsibilities and to reach out to those you trust, whether it's a medical professional, your friends and family or your faith community.And finally, recognize that what you're feeling is natural -- an idea that Obama reiterated, too.\"The idea that what this country is going through shouldn't have any effect on us -- that we all should just feel OK all the time -- that just doesn't feel real to me,\" she wrote in an Instagram post. \"So I hope you all are allowing yourselves to feel whatever it is you're feeling.\"",

        "body": "Chat with us in Facebook Messenger. Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds.\n\n(CNN)Joe Biden, the Democratic presidential nominee, has not been tested for Covid-19.\n\nThat's the big news we got over the weekend when Biden deputy campaign manager Kate Bedingfield sat down for an interview with ABC's George Stephanopoulos on Sunday. Here's the relevant exchange:Stephanopoulos: Let me ask a separate question on Covid. On July 28, Joe Biden said he hadn't been tested for the coronavirus. But this week your campaign refused to -- on two occasions to answer the question of whether or not he had been tested.So, can you clarify, has Joe Biden been tested for Covid? Has he had the virus?Read MoreBedingfield: He has not had the virus. We have put in place really strict protocols, as I think all of your journalists who attended our convention in Delaware this week saw. We put in place incredibly strict protocols to ensure that everybody involved who is around Vice President Biden, who's around Senator Harris, is undergoing the appropriate testing. The vice president has not had the virus and --Stephanopoulos: Has he been tested?Bedingfield: He has not -- he has not been tested. However, we have put the strictest protocols in place and -- and moving forward should he need to be tested, he certainly would be. But he has not been tested yet.OK, so a couple of questions here:1) How does Bedingfield know that Biden has not as Covid? Many cases are asymptomatic. And you wouldn't be able to tell either way unless he took a test.2) Why hasn't Biden, a 77-year-old man who is now the Democratic nominee for president, taken a test out of an abundance of caution?3) Why were other people -- including reporters -- who attended convention events at the Westin Hotel in Wilmington tested for Covid-19 three straight days, while the former vice president hasn't been tested a single time? As Thomas Kaplan, a reporter at The New York Times, put it on Twitter after finding out Biden had not been tested: \"What this means: Biden did not follow the health and safety protocols that others were required to follow to enter the convention venue in Wilmington.\"The answer, I suspect, to all of these questions would be a lot like this part of what Bedingfield told Stephanopoulos: \"We put in place incredibly strict protocols to ensure that everybody involved who is around Vice President Biden, who's around Senator Harris, is undergoing the appropriate testing.\"Which sounds a lot like what the White House said in the early stages of the pandemic in the United States when asked whether President Donald Trump had been tested. Asked in mid-March about being tested, Trump said this: \"I don't think it's a big deal, I would do it, I don't feel any reason -- I feel extremely good,\" said Trump, adding he had \"no symptoms, no anything.\" Which is, of course, totally beside the point! We know that asymptomatic transmission of Covid-19 happens. So, whether Trump was feeling any symptoms doesn't make any difference.The same holds true for Biden. We have seen -- time and again -- that while strict mask-wearing and social-distancing protocols are effective in mitigating the spread of the coronavirus, they don't fully protect against transmission. No matter what protocols are in place, the virus has shown a way of infiltrating even the most buttoned-up spaces. So, in short, there is simply no way of knowing a person does not have the virus unless that person is tested for the virus -- and it comes back negative. Which is what makes this back-and-forth between a reporter and a Biden aide (as reported by Buzzfeed's Ruby Cramer) on Thursday night all the more disheartening:\"Mr. Biden, have you been tested for Covid 19?\" a reporter tried shouting to Biden after he and Jill watched the fireworks on Thursday night.\"Are you kidding me?\" a Biden aide shot back.Now. None of this is to suggest Biden has Covid-19. It's extremely, extremely, extremely likely he doesn't.\n\nTHE POINT -- NOW ON YOUTUBE!\n\nIn each episode of his weekly YouTube show, Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics. Click to subscribe!\n\nBut Biden is not the average person -- where there is no need to over-task the patchwork testing when someone isn't showing symptoms. (Nota bene: I had my own personal experience with the testing nightmare in this country over the weekend.) He is 1 of 2 people in the country -- sorry Kanye! -- who could be president. He is also, like Trump, a septuagenarian, and, therefore, at higher risk for a negative outcome if he did contract the virus.Plus, there's symbolic import here, too. If our leaders are looked to for right behavior (and they are) then why wouldn't Biden simply take a test, come out and declare, \"It wasn't that bad!\" Or something like it?Remember, too, that Biden's entire campaign is premised on the idea of restoring the moral leadership, common decency and shared humanity that he argues Trump has crushed. What better way to do that than lead by example in terms of testing?The decision not to test Biden is both baffling and short-sighted. And the annoyance -- at least by one aide -- at a reporter for asking why Biden hadn't been tested is, well, positively Trumpian.",

        "body": "(CNN)While some Americans wait several days or longer for Covid-19 test results, the American Medical Association and other groups want new federal guidelines to help fast-track those who need testing and results urgently.\n\nThat would be good news for those suffering symptoms or who were definitely exposed to someone with the coronavirus. But it could mean longer delays for those seeking test results before going back to work, returning to school, or visiting friends or family.\"Updated guidelines are critical to manage the ever-increasing demand for COVID19 testing,\" since \"no additional manufacturing capacity for many testing supplies is likely to be available through the remainder of this year,\" the AMA and several other medical groups wrote in a letter dated Tuesday to Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar.\"As the country continues to struggle to provide laboratories with a consistent supply of reagents, viral transport media, plastics (such as a pipette tips), and other items essential to providing both COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 testing, we recommend that the Administration consider updating testing prioritization guidelines to ensure that the limited testing resources available are directed at those with a medically-indicated need for tests and those identified by well-defined public health surveillance efforts.\"Read MoreThe Trump administration's testing czar has said results ideally should be delivered within 24 hours of a coronavirus test. The Department of Health and Human Services did not respond Wednesday to CNN's request for comment on the letter. Who would get priority testing, and who wouldn't?The medical groups suggested \"those with COVID19 symptoms, those with known exposures to COVID-19, and those in need of pre-procedure testing\" should have access to prompt testing and test results. But even though some health officials have encouraged people without symptoms to get tested to help reduce asymptomatic spread, the massive demand for tests has created delays for those who already have symptoms or those who were directly exposed to someone with Covid-19. \"As significant surges in new COVID-19 cases create significant demand for new tests, we are also seeing an increase in demand for testing of asymptomatic individuals with no medically indicated need for testing services,\" the letter said. \"These include tests for employees going back to work, students returning to colleges and universities, and individuals wishing to engage in non-essential travel.\"And without improvement in available supplies, \"we simply do not have the resources to meet the huge demand for testing by asymptomatic individuals without exposure to COVID-19,\" the groups wrote.\"We remain hopeful that the United States will soon be able to bolster manufacturing to meet the needs of everyone desiring a COVID-19 test. However, until manufacturing can meet our unprecedented demand for testing services, it is critical that we prioritize our testing resources where they are needed most.\"The American Academy of Pediatrics on Thursday released separate -- but virtually identical -- recommendations to help health care providers determine when to test for the coronavirus. Children with symptoms, those who have been in close contact with someone with confirmed Covid-19, or those having elective surgery should be tested, the guidance states.How major delays make some tests 'borderline useless'This coronavirus is notorious for how easily it's spread by people who are asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic. So the longer an infected person without symptoms has to wait for test results, the longer that person might be infecting others unknowingly. \"People can be contagious without symptoms. And in fact -- a little bit strangely in this case -- people tend to be the most contagious before they develop symptoms, if they're going to develop symptoms,\" CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta said.\"They call that the pre-symptomatic period. So people tend to have more virus at that point seemingly in their nose, in their mouth. This is even before they get sick. And they can be shedding that virus into the environment.\"The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates 40% of coronavirus transmissions happen before people feel sick. That's one of the reasons why wearing masks is so important. In June, after crowds of young adults were seen reveling without face masks, the White House coronavirus task force coordinator urged all millennials to get tested. \"Thanks to the millennials who have been heeding our guidance, they have been coming forward and getting testing,\" Dr. Deborah Birx said. \"Whereas before we told them to stay home, now we are telling them to be tested. And this is a great change for us because it allows us now to find the asymptomatic and the mild diseases that we couldn't find before.\"But since then, testing capabilities haven't kept up with demand. In late July, the Trump administration's testing czar said while testing capabilities have improved, \"we are not going to stop our efforts until testing is exactly where we want it to be with rapid turnaround times.\" \"We are never going to be happy with testing until we get turnaround times within 24 hours,\" said Adm. Brett Giroir, a physician. At the time, he said, about half of the tests performed had results within about 24 hours. But as of early August, some people were waiting more than 10 days to receive test results -- meaning non-symptomatic carriers could be spreading Covid-19 to others. At that point, testing becomes \"borderline useless,\" said Dr. Ashish Jha, director of the Harvard Global Health Institute.If faster testing were universally available, he said in late July, \"we could drive this epidemic down, and we could bury it and get very low number of cases.\"\n\nCNN's Naomi Thomas contributed to this report.",

        "body": "(CNN)Researchers say they have evidence that a woman caught coronavirus on a flight -- perhaps in the jet's restroom.\n\nThe 28-year-old woman was among about 300 South Koreans evacuated from Italy at the height of the coronavirus pandemic in Milan last March, the researchers wrote in the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's journal Emerging Infectious Diseases.\"On the flight from Milan, Italy, to South Korea, she wore an N95 mask, except when she used a toilet,\" they wrote.\"The toilet was shared by passengers sitting nearby, including an asymptomatic patient. She was seated three rows away from the asymptomatic patient,\" they added.The South Korean officials who organized the flight had put into effect full infection control measures and tested everyone before they boarded. All the passengers and crew were quarantined when they got to South Korea, as well. Six passengers tested positive soon after arrival in South Korea.Read MoreThe 28-year-old woman developed symptoms eight days after she got home and was hospitalized. \"Given that she did not go outside and had self-quarantined for three weeks alone at her home in Italy before the flight and did not use public transportation to get to the airport, it is highly likely that her infection was transmitted in the flight via indirect contact with an asymptomatic patient,\" the researchers at Soonchunhyang University College of Medicine in Seoul wrote.There has been very little evidence about whether people can catch coronavirus on a flight, although many airlines have policies leaving more space for passengers, are cleaning aircraft more frequently, and are encouraging passengers to stay in their seats and not move about the aircraft. Evidence already shows aircraft ventilation systems clean the air quickly and thoroughly.\"This study was one of the earliest to assess asymptomatic transmission of COVID-19 on an aircraft. Previous studies of inflight transmission of other respiratory infectious diseases, such as influenza and severe acute respiratory syndrome, revealed that sitting near a person with a respiratory infectious disease is a major risk factor for transmission similar to our own findings,\" the researchers wrote.The researchers said the officials organizing the flight took many precautions. \"When the passengers arrived at the Milan airport, medical staff performed physical examinations, medical interviews, and body temperature checks outside the airport before boarding, and 11 symptomatic passengers were removed from the flight,\" they wrote.Passengers got N95 respirators -- masks shown to protect the wearer for viral infections -- and were kept six feet apart before boarding.\"Most passengers wore the N95 respirators except at mealtimes and when using the toilet during the flight. After an 11-hour flight, 299 asymptomatic passengers arrived in South Korea and were immediately quarantined for two weeks at a government quarantine facility in which the passengers were completely isolated from one another. Medical staff examined them twice daily for elevated body temperature and symptoms of COVID-19.\"Researchers in Germany reported earlier this month that two people may have become infected before, during or after a flight from Tel Aviv to Frankfurt in March.They were seated near the back of the aircraft, directly across the aisle from seven passengers who later turned out to have been infected.",

Find out what's happening in the world as it unfolds.\n\n(CNN)As 19-year-old Alyannah Buhman begins her junior year of pre-law studies at Iowa State University, she has ambitions of a career in civil rights law.\n\nShe is inspired by her grandfather, a police officer, and by growing up biracial in a small town in which there were only a few Black people.But living with diabetes during a pandemic presents major challenges to those dreams, most of which aren't immediately obvious. \"If you look at me you'd think I was perfectly normal, until you saw a little device sticking out,\" she said.That device checks her blood sugar every few minutes, buzzing if it's too high or too low, and houses a pump that can kick in to deliver insulin. Infections can easily disrupt that delicate balance, throwing her glucose into wild fluctuations.The threat of coronavirus has left her \"very on edge,\" she said. \"I get sick really easily. I cannot fight off anything to save my life. I start puking everywhere. It's a terrifying thought.\"Read MoreAs college students move into dorms, apartments and fraternity or sorority houses for the fall semester, Buhman is one of countless young Americans with chronic conditions now shouldering the risk of campus life in order to pursue their dreams.These young people are funny, energetic, ambitious and generous, with illness giving them more wisdom than their years merit.With weakened immune systems, they want people to know that Covid-19 won't just simply pass through them, presenting with only mild symptoms. It could severely hobble or kill them.These high-risk individuals are taking precautions, and they hope you will, too. Because their lives depend on it. That's what Alyannah Buhman, Maddy Boehme and Alexandria Stamer said in a video produced by the Hashimoto's Encephalopathy SREAT Alliance, emphasizing the need for social distancing and mask adherence to protect young people with a range of conditions compromising their immune systems. College students are returning to campus during a pandemicAbout 3% of the adult US population is immunocompromised, or some 7 million Americans, according to a National Health Interview Survey. And 1 in 10 people is affected by one of about 7,000 known rare diseases, according to Global Genes, an organization that advocates for patients and families affected by rare medical conditions. Half of those affected are children, and three in 10 children with rare diseases won't survive to their fifth birthday.Kids who luckily make it to their college years pursue their educational dreams, romance and and happiness -- with some modifications, particularly during a pandemic. \"Just because classes are online doesn't mean our illness or disability goes away,\" said Sneha Dave, founder and executive director of Health Advocacy Summit, a group that empowers young adults and college students through advocacy events and programs. She recently graduated from Indiana University.Dave appeared on a disability caucus panel at the Democratic National Convention on Tuesday, and worked with the American College Health Association, to help author a tool kit for vulnerable students returning to campus who need to ask for reasonable accommodations from administrators and professors.During the pandemic, Dave urges students needing health-related accommodations for their dorms, classes and activities to meticulously document what they've requested and what the school has agreed to modify for them.\"I can't emphasize enough the point to have everything in writing, she said. \"Universities will have to be held accountable if they are choosing to be in person.\" An aspiring civil rights attorney with diabetes fears college partiesBuhman lives in an off-campus apartment with two other women, where she takes all her classes online and is continuing her role this year with an extracurricular mentoring program -- albeit virtually. Although she lives off campus, she has a roommate who has to take labs in person, in courses that could number up to a hundred students.To control virus spread, Iowa State has pivoted to virtual learning, mandated masks on campus, cut class sizes, emphasized social distancing and expanded Wi-Fi availability further outside buildings. But the school can't control everything.For instance, the college made headlines this week with its so-called \"801\" parties, a reference to 8:01 a.m. the Saturday before classes start, when huge parties begin early in the morning and last all day.\"I sat inside all day because I was terrified,\" Buhman said. \"I have a feeling that over the next few weeks the coronavirus will explode.\"Before the 801 parties, 175 incoming Iowa State students had already tested positive during the school's move-in period, or 2.2% of students, the university reported. They were able to quarantine in isolated rooms.She fears what could happen if that type of party culture were to continue abated. \"I get nervous,\" she said. \"It's a very real virus. It's a scary thing.\"A graphic design graduate has a rare brain disorderMaddy Boehme, who also participated in the Hashimoto's Encephalopathy SREAT Alliance video, graduated from Western Iowa Tech Community College last spring with a graphic design degree.\"I had a job but I lost it due to the coronavirus,\" she said from her parents' coffee shop in Le Mars, Iowa.Boehme has Hashimoto's encephalopathy, a rare disorder affecting the brain, which began at age 16.\"It was like my brain was tossed in a frying pan,\" she explained. The diagnosis requires her to take a cocktail of medicines, including steroids and immune suppressants, each day, and to receive immunoglobulin infusions at home each week.\"My immune system is half gone,\" she said. She is fortunate to live in a small town, in which Covid-19 cases are rare -- so far. She won't leave home without donning a mask, although doing so makes her stick out. \"It's sort of alienating in a sense,\" she continued. \"I wouldn't say we're a mask-wearing community around here.\"Fighting a life-altering illness over the past six years has taught her lessons about radical acceptance of unchanging circumstance, insights she feels could be extended to how the whole country ought to contend with the pandemic.\"The more I'd fight it, the more I'd continue to faceplant,\" she said. \"I had to learn to live with it and accept it.\"In news reports, she sees the country struggling with the type of acceptance she was forced to learn personally.\"It's a simple thing to we can do to wear a mask whether it works or not. And I'm not looking to test the waters with the coronavirus,\" she said. \"The moment you let your guard down is when you might get it.\"A college football player feels safe only with his teamSam Heckel, a former offensive lineman for Syracuse University's football team, is moving back this week for his final year of college. The 6-foot-4 280-pound hulk has lived with congenital thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura since he was in the second grade, a rare blood disorder that can cause clots blocking the flow of blood to vital organs. It requires him to go to the hospital every two weeks for a four-hour plasma therapy infusion.Heckel played in 26 games across three seasons for the Syracuse Orange. As a freshman he distinguished himself as the team leader in knockdown blocks, and as a sophomore he blocked for an offense ranked 11th in the nation. Last season, he was disqualified from college football after having a concussion, but he plans to stay involved with the team again this year.He accomplished all that while receiving regular infusions for TTP. \"Working out after a treatment is never fun,\" he said. \"It kind of stunk practicing afterwards. If I go into a practice that way, coaches have to know.\"But the coronavirus looms as an altogether different opponent. \"I'm nervous for all the students to come back,\" he said. \"I hope nothing is going on on campus in terms of parties and social life. My life is in other people's hands.\"The earth science major is considering going into the oil business. One option for how to do that is to pursue a master's degree at Syracuse, which could be funded if he were to work as a graduate assistant coach for the school's football program.Despite the necessary contact of a rough team sport, he is confident in the precautions the football team is taking to protect its players. \"I have faith in our administration and in our football program,\" he said. \"Just the big question is the students.\"\"I'm sure if I got (coronavirus) my symptoms would be more severe.\"A recent graduate receives infusions in her garageIn the Southern California town of Whittier, Lilly Grossman is still reeling from an emergency room visit for Covid-19 symptoms early in the pandemic.She had a 103-degree temperature and was coughing up blood. \"It was like a common cold until all of a sudden it wasn't,\" her mother explained.The 23-year-old graduate from Whittier College has ADCY5-related dyskinesia, a hyperkinetic movement disorder characterized by involuntary abnormal movements. Grossman, who has a more severe case, uses a wheelchair to get around and requires a monthly infusion that helps boost her immune system and her energy level.While a nightmare for any family, an emergency room trip is a particularly devastating thought for a family with a child with Grossman's condition. She is completely dependent on others for tasks such as dressing, cooking, showering and using the restroom.During her ambulance ride and hospital visit, \"I was aware, but I couldn't talk. That was frustrating,\" said Grossman, whose mother came to help explain her disease to doctors.Only a few hundred people in the world have been diagnosed with ADCY5-related dyskinesia, and Grossman was the one of the first, after scientists sequenced her genome and isolated a gene that is active in the brain coordinating movements.For people with mobility issues, Covid-19's ability to severely restrict a patient's breathing is just one of many reasons Grossman's family is staying as far away as possible from other people. Even the nurse who comes to deliver Grossman's infusions only enters into the garage.\"We are probably the least affected (in town) because we're so careful,\" Grossman's mother, Gay Grossman, said. \"She hasn't been anywhere. We have a small pod of people who are just as strict as we are.\"In college, Grossman studied political science and minored in English, aspiring to become a journalist for National Public Radio. She frequently writes about disability and chronic illness issues and plans to pursue graduate work in disability studies online through the City University of New York.\"You can't control what other people do, but you can control what you do,\" she said.\n\nCNN's Sandee LaMotte contributed to this story.",
