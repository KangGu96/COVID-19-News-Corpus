        "body": "So-called \"half-masking,\" or wearing a face mask below the nose, may allow coronavirus the opportunity to enter your body, according to a recent study and health experts. During the coronavirus pandemic, half-masking still leaves you at risk for contracting Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, physicians told Fox News.\n\n\"It's like wearing your pants with only one leg in,\" Dr. Frederick Davis, associate chair of emergency medicine at Northwell Health/Long Island Jewish Hospital in New York, told Fox News. \"A mask, or other face covering, should cover both your mouth and nose.\"\n\nANTIVIRAL NASAL SPRAY MAY FIGHT CORONAVIRUS, STUDY FINDS\n\nA study out of the University of North Carolina (UNC) published in the journal Cell suggested the novel coronavirus tends to first penetrate and infect the nasal cavity and in some cases can be aspirated into the lungs, where it can progress to pneumonia, according to a study news release.\n\nThe team of researchers at UNC used reporter cells to track the Sars-CoV-2 virus and mapped where it infiltrated the respiratory tract. They noted the novel coronavirus infected the nasal passages the most and decreased infiltration as it progressed down the respiratory path to the throat and lungs, according to the study.\n\nThe published report also revealed that the virus targeted ACE2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme-2) cell receptors as its means of entry to the body. The ACE2 receptors are more abundant in the nasal-lining tissue and less prevalent in the lower portions of the respiratory tract, according to the report.\n\nOne of the co-authors of the study told Fox News this could explain why the nasal portion of the upper respiratory tract was more susceptible to COVID-19 infection and why wearing a mask is ultimately important.\n\n\"Unfortunately, SARS-CoV-2 has learned how to evade normal nasal host defense mechanisms and uses this receptor to infect the nasal lining cells,\" co-senior author of the study, Dr. Richard Boucher, director of the Marsico Lung Institute at the UNC School of Medicine, told Fox News. \"Nasal cells, unfortunately again, are endowed with the ability to produce literally millions of viruses when infected.\"\n\n\"Viruses produced in the nose can be then distributed to the olfactory tissues in the roof of the nose, producing loss of smell, to the mouth, infecting salivary glands and producing symptoms of dry mouth, and to the lung where they produce pneumonia with shortness of breath and indeed death. So a mask must protect the nose to be effective in preventing the acquisition and spread of COVID19,\" Boucher explained.\n\nDr. Fred Davis, who was not part of the study, also remarked on the importance of covering the nose and mouth with a mask.\n\nN95 MASKS USED AGAINST CORONAVIRUS CAN BE DECONTAMINATED WITH RICE COOKER: STUDY\n\n\"Any face covering is not as effective if only one's mouth is covered since many viruses are transmitted by respiratory particles that both come from and enter the body through one's nose and mouth,\" Davis told Fox News.\n\nThe emergency department physician said half-masking is ineffective.\n\n\"Having a face covering only covering your mouth and not your nose does not utilize the covering to its full potential to reduce your risk of spreading or contracting the disease,\" Davis said. \"It's important to wear a mask when you are in contact with others, and when you do, to wear it properly.\"",

(iStock)\n\nNow that dentists have reopened their doors, they're having patients show up with a nasty set of symptoms, which the doctors have dubbed \"mask mouth.\"\n\nThe new oral hygiene issue -- caused by, you guessed it, wearing a mask all the time to prevent the spread of the coronavirus -- is leading to all kinds of dental disasters like decaying teeth, receding gum lines and seriously sour breath.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR COMPLETE CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE\n\n\"We're seeing inflammation in people's gums that have been healthy forever, and cavities in people who have never had them before,\" says Dr. Rob Ramondi, a dentist and co-founder of One Manhattan Dental. \"About 50% of our patients are being impacted by this, [so] we decided to name it 'mask mouth' -- after 'meth mouth.'\u2009\"\n\nThe term \"meth mouth\" is widely used by dentists to describe the dental problems that arise among methamphetamine users. Addicts often end up with cracked, black- and brown-stained teeth because the stimulant causes sugar cravings, teeth grinding and jaw clenching. They also often neglect their oral hygiene.\n\nHOW THIS N95 MASK COULD PUT OTHERS AT RISK FOR ILLNESS\n\nWhile mask mouth isn't quite as obvious, if left untreated, the results could be equally harmful.\n\n\"Gum disease -- or periodontal disease -- will eventually lead to strokes and an increased risk of heart attacks,\" says Dr. Marc Sclafani, another co-founder of One Manhattan Dental.\n\nHe says the stinky syndrome is triggered by face coverings since wearing a mask increases the dryness of the mouth -- and a buildup of bad bacteria.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER\n\n\"People tend to breathe through their mouth instead of through their nose while wearing a mask,\" says Sclafani. \"The mouth breathing is causing the dry mouth, which leads to a decrease in saliva -- and saliva is what fights the bacteria and cleanses your teeth.\"\n\nHe adds that \"saliva is also what neutralizes acid in the mouth and helps prevent tooth decay and gum disease.\"\n\nPeople's tendency to drink less water while masked up, as well as consume more coffee and alcohol during lockdown, have also added to the widespread dehydration he's seeing.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nOn the bright side, the dentists say that they're packing in breath-conscious patients who might otherwise neglect their dental health during the pandemic.\n\n\"Patients are coming into us like, 'Wow, my breath smells, I need a cleaning.' [But] when you smell the bad breath, you either already have periodontal disease or you have a lot of bacteria that's sitting on your tongue because of dry mouth,\" says Sclafani.\n\nWhile masks are not negotiable given the times, Sclafani says there are things wearers can do to avoid their grossest side effect: drink more water, cut down on caffeine, snag a humidifier (to \"help moisten the air\"), use an alcohol-free mouthwash, scrape your tongue and don't smoke.\n\nAnd if all else fails? \"Just breathe through your nose!\"",

        "body": "A side effect of COVID-19 for this millennial is no longer being able to taste his favorite food.\n\nWhen Greg Shuluk, 29, contracted COVID-19 in March, he experienced mild symptoms. He felt feverish, began coughing, and lost his sense of smell and taste. The Westchester, N.Y., native says the cough went away in a month, but now, five months later, his lack of taste and smell persists.\n\n\"I can tell if something is sweet or salty, but food tastes super bland now. I can't really taste it,\" Shuluk told Fox News on Tuesday, explaining that he feels his senses are at close to 70% back. \"I'm obsessed with seafood. I went and got a lobster and cooked it and could barely taste it.\"\n\nShuluk is one of a number of former COVID-19 patients who have experienced a long-term loss of taste and smell, and doctors say it's unclear when, or if, people like Shuluk will ever get their senses back to their pre-COVID normal.\n\nIndeed, around 11% of coronavirus patients who suddenly couldn't properly taste their food, or smell through their nose reported the symptoms lasted longer than a month, according to research published in July in JAMA Otolaryngoloy -- Head & Neck Surgery.\n\nDoctors say that most people who experience the symptoms will get their senses back within a few days, or between two and six weeks. However, there are a handful of patients whose anosmia, as it's called, can last longer.\n\n\"There is a very small chance that this may last longer or may become a chronic issue. If this does occur, it's best to consult with your doctor,\" Dr. Robert Glatter, an emergency physician at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City, told Fox News.\n\nCORONAVIRUS APP FINDS LOSS OF TASTE AND SMELL MAY BE BETTER INDICATORS THAN FEVER, COUGH: STUDY\n\nGlatter said a number of viruses can cause a temporary loss of smell and taste, and will usually improve in a few days at least or within a week, when the virus clears. People may experience an inability to detect, identify and even savor flavors and odors. And for those whose symptoms become more long-term, its unclear how long recovery time can be.\n\n\"We don't know the exact timeline for recovery of taste and smell among long-haulers. We will have to monitor them for longer periods of time to better understand the role chronic inflammation plays in their symptoms and recovery,\" Glatter explained.\n\nSOME CHILDREN SUFFER RARE, CORONAVIRUS-RELATED BRAIN DAMAGE, STUDY SAYS\n\nDoctors may conduct a number of tests on patients experiencing long-lasting symptoms of lost senses of smell and taste. Those might include asking the patient to compare different smells and observing their olfactory anatomy -- i.e, the bodily structures that comprise the nose and nasal cavities -- through an MRI.\n\nIf not being able to savor a rich sauce or fresh catch (like in Shuluk's case) isn't bad enough for foodies, the long-term impact of losing vital senses can take a toll on one's mental health, too. A separate study published in July in the medical journal The Laryngoscope found that loss of smell associated with COVID-19 could be linked to an increased risk of anxiety and a depressed mood. Researches predicted it could be a result of the coronavirus interacting with the central nervous system.\n\nIn the study, participants filled out a questionnaire of how they felt before they developed symptoms for COVID-19. Participants also ranked how bad their symptoms were, including shortness of breath, fever and loss of smell. Researchers found that the loss of smell and taste was the most commonly associated symptom with anxiety and a depressed mood.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe experience has become so widespread during COVID-19, a number of support groups have increasingly been catering to those who have lost their sense of taste or smell, like Abscent.org.",

        "body": "Fox News contributor Dr. Alveda King, niece of Martin Luther King Jr., joins the debate on 'Fox &amp; Friends First.'\n\nA day before the Democratic National Convention kicked off, New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy, the event co-chair, said it was a time for unity and that the party had to \"put the 'us versus them' in the rearview mirror.\" Most of the high-profile speakers during the convention's first night apparently had other ideas, using the opportunity to bash President Trump.\n\nCONVENTION STAGE SET FOR BIDEN NOMINATION AS MICHELLE OBAMA, SANDERS KICK OFF WEEK OF TRUMP-BASHING\n\nHere are five key moments from Monday night's convention speeches:\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders, former Vice President Joe Biden's chief rival in the Democratic presidential primary race, spent the bulk of his address delivering a grim message to viewers, highlighting the ongoing coronavirus pandemic and economic crisis and insisting to his progressive supporters -- who may not be fans of Biden -- that the former vice president was America's last hope for preventing \"authoritarianism\" under Trump.\n\n\"At its most basic, this election is about preserving our democracy,\" Sanders, I-Vt., claimed, stating that under Trump's administration, \"the unthinkable has become normal,\" and that \"authoritarianism has taken root in our country.\"\n\nHe went on to take personal shots at Trump, calling him and his administration \"frauds\" and insisting that the president is \"a threat to our democracy.\"\n\nIt was only after such attacks that Sanders spoke about Biden, assuring voters who may be further to the left than Biden that the former vice president would fight for at least some of their ideals, such as a higher minimum wage and fighting climate change.\n\nSanders then closed by returning to the warnings of doom, claiming that this November \"the future of our planet is at stake.\"\n\nIn a speech that was widely praised for expressing a need for voters to unite behind Joe Biden, former first lady Michelle Obama took several opportunities to criticize Trump, ripping his handling of the coronavirus pandemic, accusing him of leaving the economy \"in shambles\" and millions of people unemployed.\n\nWhile Obama did deliver an uplifting message about the promise of America's future, she also painted a dire picture of America's present, blaming Trump for contributing to the country's ills.\n\nObama claimed that Trump \"is clearly in over his head\" and \"simply cannot be who we need him to be for us.\" She said that instead of leadership, \"what we get instead is chaos, division and a total and utter lack of empathy.\"\n\nTRUMP HITS BACK AT MICHELLE OBAMA AFTER SEARING DNC SPEECH, SAYS HE 'WOULD NOT BE HERE' IF NOT FOR HER HUSBAND\n\nNew York Gov. Andrew Cuomo did not even mention Joe Biden until the final sentences of his convention address. Instead, he used his time to blame Trump for exacerbating America's woes and even intimated that the coronavirus pandemic was merely part of a larger problem caused by the current administration.\n\n\"COVID is the symptom, not the illness,\" Cuomo said. \"A virus attacks when the body is weak and when it cannot defend itself.\" The governor said the country's \"body politic has been weakened\" by divisions, citing various forms of bigotry and the case of George Floyd, the Black man whose death in police custody in Minneapolis sparked nationwide protests and riots. While acknowledging that Trump \"didn't create the initial division,\" Cuomo claimed the president \"made it worse.\"\n\nCuomo, who has been heavily criticized for policies that critics charge resulted in thousands of COVID-19 deaths at nursing homes, accused Trump of being blind to the dangers posed by the pandemic. He even referred to it as the \"European virus\" while claiming that Trump was wrong to focus on China, where health experts say it originated. Cuomo also claimed that Trump \"watched\" New York get hit hard by the virus, despite admitting earlier this year that he provided what the state requested to deal with the pandemic.\n\n\"Cuomo, just like his brother Fredo, has not got a very good memory!\" Trump tweeted in response.\n\nTRUMP FIRES BACK AT CUOMO AFTER CORONAVIRUS CRITICISM IN DNC SPEECH\n\nRepublican former Ohio Gov. John Kasich called on the GOP \"to take off our partisan hats and put our nation first for ourselves and, of course, for our children.\"\n\nHe noted that \"in normal times, something like this would probably never happen, but these are not normal times.\" Kasich, who opposed Trump in the 2016 Republican primary race, acknowledged that there are issues where he and Biden \"absolutely disagree,\" but claimed that the former vice president would not lead the country down the path toward socialism as Trump has warned.\n\nUnlike some of the other speakers, Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar mainly used her time to rally Democrats behind Biden instead of against Trump.\n\nIn a brief address, Klobuchar focused on Americans' \"shared values\" and \"shared dreams,\" stating that \"we need a president for all of America\" and claiming that Biden is best suited for that role. \"We seek common ground to reach higher ground,\" she said.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nKlobuchar ran against Biden in the Democratic primary race, but said she and the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee share ideals.\n\n\"Joe ran for the same reasons I did,\" Klobuchar said. \"To cross the river of our divides, to bring this nation together, to be a president for all of America.\"",

I have seen great results at my practice, treating patients with post-COVID-19 symptoms,\" said Reznikoff, who runs her own practice in Brooklyn. \"I'm glad that acupuncture is being considered in the fight against COVID19 -- anything that helps.\"\n\nWhile the findings are relevant now, they could have implications long after the world recovers from the pandemic, the researchers said.\n\nCytokine storms have \"gained mainstream attention as a complication of severe COVID-19, but this aberrant immune reaction can occur in the setting of any infection and has been long known to physicians as a hallmark of sepsis, an organ-damaging, often-fatal inflammatory response to infection\" a press release for the study explained.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR COMPLETE CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE\n\nAnother study described the response as such: \"The term 'cytokine storm' calls up vivid images of an immune system gone awry and an inflammatory response flaring out of control.\"\n\nIn the new study, researchers found that mice experiencing a cytokine storm had a 40% greater chance of survival when treated with electroacupuncture. As well, acupuncture worked well as a preventative practice: Mice treated with acupuncture before developing a cytokine storm experienced lower levels of inflammation and their survival rate increased from 20 to 80%.",

However, the obituary from his local newspaper went viral this week because the second half takes on the people his family blames for his death.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"Family members believe David's death was needless,\" the obituary states. \"They blame his death and the deaths of all the other innocent people, on Trump, Abbott and all the other politicians who did not take this pandemic seriously and were more concerned with their popularity and votes than lives.\n\n\"Also to blame are the many ignorant, self-centered and selfish people who refused to follow the advice of the medical professionals, believing their 'right' not to wear a mask was more important than killing innocent people,\" the obituary states.\n\nNagy's wife, Stacey Nagy, wrote online that she had written the obituary that appeared in the Jefferson Jimplecute newspaper's July 30 edition.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER\n\n\"A statement issued by the family declared that Dave did everything he was supposed to do, but you did not,\" the obituary continues. \"Shame on all of you, and may Karma find you all!\"\n\nStacey Nagy told fact-checking website Snopes that she was glad so many people had seen the obituary because she wants more people to follow coronavirus safety precautions.\n\n\"It gets me so angry that people aren't taking this seriously,\" she told Snopes. \"The people who are dying are the older people especially - a lot of younger people are dying too - but it's almost like they're saying, 'Who cares about the older people?' I've been with my husband for 20 years and all of a sudden he's gone. People should know how this makes others feel.\"\n\nThe new coronavirus has killed more than 7,000 people in Texas, according to state health officials. More than 5,800 new cases were reported on Sunday and Monday.\n\nThroughout the United States, COVID-19 has sickened more than 4.7 million people and killed 156,000, according to Johns Hopkins University.\n\nHealth officials have warned that people may carry the virus without showing symptoms. In order to avoid spreading COVID-19, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends frequent hand washing, avoiding close contact with others, wearing a face mask that covers your mouth and nose while in public, covering coughs and sneezes and disinfecting frequently touched surfaces.",

Are they susceptible to getting as sick as adults do from the novel coronavirus?\n\n\"How easily children can transmit the virus we still don't know,\" Dr. Roberto Posada, a pediatric infectious disease physician in New York City, told Fox News.\n\n\"For other viruses like flu, kids are transmitters, so there is a potential,\" said Posada, an associate professor in the Divisions of Infectious Diseases and Medical Education in the Jack and Lucy Clark Department of Pediatrics of Mount Sinai Kravis Children's Hospital.\n\nCHILDREN WITH CORONAVIRUS AT LA HOSPITAL DEVELOP RARE INFLAMMATORY CONDITION POSSIBLY LINKED TO COVID-19\n\nGinny Brooks recently lost her husband, Kevin, a former U.S. Marine, to the virus. She told Fox News that when she recently asked her 15-year-old granddaughter if she wanted to go back to school this fall, the teen had a candid response: \"No, I do not want to die.\"\n\nParents say they are concerned about students getting sick from COVID-19 and possibly developing Multi-system Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C), a rare condition health experts say is linked to the virus.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on its website states MIS-C causes multiple organs--including the heart, kidneys, lungs, eyes, skin, and brain, among others--to become inflamed after a child has been infected with COVID-19 or has come into contact with a person who had the virus.\n\n\"It occurs several weeks after the child was exposed to someone who had a coronavirus infection. Typically, the child didn't have symptoms of COVID-19 but does show antibodies when tested,\" Posada said, reiterating that--albeit rare--the condition is \"very scary.\" He noted, however, that most children who develop MIS-C recover.\n\nThe pediatric infectious disease physician said parents should be aware of the signs of MIS-C.\n\n\"It usually will present with high fever lasting several days, plus one or more the following: rash, red eyes, cracked or swollen lips, abdominal pain, vomiting or diarrhea,\" Posada explained.\n\nHOMEMADE CORONAVIRUS FACE MASKS SHOULD BE TWO OR THREE LAYERS TO STOP SPREAD OF VIRUS, STUDY FINDS\n\nBut parents who spoke to Fox News said that even if their child doesn't get sick, they worry they will bring the virus home.\n\nThough there are recent studies investigating children's susceptibility to the virus and their ability to carry it, there is not a clear answer at this time, Posada said. Until a proven vaccine is found, the infectious disease doctor says precautions need to be followed.\n\n\"A major concern with kids going to school is that even if they don't get sick [themselves] if they do get the virus, they can still pass it to parents and grandparents [who] may be at high risk\".\n\nTo lessen exposure risk, Posada advised parents to:\n\nMeanwhile, school districts across the nation are scurrying to implement safety guidelines for children to return to school. School districts such as Nassau County School District in Florida posted new safety procedures online that include so-called \"cohorting,\" where the same small group of students will consistently be together. Other rules included wearing masks, social distancing, and cleaning and disinfecting policies for school buses, classrooms, and cafeterias. Several school districts on Long Island, N.Y., are currently voting on whether children should go to school in shifts - a hybrid type of education - where students attend some days at home and some days at the school to avoid crowded classrooms.\n\n\"A tough decision - I feel for parents,\" Posada said. \"There is a potential risk.\"\n\nOn Friday, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced schools across the state are \"authorized to open\" for the 2020 school year amid the pandemic.\n\n\"Every region is well below our COVID infection limit, therefore all school districts are authorized to open,\" Cuomo tweeted Friday. \"If the infection rate spikes, the guidance will change accordingly. School districts are required to submit plans to NYS for review.\"\n\nSchool districts across the state have been submitting plans for reopening to the Cuomo administration for weeks. Those plans will be approved by the New York Board of Health, which has the power to reject the plans, he warned.\n\nThere are 749 districts in New York State, some 127 of which have not yet submitted plans for reopening, and 50 are not yet complete, Cuomo said.\n\nDespite the governor's go-ahead, some parents remain conflicted on their stance about returning to the classroom.\n\n\"I'm less worried about COVID in schools than I am my kids being affected by this mentally, emotionally, and academically for years,\" Tara Minson, who has school-aged children, told Fox News.\n\n\"I see more parents panicked about kids back in school but yet they are having play dates with other kids?\" Minson added.\n\nMeanwhile, other parents said they hope school officials keep to the virtual learning model until a vaccine is found.\n\n\"It won't be fun if they can't truly be together. The distancing is tough on the little ones and it's too hard to deal with the requirements consistently,\" one parent told Fox News.\n\nYOUNG CHILDREN WITH CORONAVIRUS MAY CARRY 10 TO 100 TIMES MORE OF VIRUS THAN ADULTS: STUDY\n\n\"I can't give a recommendation that is applicable for the entire country about children going back to school,\" said Posada, adding that it \"really depends on how the epidemic is playing out at the location in the area and what the local health department determines is appropriate at that region.\"\n\nAs the nation grapples with back-to-school policies, the infectious disease doctor said parents should make sure they are aware of their child's school's plans and, if concerned, to speak to their family physician about the policies as well as the school district.",

        "body": "Waiting for a coronavirus test result can vary from less than an hour to up to a week, depending on the type of COVID-19 test you take. Many people choose the rapid test to get results immediately, but how accurate are these quick turnaround tests?\n\n\"Tests that are rapid, usually providing results within 30 minutes, are not as sensitive as the traditional test that is sent into the laboratory and generally takes half a day to several days to get a result on,\" Dr. Romney Humphries, Ph.D., Director of Clinical Microbiology Laboratory at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, told Fox News.\n\nYOUNG CHILDREN WITH CORONAVIRUS MAY CARRY 10 TO 100 TIMES MORE OF VIRUS THAN ADULTS: STUDY\n\n\"There is a 75-80% detection rate for rapid testing compared to 90-95% with traditional, lab-based tests.\" Humphries, also a member of the Infectious Diseases Society of America, added.\n\nHumphries added that the rapid test's ability to correctly identify those with the disease -- test sensitivity -- may not always be clinically relevant.\n\n\"Some studies have shown that rapid tests miss low levels of virus. A patient may have low levels of the virus if they are early in the course of infection before the virus has had a chance to replicate itself, or at the end of infection when the infection is dying out.\"\n\nHumphries, also a professor of Pathology, Microbiology, and Immunology at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, noted that this could be a potential problem with spreading the virus.\n\n\"In the former case, missing a positive is problematic, because that is a patient that can then go on an infect others, thinking they are negative. In the latter case, the low-levels of virus may in fact be dead virus, and that patient may not be infectious.\"\n\nAlthough the wait time for the results of the two tests differ, the technique appears similar in terms of swabbing the nasal passageway.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the antigen test -- commonly known as the \"rapid diagnostic test\" where results are given within minutes to an hour -- detects specific proteins on the virus's surface. It is usually highly accurate, though more likely to miss an active infection compared to the molecular test, the FDA stated on its website\n\nMeanwhile, the molecular test, also known as the RT-PCR test, nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT), or diagnostic test, detects the virus's genetic material and typically can take a day up to a week, depending on the demand on the lab. According to the FDA, this test is highly accurate and usually does not need to be repeated. The FDA advises if you do have symptoms but your rapid antigen test is negative, your health care provider may want to order a molecular test to see if you do indeed have an active infection.\n\nAs for which test Humphries prefers, \"I think the laboratory-based test with longer results is the preferable approach, when possible. That being said, there are times when this is not possible, and the rapid tests in the right context work well,\" she said.\n\n\"The rapid tests play an important role and can be very valuable in some cases. For instance, a patient who needs trauma surgery can't wait a day or two for test results because the physicians need to know the results before performing a life-saving, emergency procedure. Many hospitals are using rapid tests for this purpose.\"\n\n\"Another example is screening people before an event -- or possibly using it before going to school -- theoretically a rapid test would be valuable in those contexts, although this application of rapid tests is not common,\" Humphries added.\n\nBLOOD TEST IDENTIFIES WHICH CORONAVIRUS PATIENTS MAY BE HELPED OR HARMED BY STEROID TREATMENT\n\nThe microbiologist cautioned that no test is perfect and each has its limitations.\n\n\"One factor that affects every COVID test is getting a really good sample. To collect a proper nasal pharyngeal sample the tester needs to get back enough in the nose to cause a gag reflex because that is where the coronavirus is. They need to go in deep. Basically, the chances for a more accurate test result increase with a better sample,\" she noted.",

That's not the flu, that's the body working already on the vaccine,\" he said.\n\nThere's no evidence that someone who unknowingly has the virus when they get the flu shot will end up with a worse COVID-19 case, experts said.\n\nOtherwise-healthy patients suffering from mild colds often still get the shot, Kesh noted.\n\n\"We don't see it being a problem. We don't see people even getting a worse cold,\" Kesh said, though she added doctors might not administer the shot when a patient's immune system is too weak for it to \"take\" and be effective.\n\nSome believe the flu shot and other vaccinations may even potentially help ward off the coronavirus.\n\n\"If anything, there's a theory out that other vaccines might actually provide a stimulus of your immune system and it might be better off to fight off the virus,\" Schaffner said.\n\nSchaffner noted the theory has not been proven, but \"there are flu vaccine trials to try to provide nonspecific immune enhancement as protection against the virus.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nEveryone above the age of 6 months should get the flu vaccine, including people who are older than 65, are pregnant or have underlying illnesses, doctors said.\n\nExperts noted that the shots will be important in helping prevent health care systems from being overwhelmed with flu patients while also potentially battling a second wave of the virus.\n\n\"We all should get [the flu shot] because this year we will be dealing with flu and COVID and the two illnesses present clinically in a similar fashion and doctors will be stressed to find out which is which,\" Schaffner added.",

        "body": "The common cold is a type of coronavirus, health experts say, so can it prevent you from getting COVID-19 or a severe case of novel coronavirus?\n\nA new study published in Science explored this question. Although the researchers cautioned it is too premature to tell, they did find that certain cells in the human body -- \"memory T cells\" -- that recognize common cold coronaviruses can also recognize COVID-19 in some people.\n\nN95 MASKS USED AGAINST CORONAVIRUS CAN BE DECONTAMINATED WITH RICE COOKER: STUDY\n\n\"This could help explain why some people show milder symptoms of coronavirus while others get severely sick,\" said co-author of the study Daniela Weiskopf, Ph.D. in a University news release.\n\nThe researchers at La Jolla Institute for Immunology (LJI) investigated memory T cells, which are part of our immune system. The researchers explained in a press release that these cells remember viruses the body has encountered throughout a person's life. When the body gets exposed to that virus again, the memory T cells are able to identify that foreign invader and activate the immune system to fight off it off.\n\n\"Immune reactivity may translate to different degrees of protection,\" Alessandro Sette, co-author of the study and LJI professor, said in the release. \"Having a strong T cell response, or a better T cell response may give you the opportunity to mount a much quicker and stronger response.\"\n\nThe researchers in the new study collected samples from participants who had never been exposed to SARS-CoV-2 to see if they had a cross-over immunity reaction from previous common cold coronavirus exposure. Their findings showed that participants not exposed to COVID-19 can produce memory T cells that are equally reactive against SARS-CoV-2 and four other common cold coronaviruses.\n\n\"We have now proven that, in some people, pre-existing T cell memory against common cold coronaviruses can cross-recognize SARS-CoV-2, down to exact molecular structures,\" Weiskopf, an LJI research assistant professor, stated in the release.\n\n\"We knew there was pre-existing reactivity, and this study provides very strong direct molecular evidence that memory T cells can 'see' sequences that are very similar between common cold coronaviruses and SARS-CoV-2,\" Sette added.\n\nThe new study expanded on a previous report from LJI Professor Shane Crotty, Ph.D., and the Sette Lab which found 40 to 60% of people never exposed to COVID-19 had T cells that reacted to the SARS-CoV-2 virus, the news release stated. Similar study findings were revealed globally, including a study out of Singapore.\n\nThe researchers found that while some cross-reactive T cells targeted the SARS-CoV-2's spike protein, which is how the virus reportedly binds to a human's cells, the pre-existing memory T cells also target other SARS-CoV-2 proteins, according to the release. Co-study author Sette said this is significant because most vaccine candidates target mainly the spike protein, and taking advantage of this cross-reactivity to other proteins could potentially enhance vaccine potency.\n\nYOUNG CHILDREN WITH CORONAVIRUS MAY CARRY 10 TO 100 TIMES MORE OF VIRUS THAN ADULTS: STUDY\n\nSette said the study findings are speculative and much more data is needed.\n\n\"The jury is still out (some would say the trial hasn't even started) on this matter,\" Dr. Aaron E. Glatt, an epidemiologist, and a fellow of the Infectious Diseases Society of America told Fox News in an email.\n\n\"Very preliminary albeit very interesting studies suggest there may be some benefit, and some papers have even suggested that prior influenza vaccination might provide some protection, but I would certainly not rely on any prior infection to assume any significant immunity to COVID-19 at this time,\" cautioned Glatt, who is also a professor of medicine at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. \"Everyone still needs to mask and social distance appropriately.\"",

        "body": "A new report published by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has suggested the novel coronavirus can be spread on airplanes by asymptomatic carriers.\n\nIn the study, featured in the peer-reviewed journal Emerging Infections Diseases, researchers examined evidence of in-flight transmission of COVID-19 by asymptomatic patients, as prior data was inconclusive. In-flight transmission by those symptomatic for COVID-19, meanwhile, has been well established.\n\nAMERICAN AIRLINES PASSENGER THROWS EXPLETIVE-LADEN FIT AFTER REQUESTING TO LEAVE PLANE: REPORT\n\nThe studied evacuation flight flew from Milan, Italy, to South Korea in late March on an 11-hour trip; 310 passengers were initially scheduled to board, but 11 were denied entry after showing symptoms for COVID-19. Both on the ground and in the high skies, the flight crew followed strict infection control procedures by the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC).\n\nIn the high skies, all passengers wore N95 respirator masks, except while eating and using the restroom. After arriving in South Korea, the 299 passengers were quarantined for 2 weeks at a government quarantine facility, in complete isolation from one another, where they were frequently examined for symptoms of COVID-19.\n\nOn April 2, the first day of the quarantine, six passengers tested positive for COVID-19 and were hospitalized. Two weeks later, the six passengers showed no symptoms of the viral disease and were said to be asymptomatic.\n\nOn April 15, the 14th day of the quarantine, however, a woman who initially tested negative after deplaning tested positive for the coronavirus. The traveler wore the N95 mask throughout the flight, except while using the restroom, which was shared by nearby passengers - including someone who was asymptomatic. The woman who tested positive for COVID-19 on April 15 was seated three rows behind the asymptomatic passenger.\n\nLUFTHANSA REQUIRING NEGATIVE CORONAVIRUS TEST TO FLY WITHOUT A MASK\n\nTo that end, the researchers suspect that the woman's infection was likely transmitted by in-flight contact.\n\nTen crew members and eight medical staffers from the KCDC were also quarantined at the facility for two weeks and tested for COVID-19 on days 1 and 14 of quarantine; all of the 18 people tested negative for the coronavirus both times.\n\nIn further investigation, the researchers reviewed data from another evacuation flight, which traveled from Milan to South Korea on April 3 under the same strict infection control procedures as guided by the KCDC.\n\nDuring that trip, three passengers were asymptomatic for COVID-19 and one passenger who tested negative on Day 1 of quarantine similarly tested positive on Day 14 of quarantine.\n\n\"On the basis of an epidemiologic investigation, the authors and KCDC suspect that this infection was also transmitted by inflight contact,\" the authors said.\n\nThe authors concluded that it remains unclear exactly how the virus was transmitted on the airplanes, suggesting that contaminated surfaces or infected persons may have a \"critical role\" in the in-flight transmission of infectious disease and that further research was needed.\n\n\"Our findings suggest the following strategies for the prevention of SARS-CoV-2 transmission on an aircraft,\" they wrote. \"First, masks should be worn during the flight. Second, because contact with contaminated surfaces increases the risk for transmission of SARS-CoV-2 among passengers, hand hygiene is necessary to prevent infections,\" they wrote.\n\n\"Third, physical distance should be maintained before boarding and after disembarking from the aircraft.\"\n\nIn close, the authors urged that \"stringent global regulations for the prevention of COVID-19 transmission on aircraft\" could help prevent such public health emergencies in the future.",

The answer is only 50% of the time,\" Dr. Roberta DeBiasi, chief of Pediatric Infectious Diseases at Children's National Hospital in Washington D.C, said of thermal scanners, according to the newspaper. \"You still have to put in all those other measures to try to prevent spread (because) children will be missed from screening methods.\"\n\nCORONAVIRUS IN THE US: STATE-BY-STATE BREAKDOWN\n\nThe researchers found although children are less likely to get severely ill with the virus, they can easily spread it to vulnerable adults in their lives, especially if they're in school.\n\nDeBiasi added that, based on other respiratory illnesses, children are known spreaders.\n\nThe researchers also studied a rare infection that can result in heart problems from the child's immune response to the virus.\n\n\"This is a severe complication as a result of the immune response to COVID-19 infection, and the number of these patients is growing,\" Fasano, who is also a professor of Pediatrics at Harvard Medical School, said. \"And, as in adults with these very serious systemic complications, the heart seems to be the favorite organ targeted by post-COVID-19 immune response.\"\n\nShe said the immune response complication should factor into vaccine production strategy.\n\nThe researchers recommend wearing masks, social distancing, hand washing, a combination of in-person and remote learning and frequent testing if returning to school in the fall.\n\n\"This study provides much-needed facts for policymakers to make the best decisions possible for schools, daycare centers and other institutions that serve children,\" Fasano said. \"Kids are a possible source of spreading this virus, and this should be taken into account in the planning stages for reopening schools.\"\n\nCLICK HERE FOR COMPLETE CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE\n\nThe study titled \"Pediatric SARS-CoV-2: Clinical Presentation, Infectivity, and Immune Responses,\" was originally published in the Journal of Pediatrics Thursday.",

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.\n\nPresumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden has continually stressed the importance of testing when it comes to fighting the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nThe former vice president laid out a plan for free testing nationwide, expanding testing sites, having federal safety regulators enforce testing at work, and assembling at least 100,000 contact tracers to find people exposed to the virus.\n\nBut it appears Biden himself has yet to be tested for the virus.\n\nAs of late July, Biden said that he so far has not been tested - defending himself by saying he is holding mostly virtual campaign events and members of his staff and the Secret Service are regularly tested.\n\nBIDEN SAYS HE'S NOT 'HIDIN' - DEFENDS VIRTUAL CAMPAIGN STRATEGY\n\nIn May, Biden admitted that his health advisers said \"they think that I should move [in] the direction [of] the White House, that anyone coming in should be tested. And I should be tested. I haven't been tested. So that's, that's in play. We'll see how that goes.\"\n\nThe presumptive Democratic nominee's campaign did not respond to Fox News' inquiry asking if he has since been tested.\n\nWhile Biden generally has stayed away from large public events and rallies - a move that has been mocked by President Trump and his allies - and worn a mask when he does meet with voters, the 77-year-old candidate is in an age group that makes him more vulnerable to major complications from the disease.\n\nBiden also appeared on Capitol Hill last month to pay his respects to the late Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga. While he wore a mask during his time in Washington, he was still surrounded by dozens of lawmakers.\n\nThe former vice president has not recently given an explanation for why he has not been tested, but speaking with CNN in March, Biden said he hadn't received a test because he didn't have any symptoms.\n\n\"I have not been tested for the coronavirus. I have had, thank God, no symptoms that I'm aware of,\" Biden said.\n\nHe added: \"The good news is that, thank God, at least what I've been told by the doctor, I have no underlying conditions that would complicate my circumstance.\"\n\nTHE LATEST FROM FOX NEWS ON THE 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN\n\nPresident Trump, on the other hand, has been vocal about how many times he's been tested - although he made clear last month that it is not as much as press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said.\n\n\"He's tested more than anyone, multiple times a day,\" McEneny said during a press conference. \"And we believe that he's acting appropriately.\"\n\nLater that day, Trump contradicted her - saying he doesn't believe he gets tested multiple times a day.\n\n\"I don't know about more than one,\" Trump said. \"I do probably on average a test every two days, three days, and I don't know of any time I've taken two in one day, but I could see that happening.\"",

As the government pushes to have the civil service sector return to their desks in an effort to revamp the economy, Hancock said it was essential that private companies have greater access to testing.\n\n\"We must do everything in our power to protect against a second wave here in the U.K.,\" Hancock said. \"The ability to provide tests to parts of the private sector who need to know that people don't have the virus in order to be able to reopen parts of the economy, or just enable things to happen.\"\n\nHancock said accident and emergency treatment capacity is being expanded in time for winter, with \"billions more funding to the NHS\" in order to prevent a second peak, and a new ad campaign would remind the public to get tested if they experience symptoms and to adhere to proper social distancing and personal hygiene as a \"first line of defense\" against the disease.\n\nSEVERE CORONAVIRUS DISEASE, DEATH 'RARE' AMONG KIDS, UK STUDY FINDS\n\nThe University of Oxford vaccine continues to be the world leader, according to the health secretary, and the government also has contracts with six other vaccine providers to make it available to the general public as soon as possible, Sky News reported.\n\nThe UK political agenda for the next few months includes reviving an economy that shrank by a fifth during lockdown and girding for a possible second wave of virus infections. The government must also prepare for a final break with the European Union when a post-Brexit transition period ends on Dec. 31.\n\nJohnson also faces the prospect of a huge increase in unemployment after Oct. 31, when the government ends a program to pay the salaries of millions of furloughed workers. On Tuesday, Johnson named a new head for the civil service -- Simon Case, a former private secretary to Prince William. His predecessor had reportedly clashed with Johnson's top aide, Dominic Cummings.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThough his Conservatives have a hefty majority of 80 in the 650-seat House of Commons, Johnson's government has been weakened by its unsteady handling of the pandemic. Britain's official virus-related death toll stands at more than 41,500, the highest in Europe, and the government has performed U-turns on issues including wearing masks in public and quarantining people arriving from abroad. Both ideas were initially resisted, then implemented.",

        "body": "The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) now says asymptomatic people no longer need to get tested for the novel coronavirus, a quiet change the federal agency recently made to its online guidelines regarding COVID-19.\n\n\"You do not necessarily need a test unless you are a vulnerable individual or your health care provider or state or local public health officials recommend you take one,\" the CDC now recommends.\n\nMAINE HOSPITAL SEES CORONAVIRUS RESURGENCE AFTER VISITORS LEARN OF POSITIVE TEST RESULTS WHILE ON TRIP\n\nThe revised guidelines, posted on Monday, say individuals who have been in close contact with an infected person, typically meaning within six feet and for at least 15 minutes, \"do not necessarily need a test\" if they do not have symptoms. However, the CDC did state that there are exceptions, including \"vulnerable\" individuals or healthcare professionals where state or local public health officials may advise testing for the virus.\n\nFurther down the page, the CDC warns that \"it is important to realize that you can be infected and spread the virus but feel well and have no symptoms.\"\n\nThis is a change from the agency's previous guidelines that recommended testing for all those who came in close contact with an infected patient for more than 15 minutes, even though they were asymptomatic.\n\nThe CDC has emphasized pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic transmission as a major factor in the transmission of the novel coronavirus, noting last month that its \"best estimate\" is 40 percent of those infected by the novel coronavirus don't show symptoms.\n\nWhen contacted for comment on the changes, the CDC directed Fox News to the United States Department of Health & Human Services (HHS).\n\n\"This Guidance has been updated to reflect current evidence and best public health practices, and to further emphasize using CDC-approved prevention strategies to protect yourself, your family, and the most vulnerable of all ages,\" Adm. Brett P. Giroir, M.D., the assistant secretary for health (ASH) with the HHS, told Fox News in a statement.\n\n\"The updated Guidance places an emphasis on testing individuals with symptomatic illness, those with a significant exposure or for vulnerable populations, including residents and staff in nursing homes or long term care facilities, critical infrastructure workers, healthcare workers and first responders, and those individuals (who may be asymptomatic) when prioritized by public health officials. Working with our health care professionals, we can continue to implement this Guidance and adapt it to the local situation as appropriate.\"\n\n\"And finally, through continuously evaluating the data we know we have strong, proven preventive measures for reducing the spread of COVID-19: wearing a face mask, watching your distance, washing your hands and avoid large gatherings and crowded indoor spaces,\" he concluded.\n\nStill, many healthcare professionals who spoke to Fox News voiced concerns that the new CDC recommendations contradict what is currently known about the virus.\n\n\"The updated recommendations by the CDC stating that asymptomatic people may not need to be tested even if they have been in close contact with someone known to have the virus are very troubling as this is the exact patient population that should be tested,\" Dr. Ravina Kullar, an infectious disease expert in California, told Fox News in response to the change. \"An individual has a high probability of getting the virus from close contact with someone that has had the virus; why would he/she not be recommended to get tested?\"\n\nDr. Fred Davis, associate chair of emergency medicine at Northwell /Long Island Jewish, in New York, told Fox News: \"While the CDC has recommended that those that might have been exposed to someone who tested [positive] for COVID but they themselves are asymptomatic might not need to be tested, there are delicate concerns.\n\n\"We know that someone can be infected and transmitting the virus and it can take 3-5 days after initial infection before they develop symptoms. It is suspected that upwards of 50 percent of transmissions occur during this time,\" Davis continued.\n\n\"Testing those [who] have possibly been exposed to someone with COVID is an important part of contact tracing to help identify and reduce spread. When we have the resources to test, we should be testing those with known exposure to help identify and recommend proper quarantine,\" the emergency department physician added.\n\n\"I am not sure if these recommendations were based on the labs being overwhelmed or a desire to make the case numbers look better; regardless, I am stunned by these recommendations.\"\n\n-- Dr. Ravina Kullar\n\nDr. Aaron Glatt, a member of the Infectious Disease Society of America, also weighed in.\n\n\"What this practically means to me as a clinician and epidemiologist is that we still must try and test individuals exposed to COVID-19, but recognize that a negative test is worthless to rule out infection. A 14-day quarantine is still required for all exposed individuals,\" Glatt said.\n\n\"A positive test result remains very helpful to reinforce the absolute seriousness of their exposure, and testing should be obtained wherever possible to promote optimal quarantine compliance,\" added Glatt, who is an infectious disease expert from Mount Sinai Hospital in New York.\n\n\"Suboptimal testing capabilities for COVID-19 have been the single most important issue we have faced in dealing with COVID-19. Delays in obtaining results, the accuracy of the results, and the inadequate resources to do mass testing have significantly impacted our ability to prevent COVID-19 spread. This issue is not addressed by the updated guidelines,\" Glatt continued.\n\nCORONAVIRUS OUTBREAK ON MAINE BLUEBERRY FARMS SPARKS CONCERN FOR AGRICULTURAL COMMUNITY DURING HARVEST SEASON\n\nMeanwhile, Kullar cautioned that \"it is important to get tested if you've been exposed to someone, even if asymptomatic, for contact tracing.\"\n\n\"I am not sure if these recommendations were based on the labs being overwhelmed or a desire to make the case numbers look better; regardless, I am stunned by these recommendations,\" she added.\n\nThe news comes after a World Health Organization (WHO) official in June walked back her statement that spread from asymptomatic patients appeared to be \"very rare.\" The comments were renounced following criticism from the scientific community, including Dr. Anthony Fauci, the country's top infectious disease expert, who called the remarks \"not correct.\"",

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.\n\nThe director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Thursday clarified a stance on testing for asymptomatic people exposed to coronavirus following a wave of criticism over an abrupt shift in its guidance.\n\nIn a Thursday statement, CDC Director Robert Redfield said that anyone who \"needs\" a test can still get one, although not everyone who wants one should get one.\n\nCORONAVIRUS TESTING MAY NOT BE NEEDED IN SOME CASES AFTER EXPOSURE: CDC\n\n\"Testing is meant to drive actions and achieve specific public health objectives,\" Redfield said. \"Everyone who needs a COVID-19 test, can get a test.\"\n\nHowever, \"everyone who wants a test does not necessarily need a test; the key is to engage the needed public health community in the decision with the appropriate follow-up action,\" he added.\n\nThe statement came after numerous health officials and politicians raised concerns over the agency's newest testing guidelines that people without symptoms may not need to be tested even after exposure to the virus.\n\nAs of Aug. 24, the CDC's website read: \"You do not necessarily need a test unless you are a vulnerable individual or your health care provider or state or local public health officials recommend you take one.\"\n\nThe guidance was seen as an abrupt reversal from the CDC's previous advisory saying that people who have been within 6 feet of an infected person for more than 15 minutes should be tested, even if they were asymptomatic.\n\nThe agency said the updated guidelines were coordinated in conjunction with the White House Coronavirus Task Force and \"received appropriate attention, consultation and input from task force experts.\"\n\nASYMPTOMATIC CORONAVIRUS CARRIERS CAN SPREAD DISEASE ON FLIGHTS, CDC STUDY SUGGESTS\n\nMoving forward, the agency said it is \"placing an emphasis on testing individuals with symptomatic illness, individuals with a significant exposure, vulnerable populations.\"\n\nThis includes nursing homes or long-term care facilities, critical infrastructure workers, health care workers and first responders. This also applies to individuals who may be asymptomatic \"when prioritized by medical and public health officials,\" the agency said.\n\nAnyone who has been in close contact with someone who has COVID-19 should monitor their symptoms, take special precautions to protect the vulnerable, wear a mask, stay at least 6 feet apart from others, wash their hands, and talk to their health care provider to see if a test is needed, the agency said.",

In some cases, patients may become permanently disabled, the agency said.\n\nThe polio-like illness tends to spike every two years, according to the CDC, which has tracked the data since 2014. That means cases may spike amid the coronavirus pandemic, which has already infected more than 4.7 million Americans.\n\nPOLIO-LIKE ILLNESS THAT PARALYZES CHILDREN MAY BE CAUSED BY VIRAL INFECTION: STUDY\n\n\"Clinicians need to remain vigilant for AFM and promptly evaluate patients even as frontline health care workers, family, physicians and other medical professionals continue to work under the constraints of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic,\" CDC Director Dr. Robert Redfield said. \"While phone and telemedicine can be used for initial evaluations, AFM is a medical emergency that requires immediate medical care and monitoring, as this condition can progress rapidly to respiratory failure.\"\n\nClinicians should look out for AFM in patients experiencing sudden limb weakness, especially during the months of August through November.

        "authors": [],
        "body": "JOHANNESBURG (AP) -- Winter is ending in the Southern Hemisphere and country after country -- South Africa, Australia, Argentina -- had a surprise: Their steps against COVID-19 also apparently blocked the flu.\n\nBut there's no guarantee the Northern Hemisphere will avoid twin epidemics as its own flu season looms while the coronavirus still rages.\n\n\"This could be one of the worst seasons we've had from a public health perspective with COVID and flu coming together. But it also could be one of the best flu seasons we've had,\" Dr. Robert Redfield, director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, told The Associated Press.\n\nTHESE COUNTRIES HAVE NEVER REPORTED A CORONAVIRUS CASE\n\nU.S. health officials are pushing Americans to get vaccinated against the flu in record numbers this fall, so hospitals aren't overwhelmed with a dueling \"twindemic.\"\n\nIt's also becoming clear that wearing masks, avoiding crowds and keeping your distance are protections that are \"not specific for COVID. They're going to work for any respiratory virus,\" Redfield said.\n\nThe evidence: Ordinarily, South Africa sees widespread influenza during the Southern Hemisphere's winter months of May through August. This year, testing tracked by the country's National Institute of Communicable Diseases is finding almost none -- something unprecedented.\n\nSchool closures, limited public gatherings and calls to wear masks and wash hands have \"knocked down the flu,\" said Dr. Cheryl Cohen, head of the institute's respiratory program.\n\nThat not only meant lives saved from flu's annual toll, but it \"freed up our hospitals' capacity to treat COVID-19 patients,\" Cohen added.\n\nIn Australia, the national health department reported just 36 laboratory-confirmed flu-associated deaths from January to mid-August, compared to more than 480 during the same period last year.\n\n\"The most likely and the biggest contributor is social distancing,\" said Dr. Robert Booy, an infectious diseases expert at the University of Sydney.\n\nThe coronavirus is blamed for about 24 million infections and more than 810,000 deaths globally in just the first eight months of this year. A normal flu year could have the world's hospitals dealing with several million more severe illnesses on top of the COVID-19 crush.\n\nBack in February and March, as the worldwide spread of the new virus was just being recognized, many countries throughout the Southern Hemisphere girded for a double whammy. Even as they locked down to fight the coronavirus, they made a huge push for more last-minute flu vaccinations.\n\n\"We gave many more flu vaccinations, like four times more,\" said Jaco Havenga, a pharmacist who works at Mays Chemist, a pharmacy in a Johannesburg suburb.\n\nSome countries' lockdowns were more effective than others at stemming spread of the coronavirus. So why would flu have dropped even if COVID-19 still was on the rise?\n\n\"Clearly the vigilance required to be successful against COVID is really high,\" said CDC's Redfield. \"This virus is one of the most infectious viruses that we've seen.\"\n\nThat's in part because 40% of people with COVID-19 show no symptoms yet can spread infection, he said.\n\nFlu hasn't disappeared, cautions a World Health Organization report earlier this month. While \"globally, influenza activity was reported at lower levels than expected for this time of year,\" it found sporadic cases are being reported.\n\nPlus, some people who had the flu in Southern countries might just have hunkered down at home and not seen a doctor as the coronavirus was widespread, WHO added.\n\nBut international influenza experts say keeping schools closed -- children typically drive flu's spread -- and strict mask and distancing rules clearly helped.\n\n\"We don't have definitive proof, but the logical explanation is what they're doing to try to control the spread of (the coronavirus) is actually doing a really, really good job against the flu as well,\" said Richard Webby of St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, who is part of a WHO committee that tracks flu evolution.\n\nIn contrast, the U.S. and Europe didn't impose coronavirus rules nearly as restrictive as some of their Southern neighbors -- and in many cases are reopening schools and relaxing distancing rules even as COVID-19 still is spreading and the cooler months that favor influenza's spread are fast approaching.\n\nSo the U.S. CDC is urging record flu vaccinations, preferably by October. Redfield's goal is for at least 65% of adults to be vaccinated; usually only about half are.\n\nThe U.S. expects more than 190 million doses of flu vaccine, about 20 million more than last year. States are being encouraged to try drive-thru flu shots and other creative ideas to get people vaccinated while avoiding crowds.\n\nIn an unusual move, Massachusetts has mandated flu vaccination for all students -- from elementary to college -- this year. Typically only some health care workers face employment mandates for flu vaccine.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, Prime Minister Boris Johnson likewise is urging widespread flu vaccination.\n\nTo be clear, the flu vaccine only protects against influenza -- it won't lessen the chances of getting the coronavirus. Vaccines against COVID-19 still are experimental and several candidates are entering final testing to see if they really work.\n\nBut for coronavirus protection, Redfield continues to stress vigilance about wearing masks, keeping your distance, avoiding crowds and washing your hands.\n\n\"Once one stops those mitigation steps, it only takes a couple weeks for these viral pathogens to get back on the path that they were on,\" he said.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nWhile the U.S. has been mask-resistant, most states now have some type of mask requirement, either through statewide orders issued by governors or from city and county rules.\n\nMeanwhile, countries where flu season is ending are watching to see if the Northern Hemisphere heeds their lessons learned.\n\n\"It could be very scary -- we honestly don't know. But if you're going to get the two infections at the same time, you could be in big trouble,\" said Booy, the Sydney infectious diseases expert.",

        "body": "As COVID-19 infections remain high and the death toll rises by more than 1,000 a day, new coronavirus testing in the country is dropping.\n\nAn analysis by the Associated Press found that the number of tests per day slid 3.6% over the past two weeks to 750,000, with the count falling in 22 states. That includes places like Alabama, Mississippi, Missouri and Iowa, where the percentage of positive tests is high and continuing to climb, an indicator that the virus is still spreading uncontrolled.\n\nWidespread testing is considered essential to containing the outbreak as the U.S. approaches a mammoth 5 million confirmed infections and more than 157,000 deaths out of over 700,000 worldwide.\n\nThe number of confirmed infections in the U.S. has topped 4.7 million, with new cases running at nearly 60,000 a day on average, down from more than 70,000 in the second half of July.\n\nTesting demand is expected to surge again this fall, when schools reopen and flu season hits, most likely outstripping supplies and leading to new delays and bottlenecks.\n\nSome of the decline in testing over the past few weeks was expected after backlogged commercial labs urged doctors to concentrate on their highest-risk patients. But some health and government officials are seeing growing public frustration and waning demand.\n\nU.S. testing is built primarily on highly sensitive molecular tests that detect the genetic code of the coronavirus. Although the test is considered the gold standard for accuracy, experts increasingly say the country's overburdened lab system is incapable of keeping pace with the outbreak and producing results within two or three days, the time frame crucial to isolating patients and containing the virus.\n\n\"They're doing as good a job as they possibly can do, but the current system will not allow them to keep up with the demand,\" said Mara Aspinall of Arizona State University's College of Health Solutions.\n\nCORONAVIRUS: WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW\n\nTesting delays have led researchers at Harvard and elsewhere to propose a new approach using so-called antigen tests - rapid technology already used to screen for flu, strep throat and other common infections. Instead of detecting the virus itself, such tests look for viral proteins, or antigens, which are generally considered a less accurate measure of infection.\n\nA number of companies are studying COVID-19 antigen tests in which you spit on a specially coated strip of paper, and if you are infected, it changes color. Experts say the speed and widespread availability of such tests would more than make up for their lower precision.\n\nWhile no such tests for the coronavirus are on the U.S. market, experts say the technology is simple and the hurdles are more regulatory than technical. The Harvard researchers say production could quickly be scaled into the millions.\n\nA proposal from Harvard researchers calls for the federal government to distribute $1 saliva-based antigen tests to all Americans so that they can test themselves regularly, perhaps even daily.\n\nEven with accuracy as low as 50%, researchers estimate the paper strip tests would uncover five times more COVID-19 cases than the current laboratory-based approach, which federal officials estimate catches just 1 in 10 infections.\n\nBut the approach faces resistance in Washington, where federal regulators have required at least 80% accuracy for new COVID-19 tests.\n\nTo date, the Food and Drug Administration has allowed only two COVID-19 antigen tests to enter the market. Those tests require a nasal swab supervised by a health professional and can only be run on specialized machines found at hospitals, doctors' offices and clinics.\n\nAlso, because of the risk of false negatives, doctors may need to confirm a negative result with a genetic test when patients have possible symptoms of COVID-19.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR FULL CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE\n\nOn Tuesday, the governors of Maryland, Virginia, Louisiana and three other states announced an agreement with the Rockefeller Foundation to purchase more than 3 million of the FDA-cleared antigen tests, underscoring the growing interest in the technology.\n\nWhen asked about introducing cheaper, paper-based tests, the government's \"testing czar,\" Adm. Brett Giroir, warned that their accuracy could fall as low as 20% to 30%.\n\n\"I don't think that would do a service to the American public of having something that is wrong seven out of 10 times,\" Giroir said last week. \"I think that could be catastrophic.\"",

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.\n\nResearchers at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) are testing a two-drug combo with hopes that it becomes the \"golden ticket\" against coronavirus, according to a recent report.\n\nLast week, one first patient at UCSF was treated with the concoction of antiviral drug remdesivir and interferon beta, a medication used to treat multiple sclerosis, the San Francisco Chronicle reported.\n\nThe National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), is sponsoring the randomized, controlled clinical trial. The study will enroll more than 1,000 hospitalized adults with COVID-19 at as many as 100 sites in the U.S. and abroad, with UCSF being one of those sites.\n\nAccording to NIH, all patients will get remdesivir and those in the combination therapy group will be injected with interferon beta every other day for four total doses. Patients only receiving remdesivir will get a matching placebo injection.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR FULL CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE\n\n\"We are looking for the golden ticket,\" Peter Chin-Hong, a professor of medicine and infectious diseases at UCSF, who is on the study team, told the outlet. \"The gold medalist will be a combination of drugs that will get you to the sweet spot.\"\n\nResearchers hope the drug combination will attack the virus and lower inflammation, the outlet wrote. NIH said investigators will evaluate recovery time, with secondary goals to study patient outcomes and mortality.\n\nGilead Sciences' remdesivir has shown to shorten recovery times among COVID-19 patients, and a recent UK study found that hospitalized COVID-19 patients who received an inhaled form of interferon beta fared better with the virus. These patients had a 79% lower risk of developing more debilitating symptoms.\n\nDR. MARC SIEGEL DETAILS RISKS TO CHILDREN IF SCHOOLS DON'T REOPEN\n\nWhen researchers found that remdesivir improved recovery times in an earlier NIH trial, they said future strategies should evaluate antiviral agents in combination with other therapeutic approaches to further improve patient outcomes.\n\nIf the drugs are a successful duo, researchers hope to use the concoction as an outpatient treatment to prevent hospitalizations, according to the outlet. NIH said preliminary results are expected in the fall.\n\n\"It would mean I have something I can give patients that would decrease hospitalizations, decrease deaths and decrease the need for a breathing tube,\" Chin-Hong told the outlet. \"All those things would make me feel excited.\"",

        "authors": [],
        "body": "SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Northern Californians were confronted with multiple threats as wildfires, unhealthy smoky air, extreme heat, the looming possibility of power outages and an ongoing pandemic forced many to weigh the risks of staying indoors or going outside.\n\nAsh sprinkled the ground and smoke from several wildfires cast an eerie glow over much of the San Francisco Bay Area on Wednesday, creating unhealthy air quality and heightening concerns about people most prone to respiratory illnesses.\n\nCALIFORNIA SEES FIRST HUMAN PLAGUE CASE IN 5 YEARS\n\nAs ozone pollution reached unhealthy levels in some places, the region's air district and public health officials urged people to stay inside with windows and doors shut until the smoke subsided.\n\nThere was no relief in sight: the forecast for Thursday called for some of the worst air in the world, with the air quality index doubling in the densely populated parts of the Bay Area. The region's air district extended a \"Spare the Air\" alert through Sunday, which makes it illegal to burn wood.\n\nSmoke can irritate the eyes and airways, causing coughing, a dry scratchy throat and irritated sinuses. Elevated particulate matter in the air can trigger wheezing in those who suffer from asthma, emphysema or COPD.\n\n\"I'm feeling lightheaded and I'm a healthy 30-year old. Imagine what it's like if you're an older person or have asthma,\" said Kyle Laurentine of San Mateo. \"I worry, especially in the COVID-19 era, that we're in a state of respiratory vulnerability.\"\n\nBut with a statewide call to conserve energy to avert another rolling power outage, people sweltering in a prolonged heat wave and surrounded by smoke must choose between cranking their fans and air conditioners or shutting them down to conserve energy.\n\n\"These disasters need solutions that are in direct conflict with each other,\" said Jennifer K. Balch, a fire scientist at the University of Colorado. \"COVID-19 is forcing us outside to reduce transmission risk while extreme wildfire smoke is forcing us back inside where the air is better. We're running out of options to cope, under the weight of compound disasters.\"\n\nIf it gets too hot indoors, Erin DeMerritt with the Bay Area Air Quality Management District suggested visiting cooling centers where they are available or any indoor space with filtered air while following mask-wearing and social distancing protocols.\n\n\"It's also important to note that bandannas and masks used to protect yourself from the coronavirus do nothing to protect against smoke from wildfires,\" she added.\n\nMASSACHUSETTS MANDATES FLU VACCINE FOR ALL STUDENTS -- WITH A FEW EXEMPTIONS\n\nThe Bay Area has seen unhealthy levels of air pollution the last four consecutive years from smoke blowing from huge wildfires that devastated wine country in 2017 and the town of Paradise in 2018 and caused widespread evacuations in Sonoma County last year.\n\nWednesday's poor air quality came on quickly as the Bay Area was socked in by exploding wildfires to the north, south and east. Scientists said over the decades climate change's warmer, drier weather is making much more of California burn.\n\nExposure to wildfire smoke can lead to real health problems, including asthma and heart attacks, said Colorado State University atmospheric scientist Jeff Pierce, who has worked with epidemiologists on the health effects of wildfires.\n\n\"Very unhealthy\" air quality forecasts usually double hospitalizations for asthma but it may be different this year with people afraid to go to the hospital because of the coronavirus, he said.\n\nSmoke can even penetrate homes, making it hard for vulnerable people, including those sick from coronavirus, to escape, Pierce said.\n\nScientists said a top health concern with smoke are the fine particles that get deep into the lungs.\n\n\"I consider wildfire smoke kind of like tobacco smoke without the nicotine,\" said Dr. John Balmes, a professor of pulmonary medicine at University of California, San Francisco and environmental health at University of California, Berkeley.\n\nRecent studies from China and Europe suggest such particles can increase the risk of progression for patients who have milder conoravirus cases to more severe symptoms, he said. The particles can damage the lung lining, triggering the body's natural immune system to overreact with inflammation to fight off a non-existent infection. In that way it makes the injury worse, he said.\n\nOther immune system responses can also cause more problems than the smoke itself, something that can happen in coronavirus situations, he said.\n\nThe coronavirus was on Fae Gershenson's mind when she opened her 70-acre ranch to people fleeing a lightning-sparked wildfire north of Santa Cruz Tuesday evening. She had the space for evacuees' tents, stalls for their farm animals and an outdoor composting toilet to allow for physical distancing.\n\nBut when a family arrived with a 95-year-old grandmother, Gershenson said she was worried about the smoke's effect on older people and invited the woman into her house.\n\n\"We talked about how to keep each other safe; everyone's conscious about wearing masks,\" Gershenson said.\n\nTHIRD CASE OF MOSQUITO-BORNE EEE VIRUS REPORTED IN MASSACHUSETTS: OFFICIALS\n\nShe said wildfires have threatened her property in the Santa Cruz mountains a few times before, and with a neighbor helping manage her children's distance learning, she has the ability to help evacuees.\n\n\"I have no idea how people can do it right now,\" she said. \"I don't think it's going to be normal for quite some time.\"",

They then use nucleic acid targets and molecular methods recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to detect genetic markers of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, in the samples, according to the news release.\n\n\"Testing the wastewater gives you an idea of the number of cases within a community and if the numbers are increasing or decreasing,\" Pepper said in a university press release. \"The approach can also be used to help determine if an intervention is working to reduce the transmission of the virus.\"\n\nCORONAVIRUS MAY TRAVEL THROUGH TOILET AND PIPES: STUDY\n\n\"We will be able to determine if the virus persists in the community even if there are no reported new cases,\" Charles Gerba, a microbiologist and professor of environmental science in the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences, said in the press release. \"To me, it's a key to tracing the spread of a virus.\"\n\nThe wastewater surveillance program has been used worldwide, and has been helpful in identifying poliovirus, among others, found in community wastewater in some countries, according to the release.\n\n\"We have tested for hepatitis A, enteroviruses and noroviruses. We have approximately 15 different viruses that we regularly test for in sewage and recycled waters for reuse applications,\" environmental virology expert Walter Betancourt, a microbiologist and assistant research professor in the Department of Environmental Science, said in the release.\n\nRecently, the University of Arizona was able to detect two asymptomatic individuals in a dorm through the wastewater system analysis. Over 300 individuals associated with the dorm were tested and two positive cases were discovered and isolated.\n\n\"Nobody would have known that otherwise. With this early detection, we jumped on it right away, tested those youngsters, and got them the appropriate isolation where they needed to be.\" Dr. Richard Carmona, who leads the university's reentry task force, said during a recent media conference addressing the discovery. \"Think about if we had missed it, and if we waited for them to become symptomatic and they stayed in the dorm for days or a week during the incubation period, how many people would have been infected.\"\n\n\"The technology is helpful in preventing outbreaks before they start,\" Pepper added to Fox News. \"An important additional benefit is that WBE will detect virus shed by both symptomatic and asymptomatic infected individuals.\"",

        "authors": [],
        "body": "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.\n\nWith a coronavirus vaccine still months off, companies are rushing to test what may be the next best thing: drugs that deliver antibodies to fight the virus right away, without having to train the immune system to make them.\n\nAntibodies are proteins the body makes when an infection occurs; they attach to a virus and help it be eliminated. Vaccines work by tricking the body into thinking there's an infection so it makes antibodies and remembers how to do that if the real bug turns up.\n\nYOUNG CHILDREN WITH CORONAVIRUS MAY CARRY 10 TO 100 TIMES MORE OF VIRUS THAN ADULTS: STUDY\n\nBut it can take a month or two after vaccination or infection for the most effective antibodies to form. The experimental drugs shortcut that process by giving concentrated versions of specific ones that worked best against the coronavirus in lab and animal tests.\n\n\"A vaccine takes time to work, to force the development of antibodies. But when you give an antibody, you get immediate protection,\" said University of North Carolina virologist Dr. Myron Cohen. \"If we can generate them in large concentrations, in big vats in an antibody factory ... we can kind of bypass the immune system.\"\n\nThese drugs are believed to last for a month or more and could give quick, temporary immunity to people at high risk of infection, such as health workers and housemates of someone with COVID-19. If they proved effective and if a vaccine doesn't materialize or protect as hoped, the drugs might eventually be considered for wider use, perhaps for teachers or other groups.\n\nThey're also being tested as treatments, to help the immune system and prevent severe symptoms or death.\n\n\"The hope there is to target people who are in the first week of their illness and that we can treat them with the antibody and prevent them from getting sick,\" said Dr. Marshall Lyon, an infectious disease specialist helping to test one such drug at Emory University in Atlanta.\n\nHaving such a tool \"would be a really momentous thing in our fight against COVID,\" Cohen said.\n\nVaccines are seen as a key to controlling the virus, which has been confirmed to have infected more than 20 million people worldwide and killed more than 738,000. Several companies are racing to develop vaccines, but the results of the large final tests needed to evaluate them are months away. Russia on Tuesday approved a vaccine that hasn't undergone such a test, sparking international concern that it was cutting corners.\n\nThe antibody drugs are \"very promising\" and, in contrast, could be available \"fairly soon,\" said Dr. Janet Woodcock, a U.S. Food and Drug Administration official who is leading government efforts to speed COVID-19 therapies. Key studies are underway and some answers should come by early fall.\n\nOne company, Eli Lilly, has already started manufacturing its antibody drug, betting that studies now underway will give positive results.\n\n\"Our goal is to get something out as soon as possible\" and to have hundreds of thousands of doses ready by fall, said Lilly's chief scientific officer, Dr. Daniel Skovronsky.\n\nAnother company that developed an antibody drug cocktail against Ebola -- Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc. -- now is testing one for coronavirus.\n\n\"The success with our Ebola program gives us some confidence that we can potentially do this again,\" said Christos Kyratsous, a Regeneron microbiologist who helped lead that work.\n\nRegeneron's drug uses two antibodies to enhance chances the drug will work even if the virus evolves to evade action by one.\n\nLilly is testing two different, single-antibody drugs -- one with the Canadian company AbCellera and another with a Chinese company, Junshi Biosciences. In July, Junshi said no safety concerns emerged in 40 healthy people who tried it and that larger studies were getting underway.\n\nOthers working on antibody drugs include Amgen and Adaptive Biotechnologies. The Singapore biotech company Tychan Pte Ltd. also is testing an antibody drug and has similar products in development for Zika virus and yellow fever.\n\n\"I'm cautiously optimistic\" about the drugs, said the nation's top infectious diseases expert, Dr. Anthony Fauci. \"I'm heartened by the experience that we had with Ebola,\" where the drugs proved effective.\n\nWhat could go wrong?\n\n-- The antibodies may not reach all of the places in the body where they need to act, such as deep in the lungs. All the antibody drugs are given through an IV and must make their way through the bloodstream to wherever they're needed.\n\n-- The virus might mutate to avoid the antibody -- the reason Regeneron is testing a two-antibody combo that binds to the virus in different places to help prevent its escape.\n\nSkovronsky said Lilly stuck with one antibody because manufacturing capacity would essentially be cut in half to make two, and \"you will have less doses available.\" If a single antibody works, \"we can treat twice as many people,\" he said.\n\n-- The antibodies might not last long enough. If they fade within a month, it's still OK for treatment since COVID-19 illness usually resolves in that time. But for prevention, it may not be practical to give infusions more often than every month or two.\n\nA San Francisco company, Vir Biotechnology Inc., says it has engineered antibodies to last longer than they usually do to avoid this problem. GlaxoSmithKline has invested $250 million in Vir to test them.\n\nGiving a higher dose also may help. If half of antibodies disappear after a month, \"if you give twice as much, you will have two months' protection,\" Lilly's Skovronsky said.\n\nDOGS ABLE TO SNIFF CORONAVIRUS IN HUMAN SALIVA, GERMAN STUDY FINDS\n\n-- The big fear: Antibodies may do the opposite of what's hoped and actually enhance the virus's ability to get into cells or stimulate the immune system in a way that makes people sicker. It's a theoretical concern that hasn't been seen in testing so far, but large, definitive experiments are needed to prove safety.\n\n\"As best as we can tell, the antibodies are helpful,\" Lyon said.",

She later discusses how close America is to releasing a coronavirus vaccine.\n\nThe U.S. last month saw coronavirus cases jump in children by 40% while the debate in the country rages over whether or not to reopen schools for in-person classes.\n\nCLICK FOR THE LATEST ON THE CORONAVIRUS\n\nBloomberg, citing the American Academy of Pediatrics and the Children's Hospital Association, reported that 86 children died from the disease in the U.S., which amounted to 0.06% total fatalities and 0.003% of total cases.\n\nThere have been over 5 million coronavirus cases in the U.S., the highest of any country, and more than 160,000 deaths. Health officials believe the actual number is perhaps 10 times higher, or closer to 50 million, given testing limitations and the fact that as many as 40% of all those who are infected have no symptoms.\n\nGeorgia health officials confirmed last week that a 7-year-old boy with no underlying conditions has become the youngest person in the state to die from COVID-19.\n\nThe African-American boy was infected with the disease after attending a Savannah church where he was in contact with two senior members who were also stricken with the virus and died, the local NBC affiliate reported.\n\nThe debate over reopening schools has been a political flashpoint. Democrats, for the most part, have accused President Trump of recklessness with his call to get children back in the classroom, while Republicans say Democrats are weaponizing schools on an election year.\n\nGET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"We're 100 days out from the presidential election -- the only objective Democrats have is to defeat Donald Trump,\" Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, said in an interview last week. \"And they've cynically decided [the] best way to defeat Donald Trump is shut down every business in America, shut down every school in America.\"\n\nFox News' David Aaro and the Associated Press contributed to this report",

        "body": "Reported cases of the novel coronavirus linked to an outbreak at a sleep-away camp in Hope Township, Mich., has increased to 21 and six probable cases as of Monday, according to multiple reports.\n\nThe Barry-Eaton District Health Department said the cases are related to an outbreak of the virus at an outdoor campground at Camp Michawana which is located just outside of Hastings.\n\nThe outbreak was first reported Aug. 6 when five staff members and one camper tested positive for the virus, according to the Barry-Eaton District Health Department website.\n\n\"We estimate that approximately 250 persons attended or staffed the camp in the past two weeks and are at greatest risk of exposure. Approximately 180 campers were children under 18 who attended the children's overnight camp either last week or this week. An additional 70 persons were either attendees at the family-style camp or staff of the camp,\" the Barry-Eaton District Health Department said in a press release on Thursday.\n\nRARE CORONAVIRUS-LINKED SYNDROME AFFECTS 11 CHILDREN IN WASHINGTON STATE: OFFICIALS\n\nThe local health department stated in the release it was working with the camp management to notify people who had been directly exposed and noted that many live outside the area. Officials said anyone who attended or stayed at Camp Michawana -- which contains a family camp, children's overnight camp, and a campground -- on or after July 24th may have been exposed.\n\n\"The way Camp Michawana operates, it's very challenging for us to tell who is exposed and who was not exposed because there's so much movement. Because of this challenge, we acted out of caution and considered everyone exposed,\" Sarah Surna, Barry-Eaton County Health Department Community health promotions specialist, told news outlet WWMT-TV3\n\nSurna told the news outlet health officials were performing contact tracing and case investigation. \"Some of the best tools we have to prevent the spread of the disease is contact tracing and case investigation,\" she said in the interview.\n\nYOUNG CHILDREN WITH CORONAVIRUS MAY CARRY 10 TO 100 TIMES MORE OF VIRUS THAN ADULTS: STUDY\n\nGov. Gretchen Whitmer on Thursday signed an executive order requiring face masks to be worn by children attending daycare and camps. The new measure requires that staff and children ages 12 and older must wear a mask in cabins or similar indoor settings and classrooms. All staff and children 2 years old and older must wear face coverings on school buses, while those 4 years old and older are required to wear them in hallways and common areas.\n\nPreviously, camps and child care centers were not mandated to wear masks inside enclosed public spaces and crowded outdoor places.\n\n\"While I can't say if Camp Michawana outbreak would have been prevented, we encourage wide use of masks at Barry-Eaton County Health Department because we know masks work,\" Surna said to the TV outlet.\n\nThe Barry-Eaton District Health Department recommends that these individuals self-quarantine at home for 14 days past the last date of their stay at the camp and monitor themselves for signs of COVID-19. Anyone who experiences symptoms is encouraged to get tested immediately.\n\nThe camp is now closed to visitors for two weeks.\n\nAs of Monday, Barry County had a total of 164 cases of COVID-19, according to the Barry-Eaton county website.",

The sample also included approximately equal numbers of people in different age groups (adolescent, young adult, and adult), races, and genders,\" per a university release.\n\nThose who participated were asked if they ever used a vaping device and if they had smoked or vaped in the past month.\n\nCAN YOU CONTRACT THE CORONAVIRUS FROM SECONDHAND SMOKE?\n\n\"They were asked if they had experienced COVID-19 symptoms, received a test for COVID-19 or received a positive diagnosis of COVID-19 after being tested,\" per the release.\n\nAmong study participants tested for the virus, data showed that those who vaped were five times more likely to be infected. Young people who smoke cigarettes were also at an increased risk, the study found; they were seven times more likely to be infected.\n\n\"Given the predominance of e-cigarette use among U.S. youth, our investigation informs public health concerns that the ongoing youth e-cigarette epidemic contributes to the current COVID-19 pandemic,\" study authors wrote.\n\n\"Heightened exposure to nicotine and other chemicals in e-cigarettes adversely affects lung function,\" researchers said.\n\nSmoking lends itself to touching the face, and the study noted that COVID-19 can spread during repeated touching to the face. Researchers said it is a common practice among young e-cigarette users to share devices.\n\nGiven the findings, study authors said the Food and Drug Administration should \"effectively regulate\" e-cigarettes during the pandemic and called for more screening and education about the harms smoking inflicts to the respiratory and immune systems.\n\n\"This study tells us pretty clearly that youth who are using vapes or are dual-using [e-cigarettes and cigarettes] are at elevated risk, and it's not just a small increase in risk; it's a big one,\" said Shivani Mathur Gaiha, the study's lead author and postdoctoral research scholar at Stanford University, per a university release.",

(iStock)\n\nWhile the United States deals with the coronavirus, the West Nile virus is on the rise and can show similar features to COVID-19, creating some confusion. Seventeen human cases of West Nile virus have been reported so far in Texas, Los Angeles County, and Fla., according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).\n\nIn Georgia, Fox 5 Atlanta reported this week that mosquitos positive for West Nile Virus were found in DeKalb County. Because the symptoms are similar to COVID-19, which is still running rampant throughout the country, health experts warn to not overlook West Nile when diagnosing.\n\n\"Mosquitoes do not carry COVID, but because the symptoms are so similar you'll need to talk with your doctor to see about getting a COVID test,\" Juanette Willis, with the DeKalb County Board of Health, told FOX 5.\n\nBLOOD TEST IDENTIFIES WHICH CORONAVIRUS PATIENTS MAY BE HELPED OR HARMED BY STEROID TREATMENT\n\nDr. Paul Auwaerter, clinical director of the division of infectious diseases at Johns Hopkins Hospital, told Yahoo Life regarding West Nile infections, \"About 20 percent might develop a flu-like illness [also known as West Nile fever] that is probably indistinguishable from COVID-19. \" The professor of medicine at John Hopkins University School of Medicine also told the media outlet: \"They can have headache, fever, muscle aches, gastrointestinal symptoms [vomiting and diarrhea], and swollen lymph glands.\"\n\nAuwaerter said in the article with the diseases sharing similar characteristics, \"People are just assuming they have COVID-19,\" rather than a mosquito bearing disease. \"Statistically, it's probably true that it's COVID in these cases,\" the article cited Auwaerter, \"But it's not always the case.\"\n\nHealth officials at Cleveland clinic, according to the media outlet, stated a skin rash on the trunk and chest, can occur with the West Nile virus while it is not as typical with COVID-19 patients who, if they do present with a rash, typically report it on their toes.\n\nBoth diseases can have detrimental effects on a person's health and can affect the nervous system, according to the CDC, which also states on its website that nearly \"1 in every 150 people who are infected with West Nile disease can develop a severe illness affecting the central nervous system\" such as encephalitis (brain inflammation) or meningitis (inflammation of the brain and spinal cord). Doctors told Fox News, in some cases of West Nile infections, patients can show symptoms including high fever, stiff neck, severe headache, and can even become confused, weak and experience possible seizures.\n\nDOGS ABLE TO SNIFF CORONAVIRUS IN HUMAN SALIVA, GERMAN STUDY FINDS\n\nThe novel coronavirus can also show neurological effects. Some cases reported peripheral neuropathy in the legs and complaints of \"brain fog,\" some physicians explained to Fox News. COVID-19 can also affect the trigeminal and olfactory nerves which affect the sense of smell. which is not typical with the West Nile infection. Besides those symptoms, neurologists told Fox News that coronavirus can present with headache, difficulty focusing, blood clotting, weakness and some studies are linking it with the neurological condition Guillain-barre.\n\nOne main difference, according to health experts, is that the coronavirus is a contagious respiratory disease where West Nile is not. The West Nile illness is contracted typically by a mosquito bite, while novel coronavirus is currently believed to spread through sneezing, coughing or touching, according to the CDC. To differentiate clinically between the two illnesses, a physician can perform a nasal swab test to detect novel coronavirus while a blood test can determine if a person has been infected with the West Nile virus infection.",

The church reportedly still held services Sunday, according to the article on the news site.\n\n\"I went to the wedding. I officiated the wedding.

A list of sites offering testing under the HHS standing order can be found on the Keep Maine Healthy website.\n\nMAINE HOSPITAL SEES CORONAVIRUS RESURGENCE AFTER VISITORS LEARN OF POSITIVE TEST RESULTS WHILE ON TRIP\n\nThe Maine CDC stated that people who have symptoms of coronavirus should not attend gatherings or go to work. The agency recommends following proper handwashing techniques, maintain social distancing, and wear a face mask in public places, including gathering at religious services.\n\nThe federal CDC agency issued guidelines for faith-based organizations to limit exposure and spread of the novel coronavirus as churches reopen during the coronavirus pandemic. Some of the suggestions on the federal health agency's website included: limit gathering size and maintain social distancing, consider outdoor services and virtual access for those who are at high risk, limit the sharing of religious objects like prayer books and other worship aides, and consider alternative methods of collecting financial contributions to avoid the passing of collection baskets, and limit physical contact such as shaking hands and hugging amongst community members.",

The order allows gatherings up to 50 people indoors and 100 people outdoors, with a punishment fine up to $10,000 and payment of civil damages to the state for contact tracing and testing. There were approximately 65 guests at the wedding reception.\n\nThe state health department said those who attend social gatherings should remain 6 feet apart and wear cloth face coverings when not eating or drinking.",

As of Monday, at least 45 COVID-19 cases have been reported, 30 of which are staff members, while 15 are patients at St. Michael Medical Center in Bremerton, which is part of the CHI Franciscan medical group, according to a Kitsap Public Health District news release.\n\nBLOOD TEST IDENTIFIES WHICH CORONAVIRUS PATIENTS MAY BE HELPED OR HARMED BY STEROID TREATMENT\n\nKitsap health officials stated the cases started in early August, possibly with a staff member, and spread from there. More cases are expected to be reported as testing continues, local health officials stated during a press conference Monday.\n\n\"This is not the first hospital to have this outbreak,\" Dr. Scott Lindquist of the Washington State Department of Health stated during a video conference on Monday. Lindquist added the health department is working with the hospital to find a resolution and is \"confident to be able to help control this.\"\n\nThe Kitsap Public Health District was notified Aug. 4 that an employee of St. Michael Medical Center in Bremerton had tested positive for COVID-19. A case investigation and contact tracing subsequently began. More than a week later, five more novel coronavirus cases were reported and linked to a unit at that hospital, according to a timeline on the health department's website.\n\nThe local health department declared an outbreak at the medical center and consulted the state department of health when more positive tests among staff and patients across multiple units of the hospital were discovered.\n\n\"Outbreaks like this are a reminder for people to stay home and get tested if there are any symptoms,\" Dr. Gib Morrow, health officer for the Kitsap Public Health District, said during the conference.\n\nDr. Michael Anderson, chief medical officer for CHI Franciscan, said the hospital system is \"working shoulder to shoulder\" with the department of health to address the outbreak. He noted that the hospital has returned to policies initially put in place when the COVID-19 crisis began.\n\nDOGS ABLE TO SNIFF CORONAVIRUS IN HUMAN SALIVA, GERMAN STUDY FINDS\n\nThose policies include the limitation of visitors, including limiting to one visitor for end-of-life events.\n\n\"We've increased some of the protections above and beyond what the CDC originally recommended for high-risk procedures in that we are now elevating our posture until we know this outbreak has been contained,\" Anderson added during the conference.\n\n\"Public health authorities are recommending several mitigation measures, including ongoing COVID-19 testing for staff and patients, robust screening for staff, and limiting non-essential access to the facility,\" the Kitsap Public Health Department stated in a news release.\n\n\"To prevent the spread of COVID-19, it's critical that everyone continues to stay home when possible and have fewer, shorter and safer interactions with others. That means keeping physical distance and wearing face coverings,\" department officials cautioned.",

However, because COVID is highly contagious, we must manage not only ourselves but the additional responsibility of potentially infecting those we love, especially those in a high-risk category.\"\n\nBarry Douglas knows just what Potter is talking about. Douglas, recently diagnosed with the novel coronavirus, told Fox News he had that same feeling of guilt when he became ill. \"I felt lousy. I felt bad, but the anxiety of spreading the virus was worse,\" he said.\n\nThe Maryland resident said no one in his immediate circle had the novel coronavirus and he was surprised when he suddenly felt sick after driving home from the beach where he would social distance with his family to get fresh air and check-in with one another. \"I could smell the wonderful corn field fertilizer in Maryland.\" Douglas said sarcastically, knowing he'd welcome that smell now, after losing his sense of taste and smell since being infected nearly three weeks ago.\n\nPRELIMINARY STUDY INVESTIGATES HOW CORONAVIRUS PARTICLES MAY TRAVEL IN CLASSROOMS, INDOOR AREAS\n\nDouglas said he went to sleep that Sunday night and awoke around 3 a.m. with a horrific headache and a \"clogged head\" he told Fox News. Within hours the headache and congestion grew worse and eventually he could not smell. Fearing the symptoms were COVID-19, he drove an hour to a rapid test clinic that morning. \"Positive,\" Douglas shared. \"I felt lousy. I began the drive home, racing Hurricane Isaias and dialing anyone I may have put in harm's way.\"\n\nDouglas shared how his wife and children helped while trying to maintain a safe distance. Usual dinners together at the table were replaced with trays left in front of a closed door for him to eat alone, afraid of spreading the disease to his loved ones while he wondered how badly the disease would progress.\n\n\"The uncertainty can get a bit overwhelming,\" he stated.\n\nThe 55-year-old shared how thoughts would go from being worried about his own fate, with knowing people who died from coronavirus, to worrying if he spread the virus that could potentially kill his own family members.\n\n\"I wouldn't be able to live with myself,\" he remarked. \"I can't thank my wife enough. She wasn't sure if she was infected or going to get it, but hung with me anyway. \"\n\nThe guilt overtook Douglas so much that he requested his family stay at a family house and while he dealt with the disease alone, being virtually supported by his two physicians, Doctors Steve and Faranak Olexo, who continually checked on him. Douglas said, he'd rather be alone with the disease than know he gave it to his family members.\n\nHOMEMADE CORONAVIRUS FACE MASKS SHOULD BE TWO OR THREE LAYERS TO STOP SPREAD OF VIRUS, STUDY FINDS\n\n\"This is a very common experience,\" Potter, who leads a support group for post-COVID patients and patients with respiratory issues in New York, told Fox News.\n\nAs for Douglas, he said he is overcoming guilt with faith and gratitude.\n\n\"I am grateful for all my family, friends, and prayers. My mom and dad called every day to comfort me, but I know was comforting them with any report of progress. Can't thank my wife enough,\" he said. He also said the support from contact tracers also helped him realize he wasn't alone in his thoughts.\n\n\"The contact tracing team from Anne Arundel County was spectacular. They called frequently -- every two days -- to check on me and share symptoms and concerns from other patients,\" he said.\n\nFor those coping with guilt during the coronavirus pandemic, Potter offered these tips:",

He gets tested and learns he has the virus. He's tired but not in need of hospital care, so he returns home and in the process, exposes his wife and mother to the virus.\n\nHealth officials in some countries claim they know the best method to prevent the disease's spread -- but its implementation is the problem.\n\nCLICK FOR THE LATEST ON THE CORONAVIRUS\n\nA Bloomberg report published on Thursday pointed out that some countries that have struggled with COVID-19 outbreaks have enacted a strategy that employs centralized facilities for those who are infected until they are no longer a risk to the public.\n\nThe sick individual would be separated from their family and held at a large facility with others who have the virus but do not require hospitalization.\n\nJeremy Lim, an adjunct professor at the National University of Singapore's Saw Swee Hock School of public health, told Bloomberg that a \"laissez-faire approach naively trusting everyone to be responsible has been shown to be ineffective, as there will always be a proportion who will breach the terms of the isolation.\"\n\nThe report pointed out that some countries studied how those with the disease responded to quarantine orders. There were 3,000 people in Australia who were told to self-isolate and 800 disregarded the orders. The report also pointed out that 40% of Japan's elderly patients came down with the virus from a cohabitant.\n\nThe idea that health officials could force patients with mild symptoms to one of these centers would likely be chilling for many Americans and would likely draw swift comparisons to a George Orwell novel.\n\nJoe Biden, the presumptive Democrat nominee, and Sen. Kamala Harris, his running mate, were criticized by conservatives after they called for a nationwide mask mandate, saying \"every American should be wearing a mask when they're outside for the next three months at a minimum.\"\n\nMany in the U.S. have been critical of state overreach during the pandemic by limiting church services and other social gatherings, enforcement almost seems impossible to even consider, and that is without considering reports of test results that are false positives.\n\nThe Bloomberg report said the U.S. is not broadly enacting the policy that has been used in Italy and South Korea. The report said it is not being widely used in Australia.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nStephen Leeder, emeritus professor of public health and community medicine at the University of Sydney, told the outlet, \"From what I know about the Australian psyche, I don't think it would go down all that well.\"",

To help distinguish between the two, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has provided some guidance as the school year begins.\n\n\"It can be difficult to differentiate allergies from infection from COVID, especially when both can be prevalent at the same time of the year like it can be this fall,\" Dr. Fred Davis, an emergency department physician at Northwell Health Long Island Jewish medical center on Long Island, N.Y., told Fox News.\n\nPRELIMINARY STUDY INVESTIGATES HOW CORONAVIRUS PARTICLES MAY TRAVEL IN CLASSROOMS, INDOOR AREAS\n\nOne key difference is that a fever typically occurs with COVID-19 and not seasonal allergies, according to the CDC and health experts.\n\n\"Both can lead to a runny nose, cough, and congestion. The big differentiation is usually fever, those with symptoms from allergies tend to not have a fever, whereas those with a viral infection like COVID will tend to have a fever (i.e. a temperature greater than 100.4)\", Davis, also the associate chair of emergency medicine, continued.\n\nAdditionally, itchy, watery eyes and sneezing are symptoms commonly associated with allergies and not novel coronavirus, per the CD\n\nCOVID-19 symptoms that are not typically present with seasonal allergies include chills and muscle aches, fever, vomiting and nausea, diarrhea, and sudden loss of smell and taste, according to the federal health agency.\n\nThere are some overlapping symptoms that can raise concern in parents as their children return to school. Sore throat, fatigue, congestion, runny nose, cough, and headache, are some similarities, per the CDC.

EXPERTS, PARENTS WEIGH IN\n\nIf you are unsure and think you or your child may have been infected by COVID-19, it is recommended to get tested, notify the school and follow CDC guidelines for quarantining to avoid the spread of the disease, the CDC said. If your child is experiencing difficulty breathing, immediately seek medical help.\n\nThe CDC recommends frequent handwashing, social distancing, and wearing masks for those above 2 years old to avoid exposure to SARS-CoV-2, the virus also known as COVID-19. Wearing masks may also help ward off some allergens, according to the federal health agency's website.",

    "Coronavirus threat has school districts divided over how to transport students safely on buses": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "Superintendent Kathleen Porter-Magee, Fox News medical contributor Dr. Nicole Saphier, and mother Elizabeth Savetsky weigh in.\n\nSchool districts nationwide puzzling over how to safely educate children during a pandemic have a more immediate challenge -- getting 26 million bus-riding students there in the first place.\n\nFew challenges are proving to be more daunting than figuring out how to maintain social distance on school buses. A wide array of strategies have emerged to reduce the health risks but nobody has found a silver bullet.\n\nShould students with COVID-19 symptoms be isolated at the front of the school bus? Should bus seats be assigned? Should buses be loaded from the back? Should buses only carry a few students at a time?\n\nCLICK HERE FOR FULL CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE\n\n\"The transportation professionals are left with the issue of, OK, you've got little Billy at the bus stop. Mom's not there and he's got a temperature. That's a dilemma,\" said Steve Simmons, a bus safety expert who used to head pupil transportation for Columbus, Ohio, public schools. \"We can't answer those kinds of questions. I don't think anybody can.\"\n\nSimmons, president of the National Association for Pupil Transportation, was part of team of industry and school officials who produced a 70-page report on ways to lower the risk of COVID-19 transmission.\n\nMany schools have been surveying parents to determine how many students will take the bus and how many will be privately driven to school. Others are making decisions about bus capacity that involve a trade-off between safety and affordability.\n\nThe task force report warned that a 6-foot social distancing regulation \"is not financially nor operationally feasible,\" and that \"current thinking\" is that a 72-student capacity bus can accommodate 24 students, or more if family members sit together.\n\nARIZONA SUPERINTENDENT DISMISSES HOPES FOR REOPENING SCHOOLS THIS FALL AS 'FANTASY'\n\nSome large districts will nonetheless \"jam 'em in\" the bus, Simmons said, while other districts plan to stagger school start times or teach half the students in the morning and the rest in the afternoon, with two sets of bus runs.\n\nSchool transportation plans are \"just one of the many ways we're seeing inequities playing out in this pandemic,\" said Deborah Gordon Klehr, executive director of the Education Law Center in Philadelphia.\n\n\"Some districts are saying that they will cut back on the number of students offered transportation, or expect more parents to drive their students to school,\" she said. \"Students and families with fewer resources are going to be the ones hurt by this.\"\n\nKim Blodgett quit her job as a fourth-grade teacher this year in order to drive her 5-year-old son to the Oklahoma School for the Deaf, concerned the twice-daily, 45-minute bus ride from their home in Norman was too risky.\n\n\"So many parents feel like they have no control over any of this that's happened,\" Blodgett said. \"They have to work, they have to send their kids to school. They have to put their kids on that bus. It's a horrible situation all the way around.\"\n\nCORONAVIRUS IS REDUCING PARENTS' SPENDING ON BACK-TO-SCHOOL ITEMS, CLOTHES\n\nSimmons said most bus drivers are old enough to put them at heightened risk for severe illness if they catch the virus. They will have to decide whether to continue driving - a job that typically does not pay much - or to stay home and prioritize their own safety, which could worsen a years-long national school bus driver shortage.\n\nSchools will have to decide what cleaning standards they want to set and whether to add sneeze guards or similar barriers among students and between students and bus drivers.\n\nIn Pennsylvania, the Transportation Department shot down a proposal to install plastic barriers around bus drivers, telling a school bus contractor there is no evidence it would make students or drivers safer. In New York, hand sanitizer isn't even allowed on buses \"due to its combustible composition and potential liability to the carrier or district,\" according to guidance from the state's school reopening task force.\n\nThe task force report said a survey of bus contractors found they were unanimously opposed to taking students' temperatures, as some districts have considered. The contractors said drivers and bus monitors do not want to have to interpret health data, among other objections.\n\nALABAMA SCHOOL DISTRICT FORCED TO REORDER LAPTOPS AFTER US BLOCKS CHINA SHIPMENT\n\nGetting on and off the bus is considered a time of heightened risk. Pennsylvania districts are considering assigned bus seating, making students fill empty buses from the back and emptying them from the front.\n\nA suburban Philadelphia school district's reopening plan states that students with symptoms should be placed in the front seat of the bus and brought to the school nurse. Another mandates that no students with symptoms will be sent on a bus or brought to school. Districts are designating rooms where sick or potentially sick children can be isolated until their parents can retrieve them.\n\nPottstown, Pa., schools have proposed keeping windows on its few buses open, a plan that will be difficult to carry out in winter. New York's statewide recommendation is for windows to remain cracked if the outside temperature is at least 45 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\nPublic schools in Providence, R.I., had considered making all students attend the schools that are located closest to their homes as a way to limit ridership, but officials withdrew that proposal after parents objected.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe Kentucky Education Department suggests schools institute \"walking school buses,\" a system used in at least two other states in which adults chaperone groups of students walking to and from school together, with designated bus stops and pickup times. Education Department spokesperson Toni Konz Tatman said there has been no word yet of any districts giving the walking school buses a try.\n\nBus plans are expected to be tweaked over the first weeks and months of school, but if a major outbreak is linked to bus transportation, parents will have to decide whether to vote with their feet and go another route.",

At this time, routine testing of animals is not recommended,\" he continued.\n\n\"If you are diagnosed with COVID-19, allow a family member or close friend to care for your pets. If no one is available, maintain a safe distance from your pet and frequently wash your hands before and after contact with your pet, their food and supplies,\" added Strain. \"Remember, in the event of an emergency, it is wise to have a pet plan as you would have a game plan for your family.\"\n\nThere have been other reports of canines testing positive for the virus since the pandemic began.

        "body": "From police injuries to financial losses from looters, the aftermath from weeks of cross-country protests is bringing some cities to their knees.\n\nAll told, the unruly demonstrations following the deaths of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor and Ahmaud Arbery could make it one of the costliest displays of civil disorder in U.S. history. In many places, the financial fallout comes as cities and states have drained their coffers trying to fight COVID-19. The end result for these cash-strapped cities could put them millions of dollars in the red and struggling for years to get out.\n\nIn Minneapolis, costs related to the protests could hit higher than $500 million. In Portland, Ore., nearly 80 nights of destruction have caused the liberal locale $23 million and counting. In Chicago, a city that's seen soaring crime rates and corruption at the highest levels, the damage done from the protests has not only hit high-end retailers but crippled hundreds of mom-and-pop stores trying to eke out a living.\n\nPORTLAND TO ALLOW COPS TO INTERACT WITH SOME FEDERAL AUTHORITIES\n\nAlthough the total financial fallout from the protests is still unknown, it will likely eclipse the Los Angeles riots in 1992, which until this years was the most expensive, costing the city $1.4 billion (adjusted for inflation), according to PCS, the insurance industry's primary source for reporting insured losses. Two days of riots following Freddie Gray's funeral in 2015 caused Baltimore $26 million in losses.\n\nWhile it's true that thousands of people have peacefully protested across the United States following Floyd's death in May, there have been several demonstrations that have gotten out of hand, escalating into violence and vandalism.\n\nHere's a look at the financial impact of demonstrations across five U.S. cities.\n\nMINNEAPOLIS\n\nThe first peaceful protests broke out in Minneapolis following Floyd's death but then turned violent. Costs related to the protests could balloon to more than $500 million on top of $12.7 million for the National Guard deployment.\n\nThe city's Third Police Precinct, which was abandoned at the direction of Mayor Jacob Frey on May 28, was torched and will cost at least $10 million to rebuild, Hennepin County officials said. It will cost another $289,000 to replace the 911 equipment inside the station, $225,000 for cleanup operations and $5,000 for paper-shredding services, the Star Tribune reported. Another $1 million will be used to cover overtime for police, fire and public employees.\n\nMINNEAPOLIS' THIRD PRECINCT DAMAGED DURING GEORGE FLOYD RIOTS WILL COST $10M TO FIX: REPORT\n\nBut that's just the beginning.\n\nMore than 400 businesses have been damaged with owners and insurance experts estimating rebuilding costs in the hundreds of millions of dollars range.\n\nThe city of Minneapolis has tallied at least $55 million in property damage and looting.\n\nThe city could also be on the hook for millions more if they lose the lawsuits filed against them.\n\nOne of them was filed by the American Civil Liberties Union of Minnesota and accuses the city of abridging the constitutionally mandated freedom of the press. The lawsuit, filed on behalf of freelance journalist Jared Goyette, names the City of Minneapolis along with several law enforcement officials as defendants. The ACLU is seeking class-action status for the suit.\n\nIn late July, four Minneapolis activists also filed a lawsuit against the city and members of the police department, alleging authorities used excessive force against protesters. The civil rights lawsuit was filed by attorney Nekima Levy Armstrong, Marques Armstrong, Terry Hempfling and Rachel Clark against the City of Minneapolis, Minneapolis Police Chief Medaria Arradondo, Lt. Robert Kroll, Minnesota Department of Public Safety Commissioner John Harrington and Minnesota State Patrol Col. Matthew Langer. The suit claims the plaintiffs suffered injuries during the protests that have lingered for more than two months, including severe bruising and vocal issues from tear gas.\n\nThere have been other injuries reported as well.\n\nAt least 150 Minneapolis police officers say they are suffering from symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder or other injuries and have started the process of filing disability claims that could allow them to permanently leave the force but get paid as well, which could significantly increase the city's tab.\n\nPORTLAND\n\nIn Portland, Ore., the costs related to nearly 80 nights of protests have soared past the $23 million mark in damages and lost revenue for downtown businesses. Clashes in Oregon's largest city escalated in July when President Trump ordered thousands of federal agents to protect federal buildings from being vandalized. While the confrontations between demonstrators and law enforcement have gone down following the withdrawal of troops from the largely liberal city, the damage has already been done.\n\nSo far, there have been 550 arrests related to the protests.\n\nPORTLAND PROTESTERS, RIOTERS TARGET POLICE WITH LASERS AND FIREWORKS OUTSIDE FEDERAL COURTHOUSE\n\nOn Tuesday, Mike Schmidt, Portland's newly-elected district attorney, announced his office would not be pursuing charges against those who had been arrested over non-violent incidents. Of the 550 arrests, 133 have been classified as felony referrals while 350 were violations with no bodily harm or simple misdemeanors.\n\nOn Thursday, Oregon State Police pulled out approximately 100 troops helping both federal officers and the Portland police in responding to nightly protests. State police had committed two weeks \"and that two weeks ends today,\" spokesman Capt Timothy Fox said.\n\n\"We're in a country that's not going to prosecute this criminal behavior,' he said.\n\nLast month, Portland Police Deputy Chief Chris Davis blamed much of the violence on \"agitator corps\" hellbent on creating havoc and said \"at least\" 33 officers had been hurt. Many of the injuries came from items being thrown at them, including rocks, glass bottles, frozen water bottles, bricks and steel pellets from slingshots. On Aug. 8, an Oregon State Police trooper was struck by a large rock and suffered a head injury.\n\nPORTLAND PROTESTERS CREATE OWN 'AUTONOMOUS ZONE' BY PITCHING TENTS, REBUILDING BARRICADES REMOVED BY POLICE\n\nThe police department's $23 million figure on cost, which was last updated in early July and has likely gone up, includes $300,000 damage to public buildings, $4.8 million in property damages to businesses and $7 million in overtime for police covering protests through July 1.\n\nCHICAGO\n\nChicagoans steeled themselves this week after hundreds of looters responding to social-media calls descended on the city's Magnificent Mile district following the police shooting of a man who officers said fired on them first.\n\nThe Monday morning, carnage looked like the destruction during the city's Floyd protests with broken store windows, looted shops, roads closed and an increase in police presence. By Monday afternoon, KEA Construction owner Alen Music had boarded up five businesses and said the looting has left people \"frustrated and pissed off to be honest, more than scared.\"\n\nSince the start of the protests, more than 200 stores have been impacted in Chicago's central business district that has resulted in \"millions\" of dollars worth of damage, said Adam Skaf, a spokesman for the Magnificent Mile Association.\n\nThe Chicago Sun-Times reported the Floyd protests caused more than $20 million in property damage.\n\nA survey of the aftermath found 40 Cook County businesses sustained major damage and uninsured losses, while another 95 businesses sustained minor damage, according to the Illinois Department of Commerce and Economic Opportunity and the state Emergency Management Agency.\n\nNot only did businesses bear the brunt of out-of-control demonstrators, but police officers also did, too.\n\nSo far, 31 law enforcement officials have been injured -- 13 this week and 18 others in July.\n\nNEW YORK CITY\n\nThe financial fallout in New York City, which was already reeling from massive costs related to COVID-19, has been brutal. Not only have more than 300 officers been injured, but the demonstrations have also cost the city $115 million, plus another $179 million more in overtime.\n\nAccording to the New York Police Department, from May 28 to July 22, 303 cop cars have been vandalized during the protests. The vehicles have been tagged with graffiti, pelted with rocks and in some cases set on fire. Seven vehicles remain out of service while 14 are at a total loss due to arson and have been condemned. The cost of damages is estimated to be $996,700, according to the NYPD.\n\n\"Enough is enough,\" tweeted the Lieutenants Benevolent Association police union. \"The #silentmajority must speak out against this destruction!\"\n\nNEW YORK CITY PROTESTERS TARGET POLICE VEHICLES, LIGHT FIRES\n\nThe nearly $1 million tab taxpayers will have to pick up for the vehicles is just a drop in the bucket.\n\nThe city's Independent Budget Office reported overtime for the first two weeks of the Floyd protests costing $115 million in overtime. Overtime for the same period in 2019 was $61.5 million. This year's June figures did not include costs associated with Puerto Rican Day, Israeli Day or Gay Pride celebrations in the city.\n\nThere's also the cost of NYPD misconduct, which was a motivating factor behind some of the recent protests. Last year, NYC shelled out $68.7 million in settlements and other fines associated with police misconduct, according to the New York City law department. This year, the department has already paid more than $3 million in police misconduct cases.\n\nWASHINGTON, D.C.\n\nIn the nation's capital, costs from the protests have risen past $14.5 million. In June, President Trump ordered the deployment of thousands of National Guard troops -- 1,200 from D.C. and 3,900 from other states -- in response to the demonstrations. The deployment, which began on June 1, lasted a week. On May 31, protests flared up in the district and fires broke out near the White House on May 31. U.S. officials told Reuters that at its peak, the cost came to $2.6 million per day.\n\nD.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser demanded Trump withdraw troops while Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., called Trump's use of National Guard troops \"an affront to our Constitution.\"\n\nDC MAYOR BROWSER UNVEILS 'BLACK LIVES MATTER PLAZA' NEAR WHITE HOUSE\n\n\"The administration's use of taxpayer dollars to deploy National Guard troops and transfer active-duty military -- and their refusal to provide details on these costs -- is unacceptable,\" Van Hollen said.\n\nThe DCPD said there were 32 injury reports filed between June 30, 2020, and Aug. 4, 2020, which will likely bump up the financial damage related to the protests.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nOn Friday, DC police said they arrested 41 people during Thursday night's protests in Adams Morgan on charges of felony rioting and assault on officers.",

He broke with his party in his attitude toward Trump supporters\n\nUnlike some of his Democratic primary rivals, Yang openly wooed President Trump's supporters and was reluctant to blame the nation's problems on the president.\n\n\"You are missing the lesson of Donald Trump's victory,\" he said during a February presidential debate. \"Trump is not the cause of all of our problems and we are making a mistake when we act like he is.

We should seriously look at 4-day workweeks.

        "body": "Dr. Manny Alvarez answers if mosquitoes can be a carrier of coronavirus and transmit the illness to another person\n\nMassachusetts health officials over the weekend announced a second person in the state has contracted a potentially deadly mosquito-borne virus.\n\nA woman in her 60s, from Hampden County, has become the state's second human case of Eastern Equine Encephalitis (EEE) virus, the Massachusetts Department of Public Health said in a press release. No other details were provided and the woman's condition is not currently clear.\n\nDANGEROUS MOSQUITO-BORNE EEE INFECTS MASSACHUSETTS MINOR; CASE MARKS FIRST OF THE SEASON: OFFICIALS\n\nEarlier this month, a minor had become the Bay State's first EEE case of the year. At the time, officials said a male under the age of 18 from Plymouth County was infected.\n\n\"EEE is rare, but it is a serious disease and public health concern, and we remind residents of the need to protect themselves from mosquito bites as EEE activity increases,\" said Public Health Commissioner Monica Bharel, in a statement when announcing the state's first case.\n\n\"The single best prevention tool continues to be avoiding mosquito bites by using repellent, wearing long sleeves and pants, weather permitting, and avoiding outdoor activity between the hours of dusk and dawn in the highest risk areas,\" she added.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) describes EEE as \"one of a group of mosquito-transmitted viruses that can cause inflammation of the brain (encephalitis).\"\n\nSymptoms typically appear about four to 10 days after a bite, with severe cases progressing to encephalitis. Patients may experience high fever, stiff neck, severe headache and lack of energy. Approximately one-third of patients who contract EEE will die, and there is no specific treatment for the virus. Health officials said the only way to protect against the virus to avoid being bitten by mosquitoes.\n\nOn average, five to 10 cases of EEE are reported each year, the CDC says. Last year, however, parts of the nation experienced the worst outbreak of EEE in more than 50 years, according to a report at the time.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nExperts said the outbreak may have been worsened by warmer-than-normal temperatures, as mosquitoes thrive in warm weather. It was also possible that a new strain of EEE was carried to the northeastern part of the country from birds -- which are immune to the virus but pass it to mosquitoes when the insects feed on them -- that migrated from Florida, a Massachusetts state epidemiologist said at the time.\n\nIn 2019, Massachusetts saw a dozen cases of EEE and six deaths, officials said.",

Check out what's clicking today in entertainment.\n\nMark Mothersbaugh, the frontman for Devo, first noticed symptoms of coronavirus in May, which led him to a mentally and physically exhausting stay in the ICU.\n\nThe musician, who turned 70 the same month he began experiencing symptoms, said the diagnosis and hospitalization made him feel 20 years older.\n\nMothersbaugh went into detail about the battle in a candid interview with the Los Angeles Times on Monday.\n\nCORONAVIRUS: WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW\n\nThe Devo frontman told the outlet his symptoms first started out as fatigue, which he attributed to his various work projects.\n\nTo his shock, he registered a 103-degree fever.\n\n\"A nurse came over the next morning and said, 'You should be in ICU.' I said, 'That's ridiculous.' She replied that she'd been a nurse for three decades: 'You need an ambulance right now,'\" Mothersbaugh recalled.\n\nHis wife, Anita Greenspan, also opened up to the outlet about the escalation of his symptoms.\n\n\"It went from, 'I don't feel good' on Tuesday to an ambulance to Cedars on Saturday. It was terrifying,\" she said.\n\nCORONAVIRUS IN THE US: STATE-BY-STATE BREAKDOWN\n\nMeanwhile, Mothersbaugh said his next-door neighbors were a group of TikTokers who continued to throw large parties, ignoring all social distancing guidelines.\n\n\"For anybody that's doubting whether the coronavirus and COVID-19 is real, it's really real,\" he said.\n\nIn the hospital, the \"Whip It\" singer began to experience a multitude of delusions. Some involved the creation of new music and going on tour, while others were \"very dark.\"\n\n\"I was convinced for about two weeks that I had been hit by a brick by somebody in Little Tokyo,\" he said. \"I felt blood from being hit. I was handcuffed to a parking deck downtown. I had this whole elaborate story of how these kids sold me to an ambulance company that then got some sort of a payment for delivering COVID patients to their ICUs. I totally believed it.\"\n\nKEVIN HART REVEALS HE TESTED POSITIVE FOR CORONAVIRUS 'AROUND THE SAME TIME' AS TOM HANKS\n\nIt was his wife and their children -- Hui Hui, 19, and Margaret, 16 -- that he said kept him alive amid points where he thought he was going to die.\n\n\"[There was] a time where I just felt exhausted. Like, 'I could just float down this river right now, and it would be really peaceful. It wouldn't be a freak out. It wouldn't be something I'd be scared of. I could really just do that.' I really thought about it,\" Mothersbaugh said.\n\nThe \"Rugrats\" scorer continued: \"And then it just happened that [Greenspan] called me, and she and the kids were on my phone, saying, 'You're getting out of there soon. Get off of that machine.' I don't know if everybody is lucky enough to have somebody do that for them.\"\n\nBRYAN CRANSTON OPENS UP ABOUT CORONAVIRUS RECOVERY, HANGING OUT WITH TOM HANKS AFTER SYMPTOMS SUBSIDED\n\nMothersbaugh stressed the importance of keeping in contact with loved ones if they are battling the virus in the hospital.\n\n\"It's easy to lose track of where you are and why you are. I had no idea I was on a ventilator for 10 days. Time meant nothing,\" he said of the isolation.\n\nThe Devo frontman is still experiencing side effects of his coronavirus diagnosis, including trembles and exhaustion.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"Before COVID, I was like, 'Yeah, I'm starting to feel about 50 now, and I'm 70.' When I was in the hospital, I was feeling like I was about 90. And now I'm back to 70, and I'm trying to get back to 50. That's my goal.\"",

Evidence also suggests that masks may offer some protection for the people wearing them.\n\nThe virus spreads from droplets people spray when they cough, sneeze or talk. Surgical or cloth face masks can block most of those particles from spreading.\n\nWhile some droplets may still spread out, wearing a mask could reduce the amount, providing a benefit to others. Research shows people don't get as sick when exposed to smaller amounts of virus, said Dr. Monica Gandhi, a virus expert at University of California, San Francisco.\n\nAnd masks may protect the people wearing them by reducing the amount of droplets from others that might make contact with them.\n\nIn two U.S. food processing plants where masks were required and infection clusters occurred, Gandhi noted that most workers who developed COVID-19 had mild illness or no symptoms.\n\nCORONAVIRUS CASES DISCOVERED IN MINKS ON UTAH FARMS, FIRST IN THE US\n\nResearch on a different coronavirus has also found low infection rates among people who frequently wore masks in public.\n\nExperts say masks are particularly important with the new coronavirus because infected people can be contagious even if they don't have symptoms.",

        "body": "Dr. Saphier's three questions for Biden's call for national mask mandate\n\nMask-wearing has become politicized since the coronavirus lockdowns began earlier this year. But here's the truth: all science, especially public health, is usually messy and our current situation is no exception. This week the debate over where and when to wear a mask became even more politicized.\n\nThursday, in only his second appearance since announcing Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., as his running mate, presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden declared, \"Every single American should be wearing a mask when they're outside for the next three months at a minimum.\"\n\nBiden himself has said science, not politics should influence decisions regarding COVID-19, yet his statement left a coronavirus weary nation with even more questions.\n\nKEVIN MCCARTHY TORCHES JOE BIDEN FOR REFUSING TO ANSWER REPORTERS' QUESTIONS ON MASK MANDATE\n\nGiven the urgency of the situation, it is important to articulate what an effective universal masking mandate would look like. Unfortunately, no questions were allowed at the event where Biden made his comments but here are three I have for the presidential candidate:\n\n1. What science is backing the decision that masks must be worn outdoors regardless of social distancing measures?\n\nAlmost all studies, at least that I'm aware of, have looked at the inside of buildings and little research has compared indoor transmission to what happens outdoors.\n\nAn unpublished study of 110 COVID-19 cases in Japan is one exception. It tested individuals then used contact-tracing to follow-up on secondary cases. The results showed that people were much more likely to catch coronavirus indoors. In fact, they suggest indoor transmission was 18.7 times greater compared to the open air.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nA team at the Department of Homeland Security Science and Technology Directorate in Washington, D.C. found that environmental conditions play a big part in how long virus particles in aerosols remain viable.\n\nSARS-CoV-2 in mock saliva aerosols lost 90% of its viability in 6 minutes of exposure to sunlight. This was compared to 125 minutes in indoor darkness.\n\nTheir overall conclusion was that indoor environments might be especially risky because they lack ultraviolet light and therefore have a greater ability to become more concentrated than if it were in sunlit outdoor spaces.\n\nIn fact, there are very few documented outbreaks associated with outdoor transmission.\n\nInstead, the major perpetrators are crowded indoor spaces, poorly ventilated areas and places where people are congregated talking loudly or even singing.\n\nSo, I ask you Vice President Biden, what science is guiding the mandatory wearing of masks outdoors when the current recommendations are already to wear masks if one cannot socially distance?\n\n2. If masks are necessary at all times when in public, will this force outdoor dining to close?\n\nThe economic consequences of shuttering restaurants to indoor dining have been devastating with many businesses closing their doors forever and leaving millions of Americans unemployed.\n\nWhen state re-openings allowed outdoor dining to resume, businesses were able to capture some lost revenue and provide jobs back to the American workforce; not to mention also providing a level of normalcy to patrons everywhere.\n\nIndoor dining remains banned in the New York City area and various other places because it has proved far riskier than outdoor dining. While there have been outbreaks linked to indoor dining, especially in bars, I have not heard of a major outbreak being traced to outdoor dining.\n\nSo, if outdoor dining has not been proven unsafe, would it be forced to cease regardless if masks are mandated at all times while outdoors?\n\n3. What metrics will you be considering when deciding to end or extend the mandate?\n\nWill it be based on the number of newly confirmed cases, confirmed and presumed positive cases, hospitalization rates or percent positivity?\n\nOr under a Biden administration would the mandate be to \"put on a mask until further notice\" and keep Americans in the dark about the end date for the plan?\n\nWe have already seen the consequences of civil unrest unfolding after stay-at-home orders and rampant unemployment, what else will ensue and how can you guarantee the legitimacy of the metrics you are monitoring?\n\nWhile I don't know how Vice President Biden would answer these questions. Here's my advice: Politics aside, as Americans we should do what we can to follow the science and not get caught up in the political t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate during an election year.\n\nIn the health care setting, universal masking was a key component that turned around transmission in a large hospital, as described in JAMA.\n\nOf course, other confounding interventions both in the hospital as well as in the community were also occurring -- such as canceling elective procedures, restricting visitors, and forgoing non-essential business travel so the mask mandate alone is difficult to gauge.\n\nHowever, many people who become infected can unknowingly spread COVID-19 because they have mild or no symptoms.\n\nSo, for the general public, wearing a mask is a way of tipping your hat to show respect for those around you and also contributing to help lessen the spread of the virus.\n\nThe CDC has discussed how face coverings decrease the amount of infectious virus exhaled into the environment, reducing the risk an exposed person will become infected.\n\nWe know that surgical masks are less effective and cloth face coverings even less however, even a 50% reduction in viral transmission is important in reducing community transmission.\n\nYou may remember a few months ago a story about how two hair-stylists working at a Great Clips salon exposed over 100 people to SARS-CoV-2.\n\nA complete investigation published in the CDC's Morbidity & Mortality Weekly Report found that none of the 139 persons exposed to the two infected stylists developed COVID-19. The most likely reason: both the hair-stylists and 98% of clients wore masks in addition to other safety precautions being adhered to.\n\nA well-crafted message addressing the common good could increase mask use and alter societal norms to improve compliance. The president himself even said wearing a mask was \"patriotic.\"\n\nDo we need another \"click it or ticket\" type mandate as we had for seatbelt safety or can we take individual responsibility while acknowledging this is temporary?\n\nAt a minimum, masks should be worn when indoors at public places and when outside and unable to socially distance (greater than 6 feet apart).\n\nWe should still be avoiding large gatherings and restricting our circles as much as possible so community transmission is lessened and our children can safely return to school and parents go back to work.\n\nWe are still in the middle of a global pandemic with many treatments and preventive innovations under development.\n\nBe patient. Be kind. Continue to do what you can to protect those around you.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nDoctors, scientists and the government have jobs to do, but so do all of the people of America.",

In fact, it's been used for nearly a century treating various conditions. It has proven safe in a large reputable observational study performed by the Mayo Clinic in the treatment of COVID-19. The people in the study who benefited the most from the treatment were those over 80 years old not on a ventilator, the most vulnerable.\n\nIt may not be the magic ticket to end the pandemic, but can it save lives if sufficient quantities of IgG are given early enough? Data from over 30,000 people in the study suggest so. And because of that, every American should be rejoicing.\n\nWhile there may be some people attempting to dampen the enthusiasm of the announcement, any treatment that is proving safe and potentially efficacious after being administered in over 70,000 Americans deserves praise. Convalescent plasma is currently being used across the country under an expanded access program but the EUA gives further access by cutting through potential administrative delays.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nSince convalescent plasma treatment involves giving donated plasma with antibodies from patients who have recovered from COVID-19, it is imperative that people who have recovered from the illness donate to help others. Otherwise, there is a high likelihood that we will have a shortage of the treatment and many people will no be able to benefit from it.\n\nIn a similar vein, as we move forward exploring antibody therapy, monoclonal (lab manufactured) antibodies (mAbs) are declaring their role in treating COVID-19. Specifically, Leronlimab, created by a lesser-known biotech company CytoDyn, is currently enrolling two placebo-controlled double-blind clinical trials that have already entered Phase 3. Phase 2 results reported in July passed all safety checks.\n\nOriginally manufactured as an investigational injectable for HIV, Leronlimab is also demonstrating an ability to prevent and/or lessen the cytokine storm that causes much of the severity in COVID-19 symptoms. Albeit a small sample size, early Phase 1 results showed patients on Leronlimab experienced 63% less seriously adverse events than the control group, while also demonstrating reduction in viral load to zero after 14 days.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nWhile all of this is promising, Phase 2 efficacy data has not been released yet. If that data demonstrate similar results to Phase 1, an EUA may be in the near future for this medication while Phase 3 enrollment is ongoing.\n\nAs children head back to school and outbreaks are still occurring, it is hopeful that we are making progress on the treatment front and the FDA is doing what it can to expedients safe treatments. For the over 1 million Americans who have already recovered from COVID-19, please consider donating your plasma today so that this potentially life-saving treatment can be readily available nationwide.",

        "body": "New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo has called for a SWAT team to help officials at State University of New York at Oneonta cut down on the surging number of coronavirus cases.\n\nThere's plenty of room for disagreement and debate in our society. But one thing has become clear: Masks reduce COVID-19 spread and save lives.\n\nIf we all wear a mask when we're around others, particularly indoors, we'll all be safer and we'll get more of our economy back sooner. My initiative, Resolve to Save Lives, just published a review on the facts and best practices on mask use.\n\nThis hasn't always been clear. We've never encountered the virus that causes COVID-19 before. Back in February and March, we learned that COVID-19 behaves very differently from most infectious diseases. Usually, the sicker you are, the more infectious you are. Surprisingly, that's not how COVID-19 works.\n\nFOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE JUNE, THIS STATE ANNOUNCED LESS THAN 2,000 NEW CORONAVIRUS CASES\n\nYou're most infectious at the start of the illness, even before you feel sick. I'm an infectious disease doctor, and that was startling.\n\nIt's not too late for us to get back on the right track to save lives and our economy by wearing masks consistently and correctly.\n\nMy particular area of experience is tuberculosis. With tuberculosis - as with SARS, which is closely related to COVID - patients who are very sick are the most infectious. This surprising finding, along with supply shortages of medical and surgical masks, was one reason for conflicting recommendations early in the pandemic, and one reason for continuing confusion.\n\nIf you get infected, you may never know it. You may never feel sick, or get such minor symptoms that you wave it off as a slight cold or allergies. But you could still be highly infectious.\n\nYou could pass the infection to someone else, who could then pass it on further, to a parent or grandparent or someone with cancer. They might get very sick and die, as nearly 200,000 Americans already have.\n\nOne way to help stop COVID is for everyone to wear masks in public places whenever they're within 6 feet of others, particularly indoors.\n\nMasks prevent spread, and places in South Carolina and Kansas among others that require people to mask up have greatly reduced new cases.\n\nIf we had been wearing masks all along, there could have been a hundred thousand fewer deaths, millions fewer lost jobs and businesses, and a faster economic recovery. Masks are one of the least expensive and most effective ways of getting more of our lives back, faster.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nIt's not too late for us to get back on the right track to save lives and our economy by wearing masks consistently and correctly. Masking up requires all of us to work together. We have a common enemy - the virus. When all of us wear masks, all of us are safer.\n\nSome people believe that being forced to wear a mask is an infringement of their rights. In fact, you don't have to wear a mask - as long as you don't get near other people outside of your family.\n\nThe virus spreads more indoors, in poorly ventilated spaces, when people sing, shout, cough, or sneeze - this is why masks are so important indoors when near others. We won't have to wear them forever, just long enough for us to get the virus under control.\n\nWearing a mask won't solve everything, but it will let us start doing more, and, as cases continue to drop, even more.\n\nAs more people wear masks, there will be less disease spread. More of our society and economy can re-open, and there will be less risk of having to shut back down because of an outbreak.\n\nIn countries where people started wearing masks correctly and consistently early in the pandemic, just about everything except very large indoor events has reopened. These places still have new cases, but they've been reduced to such low numbers that the virus is under control. Localized outbreaks can be stopped without having to resort to widespread closures.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nMasks don't have to separate us from other people, they can help bring us closer together. Properly worn - over the nose and down to the chin, fitting tightly - they simply separate us from the virus.\n\nTo fight COVID-19, we also need coordinated action by governments and communities. But all of us can do our part by wearing a mask. It's simple, inexpensive, and will help get our economy running again - and get back our freedom to once again do the things we most want to.",

But she's not afraid of catching the love bug.\n\n\"Having that buddy to kinda, you know, brave through the pandemic with and tackle the grocery store hassles and whatnot, is really important,\" said Agudo.\n\nNEIGHBOR ADVISES WOMAN DUMP HER CHEATING BOYFRIEND VIA BRUTAL NOTE ON CAR\n\nGone are the days of meeting potential partners at social events or through friends. In response, more people are turning to matchmakers and dating apps to find love.\n\n\"This guy, he is marked as 'socially distant,' he is looking for a relationship, he likes dogs,\" Agudo explains, while scrolling through her potential matches on Tinder and Bumble.\n\nThese apps are providing updated features, like the \"socially distant\" tag, as well as information on health screenings and the facilitation of video dates. Users say video dates provide a zero-contact way to suss out any dealbreakers before deciding whether or not to meet up.\n\n\"I ask them when they last got tested, have they had COVID. Like, are they having any symptoms?\" Agudo said.\n\n\"A lot of people have switched their pictures to incorporate masks,\" she added. \"A lot of people have changed their captions to some corona-friendly statements, such as, 'Hit me up for toilet paper,' or 'Need Clorox wipes? Got you covered...'\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER\n\nBut there is a silver lining to virtual dating, she claimed. There's fewer first-date jitters, and daters have more time to get to know each other. And more people are apparently open to the idea than ever before: A recent study by Match.com shows that nearly 1 in 4 people would become exclusive with someone they have never met in person.\n\n\"You're forced to have these deep conversations and ask them about their values. Ask them what they like to do in their spare time, their hobbies, and then decide ... OK, do I want to risk meeting them in person while staying six feet apart? Maybe. Or is this someone that ... isn't worth it,\" Agudo said.\n\nAgudo said deciding to meet up in person takes much longer than before. Daters often go back-and-forth on whether or not they want to take that risk, she claims.\n\n\"Now, if you get to that point of seeing them in person, it is kind of like a big reveal,\" she said. \"It's like a bride when they undo the veil at the altar. It's similar to that in a weird way, where it's like you're unveiling yourself by taking off your mask and seeing them for the first time.\"\n\nMiami-based matchmaker April Davis founded Luma matchmaking and said she has helped thousands of people find love.\n\n\"We're really realizing, hey, I don't want to go through this pandemic alone, I want to find that person,\" said Davis.\n\nShe claimed, even during a pandemic, business is booming.\n\n\"We actually had our busiest July ever, which is interesting because usually, July is really slow for us. But it was our busiest month so far this year, which is incredible,\" Davis said.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR FOX NEWS' CONTINUING CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE\n\nDavis said safety is also a priority for her agency and they are taking the same precautions as dating apps. She gives her clients camera-ready tips ahead of time, and advice on how to put their best virtual foot forward.\n\n\"Now, more than ever, people are interested in each other's health and well-being. We've had people even say, 'OK, I will go on a date with you as long as you go and get a COVID test and if it comes back negative and I'll meet you in person,'\" Davis said.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nEven though the world may be on pause, Agudo is not letting that stop her from finding her person, saying, \"Yeah, pandemic dating is hard, but hasn't dating always been difficult?\"",

The patient did not display symptoms from the second infection, which suggests that \"subsequent infections may be milder,\" per the Japan Times.\n\n\"Before this report, many believe that recovered COVID-19 patients have immunity against reinfection, however, there is evidence that some patients have a waning antibody level after few months,\" the researchers from the University of Hong Kong said in a statement to the outlet.\n\n\"Our results prove that his second infection is caused by a new virus that he acquired recently rather than prolonged viral shedding,\" Dr. Kelvin Kai-Wang To, a clinical microbiologist at the university, told the New York Times.\n\nThe World Health Organization weighed in on the study, according to the Japanese Times, which noted the WHO's technical lead Maria van Kerkhove told reporters that documenting cases like this one is important.\n\nHowever, she cautioned \"not jump to any conclusions,\" noting that larger studies of cases over time are needed to gain a better understanding of a patient's antibody response to Sars- Cov-2, the novel coronavirus.\n\nInfectious disease specialists told Fox News there been some reported anecdotal accounts of possible reinfection, but this is the first report involving a scientifically proven case.\n\nDr. Ravina Kullar, an infectious disease specialist in California, said the report is concerning.\n\n\"There have been prior reports of presumed reinfection, but none of those cases have been confirmed with rigorous testing,\" Kullar said.\n\nKullar, also a member of the Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA), explained patients who recover from the novel coronavirus can shed viral fragments for weeks, giving some tests a positive result even though the virus is no longer live. But the 33-year-old man's case is a different scenario, Kullar noted.\n\n\"This report sequenced the virus from both rounds of infection and found differences in both sets of the virus, showing that the patient may have been infected a second time. This may support the finding that some patients [who] get infected with COVID-19 have diminishing antibody levels after just a few months,\" she said.\n\nMUTATED FORM OF CORONAVIRUS MAY BE MORE CONTAGIOUS, BUT LESS DEADLY, EXPERTS SAY\n\nDr. Aaron Glatt, an epidemiologist on Long Island, New York, made a similar statement, telling Fox News this case is significant since the reinfection of the virus was \"a different strain of COVID-19, making it unlikely that it was just persistent dead virus from the first illness still being detected.\"\n\nGlatt, also a member of the IDSA, cautioned to keep the findings in perspective.\n\n\"While it clearly suggests what we suspected -- that COVID-19 immunity might not be lifelong -- it must be appreciated that this is the first case after 20,000,000 plus cases of COVID-19 worldwide. So while it is critically important to realize immunity may not last forever, at least in the short term, immunity is actually quite good,\" he said.",

However, these early days of navigating educational instruction amid the COVID-19 pandemic are providing schools with new challenges.\n\nATLANTA PUBLIC SCHOOLS POSTPONE FIRST DAY OF SCHOOL, MANDATE CORONAVIRUS MASKS FOR STUDENTS\n\nCherokee County School District officials announced Tuesday that a teacher at Sixes Elementary School near Canton and 20 other students were sent home to quarantine and learn online for 14 days after a student tested positive for the virus.\n\nOfficials said the teacher has shown no signs of COVID-19 symptoms, FOX5 Atlanta reported.\n\nMeanwhile, Cherokee and Paulding schools have faced questions over their mask-optional policies.\n\nIn Cherokee County, dozens of seniors gathered at two of the district's six high schools to take the traditional first day of school senior photos, with students squeezing together in black outfits. No one in pictures at Sequoyah High School in Hickory Flat or Etowah High School in Woodstock wore a mask.\n\nCherokee County school district spokesperson Barbara Jacoby said the pictures weren't a sanctioned activity and officials only became aware when the photos were posted on social media.\n\nIn Paulding County, student pictures taken Monday and Tuesday show crowded hallways at North Paulding High School in Dallas. Many students were not seen wearing masks.\n\nPaulding County Superintendent Brian Otott wrote in an email Tuesday that the pictures were accurate, according to The Associated Press, adding that the district is following state guidelines.\n\nHe said class changes are \"a challenge\" and that \"it is an area where we are continuing to work on in this new environment to find practicable ways to further limit students from congregating.\"\n\nHe added that \"there is no question that the photo does not look good,\" but defended the district's decision not to require masks, writing that \"wearing a mask is a personal choice and there is no practical way to enforce a mandate to wear them.\"\n\nCHASTITY MILLIGAN: SCHOOLS NEED TO REOPEN FOR IN-PERSON CLASSES -- VIRTUAL EDUCATION A POOR SUBSTITUTE\n\nBoth districts are giving parents the option of five-day-a-week classes or online learning. In Cherokee, 22 percent chose to learn remotely, while 30 percent of students chose it in Paulding, The Associated Press reported.\n\nOther school districts in the state are having students begin the year with remote learning.\n\nThe 180,000-student Gwinnett district said it would start instruction all-virtual on Aug. 12. It later announced that kindergartners, first graders, sixth graders, high school freshmen, and certain special education students would be back to school as early as Aug. 26, with other grades following in phases.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nGwinnett and Cobb County, which also announced all-virtual classes, have faced protests from parents demanding in-person classes.",

        "body": "A recent survey identified dozens of potential long-term coronavirus symptoms that had previously been unreported, including hair loss.\n\nThe study was conducted by a doctor at the Indiana University School of Medicine and the grassroots COVID-19 survivor group Survivor Corps using a Facebook poll. While the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recently identified only 17 persistent COVID-19 symptoms, the survey of more than 1,500 patients found 98 possible symptoms, according to Dr. Natalie Lambert, an associate research professor at the Indiana University school of medicine.\n\n\"The new symptoms our study identified include severe nerve pain, difficulty concentrating, difficulty sleeping, blurry vision and even hair loss,\" Lambert said in a written statement.\n\nCORONAVIRUS: WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW\n\nThe CDC has identified fever or chills, cough, shortness of breath, fatigue, muscle or body aches, headache, loss of taste or smell, sore throat, congestion or runny nose, nausea or vomiting and diarrhea as symptoms that may appear between two and 14 days after exposure to the virus.\n\nMore than a quarter of the new survey's reported symptoms - 26.5% - were painful, according to the report. They included some of the same symptoms identified by the CDC, plus others like heartburn, back pain and chest pain.\n\nThe rest of the symptoms were painless, including nearly a third of respondents who reported hair loss. Other reported symptoms included memory problems, anxiety, dizziness and blurry vision, among others.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nOne member of the group who said she contracted COVID-19 in early April estimated she had lost 75% of her hair and wrote that she planned to get a wig.\n\n\"My face already looks more aged since contracting the virus but still I'm resilient,\" she wrote. \"I'm not sure if my hair will ever return back the same.\"\n\nThe American Academy of Dermatology is also tracking \"dermatologic manifestations\" of the coronavirus. The group has already warned of people with the virus developing a rash or \"COVID toes\" that are swollen and discolored.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER\n\nDr. Esther Freeman, who's leading the academy's efforts on the coronavirus, told Today.com that they have also seen an increasing number of hair loss cases.\n\nThe hair loss may be tied to a condition called telogen effluvium, according to the report. It causes people who experience a stressful illness or other life event to shed hair. Telogen effluvium hair loss typically starts about three months after the stressful event, which Freeman told Today would coincide with the pandemic's peak.\n\nWhile there's still a lot to learn about COVID-19, many members of the Survivor Corps group have reported difficulty in getting help from their doctors to manage less common coronavirus symptoms.\n\nWhile Facebook is not typically used as a basis for medical studies, Lambert said the Survivor Corps group was valuable for crowdsourcing experiences.\n\n\"Until there is more research that helps us to understand why these long-term symptoms are happening and how to treat them, thousands of long haulers will continue to suffer at home; both from painful COVID-19 symptoms and uncertainty about when they will feel well again.\"",

What's worse, 12,000 cases reported were among children age 5 or younger.\n\nTHE FDA NOW INCLUDES 75 'TOXIC' HAND SANITIZERS ON ITS LIST OF PRODUCTS TO AVOID\n\nOne major problem poison control centers noted is consumers are using hand sanitizers that are too highly concentrated with methanol, which can be toxic when consumed or absorbed through the skin. Sanitizers become harmful when they contain too much methanol and not enough ethyl alcohol (the main ingredient that can kill germs and viruses), according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in July put out a public warning about methanol-contaminated hand sanitizers.\n\n\"If soap and water are not readily available, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend consumers use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60 percent ethanol (also referred to as ethyl alcohol),\" the FDA advises on its website.\n\nHERE'S THE CORRECT WAY TO USE HAND SANITIZER, ACCORDING TO THE CDC\n\nPeople exposed to high doses of methanol may exhibit symptoms of headache, blurred vision, nausea and vomiting, and in more severe cases, permanent blindness and seizures. The poisoning can occur on the skin and when consumed, the latter of which is one of the biggest risks among children.",

It will also give the State Department of Health access to the passenger health information and can be used by the Department of the Attorney General and county law enforcement officials to enforce quarantine rules.\n\nTravelers are urged to input their information and trip details ahead of their flight. They'll then receive a QR code 24 hours later via email they can print or scan via a mobile device for the airport screener in person on arrival.\n\nA mandatory 14-day quarantine is still in place for out-of-state travelers to curb the spread of COVID-19 while a partial interisland quarantine was also reinstated on Aug. 11.\n\nIge announced earlier this month that the state will not open to tourism until at least October.\n\nAs of Sunday, 8,339 cases of the novel coronavirus have been reported in the Aloha State, per the Hawaii State Department of Health.",

The estimate of rally turnout is typically released by the city each year and based mainly on the weight of the trash generated.\n\nWhile a few people wore masks and some said they were avoiding crowds, many others packed close together at bars and rock shows.\n\nSTURGIS RALLY ROARS AHEAD DESPITE CORONAVIRUS CONCERNS\n\n\"Everybody's still partying hardy,\" said motorcyclist Kevin Lunsmann, who rode more than 600 miles to the rally from Minnesota.\n\nSome of the Sturgis crowd is deemed to consist of people in the age range at the most risk to suffer complications from the virus.\n\nThe mass gathering has raised concerns it could become an epicenter of infections.

The insect repellant was applied to a liquid drop of the virus and then to a synthetic skin made of latex.\n\nMUTATED FORM OF CORONAVIRUS MAY BE MORE CONTAGIOUS, BUT LESS DEADLY, EXPERTS SAY\n\n\"One minute liquid suspension tests indicated that Mosi-guard Natural\u00ae has anti-viral activity against SARS-CoV-2 England-2 isolate if mixed with the virus in the liquid phase.

If it were 20 times higher as Mahboobfar suggests, it would mean a death toll of more than 360,000 people.\n\nA Health Ministry spokeswoman rejected the allegations and said Mahboobfar had no role in the government's anti-coronavirus campaign: \"The Health Ministry is not a political body and health of people is its main priority.\"\n\nIRANIAN PRISONERS RIOT, SMASH CAMERAS AS COUNTRY'S CORONAVIRUS DEATH TOLL RISES\n\nThe regime in Tehran has come under significant criticism for its handling of the virus, and Iranian resistance groups have longed claimed that the Iranian regime has delayed reporting of the virus and that the death toll is significantly higher.\n\nThe National Council of Resistance of Iran (NCRI), said that the alleged coverup of the coronavirus is part of the \"deception, denial and duplicity\" that it says is part of the regime's DNA.\n\n\"The regime is terrified of the eruption of a mass uprising, similar to the November 2019 nationwide protests, which it barely managed to contain by murdering in cold blood 1,500 protesters,\" Ali Safavi, an official with the NCRI's Foreign Affairs Committee told Fox News. \"To this end, the mullahs have tried to exploit the COVID-19 and the strategy of mass casualties as a barrier against the eruption of society. But this will prove futile.\"\n\nThe NCRI published documents in April that it says shows that Iran had multiple cases in late January.\n\nThe documents consist of mission reports from the government's National Emergency Organization, and carrying the emblem of the country's Health Ministry, that outline multiple suspected cases of the virus - all from the Chinese Embassy in Tehran. In those cases, the reports note that they showed symptoms of the coronavirus, and their colleagues had symptoms as well.\n\nOne of those documents, according to the NCRI's translation, was a 37-year-old woman with signs of coughing and a cold. The document was dated Jan 28. The regime said that it didn't have its first case until Feb. 19.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe NCRI contrasted that information with claims by Iranian officials in early February that there were no coronavirus cases in the country. They also claim the information was suppressed in order to ensure participation in the February elections - which resistance groups called on Iranians to boycott.",

        "body": "University of Kentucky President Dr. Eli Capilouto joins 'America's Newsroom' to explain how the process works and what happens if someone tests positive.\n\nThe fall semester is just around the corner, and with this school year starting during a global pandemic, it presents some unique challenges for both parents and students. For every parent who isn't concerned, there are those who are worried and confused about sending their students back to college.\n\nAs president of Southeastern University, I'm aware there are many valid concerns parents have over complications that the coronavirus may present. On our campus, we've had parents calling in and asking, \"Is it going to be safe for my student to return?\" and \"How can my child socially distance in a dorm room?\" and \"Are there other options for students who don't wish to return to campus?\"\n\nWhile there are endless questions and concerns filling parents' heads, there are several ways universities are preparing for students to return to new protocols and standards to meet the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommendations and ensure student safety.\n\nYALE UNIVERSITY STUDENT SUES OVER 'INFERIOR' ONLINE CLASSES DURING PANDEMIC, SEEKS TUITION REFUND\n\nLast week, the Chronicle of Higher Education released the latest updates on the reopening plans for institutions moving forward toward the fall. While 24% of colleges and universities prepare to teach primarily online, 21% will meet primarily in person, 16% will be hybrid, 12% taking other options, and 27% are still left to be determined.\n\nThere are a variety of different approaches depending on the campus. Early last month, Harvard University announced they would only return 40% of their undergraduate students. The University of Texas at Austin will only allow a capacity of 40% in each classroom. Georgetown University will only allow 2,000 students to return in the fall, a majority of them are freshmen along with students who cannot pursue remote coursework and residential assistants.\n\nOverall, universities who are bringing students back to campus are making their preparations by following the guidelines laid out by the CDC. At Southeastern University, we have been creating our plan for the fall since our students returned home in March.\n\nSome of our new procedures moving forward include masks in all communal areas, including classrooms, continually monitoring symptoms for COVID-19, reduced capacity in the classroom and offering classes in hybrid models to accommodate social distancing. We are also putting a heavy emphasis on teaching our students to be \"healthy citizens.\"\n\nBut for most schools like ours, the development of these new protocols is being fine-tuned each day. As universities are making preparations to meet parents' concerns and remain up to par with CDC guidelines, there are also many ways parents can prepare their students to navigate this pandemic.\n\nBefore you begin driving out to campuses or sending your children off to school this fall, there are essential ways to prepare them to safely and wisely navigate college amid a pandemic. Here are three things you can do to prepare your student before returning to school:\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nTrain them to be safe. Teach your children how to sanitize their surroundings, their things and themselves regularly. Also, instill simple reminders such as an appropriate use of masks. It is good to remind and encourage your children to use masks to keep themselves safe as well as to remain considerate of the health of those around them. Encourage them to steer clear of high-risk environments such as theaters, concerts and other prominent attractions.\n\nEquip them to stay connected. While you're encouraging them to remain socially distant, you also want to encourage them to stay socially connected. Help your children avoid isolation this year. Search extra-curricular groups and activities on campus to engage the campus community this year. Discuss ways to engage new relationships, invest in their communities and also encourage the connection of a spiritual community early on. Help them to search out local churches and other faith-based communities -- even if they are still streaming services online so they can connect with a small group in the area via Zoom.\n\nAssure them of your support. Seek to continue to give your children moral and emotional comfort throughout this time. At least every other day, whether through text, call or email, find moments to touch base with your children. Send them periodic care packages, cards or gifts. (There's not much worse than an empty school mailbox.) Call them and ask them a great question or two, and then take time to truly listen to how they are doing.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nAs parents, we want to take every measure to protect our children. In this season, parents want to take the proper precautions to avoid any harm that may come to them. It's easy to be overcome by our worries and concerns about the future, but we never want to place our fears on our children. Instead, we can help them prepare to make the wisest and healthiest decisions possible this semester.\n\nIn many ways, this will be a team effort for schools, students and parents as we step forward into a new academic year. Of course, it is vitally important that parents are adequately informed of new protocols and ensure that their children return safely to campus this fall. By equipping your children with the proper safety measures and moral support, you can help give students the knowledge and confidence they need to navigate this pandemic and prepare for a safe return to school.",

        "body": "Dr. Peter Hotez reacts to President Trump's briefing on safely reopening schools\n\nJust as schools are reopening across the country, a new study is detailing how kids who have the coronavirus but don't show symptoms can still spread the infection for weeks.\n\nTwo Washington-based scientists made the discovery by analyzing South Korean kids who had been hospitalized because they tested positive for COVID-19 -- even though roughly four out of 10 had either no symptoms or only mild ones, German news outlet DW reported.\n\nCORONAVIRUS PROJECTION FOR US FORECASTS 317,697 DEATHS BY DECEMBER\n\nRoberta L. DeBiasi and Meghan Delaney analyzed the cases of 91 kids in 22 hospitals across South Korea because doctors there -- unlike in the US -- don't release patients until they are fully recovered.\n\nThe team found roughly a fifth of the kids never had symptoms; another fifth at first showed no symptoms, then developed mild ones; and three-fifths had symptoms from the start.\n\nDeBiasi and Delaney have found a big range in the time that kids can have COVID-19 symptoms -- from three days to three weeks. Half of the kids with symptoms and a fifth of the kids without symptoms were still spreading the coronavirus three weeks after they became infected.\n\nSALMONELLA OUTBREAK LINKED TO PEACHES EXPANDS TO 12 STATES\n\nTheir work, published Friday on the JAMA Pediatrics website, builds on a study out of Boston that found kids carry a lot of viruses, including the coronavirus.\n\nThe Boston researchers, who published their findings Aug. 1 in the Journal of Pediatrics, took nose and throat swabs from people under the age of 21. They found the kids had much higher levels of the coronavirus than adults who were in intensive care units with COVID-19 and far fewer ACE-2 receptors, which experts think are the infection's way of getting into the body.",

    "Large antibody study offers hope for virus vaccine efforts": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "Antibodies that people make to fight the new coronavirus last for at least four months after diagnosis and do not fade quickly as some earlier reports suggested, scientists have found.\n\nTuesday's report, from tests on more than 30,000 people in Iceland, is the most extensive work yet on the immune system's response to the virus over time, and is good news for efforts to develop vaccines.\n\nIf a vaccine can spur production of long-lasting antibodies as natural infection seems to do, it gives hope that \"immunity to this unpredictable and highly contagious virus may not be fleeting,\" scientists from Harvard University and the U.S. National Institutes of Health wrote in a commentary published with the study in the New England Journal of Medicine.\n\nOne of the big mysteries of the pandemic is whether having had the coronavirus helps protect against future infection, and for how long. Some smaller studies previously suggested that antibodies may disappear quickly and that some people with few or no symptoms may not make many at all.\n\nSCIENTISTS ARE GIVING DIY CORONAVIRUS VACCINES TO THEMSELVES AND SOMETIMES TO FRIENDS, FAMILY\n\nThe new study was done by Reykjavik-based deCODE Genetics, a subsidiary of the U.S. biotech company Amgen, with several hospitals, universities and health officials in Iceland. The country tested 15% of its population since late February, when its first COVID-19 cases were detected, giving a solid base for comparisons.\n\nScientists used two different types of coronavirus testing: the kind from nose swabs or other samples that detects bits of the virus, indicating infection, and tests that measure antibodies in the blood, which can show whether someone was infected now or in the past.\n\nBlood samples were analyzed from 30,576 people using various methods, and someone was counted as a case if at least two of the antibody tests were positive. These included a range of people, from those without symptoms to people hospitalized with signs of COVID-19.\n\nIn a subgroup who tested positive, further testing found that antibodies rose for two months after their infection initially was diagnosed and then plateaued and remained stable for four months.\n\nPrevious studies suggesting antibodies faded quickly may have been just looking at the first wave of antibodies the immune system makes in response to infection; those studies mostly looked 28 days after diagnosis. A second wave of antibodies forms after a month or two into infection, and this seems more stable and long-lasting, the researchers report.\n\nThe results don't necessarily mean that all countries' populations will be the same, or that every person has this sort of response. Other scientists recently documented at least two cases where people seem to have been reinfected with the coronavirus months after their first bout.\n\nCORONAVIIRUS: FACE SHIELDS OFFER LESS PROTECTION FOR OTHERS THAN REGULAR MASKS, STUDY FINDS\n\nThe new study does not establish how much or which type of antibody confers immunity or protection -- that remains unknown.\n\nThe study also found:\n\n-- Testing through the bits-of-virus method that's commonly done in community settings missed nearly half of people who were found to have had the virus by blood antibody testing. That means the blood tests are far more reliable and better for tracking spread of the disease in a region and for guiding decisions and returning to work or school, researchers say.\n\n-- Nearly a third of infections were in people who reported no symptoms.\n\n-- Nearly 1% of Iceland's population was infected in this first wave of the pandemic, meaning the other 99% are still vulnerable to the virus.\n\n-- The infection fatality rate was 0.3%. That's about three times the fatality rate of seasonal flu and in keeping with some other more recent estimates, said Dr. Derek Angus, critical care chief at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center.\n\nAlthough many studies have been reporting death rates based on specific groups such as hospitalized patients, the rate of death among all infected with the coronavirus has been unknown.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe news that natural antibodies don't quickly disappear \"will be encouraging for people working on vaccines,\" Angus said.",

They argued a flu shot mandate was a form of \"government overreach.\"\n\n\"They are forcing us to inject something into our child that we don't agree with,\" Mike Megna, a parent protesting, told Boston's WBZ-TV. \"This is about taking away the fears of COVID. I just think we should be able to choose what goes in my son's body. We can say 'yes' or 'no' and the government shouldn't say it for us.\"\n\nFLORIDA'S ORDER TO REOPEN PUBLIC SCHOOLS HALTED BY A JUDGE\n\nThe Massachusetts Department of Public Health said earlier this month that \"influenza immunization will be required for all children 6 months of age or older who are attending Massachusetts child care, pre-school, kindergarten, K-12, and colleges and universities.\"\n\n\"The new vaccine requirement is an important step to reduce flu-related illness and the overall impact of respiratory illness during the COVID-19 pandemic,\" the statement said.\n\nThough Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker, a Republican, said the flu shot mandate will help ensure the state's hospitals and health care resources don't become overwhelmed during the pandemic, Sunday's demonstration came amid fears officials would force the public to get vaccinated against COVID-19 when a new vaccine for the novel disease eventually comes to market.\n\nA Gallup poll published Aug. 7 found that about 35% of Americans -- about one in three people -- would not get a free, FDA-approved COVID-19 vaccine if it was ready today.\n\nThe flu shot mandate applies to some virtual learners in Massachusetts, and only K-12 students who are home-schooled and higher education students who are completely off-campus and engaged solely in remote learning may skip the vaccine. Some medical and religious exemptions may also apply.\n\n\"Every year, thousands of people of all ages are affected by influenza, leading to many hospitalizations and deaths,\" said Dr. Larry Madoff, medical director of DPH's Bureau of Infectious Disease and Laboratory Sciences. \"It is more important now than ever to get a flu vaccine because flu symptoms are very similar to those of COVID-19 and preventing the flu will save lives and preserve health care resources.\"\n\nMassachusetts students will be expected to have received a flu vaccine by Dec. 31, 2020, for the 2020-2021 influenza season. Students in kindergarten through 12th grade are already required to be immunized with DTaP/Tdap, polio, MMR, Hepatitis B and Varicella vaccines.\n\nIn regards to a new vaccine against COVID-19, Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, has said he would be \"pretty surprised\" if vaccination became mandatory for any part of the population.\n\nOther experts have raised the possibility of a vaccine being mandatory as part of an \"if/then\" proposition - in other words, someone can only do something if they are first vaccinated. For example, proof of vaccination could be required to engage in certain jobs, such as prison staff or line workers in meat processing plants. Some businesses, such as nursing homes and hospitals, might require vaccination for those who work with certain high-risk populations.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nIt also could be required to gain access to certain spaces, such as schools or sporting events, or to qualify for certain benefits, like the freedom to travel to other states without having to quarantine. These types of rules already exist, for example, in many universities, which require students living in dorms to be vaccinated against meningitis.",

COVID-19 tests taken prior to admission and two taken during her hospitalization were negative, Craig said in the article.\n\nMAINE HOSPITAL SEES CORONAVIRUS RESURGENCE AFTER VISITORS LEARN OF POSITIVE TEST RESULTS WHILE ON TRIP\n\nCraig told the media that a week had passed before doctors evaluated further and found the young mother had lung, ovarian and breast cancer. Pattison died June 27 in the hospital.\n\n\"If there's one thing Beth can leave as her legacy it's that people who have had a previous diagnosis of cancer are checked for it first before other causes are looked at,\" Craig said.\n\nPattison's family is pleading with the National Health Service to check for cancer as a priority if a patient has a history of the disease and not just assume it is COVID-19.\n\n\"Let's make sure the horrible disease hasn't come back. Get tested now. That's all we're asking,\" Craig said to the outlet.\n\nThe BBC said Newcastle Hospitals NHS Trust has been approached for comment and that Bridge End Surgery offered the family its condolences.\n\n\"As always, we would reiterate to people that if you're experiencing potential cancer symptoms, please get in touch with your GP practice,\" it said.\n\n\"We're not looking to blame any health professional because the care and support she received over four years was second to none and we think what the NHS has done, especially since March when the pandemic came along, has been superb,\" the father said.",

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.\n\nHealth authorities in New Zealand were scrambling Wednesday to trace the source of a new outbreak of the coronavirus as the nation's largest city went back into lockdown.\n\nAuthorities had confirmed four cases of the virus in one Auckland household from an unknown source and were awaiting the test results of four more people they suspect have infections -- two work colleagues and two relatives of those in the house.\n\nThe cases this week were the first known local transmission of the virus in New Zealand in 102 days.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR FULL CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE\n\nPrime Minister Jacinda Ardern said more than 200 people with connections to those in the house were contacted Wednesday.\n\n\"Our plan of mass testing, rapid contact tracing and, of course, our restrictions to stop the chain of transmission has been in full swing in Auckland today,\" Ardern said.\n\nDirector-General of Health Ashley Bloomfield said one of the people who tested positive works at an Americold food cold-storage facility in Auckland, which was being swabbed to check if it was a possible source of the infections.\n\n\"We do know from studies overseas that actually, the virus can survive in some refrigerated environments for quite some time,\" he said.\n\nCORONAVIRUS CASES APPEAR AGAIN IN NEW ZEALAND\n\nThe cluster came as an unpleasant surprise to many and raised questions about whether the nation's general election would go ahead as planned next month.\n\nBloomfield said two of the people who had tested positive had traveled to the city of Rotorua while suffering symptoms over recent days and had visited several tourist attractions.\n\n\"People in Rotorua and indeed around the country should be vigilant about their health and seek advice if they have symptoms,\" he said.\n\nAuckland was moved to Alert Level 3 at midday Wednesday, a designation initially set to continue through midnight Friday. That means that nonessential workers are required to stay home, while bars, restaurants and most businesses will be closed.\n\nThe rest of the country was moved to Alert Level 2, meaning that mass gatherings are limited to 100 attendees and people are required to socially distance themselves.\n\nHONEYMOON COUPLE STRANDED BY CORONAVIRUS RETURNS HOME BY HITCHING 5,000-MILE RIDE ON FISHING BOAT\n\nBloomfield said they would use genome sequencing as part of their effort to find the source of the new outbreak.\n\nPrime Minister Jacinda Ardern said she had worked quickly to impose the Auckland lockdown measures after first learning about the cases Tuesday afternoon.\n\nShe said Aucklanders were also \"strongly encouraged\" but not mandated to wear masks, and that authorities were releasing 5 million masks from a central supply. New Zealanders have not widely worn masks before, although authorities have been urging people to buy them or fashion them from scarves or bandannas just in case.\n\nThe nation's parliament was due to be dissolved Wednesday ahead of a general election on Sept. 19 as lawmakers hit the campaign trail. But Ardern said she was delaying the dissolution until at least Monday in case lawmakers needed to meet at short notice. She said she was also seeking advice about options for the election.\n\nNEW ZEALAND SUSPECTS ARMED WITH PIPE BOMBS FAIL TO BLAST OPEN ATM\n\nUnder New Zealand law, the government could delay the election for up to about two months. The main candidates have already canceled most of their planned upcoming campaign events.\n\nThe outbreak was found after a man in his 50s went to his doctor Monday with symptoms and was swabbed twice, testing positive both times. Three more people in his household tested positive later.\n\nThe case has health authorities scratching their heads, as the man had not recently traveled overseas and had no immediately apparent connection with infections contained at the border.\n\nUntil Tuesday, the only known cases of the virus in New Zealand were 22 travelers held in quarantine after returning from abroad.\n\nNew Zealand has been praised globally for its virus response and had just celebrated reaching 100 days without any known community transmission.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe South Pacific nation of 5 million initially got rid of the virus by imposing a strict lockdown in late March when only about 100 people had tested positive for the disease, stopping its spread.\n\nLife had returned to normal for many people as they attended rugby games at packed stadiums and sat down in bars and restaurants without fear of getting infected. But some had warned that the country had become complacent.",

        "body": "Heads up, consumers: The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced this week that another toxic ingredient has been found in some hand sanitizers sold in the U.S.\n\nThe FDA on Wednesday announced that certain hand sanitizers have tested positive for 1-propanol, a toxin that can depress the central nervous system.\n\nHERE'S THE CORRECT WAY TO USE HAND SANITIZER, ACCORDING TO THE CDC\n\n\"FDA is warning consumers and health care professionals about certain hand sanitizer products, including those manufactured by Harmonic Nature S de RL de MI in Mexico, that are labeled to contain ethanol or isopropyl alcohol but have tested positive for 1-propanol contamination,\" the federal agency states, noting that 1-propanol is not the same as isopropyl alcohol (also referred to as 2-propanol or isopropanol), which is a common ingredient found in hand sanitizer products.\n\nThe 1-propanol-containing products have subsequently been added to the FDA's \"do not use\" list of hand sanitizers, which now includes more than 100 such products. The list of unsafe hand sanitizers, including those that contain 1-propanol, can be found here.\n\nPer the federal agency, 1-propanol \"is not an acceptable ingredient for hand sanitizer products marketed in the United States and can be toxic and life-threatening when ingested.\"\n\n\"Young children who accidentally ingest these products and adolescents and adults who drink these products as an alcohol (ethanol) substitute are most at risk. Ingesting 1-propanol can cause central nervous system (CNS) depression, which can result in death,\" the FDA warns.\n\nConfusion, as well as decreased consciousness, slowed pulse and breathing are common symptoms of 1-propanol exposure, per the agency, which noted that animal studies have indicated that the central nervous system depressant effects of 1-propanol \"are 2 to 4 times as potent as alcohol (ethanol).\"\n\n\"Consumers who have been exposed to hand sanitizer containing 1-propanol and are experiencing symptoms should seek immediate care for treatment of toxic effects of 1-propanol poisoning. Skin or eye exposure to 1-propanol can result in irritation, and rare cases of allergic skin reactions have been reported,\"\n\nAnyone in possession of a hand sanitizer that contains 1-propanol should dispose of it in a hazardous waste container rather than flushing the product or pouring it down the drain.\n\nEarlier this month, the FDA added additional hand sanitizers to its do-not-use list over concerns they have \"concerningly low levels of ethyl alcohol or isopropyl alcohol,\" or the active ingredients found in hand sanitizers.\n\nTO PROTECT AGAINST CORONAVIRUS, CDC SAYS TO HAVE THESE 3 ITEMS ON HAND WHEN VENTURING OUT\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends using hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol, which it lists as one of the three essential items to have on hand when venturing out.\n\n\"The agency urges consumers not to use these subpotent products and has expanded its list to include subpotent hand sanitizers, in addition to hand sanitizers that are or may be contaminated with methanol,\" the FDA wrote at the time, referencing its rolling list of what now includes more than 100 \"dangerous\" hand sanitizers that have been recalled due to the presence of methanol, a toxic chemical.",

Look, players are a lot safer with us than they are running around at home. We have around a 2% positive ratio on our team since the Fourth of July. It's a lot higher than that in society. We act like these guys can't get this unless they play football. They can get it anywhere, whether they're in a bar or just hanging out.\"\n\nThe 2020 college football season is jeopardy this week due to uncertainty related to the pandemic.

This illness typically occurs when people consume food or water contaminated by feces. Symptoms can take up to a week to appear following the infection, per the CDC.\n\nAustin public health officials have not yet found a source of the local outbreak but stated that previous outbreaks have been linked to different fresh fruits or vegetables, including green onions, cilantro, raspberries and basil.\n\nRecently, the CDC warned that a cyclospora outbreak that affected multiple states was linked to a brand of bagged salad. That warning, from July, did not include Texas, however.\n\n\"While we may be in COVID-19 season, we cannot forget the other diseases and infections that are commonly present in our community,\" Janet Pichette, APH chief epidemiologist, stated on the APH website. \"And as we have said time and time again, there are ways to prevent many of these diseases and infections, including Cyclosporiasis - thoroughly wash fresh produce, wash your hands after handling fruits and vegetables, and separate produce from raw meat and seafood.\"\n\nIf you think you may have been infected, public health officials recommend writing down a list of foods you ate in the past two weeks and see your health care professional.

        "body": "Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease is a leading cause of chronic liver disease and, according to Dr. Juan Frias, affects nearly one in three U.S. adults. Frias is an endocrinologist with the National Research Institute in Los Angeles.\n\nFatty liver disease occurs when at least 5% of a person's liver weight is comprised of fat. When too much fat starts accumulating in the liver, the liver creates an immune response, attacking the fat and potentially resulting in scarring or fibrosis, Frias explained.\n\nPARASITIC INFECTION OUTBREAK IN TEXAS SICKENS 82 PEOPLE\n\nNot all patients with fatty liver disease experience symptoms, but severe scarring can lead to cirrhosis, which can worsen to end-stage liver disease, potentially necessitating a liver transplant.\n\nFatty liver disease is most common among people with obesity and Type 2 diabetes.\n\nThe CDC's list of medical conditions predisposing for more severe COVID-19 disease includes cancer, obesity, Type 2 diabetes, and serious heart conditions. Frias warns that patients in high-risk categories may have fatty liver disease as well.\n\nWhile it's unclear whether fatty liver disease itself raises the risk of more severe COVID-19 symptoms, or if the risk stems from the fact that these patients are usually older with other chronic medical conditions, Frias says these patients are currently at increased risk of having poorer outcomes.\n\n\"Diabetes and fatty liver commonly occur with obesity and that is a tough combination with battling COVID-19,\" Dr. Douglas Dieterich with Mount Sinai's Division of Hepatology, told Fox News.\n\nWHY SOME PEOPLE MAY NOT NEED 8 HOURS OF SLEEP, ACCORDING TO A NEW REPORT\n\nFrias advises those in high-risk categories, especially Type 2 diabetes and obesity, to have a discussion with their clinician about fatty liver disease.\n\n\"I think it's important to know if you have or don't have fatty liver disease, just like it's important to know if you have Type 2 diabetes,\" he said, adding that ultrasounds and blood tests can give an indication of fatty liver disease and also assess the degree of fibrosis, when applicable.\n\nFortunately, Frias says the liver is a \"forgiving\" organ, and losing about 7% to 10% of total body weight can restore a fatty liver to a healthier, normal state -- though the weight loss must be maintained, he warned.",

Women with BV are also at higher risk for contracting HIV or other sexually transmitted infections such as gonorrhea and chlamydia, both of which can lead to pelvic inflammatory disease.\n\nHealth experts say the risk for bacterial vaginosis can occur when there is a new sex partner or multiple partners, or with hygiene practices like douching. The CDC says symptomatic females may complain of pain, itching or burning in or around the vagina, burning during urination, and a strong fish-like odor, especially after sex. Recurrence is also a common complaint, health experts told Fox News.\n\n\"I was in and out of the gynecologist's office every two to three months,\" Mary, one patient who has suffered from BV, told Fox News. She asked for her last name to be withheld for privacy reasons.\n\n\"It became frustrating to suffer from this pain and irritation. I tried different treatments, including Metrogel, even boric acid suppositories, [but] nothing seemed to make it ever go away. I asked my doctor if it could be transmitted between my partner and me and if he could be treated. She said there was no real proof that treating my partner would be effective.\"\n\nThe new study could offer hope for women like Mary.\n\n\"This study also reminds us that BV is sexually transmissible and may explain why it is difficult to clear with topical and oral antibiotics - there is often reinfection or re-inoculation between partners,\" Dr. Anna Powell, from the Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, told Fox News.\n\n\"As a gynecologist who cares for many women with BV and other vaginitis concerns, I hear the frustration that accompanies this chronic and often relapsing condition. In my own practice I have counseled patients that there is still much we don't know about sex partner treatment to help relieve the index partner's symptoms,\" she said.\n\nThe physician, who is also a member of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologist, added: \"I would tell them this study certainly provides validation to the idea that both partners are involved, i.e. it's not just something the female partner is [or] isn't doing.\"\n\n\"Male sex partner treatment may be a new strategy,\" Dr. Supriya Mehta, an epidemiologist at the University of Illinois at Chicago and author of the study, stated in multiple reports.\n\n\"I would like for clinicians, researchers and the public to be inclusive of male sex partners in their efforts to improve women's reproductive health,\" Mehta added.\n\nMINNESOTA MOM DIES OF CORONAVIRUS, WEEKS AFTER GIVING BIRTH ON VENTILATOR\n\nThe study found BV occurred in 31% of the 168 couples studied, where the woman did not have BV at baseline, and 37.3% if the man was uncircumcised and 26.3% who were.\n\n\"Baseline penile microbiota accurately predicted BV incidence in women who did not have BV at baseline, with more than half of incident infections observed at 6 to 12 months after penile microbiome assessment. These results suggest interventions to manipulate the penile microbiome may reduce BV incidence in sex partners, and that potential treatment (antibiotic or live biotherapeutic) will need to be effective in reducing or altering bacteria at both the glans/coronal sulcus and urethral sites,\" the authors stated.\n\n\"While we can't draw firm conclusions on the exact antibiotic or pro-biotic regimen/duration, this study highlights that, yes, penile skin appears to be a reservoir for the bacteria that are associated with BV in women,\" Powell told Fox News, adding that there were limitations to the study and further research should be done to investigate these new findings.",

This may increase the risk of heart failure or other heart complications in the future,\" Mayo Clinic writes on its website.\n\nBig Ten Commissioner Kevin Warren cited potential complications with the heart and other medical unknowns related to coronavirus as a reason that the football season had to be postponed this fall.\n\nEIGHT NEBRASKA FOOTBALL PLAYERS SUING BIG TEN OVER POSTPONED SEASON\n\n\"There is simply too much we do not know about the virus, recovery from infection, and longer-term effects,\" Warren wrote to the Big Ten community on Aug. 19. \"While the data on cardiomyopathy is preliminary and incomplete, the uncertain risk was unacceptable at this time.\"\n\nThe Big Ten voted on Aug. 11 to postpone the season, with every school except for Nebraska, Ohio State, and Iowa voting in favor of postponement, according to ESPN. Eight Nebraska football players sued the Big Ten last month to try to invalidate the suspension of the season.\n\nPresident Trump tweeted Tuesday that he spoke with Warren about the Big Ten potentially reversing plans and playing football this fall.\n\n\"We had a very good conversation, very productive, and maybe we'll be very nicely surprised.

However, once the pandemic took hold of the United States, that figure spiked to 28% of respondents.\n\nUS DIVORCE RATES SKYROCKET AMID COVID-19 PANDEMIC\n\nHowever, while mental health effects in the aftermath of large-scale traumatic events are well-documented, lead author of the JAMA Network Open study Catherine Ettman, told HealthDay on Wednesday the researchers were \"surprised at the high levels of depression.\"\n\n\"These rates were higher than what we've seen in the general population after other large-scale traumas like September 11 and Hurricane Katrina,\" Ettman said.\n\nEttman further explained that because the results of the pandemic are a combination of fear, anxiety and disparate economic consequences, the virus has most negatively impacted front-line workers and marginalized U.S. residents.\n\nForty-seven percent of people with a household income of less than $20,000 and 41% of people with household savings under $5,000 said they had experienced symptoms of depression.\n\nAdditional stressors like the loss of a job or the death of a family member were also linked to those who confirmed these symptoms. Although, researchers were notably unable to investigate regional differences in depression.\n\n\"This calls for us paying attention to mental health problems that are arising at this moment that will need attention in the coming months and years,\" Ettman said.\n\nSuicide rates in the U.S. were on the rise before the pandemic, though experts worry that they could still be driven higher.\n\nAmid the pandemic, the FBI confirmed firearms sales have skyrocketed in recent months, with an estimated 2 million excess weapons purchased between March and May.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nEarlier this month, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said a panel survey of more than 5,400 people found that nearly 11% of U.S. adults reported seriously contemplating suicide in June.\n\nIf you or someone you know is in crisis, call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 800-273-8255, text HOME to 741741, or visit SpeakingOfSuicide.com/resources for additional resources.",

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.\n\nMultisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) has affected almost a dozen kids in Washington state so far this year, according to several reports.\n\nSince the start of the pandemic, a total of 11 children in the state have been diagnosed with the rare condition linked to the novel coronavirus, The Seattle Times reported.\n\n\"These kids feel terrible,\" Dr. John McGuire, chief of critical care at Seattle Children's, stated in an interview with the outlet. \"They're tired, weak, and achy, they have pretty high fevers. They feel completely wiped out.\"\n\nWHY CORONAVIRUS OCCURS LESS IN CHILDREN THAN ADULTS, ACCORDING TO NEW STUDY\n\nFortunately, McGuire said, all of the children have responded well to treatment.\n\nDoctors told Fox News that MIS-C seems to occur from a hyper-reactive immune response that has gone haywire after a child has contracted or has been exposed to COVID-19.\n\nDr. Roberto Posada, an infectious disease control expert from Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City, told Fox News in a recent interview that MIS-C \"occurs several weeks after the child was exposed to someone who had a coronavirus infection. Typically the child didn't have symptoms of COVID -19 but does show antibodies when tested.\"\n\nAccording to health experts, this often occurs two to four weeks after exposure.\n\nPosada stated MIS-C is a rare condition but most kids recover. \"It usually will present with high fever lasting several days, plus one or more the following: rash, red eyes, cracked or swollen lips, abdominal pain, vomiting or diarrhea,\" explained the pediatric infectious disease physician.\n\nAccording to a report released by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Friday, as of July 29, there have been 570 reported cases of MIS-C in the U.S. and 10 children have died. Of the 565 patients who underwent COVID-19 testing, \"all had a positive test result by RT-PCR or serology,\" the authors of the report stated.\n\nAMID CORONAVIRUS, IS IT SAFE TO SEND CHILDREN BACK TO SCHOOL? EXPERTS, PARENTS WEIGH IN\n\nThe children who showed acute symptoms of COVID-19 appeared to have less severe complications from novel coronavirus and only a small percentage have been affected by MIS-C. The federal health agency said in the report that nearly 36% of the MIS-C cases presented with abdominal pain, shock, cardiac dysfunction, and significantly elevated inflammatory markers along with positive COVID-19 test results. It also stated that over 64 percent of the MIS-C cases manifested symptoms that overlap with those of acute novel coronavirus and features similar to Kawasaki disease.\n\nOf the 570 patients, the CDC said 364 required a stay in the ICU. The average hospital stay was around 6 days.\n\n\"Distinguishing MIS-C from other severe infectious or inflammatory conditions poses a challenge to clinicians caring for children and adolescents,\" the authors of the CDC report wrote.\n\nAs the pandemic continues, health care professionals need to be aware of the signs and symptoms of MIS-C and to report cases to state and local health departments, federal officials said in the report.",

Many employees forced to work from their homes during the COVID-19 outbreak are also looking to buy or rent a spare studio apartment to work from, allowing them the space from loved ones so they can focus on their daily work tasks, according to a recent report.\n\nBut as people flock to find their new nests, health experts caution to be wary of a hidden danger to your health that could be lurking in the potential new home: mold.\n\nMORE AMERICANS SIGNED CONTRACTS TO BUY HOMES IN JUNE\n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, some people are sensitive to molds, and some studies suggest a potential link between early mold exposure and asthma development in children. Mold allergy symptoms typically include a stuffy nose, red itchy eyes or skin, and in some cases, wheezing and shortness of breath, according to the CDC.\n\nSeveral medical professionals attribute mold allergies to some patients' complaints of joint pain, autoimmune-related illnesses, and feelings of fogginess, among other symptoms.\n\nJennifer McCormick, a Maryland real estate advisor for Engel & Volkers Annapolis, told Fox News she recommends potential home buyers or renters to \"look for any suspected areas of mold growth and note items such as musty smells, standing water in basements or stains in a ceiling.\"\n\nA reputable home inspector is important as well, McCormick added.\n\n\"Their reports could state there is a leak in the roof or chimney, a grading issue where water runs into a basement or a vacant/foreclosed house that appears to have humidity issues because the power is off. The inspector may see that these situations could allow mold to grow,\" McCormick said, noting that based on the report, the buyer can then decide if they should bring in a professional mold inspector to determine if there is mold growth.\n\nLarry Jenkins, an environmental consultant and industrial hygienist in Maryland, told Fox News potential buyers or renters should look for clues when inspecting a home.\n\n\"Does this home have any odors in the lower levels?\" he said of a possible clue. \"There should be a consistently free odor in the home no matter what room is entered. The typical mustiness smell is an indication of water-damaged building material, hence mold.\"\n\nYOUNG CHILDREN WITH CORONAVIRUS MAY CARRY 10 TO 100 TIMES MORE OF VIRUS THAN ADULTS: STUDY\n\nJenkins pointed out another sign.\n\n\"Typically if a home for sale has been vacant for a while, the energy savings-minded people will cut back or eliminate the AC,\" which is \"not a good plan,\" he warned.\n\n\"AC serves to dry out the home and maintain proper humidity,\" he added.\n\nJenkins also cautioned to look for a pitch of the earth near the home's foundation.\n\n\"Don't be fooled by nice mulch around the perimeter of the home -- it can conceal a negative pitch which allows water to remain against the foundation and eventually affect the interior of the concrete or brick wall.\"\n\nThose who are concerned they have a mold allergy can contact their doctor to undergo a simple blood or skin test to find out. On its website, the CDC also states certain interventions can be done to improve housing conditions that may help reduce respiratory allergies and asthma.",

        "body": "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.\n\nThe hundreds of thousands of bikers who attended the Sturgis Motorcycle Rally may have departed western South Dakota, but public health departments in multiple states are trying to measure how much and how quickly the coronavirus spread in bars, tattoo shops, and gatherings before people traveled home to nearly every state in the country.\n\nFrom the city of Sturgis, which is conducting mass testing for its roughly 7,000 residents, to health departments in at least six states, health officials are trying to track outbreaks from the 10-day rally which ended on Aug. 16. They face the task of tracking an invisible virus that spread among bar-hoppers and rallygoers, who then traveled to over half of the counties in the United States.\n\nAn analysis of anonymous cell phone data from Camber Systems, a firm that aggregates cell phone activity for health researchers, found that 61% of all the counties in the U.S. have been visited by someone who attended Sturgis, creating a travel hub that was comparable to a major U.S. city.\n\nSTURGIS: AT LEAST 7 CORONAVIRUS CASES IN NEBRASKA TIED TO MOTORCYCLE RALLY, REPORT SAYS\n\n\"Imagine trying to do contact tracing for the entire city of (Washington), D.C., but you also know that you don't have any distancing, or the distancing is very, very limited, the masking is limited,\" said Navin Vembar, who co-founded Camber Systems. \"It all adds up to a very dangerous situation for people all over the place. Contact tracing becomes dramatically difficult.\"\n\nHealth departments in four states, including South Dakota, Minnesota, Nebraska and Wyoming, have reported a total of 81 cases among people who attended the rally. South Dakota health officials said Monday they had received reports of infections from residents of two other states -- North Dakota and Washington. The Department of Health also issued public warnings of possible COVID-19 exposure at five businesses popular with bikers, saying it didn't know how many people could have been exposed.\n\nSouth Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem, a Republican, has defied calls to cancel large gatherings and opposes requirements to wear masks. She welcomed the event, which in previous years brought in about $800 million in tourist spending, according to the state's Department of Tourism.\n\n\"I sat at a bar elbow-to-elbow with guys. No one was wearing masks,\" said Stephen Sample, a rallygoer who rode back to Arizona last week.\n\nHe had visited a bar where health authorities later issued warnings -- One-Eyed Jack's Saloon -- but said he had not had any COVID-19 symptoms. He discussed quarantining with his wife after he returned, but decided against it.\n\nIn a country where each state has been tasked with doing the heavy-lifting of responding to the pandemic, tracing every infection from the rally is virtually impossible. But the city of Sturgis is doing what it can to head off a local outbreak by holding mass testing for asymptomatic people.\n\nThe city, which is a sleepy tourist destination for most of the 355 days of the year outside of the rally dates, was a reluctant host this year. After many residents objected to the massive influx of people during a pandemic, city leaders decided to pay for mass testing from money they had received as part of federal coronavirus relief funding.\n\nOn Monday morning, Linda Chaplin drove with her husband to line up at the mass testing event in the parking lot of the Sturgis Community Center. They had left town during the rally, but the crowds that came before and after the event concerned them so they decided to get tested.\n\nWhile the results from the test will take a couple days to process, the region is already seeing an increase in coronavirus cases.\n\n\"For a long time, people would say, 'Well, do you know anybody that has COVID?' and I would say, 'No, I don't, but I'm watching the news,'\" Chaplin said. \"Now, I do know some people that we've heard have COVID.\"\n\nWhile Chaplin said the people she knows who have been infected had not participated in the rally, she said that many residents were relieved it's over.\n\n\"Once you get your town back and once the rally is over, it feels like the end of the summer is approaching, school is starting up,\" she said.\n\nThe local school district delayed the start of in-person classes this year in hopes it would give health officials time to contain an outbreak. The city also made coronavirus tests available for school staff, in addition to requiring city employees to get tested.\n\nHEALTH OFFICIALS WARN OF POTENTIAL CORONAVIRUS EXPOSURE AT STURGIS SALOON DURING RALLY\n\nAlthough the city arranged to have 1,300 tests available, about 850 people have signed up for tests so far, according to Danial Ainslie, the city manager.\n\nSome residents, like Eunice Peck, were not concerned about the potential for an outbreak. She rented her home out to rallygoers as a way to make extra money. She had avoided the crowds that fill the city's downtown and didn't feel the need to get a test.\n\n\"It's a very good thing for the town,\" Peck said of the rally.\n\nBut events like Sturgis concern health experts, who see infections growing without regard to city and state boundaries. Without a nationally-coordinated testing and tracing system, containing infections in a scenario like Sturgis is \"almost impossible,\" said Dr. Howard Koh, a professor at the Harvard School of Public Health who worked at the Department of Health and Human Services under former President Barack Obama.\n\n\"We would need a finely orchestrated national system and we are far from that,\" he said. \"We are really witnessing a 50-state effort with all of them going in different directions right now.\"\n\nKris Ehresmann, infectious disease director at the Minnesota Department of Health, on Friday advised people to quarantine for two weeks if they attended the rally.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nShe said, \"We're expecting that we're going to see many more cases associated with Sturgis.\"",

The states with the highest number of reported illnesses continue to be Minnesota and Michigan. States added in the update were Connecticut, Kentucky and Missouri.\n\nOfficials in Canada also previously issued a warning, saying the ongoing outbreak resulted in 33 illnesses in Ontario and Quebec.\n\nCompanies recalling the peaches, or products made with them, include Aldi, Food Lion, Hannaford, Kroger, Target, Walmart and Wegmans. The FDA said it is continuing its investigation to find other retailers who might have been sold the peaches.\n\nA new development on Thursday listed Russ David Wholesale and its recall of peach salsa and gift baskets with the recalled peaches. The CDC said the \"recalled peach salsa was sold under three brand names and labeled as 'Perfectly Peach Salsa.'\"\n\n\"If you have loose peaches and can't tell where they're from, throw them out,\" the CDC advised.\n\nSalmonella infections usually result in stomach cramps, fever and diarrhea up to six days after exposure. While most people recover without treatment, sometimes severe illnesses require hospitalization because the infection can spread from the intestines to the bloodstream and then elsewhere in the body.\n\nThe CDC recommends seeing your healthcare provider over concerning symptoms like high fever (above 102\u00b0F), blood in diarrhea and stool, or frequent vomiting.",

        "body": "Fox News senior correspondent Claudia Cowan reports on how people of color, including children who have contracted COVID-19, are the victims of the racial disparities in America.\n\nA trio of Democrats on Thursday introduced legislation to declare structural racism a public health crisis and to create a federal government center to tackle racial disparities in health care for Black communities and other minorities.\n\nSen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., teamed up with Rep. Ayanna Pressley, D-Mass., and Rep. Barbara Lee, D-Calif., to unveil their plan to require the federal government to begin actively developing \"anti-racist health policy.\" The lawmakers pointed to the coronavirus pandemic and police brutality \u2012 which has set off a summer of racial unrest in America \u2012 as reasons to pass the legislation.\n\nDEMS CALL FOR BREAKDOWN OF CORONAVIRUS CASES BY RACE, ETHNICITY\n\n\"It is time we start treating structural racism like we would treat any other public health problem or disease: investing in research into its symptoms and causes and finding ways to mitigate its effects,\" Warren, the former presidential candidate, said in a statement. \"My bill with Representatives Lee and Pressley is a first step to create anti-racist federal health policy that studies and addresses disparities in health outcomes at their roots.\"\n\nThe Anti-Racism in Public Health Act would create a \"National Center for Anti-Racism\" at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to research the health impacts of racism and create at least three regional centers in anti-racism to educate the public and to help coordinate better health care outcomes. The legislation would also create a \"Law Enforcement Violence Prevention Program\" at the CDC to combat police brutality.\n\n\"For far too long, our federal government has failed to recognize and address the structural racism that has devastated Black and brown communities and denied access to quality health care,\" Pressley, a member of the so-called Squad, said. \"With the COVID-19 pandemic unveiling and exacerbating racial disparities in health outcomes, it is time we recognize and treat structural racism and police brutality as the public health crises that they are.\"\n\nBLACKS HOSPITALIZED WITH CORONAVIRUS AT RATE FOUR TIMES HIGHER THAN WHITES, MEDICARE DATA REVEALS\n\nThe lawmakers said the coronavirus pandemic exposed racial inequities in the health care system that can no longer be ignored. The coronavirus is disproportionately infecting communities of color. And those who contract the virus are at increased risk for experiencing serious illness due to higher rates of certain underlying health conditions compared to Whites, research has found.\n\nPressley points to data in her own Boston district that found Black and Latinx people represent 65 percent of COVID-19 cases despite making up only about 44 percent of the city's population. But the full extent of the nationwide problem isn't known because the federal government doesn't adequately collect race data, the lawmakers said.\n\nMICHIGAN GOVERNOR WHITMER SETS UP CORONAVIRUS RACIAL DISPARITY TASK FORCE\n\n\"Many don't equate racism with health care, but countless African Americans and people of color have lost their lives as a result of being denied quality health care,\" Newport News Mayor McKinley L. Price, president of the African American Mayors Association, said in a statement. \"We must address the systemic racism that's rampant in our healthcare network, and collecting data on the problem is a good first step.\"",

This type of robust testing by our states has been a key factor in our success so far to flatten the curve in the tri-state area,\" the governors of New York, New Jersey and Connecticut said in a joint statement sent to Fox News.\n\n\"New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut will continue to follow the advice of health experts to contain and prevent the spread of COVID-19, and therefore will not be changing our guidance that prioritizes testing for this population,\" the statement continued.\n\n\"This 180-degree reversal of COVID-19 testing guidelines is reckless, and not based on science and has the potential to do long-term damage to the institution's reputation,\" the tristate governors added in the statement.\n\nFlorida and California reportedly don't plan on following the new recommendations, and Texas health officials told Fox News they share a similar sentiment.\n\n\"The current Texas guidance recommends testing for all close contacts of a confirmed case because it allows for early case identification among people who are at a higher risk of infection,\" a spokesperson for the Texas Department of State Health Services said in a statement to Fox News. \"There's not a planned change at this point, but we are always reviewing our guidance in light of new information about the disease and the situation in Texas to see if it needs to be updated.\"\n\nThe CDC faced criticism following the sudden reversal earlier this week.\n\nAsymptomatic people who came in contact with infected individuals \"do not necessarily need a test,\" the federal agency now states. Yet, a few lines down, the CDC also notes that it is \"important to realize that you can be infected and spread the virus but feel well and have no symptoms.\"\n\nPreviously, the CDC had recommended testing of people who had close contact with someone diagnosed with COVID-19 to help mitigate virus spread.\n\nThe change led to speculation that the federal health agency was pressured politically for the change.\n\nIndeed, the governors of New York, New Jersey and Connecticut questioned the reasoning behind the reversed decision.\n\n\"CDC and HHS have not shared their scientific rationale for this change in policy, which substitutes sound science-based public health guidance with the President's misinformation. This abrupt and ill-informed shift threatens the robust testing regimes our states have worked tirelessly to stand up with our federal partners,\" the joint statement said.\n\nHowever, following the changes, federal officials were quick to deny the accusations of political involvement in the decision.\n\n\"There is no direction from President Trump. This is evidence-based driven,\" said Adm. Dr. Brett M. Giroir, who is assistant secretary for health at the HHS, during a livestreamed media briefing Wednesday.\n\nFollowing the backlash, however, the CDC director, Dr. Robert Redfield, appeared to walk back the revisions, saying in a statement to Fox News that \"testing may be considered for all close contacts of confirmed or probable COVID-19 patients.\"\n\nCDC DID NOT GET ORDERS FROM PRESIDENT TRUMP TO CHANGE CORONAVIRUS TESTING GUIDELINES, HHS SAYS\n\nThat said, as of Friday morning the CDC site had not changed the new recommendations on its website.\n\nVarious health organizations, such as the Infectious Disease Society of America and the American Medical Association (AMA), are calling for the immediate reversal of the CDC coronavirus testing guidelines as the United States continues to have the most confirmed cases worldwide.\n\n\"Evidence has clearly indicated that asymptomatic persons play a significant role in transmissions. Identifying individuals infected with COVID-19 -- even if they are asymptomatic -- is critical to support appropriate isolation and identification of contacts, to limit spread, and to provide the data-driven, comprehensive view of community spread needed to inform effective public health responses,\" the IDSA said in a statement.",

        "body": "The Center for Disease Control &nbsp;(CDC) reversed it's coronavirus testing guidelines saying, testing may not be needed for some after exposure to the virus.\n\nKnowing when to get tested for the new coronavirus before seeing friends and family can be confusing, especially as the nation lacks a cohesive approach.\n\nLikely compounding any confusion is the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's recent change to its testing guidance, which led to widespread criticism and further uncertainty around COVID-19 testing in general.\n\nBut as the pandemic drags on, some may be experiencing so-called \"caution fatigue\" and feel emboldened to see friends and family whom they have been separated from for months -- making it important to understand the circumstances under which a COVID-19 test may be necessary.\n\n\"The challenge has been with testing -- it's not always easy to do and not always readily available in many areas,\" Dr. John Whyte, the chief medical officer of the healthcare website WebMD, told Fox News. \"You can't be waiting hours for the test and then days to get it back,\"\n\nDO YOU HAVE CORONAVIRUS 'CAUTION FATIGUE'?\n\nWhyte said he typically doesn't encourage testing if the person seeking the test doesn't have any symptoms of the virus, but he noted that there is at least one exception.\n\n\"The exception might be that if I was going to spend time with people that are at high risk or immunocompromised,\" he said.\n\nHe might also consider testing if test results could be returned in a couple of days before the interaction.\n\nBut if the test results take too long, or the interaction comes too long after the test, a negative result could become moot if the patient is subsequently infected.\n\n\"I also think we don't want to lull people into a false sense of security,\" he said \"If they test negative now, that doesn't mean they are going to be negative in several weeks if they don't continue to wear masks, wash hands, and physically distant.\"\n\nAdding to the confusion is how accurate some of the coronavirus tests are. Rapid tests, those that produce near-immediate results, are less sensitive than a traditional test that is sent to a laboratory and can take up to several days to receive a result.\n\nIndeed, there is a 75-80% detection rate for rapid testing compared to 90-95% with traditional, lab-based tests, Dr. Romney Humphries, the director of the Clinical Microbiology Laboratory at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, previously told Fox News.\n\n\"Some studies have shown that rapid tests miss low levels of virus,\" he has said. \"A patient may have low levels of the virus if they are early in the course of infection before the virus has had a chance to replicate itself, or at the end of infection when the infection is dying out.\"\n\nThe antigen test -- commonly known as the \"rapid diagnostic test\" after which results are provided in minutes to an hour -- detects specific proteins on the virus's surface. It's usually highly accurate, but it is more likely to miss an active infection compared to the molecular test, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.\n\nMeanwhile, the molecular test, also known as the RT-PCR test, nucleic acid amplification test or a NAAT or diagnostic test, detects the virus's genetic material and, depending on demand in the lab, typically takes a day or up to a week for results. This test is highly accurate and usually does not need to be repeated; however, those who have symptoms but have a negative rapid antigen test may require a molecular test to see there is indeed an active infection, according to the FDA.\n\n\"As it stands now, I think we trade off accuracy for speed,\" Whyte said. \"I think we will continue to improve these tests but that's also why being attuned to symptoms and practicing the public health strategies is the way to go for now. Ultimately, we need to do more surveillance testing to really see what's happening in the community.\"\n\nDr. William Schaffner, a medical professor at Vanderbilt University and medical director of the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases, told Fox News that testing could play a role in certain situations, using a family with young children visiting grandparents as a key example.\n\n\"Testing could have a role in this, though not so much for grandma and grandpa who have [likely] been sheltered at home,\" he said.\n\nBut Schaffner, like Whyte, expressed concerns over testing accuracy and providing a false sense of security to those who receive the test.\n\n\"I think you have to inquire on the front end how long it takes for the results to come back, it tells you what your status is on that day\" of the test, he said.\n\nWaiting up to a week for results is less useful.\n\n\"Every test has its limitations; more rapid tests coming on the market may be better, but are not widely available yet,\" he said.\n\nRapid test accuracy is better when they are used consistently over a series of days or weeks, as is the case for many professional athletes.\n\n\"If they're being done on a daily basis, then you reduce the chance of false negatives,\" he said. \"Repeated negatives over time have a greater chance of being negative.\"\n\nSo Schaffner encouraged families and friends who are hoping to see one another for the first time \"to have a conversation before they get together,\" especially if young children are involved.\n\n\"Have a conversation around the ground rules,\" he said. \"Will we permit hugs and kisses [from children to grandparents], or only hugs around the waist? What does together mean? Outside or inside? Will social distancing be maintained?\"\n\nSchaffner has had two family visits, which were big events. His family was together first time indoors, and everyone was spread apart, wore masks and stayed together for about an hour and a half, he said of the first family gathering.\n\nCORONAVIRUS IN THE US: STATE-BY-STATE BREAKDOWN\n\nThe second time, he said, his family came to sit near the pool outside, with the visitors at the opposite end of the pool as himself.\n\n\"They didn't go through the house, they walked around the house to the pool, and they stayed at one end and we stayed at the other. We did serve some meals, but rigorously [social distanced], and in any instances that we were not, we all used masks,\" he said.\n\nVisting family and friends is possible.\n\n\"You can do these things if you're careful,\" he said. \"Have a conversation with any children beforehand so they can participate in keeping grandparents safe. Acknowledge that they would like to hug and kiss, but can't this time.\"",

That is nearly double the percentage who did so last summer, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention stated.\n\nAccording to a report released Thursday, the CDC asked 5,412 participants in a survey if they seriously considered suicide in the 30 days preceding the survey performed the last week of June. The findings revealed that 10.7% of Americans reported contemplating suicide compared to 4.3% who reported the same thing throughout 2018. The study also found that 40% of Americans reported some form of mental health issue or substance abuse related to the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nThe percentages were far higher in certain groups, including essential workers and ethnic and racial minorities. The study found that the groups with the highest rates of suicide ideation were unpaid caregivers for adults, citing 30% who contemplated it in June. The other group highly affected was the 18- to 24 age group with 25% reporting having those thoughts.\n\nEthnic and racial minority groups were found to be disproportionately affected as well. The report said 15.1% of Black and 18.6% of Hispanic Americans reported seriously thinking about suicide in June.\n\nBesides an increase in suicide ideation, the study found that there was also an increase in symptoms of depression and anxiety. The rate of depression symptoms quadrupled in number and anxiety tripled compared to the second quarter of 2019.\n\nAbout 13% of those surveyed said they increased or started using substances to cope with stress during June.\n\nThe authors of the report stated factors need to be investigated such as social isolation, unemployment and financial concerns, lack of school structure, and forms of violence, to see how they serve as additional stressors. The report pointed out that the increased percentages of these mental and behavioral health effects highlights the impact this pandemic has on the population. The study authors stated the report also helped with \"identification of populations at increased risk for psychological distress and unhealthy coping.\" It suggested expanded use of telehealth to provide services to those in need and suggested future studies to identify drivers of adverse mental and behavioral health during the COVID-19 pandemic and community programs.\n\nThe suicide prevention lifeline stated on their website the following warning signs may help determine if a loved one is at risk for suicide. It stated if the behavior has increased, is new, or is related to a recent loss or painful event, seek help by calling the lifeline.",

Haley hospital want transparency from management.\n\nThey're demanding that registered nurses \"have access to safe protective equipment and that RNs who are exposed to COVID-19 get immediate testing. ... RNs are also insisting that management staff the hospital appropriately so that the veterans receive optimal care.\"\n\nThe spread of COVID-19 in the Sunshine State, meanwhile, appears to be slowing. The Miami Herald reported Thursday that Florida has seen a slight decrease in newly confirmed cases over the past fortnight.\n\nAccording to the Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center, there are now more than 518,000 confirmed cases, almost 8,000 deaths, and an above-average positive testing rate of 13.29%.\n\nA case rate that high, however -- just below California's numbers -- is still worrying, especially for health workers on the front lines.\n\nAccording to FOX 13, some nurses have even reported that they were told to keep working after they were exposed to COVID-19 and showed no symptoms.\n\nA hospital spokesperson, however, said the health and well-being of the facility's staff and veterans is \"always [its] top concern\" and said the protests don't reflect the site's safety practices, which have proven effective.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"Many of the demands are already part of the facility's operational response to this pandemic and have been for months,\" the spokesperson said in a statement.\n\nNot only does the hospital provide employees with all required safety gear in accordance with CDC guidelines, it has an adequate supply to meet current demand, the spokesperson said.",

In pre-clinical research, the drug was said to stop the virus that causes COVID-19 from replicating and showed more potency than Gilead Sciences' remdesivir in the same assay. Niclosamide also documented anti-inflammatory properties, officials said.\n\n\"ANA Therapeutics believes niclosamide has the strong potential to both stop viral replication and reduce symptoms in patients suffering from COVID-19,\" company officials wrote in a press release.\n\n\"Safe and effective antiviral therapies are critically needed to treat COVID-19 now and treatments will continue to be necessary even if a vaccine is developed,\" said Akash Bakshi, ANA Therapeutics co-founder and CEO.\n\n\"Anticipating that niclosamide may prove to be effective against COVID-19, we are already laying plans to make the drug accessible to everyone,\" Bakshi said.\n\nHAIR LOSS MAY BE A CORONAVIRUS SYMPTOM, STUDY FINDS\n\nThe clinical trial seeks to enroll at least 400 patients with COVID-19 at 10 centers across the U.S., specifically in states experiencing a surge in cases, such as Florida and Texas.\n\nANA Therapeutics will set out to evaluate the safety of niclosamide and its ability to improve hospitalized patients, focusing on less severe patients who are not on ventilators.\n\nPatients will be given a seven-day course of the drug and monitored for 60 days. ANA Therapeutics will examine the drug's effectiveness in treating outpatients in a later study.\n\nIn early March, ANA pivoted the business to determine the efficacy of niclosamide for COVID-19 and raised more than $5 million to lead the clinical trial.",

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.\n\nFinding and isolating coronavirus cases is key for curbing virus spread until there is an effective vaccine. Officials say temperature screenings upon entry to businesses and other places can be useful, but they advise pairing the technique with other screening measures too.\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration (FDA), for example, has warned that even when temperature assessment devices are used properly, they may have a \"limited impact\" on reducing the spread of infections. It has been estimated that up to 40% of infected individuals are asymptomatic and could potentially breeze past this screening method undetected with the opportunity to further spread the virus.\n\nFOGGY GLASSES, 'MASKNE' FIXED WITH THESE SIMPLE TIPS\n\n\"Screening employees is an optional strategy that employers may use,\" according to guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). \"Performing screening or health checks will not be completely effective because asymptomatic individuals or individuals with mild non-specific symptoms may not realize they are infected and may pass through screening.\"\n\nIn addition to temperature screenings, the CDC says to focus on screening questions for \"new\" or \"unexpected\" symptoms, including fever or feeling feverish (chills, sweating), new cough, difficulty breathing, sore throat, muscle aches or body aches, vomiting or diarrhea and new loss of taste or smell.\n\nAccording to a recent study from the University of Southern California, the earliest symptom of COVID-19 in patients will most likely be fever, followed by cough and muscle pain.\n\n\"During outbreaks, one can argue that it's likely most of the fevers will be secondary to the outbreak, and hence it will help in detecting symptomatic coronavirus cases,\" Dr. Waleed Javaid, director of Infection Prevention and Control at New York's Mount Sinai Downtown, wrote in an email statement to Fox News.\n\nASYMPTOMATIC KIDS MAY BE MORE CONTAGIOUS THAN SEVERELY ILL ADULTS, NEW STUDY FINDS\n\nHe said the effectiveness of temperature screenings depends on the tool, sensitivity, operator, operator training and margin of error, among other factors.\n\n\"If any such tool is being used, it should be tested, instructions of use followed and understanding of the margin of error (how many degrees), etc.,\" Javaid said.\n\nFor employers conducting temperature assessments, the CDC says to stand behind a physical barrier, such as a glass or plastic window or partition to protect the screener's face from potential exposure to infected respiratory droplets.\n\nThe employers should make a visual inspection of the employee for signs of illness, like flushed cheeks, fatigue, coughing or shortness of breath. Also, officials say to always wear a clean pair of gloves for each employee and thoroughly clean thermometers between each check.\n\nThe CDC considers a person to have a fever at 100.4\u00b0F or greater or when they feel warm to the touch or give a history of feeling feverish. However, the CDC says a lower temperature threshold -- 100\u00b0F, for instance -- can be used, particularly in health care settings.",

Infant severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) nasopharyngeal testing was positive at 24 and 48 hours of life,\" the Parkland physicians said in July of the COVID-19 positive newborn case in The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal.\n\nThe baby was taken to a designated NICU for infected newborns, while her mother was in the COVID-19 unit. The two were separated for 20 days, according to multiple news outlets.\n\n\"We immediately separated the baby from [her] mother. Mom was wearing a mask during delivery to reduce transmission,\" Dr. Mamarambath Jaleel, the director of Parkland Neonatal ICU, told media outlet WFAA.\n\n\"I could not see my daughter. They took her from me. I could only see her from far away. I could not hold her. I cried,\" Figueroa told the news outlet, which also reported that Parkland officials gave Figuero an iPad that was set up on Alexa's incubator so the mother could watch over her baby.\n\nMore than 170 mothers who tested positive for novel coronavirus have delivered babies at the hospital, and only six of those babies have tested positive. But only Alexa fell ill, according to multiple reports.\n\nIn Alexa's case, the virus was detected in Figueroa's placenta, which delivers oxygen and nutrients to a growing baby, Fox 4 reported.\n\n\"We literally had to hold on to placenta until we were able to get a hold of a lab [that] was able to get a test to test placentas,\" Marjorie Quint-Bouzid, senior vice president of nursing for Women's Infant Specialty Health, told Fox 4.\n\n\"Having the testing positive of the placenta, the most likely explanation was the transmission of infection was when the baby was in the mother's womb,\" Jaleel added to WFAA.\n\nFigueroa and her baby are both reportedly doing well. The mother recently recalled the moment she first held her baby after nearly three weeks.\n\n\"When I held my daughter for the first time at that moment nothing else mattered,\" Figueroa said, according to one report.\n\nWHY CORONAVIRUS OCCURS LESS IN CHILDREN THAN ADULTS, ACCORDING TO NEW STUDY\n\nAt this time, medical officials are unsure what the long term effects on the baby will be, but Alexa will continue to be monitored, Jaleel told Fox 4.\n\n\"Further understanding of the risk factors that lead to in utero transmission of SARS-CoV-2 infection is needed,\" added the authors of the report in The Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal.",

A recent study has identified the most and least effective face coverings, with one face mask in particular claiming the No.1 spot for being the most effective at curbing the spread of COVID-19.\n\nResearchers at Duke University compared 14 commonly available masks and face coverings to see which was most effective at stopping the spread of respiratory droplets. The best face coverings for preventing droplet spread were N95 masks without valves, they found, while fleece coverings and bandanas were shown to be \"counterproductive.\"\n\nThe main route of coronavirus spread is said to occur from person to person through respiratory droplets containing the virus when an infected person coughs, sneezes or talks. These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people nearby, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).\n\nBANDANA IS LEAST EFFECTIVE FACE MASK MATERIAL, STUDY FINDS\n\nIt is also estimated that up to 40% of those infected have no symptoms, emphasizing the need for widespread use of face masks to curb virus spread.\n\nResearchers used a simple optical measurement method of a cellphone camera and laser pointer to illuminate particles emitted by someone wearing a variety of face coverings and masks.\n\nThey found that neck fleece, or bandanas, \"offer very little protection\" and actually disperse large droplets into a multitude of smaller droplets.\n\n\"Considering that smaller particles are airborne longer than large droplets (larger droplets sink faster), the use of such a mask might be counterproductive,\" the study authors wrote.\n\nCORONAVIRUS-INDUCED EQUIPMENT SHORTAGES LED NEW YORK HOSPITAL TO USE GARDEN HOSES WITH VENTILATORS: BOOK\n\nCotton masks offer more protection, and surgical masks are even better at blocking droplets, researchers found.\n\nFinally, fitted, non-valved N95 masks performed \"far superior\" to valved N95 masks because the exhalation valve opens for strong outward airflow, therefore putting those nearby at greater risk of exposure, researchers said.\n\nThe study was published Friday in Science Advances.\n\nFox News' Stephen Sorace contributed to this report.",

        "body": "New research has boiled down the most probable order in which COVID-19 symptoms first appear.\n\nThe earliest sign of the coronavirus will most likely be a fever in infected patients, followed by a cough and muscle pain, according to the study conducted by the University of Southern California published in the Frontiers in Public Health journal Thursday.\n\nPeople will then experience nausea or vomiting and diarrhea.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR FULL CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE\n\nThe latest findings are a major breakthrough in studying the coronavirus since patients will now be able to more quickly identify and treat the disease.\n\n\"This order is especially important to know when we have overlapping cycles of illnesses like the flu that coincide with infections of COVID-19,\" Peter Kuhn, a professor of biological sciences and medicine who worked on the study, said in a statement. \"Doctors can determine what steps to take to care for the patient, and they may prevent the patient's condition from worsening.\"\n\nEstablishing a diagnosis early is key to stopping the virus before it gets more serious.\n\n\"Given that there are now better approaches to treatments for COVID-19, identifying patients earlier could reduce hospitalization time,\" said Joseph Larsen, a doctoral candidate and the lead researcher on the study. \"The order of the symptoms matter. Knowing that each illness progresses differently means that doctors can identify sooner whether someone likely has COVID-19, or another illness, which can help them make better treatment decisions.\"\n\nThe initial symptoms of the coronavirus are very similar to other respiratory illnesses such as MERS and SARS, but it's the timing of gastrointestinal issues that makes COVID-19 easier to single out.\n\n\"The upper GI tract (i.e., nausea/vomiting) seems to be affected before the lower GI tract (i.e., diarrhea) in COVID-19, which is the opposite from MERS and SARS,\" the scientists wrote in the study.\n\nCORONAVIRUS: WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW\n\nLarsen, along with faculty advisers Kuhn and James Hicks, conducted the study at the USC Michelson Center for Convergent Bioscience's Convergent Science Institute in Cancer.\n\nThe USC researchers analyzed data collected by the World Health Organization in China between Feb. 16 and 24 from more than 55,000 confirmed coronavirus cases.

They then compared it to increases in emergency department visits due to respiratory conditions in older patient populations in the days before and after thunderstorms. The researchers also used data collected from 46 million Medicare beneficiaries older than 65 to identify visits due to acute respiratory illnesses. Of those analyzed in the study, more than 26% had COPD, 10% had chronic asthma and 6.6% had both, according to the study.\n\n\"Emergency visits for acute respiratory illness significantly increased during the days before major thunderstorms among Medicare beneficiaries, particularly those with asthma and/or COPD,\" the authors stated.\n\nThey explained the ED visits were associated with atmospheric changes, the temperature rises, and increased air pollution that compromised breathing in patients with chronic respiratory diseases, ultimately causing them to seek medical help.\n\n\"For those with respiratory illnesses like chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which includes bronchitis and emphysema, the weather has been a factor in leading to exacerbations. This is because both temperature and humidity can lead to flares,\" Dr. Fred Davis, a physician at Northwell Health Long Island Jewish Hospitals Emergency Department on Long Island, N.Y., told Fox News.\n\nAnother possible reason for the correlation, Davis said, could be that during thunderstorms, increased wind could blow allergens and particles around that may lead to flares in those with asthma and COPD.\n\n\"Those that are older are more susceptible to temperature changes and those with respiratory illnesses should be cognizant of the weather to plan accordingly. Part of this planning would be times to reduce outdoor exposure and always carrying their rescue medication with them,\" the emergency medicine physician added.\n\nDIETS HIGHER IN PROTEIN, PARTICULARLY PLANT PROTEIN, LINKED TO LOWER RATES OF EARLY DEATH: STUDY\n\n\"It's the weather pattern prior to the thunderstorms that seemingly caused the breathing problems. And that makes sense because it is usually hot [and] humid before thunderstorms form,\" a chief meteorologist told Fox News.\n\n\"Plants are known to release spores, pollen and allergens under these circumstances. Then the gusty winds, either prior to or accompanying the thunderstorms, will transport them in higher percentages and greater distances. So [yes], I can see the correlation but one has to lead to the other and that makes it appear like the thunderstorms are causing the breathing problems but actually it's what leads up to them. The timing goes hand in hand.\"\n\nThe increase in temperature and particles in the air are both possibly the dominant triggers to thunderstorm-associated acute respiratory flare-ups in older populations, the study authors said, noting that this \"may contribute to strain on the health care system as storm activity increases with rising global temperatures.\"",

Start with Biden.\n\n1. Trump and Vice President Mike Pence have given us \"four years of mismanagement and coddling of terrorists and thugs around the world,\" Biden said. Did Trump \"coddle\" Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the leader of the Islamic State group? No, he's dead. Did Trump \"coddle\" Iranian terrorist Gen. Qassem Soleimani? He's dead, too. Biden opposed taking down Usama bin Laden, so he should sit a spell.\n\n2. Trump has no \"plan\" for the pandemic. He has \"no real help for the states and local governments trying to fill the vacuum of leadership from the White House, no real help for children and educators, for small businesses and front-line workers,\" Biden said. We didn't allocate $3 trillion to mitigate the pandemic, aiding governments and businesses and vaccine development?\n\n3. Trump was accused of referring to neo-Nazis and racists when he said, \"There are very fine people on both sides\" of the 2017 Charlottesville protests. This is transparently false ... and yet, fact-checkers like PolitiFact go limp and let Biden unspool this lie. Reporters at the time prodded Trump, and he explicitly condemned the neo-Nazis and racists.\n\nThe nation's most influential newspapers largely skipped over many of these troubling quotes in their accounts.\n\n4. Trump is \"on track to leave office with the worst jobs record of any American president in modern history.\" In January, FactCheck.org reported, \"The economy added 6.7 million jobs, and unemployment fell to the lowest rate in half a century.\" We're now in a pandemic that shocked the economy, but the economy is recovering. Does anyone think the \"fact-checkers\" would let a Republican blame the Democrats for the economy if this were to happen under a President Hillary Clinton?\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\n5. Kamala Harris said: \"The president's mismanagement of the pandemic has plunged us into the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression. ... He inherited the longest economic expansion in history ... And then, like everything else he inherited, he ran it straight into the ground.\" Did Democrats oppose the lockdown kicking and screaming? Shouldn't they share responsibility for it?\n\n6. Harris insisted, \"After the most competitive primary in history, the country received a resounding message that Joe was the person to lead us forward.\" That's a joke. There were a huge number of candidates, but it didn't end up competitive at all, in part because of the pandemic. It certainly didn't match Obama vs. Clinton in 2008.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n7. Harris tried to compare the coronavirus pandemic to the Ebola outbreak of 2014: \"Barack Obama and Joe Biden did their job. Only two people in the United States died. Two. That is what's called leadership.\" These are apples and oranges in epidemiology. Ebola is much deadlier than the coronavirus. But the spread isn't nearly the same, since Ebola is not infectious until you have symptoms, and you're quickly bedridden.\n\nThe nation's most influential newspapers largely skipped over many of these troubling quotes in their accounts. Did that occur because they knew how unfactual these claims were?",

And so I wanted to make sure that their voice was heard because first and foremost, they're the ones playing the game.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nIn addition to the players' concerns, Edsall told Cavuto there were too many \"unknowns\" about how the season would operate, particularly in regard to road games that require hotel stays and dressing in tightly-packed visiting locker rooms.\n\n\"I wanted to make sure that our players had a say in this,\" he said. \"Because you take a look at a lot of these things that are going on - these players really didn't have a say in anything ... I'm glad we made that decision and our kids now have direction in terms of what's going on.\"",

        "body": "Several University of Connecticut students were kicked out of their dorm rooms this week after videos on social media showed them at a crowded party with no masks and even less social distancing amid the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nMost UConn students have cooperated with strict health and safety guidelines since returning to campus last Friday, but some haven't, university President Tom Katsouleas and Provost Carl Lejuez said in a letter to the campus community Wednesday.\n\n\"Many of you are aware of a party in a residence hall that violated our health and safety rules; as a result, the students involved have been removed from campus housing,\" Katsouleas and Lejuez wrote. \"Separately, over the weekend, seven students were written up for minor infractions.\n\nNOTRE DAME SUSPENDING IN-PERSON CLASSES FOR TWO WEEKS FOLLOWING CORONAVIRUS SPIKE\n\nDespite the party, UConn still appears to have a handle on the spread of the virus. Out of 5,042 residential students who have been tested, only eight have come back positive, a .16% positivity rate. Three off-campus commuter students have also tested positive. Just two staff members out of 2,110 who have been tested were positive, a .01% positivity rate.\n\nThat's in stark contrast to other universities that have already had to send students home due to an inability to control the spread on campus.\n\nElsewhere, the COVID-19 positivity rate at the University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill increased from 2.8% to 13.6% after just one week of in-person classes, prompting the university to shift to remote learning for the rest of the fall semester.\n\nGEORGIA COLLEGE KIDS PREPARE FOR CORONAVIRUS SEMESTER WITH WILD PARTY\n\nThe University of Notre Dame is currently dealing with a 17.3% positivity rate, as 222 of 1,278 tests have come back positive since students started returning to campus earlier this month. The school announced Tuesday that it is suspending all in-person undergraduate classes for two weeks, and if it can't get control of the spread, then it will send students home for the semester.\n\nSome colleges that haven't even started yet are changing their plans due to the challenges other schools have faced. Michigan State University announced Tuesday that it is moving all undergraduate students to remote learning for the fall semester, just days before students were set to return to campus.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR COMPLETE CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE\n\nThe World Health Organization warned this week that coronavirus is now primarily being spread by young people.\n\n\"The epidemic is changing: people in their 20s, 30s and 40s are increasingly driving its spread,\" Dr. Takeshi Kasai, WHO's regional health director for the Western Pacific region, said in a virtual news conference Tuesday. \"Many are unaware they're infected -- with very mild symptoms or none at all.

It's also running a trial on the benefits of repeat testing of people without symptoms.\n\nBritain has hugely expanded its testing capacity since the start of the pandemic, but critics say it is still not doing enough to find and isolate people with the coronavirus.\n\nAnyone with symptoms is eligible for a test, but the BBC reported Thursday that people who enter their postcode into the government's website are sometimes being directed to drive-through centers hundreds of miles away.\n\nHancock insisted the system was working well despite some \"operational challenges.\"\n\nThe government says it has the capacity to perform almost 350,000 tests a day, though only abut 180,000 are actually being processed daily.\n\nHERE'S WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT THE VIRUS OUTBREAK\n\n-- CDC tells states: Be ready to distribute vaccines on Nov. 1\n\n-- Critics: Eviction ban may only delay wave of homelessness\n\n-- Former Italian premier Berlusconi tests positive for COVID\n\n-- Amnesty International says Mexico leads the world in coronavirus deaths among its health care workers. The group says Mexico has reported 1,320 confirmed deaths from COVIID-19 so far, surpassing the United States at 1,077, the United Kingdom at 649, and Brazil at 634.\n\n-- New studies confirm that multiple types of steroids improve survival for severely ill COVID-19 patients, cementing the cheap drugs as a standard of care.\n\n-- Scientists are reporting that the antibodies people make to fight the new coronavirus do not fade quickly. The new study is the most extensive work yet on the immune system's response to the virus and is good news for efforts to develop vaccines.\n\nCDC: CORONAVIRUS VACCINE COULD ARRIVE IN OCTOBER, NOVEMBER; ASKS STATES TO PREPARE\n\nLONDON -- Sanofi and GlaxoSmithKline say they are beginning human trials of a potential vaccine for COVID-19 after positive results from preclinical testing.\n\nThe drugmakers said Thursday they plan to test the vaccine on 440 adults at 11 sites in the U.S., with the first results expected in early December. If these tests are successful, the companies plan to begin large-scale trials later that month.\n\nSanofi and GlaxoSmithKline say they plan to seek regulatory approval for the vaccine in early 2021 if data from the trials supports it.\n\nThe two companies in July announced plans to collaborate with the U.S. government to produce up to 100 million doses of the vaccine, with the government taking an option to purchase up to 500 million more doses in the future. The British government has agreed to buy up to 60 million doses.\n\nANKARA, Turkey -- Turkey is expanding restrictions imposed on social gatherings such as wedding and engagement parties and henna nights in more than a dozen provinces to the entire country.\n\nAn Interior Ministry circular sent to Turkey's 81 provinces late Wednesday says such social gatherings will banned from Friday. Marriage registration ceremonies will be allowed but will be restricted to one hour only.\n\nThe decision came after the health minister said the country is experiencing the second peak of the first wave of the coronavirus outbreak and blamed gatherings at weddings and holidays.\n\nThe number of daily infections have tipped above 1,500 -- levels previously seen in mid-June. More than 273,000 people have tested positive for the virus in Turkey since March.\n\nPRAGUE -- The Czech Republic has registered the biggest day-to-day increase in the new confirmed cases of COVID-19.\n\nThe Health Ministry says a record 650 people tested positive on Wednesday, up from 504 on Tuesday.\n\nHealth Minister Adam Vojtech says new restrictions are likely to be imposed.\n\nVojtech is currently quarantined after a senior official in his department tested positive for COVID-19.\n\nThe Czech Republic has had 25,773 confirmed infections with 425 deaths.\n\nLOS ANGELES -- The Los Angeles City Council has declared a fiscal emergency because of the coronavirus pandemic, paving the way to furlough about 15,000 employees.\n\nWednesday's declaration comes as the city looks at a tax shortfall this year of up to $400 million.\n\nMayor Eric Garcetti is expected to approve the measure.\n\nThe furloughs, which would begin Oct. 11, would require civilian employees to take up to 18 days off from work. But a labor union official tells the Los Angeles Daily News that the furloughs violate labor contracts and will be vigorously fought.\n\nBEIJING -- Beijing's main international airport on Thursday began again receiving international flights from a limited number of countries considered at low risk of coronavirus infection.\n\nPassengers flying in from Cambodia, Greece, Denmark, Thailand, Pakistan, Austria, Canada and Sweden, must have first shown a negative nucleic acid test for coronavirus before boarding, city government spokesperson Xu Hejian told reporters.\n\nPassenger arrivals will be limited to roughly 500 per day during an initial trial period and all will need to undergo additional testing for the virus on arrival, followed by two weeks of quarantine. The first flight under the new arrangement, Air China 746, arrived from Pnom Penh, Cambodia just before 7 a.m.\n\nBeginning in March, all international flights to Beijing had been redirected to a dozen other cities where passengers were tested and processed before being allowed to travel on to the Chinese capital.\n\nChina has gone weeks without new cases of local infection and on Thursday recorded 11 cases brought from outside the country. China has recorded a total of 4,634 deaths from COVID-19 among 85,077 cases since the virus was first detected in the central Chinese city of Wuhan late last year, sparking the global pandemic.\n\nWEAR A MASK DURING SEX, SKIP KISSING, CANADA'S TOP DOCTOR SUGGESTS\n\nLOS ANGELES -- Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson says he and his family tested positive for the coronavirus.\n\nJohnson announced their diagnosis in an 11-plus minute video on Instagram on Wednesday.\n\nThe actor says he was shocked after hearing their positive tests. He called the ordeal \"one of the most challenging and difficult things we've had ever to endure.\"\n\nThe actor said he along with wife, Lauren Hashian, and two young daughters contracted the virus, but have now recovered.\n\nHe says his daughters \"bounced back\" after having sore throats for a couple days. But for Johnson and his wife, he says they both had a \"rough go.\"\n\nSAN DIEGO -- San Diego State University has halted in-person classes for a month after dozens of students were infected with the coronavirus.\n\nThe school announced Wednesday that about 200 course offerings, some of them lab classes, will move to virtual learning. On-campus housing will remain open.\n\nSan Diego County health officials say there have been 64 confirmed or probable cases of COVID-19 among SDSU students since classes resumed last week. Some, but not all, of the infections were linked to other cases at the university. Some involve students who live off-campus.\n\nCalifornia State university at Chico also halted classes this week.\n\nSANTA FE, N.M. -- A top state health official is warning that COVID-19 infections are far more prevalent in low-income areas of the New Mexico, potentially straining Medicaid health care.\n\nHuman Services Secretary David Scrase said Wednesday that an analysis of infection rates by census tract shows that highly impoverished areas have infection rates seven times higher than the most affluent zones.\n\nScrase and Children Youth and Families Secretary Brian Blalock gave a briefing on public health trends and the state's coronavirus response.\n\nState health officials are wary that festivities over the Labor Day holiday weekend could lead to renewed surges in COVID-19 infections.\n\nURBANA, Ill. -- The University of Illinois is ramping up enforcement of restrictions on student activity after more than 330 COVID-19 cases in two days on the school's Urbana-Champaign campus, school officials said Wednesday.\n\nIn an email to students, Chancellor Robert Jones said he expects all undergraduates to \"limit their in-person interactions to only the most essential activities\" for the next two weeks starting Wednesday evening.\n\n\"These include things like taking twice weekly COVID-19 tests, attending class, purchasing groceries and food, going to work, engaging in individual outdoor activity, attending religious services and seeking medical attention,\" Jones wrote.\n\nThe University of Illinois isn't the only university in the state seeing a spike in COVID-19 cases. Illinois State University in Normal is reporting about 1,025 students have tested positive since the start of the fall semester two weeks ago, nearly 5% of the student body.\n\nSince students returned to the Urbana-Champaign campus Aug. 16, more than 1,000 people on campus have tested positive. University officials say about 800 people are currently in quarantine.\n\nATLANTA -- With more than 3,000 public university students and employees across Georgia testing positive for COVID-19 since Aug. 1, some schools are taking action to slow the spread of the respiratory illness.\n\nGeorgia Tech is encouraging students to convert to single rooms, moving out roommates over coming weeks to reduce exposure to the coronavirus. Both Georgia Tech and the University of Georgia announced they are renting more off-campus rooms to isolate or quarantine students who have been infected or exposed to the virus.\n\nThe University of Georgia reported 821 new infections for the week ended Saturday, a number that President Jere Morehead said Wednesday is \"concerning.\" He urged students to \"continue to make every effort to prioritize their health and safety by taking the proper steps to avoid exposure to this virus.\n\nAround 4% of all cases recorded in Georgia in the last month have been associated with university campuses, according to figures kept by The Associated Press. The number could be higher because some schools, including the state's largest -- Georgia State University -- are not posting full reports publicly.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe rising campus infection numbers come as new cases in the rest of Georgia decline. The total number of cases rose to near 275,000 Wednesday, according to state data, but the average number of cases has fallen below 2,000 a day.",

        "authors": [],
        "body": "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.\n\nAlready delayed, the Tour de France sets off Saturday shrouded in uncertainty, flying in the face of the coronavirus pandemic and the imponderable question of how many of the 176 riders will avoid infection and endure three exceptionally tough weeks of racing to reach the finish in Paris.\n\nThat's if the rolling roadshow gets that far.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM\n\nStaging cycling's premier race when COVID-19 infections are rising again in France represents both a health risk and an embodiment of French President Emmanuel Macron's insistence that the country must learn to function as normally as possible with the virus.\n\nFailure to safely steer the Tour to the cobbles of Paris' Champs-Elys\u00e9es avenue on Sept. 20 could cast further doubt on the feasibility of holding other sporting mega-events, including the Tokyo Olympics postponed to next year, while the coronavirus remains untamed. A key question posed by pushing ahead with the race will be whether it would have been wiser and safer to simply cancel it.\n\n\"Is the Tour adding to the human community experience this year? Or hurting it? That's what needs answering,\" Jonathan Vaughters, boss of the EF Education First team, told The Associated Press. \"If we choose to take on the risk of living life, then I suppose we might have to take the risk of letting events go forward that make life worth living, like the Tour. Is that responsible for the community at large? I think there are many opinions. Many.\"\n\nAmid the pandemic, the usually boisterous celebration of cycling that for decades has drawn packed throngs of cheering roadside spectators promises to be a strange and more subdued affair, moved for the first time in its 117-year history out of its traditional July slot to a September month when many fans will be back at school or at work after summer vacations.\n\nRiders who in more carefree times were habitually besieged by admirers congregating outside their team buses and hotels are expected to be largely sealed off from the outside world, except while out on the roads. Organizers are beseeching spectators to wear face masks, but won't be able to prevent them from turning out to watch as riders speed through their towns and villages, starting in the Mediterranean city of Nice on Saturday. Masks will be obligatory for spectators at stage starts and finishes, and have become mandatory outdoors in a growing number of cities and towns as French infection rates have ticked upward over the summer.\n\n\"If you love the Tour, if you love the champions, wear a mask,\" race director Christian Prudhomme said. \"Not only will this not be the year to collect an autograph, but you shouldn't ask for autographs or ask for selfies. The riders will say 'Hello' from afar. That isn't to say that they're not nice. All in all, it will be like Wimbledon: You don't get (Roger) Federer's autograph in the morning.\"\n\nTo try to keep the coronavirus from infecting the peloton of riders as it negotiates the clockwise, 3,484-kilometer (2,165-mile) route, organizers aim to shield the 22 teams inside what they call a \"race bubble\" -- opened only to riders and staff who have twice tested negative in the race run-up, including this week at a mobile laboratory in Nice.\n\nThe Tour's COVID-19 protocol, detailed in a 17-page document distributed to teams and obtained by the AP, says teams will be expelled if two of their riders or staff test positive for the virus or show strong symptoms of infection. Race organizers say that scenario will be reserved only for two or more cases within a seven-day span. The threat of expulsion is making riders and managers even edgier than usual on the eve of the biggest event on cycling's calendar, anxious not only about infection but also about the reliability of virus testing.\n\nThe German team Bora-Hansgrohe is among those expressing concern, after one if its riders first tested positive and then tested negative Tuesday, prompting the withdrawal of its entire squad from the one-day Bretagne Classic race. Bora team manager Ralph Denk appealed for immediate changes to cycling's testing regimen to combat false positives.\n\n\"We are talking about athletes who have prepared for a race for weeks or months and then might not be allowed to start the event due to a false finding,\" he said.\n\nAs Tour teams arrived in Nice, some were surprised to discover that they were sharing their designated hotel with ordinary guests, raising doubts about how hermetically sealed the race bubble will be.\n\nOn top of COVID-19 concerns, riders will contend with one of the most unrelenting Tour routes in memory, with an usually high total of 29 tough climbs. They'll scale all five of France's mountain ranges: the Alps, the Massif Central, the Pyr\u00e9n\u00e9es, the Jura and the Vosges. Uphill slogs come as soon as Stage 2 on Sunday, in a first for the race, with two ascents to 1,500 meters (4,920 feet) and higher.\n\nAn uphill time trial on the penultimate stage before Paris will decide the standings among contenders chasing podium places and the winner's prize of 500,000 euros ($590,000).\n\nDefending champion Egan Bernal from Colombia is the only previous winner in a field stripped of four-time champion Chris Froome and 2018 victor Geraint Thomas, both omitted by Bernal's Ineos team, leaving him as its sole leader. Principal among Bernal's rivals could be Primoz Roglic, a Slovenian who finished 4th in 2018, and Tom Dumoulin, the Dutch runner-up that year who is now Roglic's teammate at Jumbo-Visma.\n\nBut with the pandemic having forced riders to train indoors on stationary bikes and with scant racing in this year of tumult, the readiness of top contenders is one of many uncertainties in a Tour unlike any other.",

At the start of the event, patrons were reportedly instructed to remain within individual taped-off areas within the seating area. By the event's end, however, customers appeared to be skirting the restrictions.\n\nIn video that has since circulated on Twitter, a bartender can be seen standing on top of the bar, pouring liquor directly into the mouths of several patrons below. And while the bartender is wearing a face covering, many of the revelers who approach him are not and do not appear to be carrying masks at all.\n\nIrish Health Minister Stephen Donnelly became aware of the scene the following day, calling it \"reckless\" and sickening.\n\n\"The vast majority of Irish people have sacrificed a huge amount to help suppress this virus,\" Donnelly said on Twitter. \"They've shown huge solidarity. People are rightly sickened by these scenes. The reckless actions of a small few can have huge repercussions on everyone else.\"\n\nOther officials, including Higher Education Minister Simon Harris and politician Noel Rock, decried the actions seen in the video. But on Tuesday, the prime minister addressed the video during a speech on Tuesday, calling it an \"appalling\" example of a larger, more worrisome trend.\n\n\"This is not just about the appalling behavior we saw in one Dublin bar at the weekend,\" Martin said, per the Irish Independent. \"The evidence is that a large number of people are acting as if the virus is no threat to them, or that it's okay to take a few more risks. And many people seem to believe that if they are those they are socializing with have no symptoms.\n\n\"The fact is that a person can spread the virus, without ever showing any symptoms. You may be young and healthy, but your choices impact on everyone.\"\n\nMartin then urged citizens to \"recommit\" to safety mandates.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR LIFESTYLE NEWSLETTER\n\nMeanwhile, Jay Bourke, one of the restaurateurs behind Berlin D2, defended Saturday's brunch event as being mostly orderly, despite admitting that he was \"absolutely mortified\" by the actions seen in the video.\n\nIt was only \"20 seconds of madness,\" he told RTE, Ireland's national public broadcaster.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe bar's liquor license is currently under review, the Irish Times reports, although sources for the local police service told the outlet that the owners will likely avoid prosecution, as they had not technically violated health regulations.",

        "authors": [],
        "body": "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.\n\nThe captivation and celebration of the NFL have long-stemmed from the speed, strategy, strength and teamwork that make the game go.\n\nFootball is just as much a sport of pattern and detail, too, never more than at training camps around the league in the time of COVID-19.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE SPORTS COVERAGE ON FOXNEWS.COM\n\nLike the defense stiffening at the goal line late in the fourth quarter, the NFL has implemented a wide array of health protocols designed to keep the virus from wrecking the 2020 season for this cultural institution that was a $16 billion business before the pandemic.\n\n\"There are so many steps along the way. You've got to fill out your questionnaire on our app when you wake up in the morning,\" Minnesota Vikings tight end Kyle Rudolph said. \"Then when you come in, you sanitize your hands, do your temperature check, get your COVID tests, put on your lanyard, grab your tracker. So there's just a lot of things that have now been added to your routine.\"\n\nDaily testing, naturally, is the fulcrum of this aggressive virus-proofing around team facilities. NFL Network reported that, of 109,075 coronavirus tests conducted on players, coaches and team employees through Tuesday, the rate of positive tests has been 0.46% overall and 0.81% for players.\n\nSince training camps began three weeks ago, 108 players have been placed on COVID-19 reserve lists by their respective teams -- according to an Associated Press review of the league's daily transaction logs -- and 81 of those players were subsequently returned to active status on the roster. There are more than 2,600 players currently employed across the 32 clubs.\n\nLanding on the COVID-19 reserve list does not mean a player has the virus. The category was created for a player who either tests positive for COVID-19 or who has been quarantined after having been in close contact with an infected person or persons. By agreement between the NFL and the NFL Players Association, clubs are not permitted to disclose whether a player is positive for COVID-19 or simply in preventative quarantine.\n\nWearing masks, of course, is a vital part of the equation.\n\nAfter leaving the testing trailer and entering the building, players and staffers must pass the temperature check. The tablet-like device won't even perform the thermal scan if the person is not wearing a face covering.\n\n\"It's an adjustment. You used to check phone, key, wallet. Now it's phone, key, wallet, mask, proximity locator,\" Vikings linebacker Eric Kendricks said. \"But they explained to us the reason behind it. If someone is to get infected, heaven forbid, if we're close to those people for a certain amount of time, those devices will allow us to quarantine effectively if that's the case. So there's a reason behind the madness.\"\n\nPassing the symptom questionnaire and the temperature check, with the nasal swab performed in between, then takes the employee to another level of high-tech: the proximity tracker.\n\nThe device, which resembles a smart watch, produces audible and visual warnings to help maximize social distancing and keep employees not required to interact with players apart from those who must. The tracker can also provide instant reports for contact tracing in case of a positive test. The devices are worn during practice but turned in at the end of the work day before employees depart the building.\n\n\"It's weird when someone tells you you've been too close for too long,\" Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes said, \"but it's necessary. We're going to try to do our part for the community and make sure we can keep playing the game we love.\"\n\nThe bulk of the virus-proofing protocols are uniform across the league, with each team applying its own twists to fit the facility.\n\nThe Miami Dolphins installed new air purification devices throughout their facility. The Tennessee Titans had 4-feet-long dividers placed between each player's cubicle in the locker room, making the spaces look a little like voting booths. Vikings players can order meals via smart phone app to reduce time spent in the cafeteria.\n\nThe Carolina Panthers have made clever use of Bank of America Stadium to their virus-fighting advantage. All of the 80-plus players have their own temporary luxury suite at the 73,000-seat venue, expected to retreat there alone for lunch or during the down time between practices and meetings in the name of social distancing.\n\nThere's almost no end to the precautions that can be taken. Narrow hallways have become one-way paths. Couches have been removed. Even shower heads in the locker room have been taken out to increase spacing. Electric static sprayers are being used for surface disinfecting. Seating capacity in meeting rooms has been significantly reduced.\n\n\"We're so spaced out that it can feel like you're not all in the same room together, even more than a Zoom, even though you are sitting in the same room,\" Titans quarterback Ryan Tannehill said.\n\nIn an intense contact sport in which participants are bound to breathe on each other often, the work has to be done in the building during the day and at home at night.\n\n\"Everyone is going to do the absolute best they can do, knowing that it's impossible to totally eliminate the risk,\" said Vikings head athletic trainer and vice president of sports medicine Eric Sugarman, who is the team's infection control officer. He tested positive for COVID-19 last month.\n\nAs far as the tall task of making it through a full season, well, the fiercely competitive nature of its participants ought to work in pro football's favor.\n\n\"It's going to come down to whoever handles the situation the best. That's who's going to be at the top at the end, and I feel like we're taking all the right steps,\" Green Bay Packers defensive tackle Kenny Clark said. \"You walk in here, you get tested, there's sanitizers everywhere. You know, the masks, everything that we're doing, they're serious about getting us ready to be able to play and keeping us healthy.\"",

    "Why do we develop lifelong immunity to some diseases, but not others?": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.\n\nSome diseases, like the measles, infect us once and usually grant us immunity for life. For others, like the flu, we have to get vaccinated year after year.\n\nSo why do we develop lifelong immunity to some diseases but not others? And where does the novel coronavirus fit into all this?\n\nWhether or not we develop immunity to a disease often depends on our antibodies, which are proteins we produce in response to infection. Antibodies are one of the body's most well-known defenses: They coat invading cells and, in the best case, prevent those invaders from hijacking our cells and replicating. After we clear an infection, antibody levels often wane, but at least a few stick around, ready to ramp up production again if that same disease attacks again. That's why an antibody test can tell you if you were infected in the past. It's also what keeps us from getting sick a second time -- usually.\n\nCORONAVIRUS: WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW\n\n\"The body doesn't really forget,\" said Marc Jenkins, an immunologist at the University of Minnesota Medical School. Usually, when we get reinfected with a disease, it's not because our body has lost immunity. We get reinfected either because the pathogen mutated and our immune system no longer recognizes it, or because our bodies tend to mount a much lower immune response, he said.\n\nTake the flu. This is a virus that can change its genes easily, Jenkins said. Just as our immune systems kill off one version of the virus, another emerges that our immune systems don't recognize. Not all viruses mutate so readily. For example, the poliovirus can't easily change its genome, Jenkins said. That's why we've been so successful at (almost) eradicating it.\n\nThe common cold, and other viruses that don't typically get past our upper respiratory tract, reinfect us not necessarily because they mutate rapidly, but because our body doesn't usually produce many antibodies against these pathogens in the first place, said Mark Slifka, an immunologist at the Oregon National Primate Research Center. \"Our bodies are not worried about the upper respiratory tract,\" he said. That's what we're seeing with mild cases of COVID-19. The virus sticks to the upper respiratory tract, where the body does not treat it like a threat. In a 2020 preprint study (meaning it hasn't been peer-reviewed yet) published in the database MedRxiv, 10 out of 175 patients who had mild symptoms recovered from COVID-19 without developing detectable antibodies.\n\nFor diseases that don't fall into either of these categories -- meaning they don't mutate rapidly and they generally prompt a strong immune response -- immunity tends to last much longer. A 2007 study published in the New England Journal of Medicine found that it would take more than 200 years for even half of your antibodies to disappear after a measles or a mumps infection. The same study found similar results for Epstein-Barr virus, which causes mono. Still, antibody responses don't always last a lifetime. That same study found that it takes around 50 years to lose half of our chickenpox antibodies, and 11 years to lose half of our tetanus antibodies. That means that without a booster shot, you could theoretically become infected with one of these diseases as an adult.\n\nScientists still aren't sure why we maintain our antibody responses longer for some diseases compared with others. It's possible that some of these more common diseases, such as chickenpox and mono, actually are reinfecting us more frequently than we realize, but that the antibodies we do have crush the infection before we notice, Jenkins said. And in those cases, the immune system would be at full capacity again and again because of the reinfections. \"It keeps our immunity vigilant,\" he noted. In contrast, \"with tetanus, we're probably very rarely getting exposed, we're not stepping on a [dirty] nail very often.\"\n\nOther scientists point out that the human immune system is trained to target pathogens that \"look\" a certain way, Slifka said. Bacteria and viruses tend to be symmetrical with a repetitive pattern of proteins across their surfaces. (Think about COVID-19 -- it's a ball with evenly spaced spikes all over it.) One theory suggests that we mount a larger and longer-lasting immune response to more repetitive-looking pathogens. For example, the antibodies we produce against variola, the highly repetitively-structured smallpox virus, last a lifetime. Tetanus, however, isn't repetitive at all. It's the toxin produced by tetanus bacteria, not the bacteria itself, that makes us sick. Based on this theory, it's possible that our bodies aren't as well-trained to target this single, asymmetrical protein, Slifka said.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR COMPLETE CORONAVIRUS COVERAGE\n\nSo, will immunity to the new coronavirus -- whether that comes from infection or a vaccine -- be as long-lived as our immunity to smallpox, or will we need a new vaccine every year? While it's true that some people aren't mounting large antibody responses, Jenkins is still hopeful for the former. All the evidence both from natural infections and from vaccine trials suggest that most people are making neutralizing antibodies, the variety that prevents viruses from entering our cells, Jenkins said. And unlike the flu, SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, isn't mutating quickly, Jenkins noted.\n\n\"This virus has the features of viruses that we've been very successful in vaccinating against,\" Jenkins said.",

        "body": "College students can safely return to school this fall if they are tested for the coronavirus every two to three days, strictly observe social distancing and \"adhere to basic prevention practices,\" the lead author of a new study told \"The Story\" Monday.\n\n\"The analysis shows that there is a safe way to reopen college where the key element of the plan is screening all students for the virus at very high frequency every two or three days using a rapid, inexpensive test alongside strict, vigilant adherence to social distancing and other basic prevention practices,\" Yale School of Public Health professor A. David Paltiel told host Sandra Smith.\n\nThe study, which used digital simulations to track how the virus would spread among a hypothetical cohort of 5,000 students, was conducted by researchers from the Yale School of Public Health, Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School.\n\nPaltiel added that if university officials \"could choose between testing every two or three days with a test that was pretty good and pretty inexpensive or a much more accurate test at higher costs, and only take it once a week, you would take the first one.\"\n\nHowever, he emphasized, \"social distancing has to go hand-in-hand with the frequent testing program\" to properly contain the virus.\n\nWHICH COLLEGES COMMITTED TO ONLINE LEARNING FOR FALL 2020?\n\nThe study comes as academic institutions across the country grapple with how to educate students during the coronavirus pandemic. Many colleges have announced alternatives to in-person courses when the fall 2020 semester begins.\n\nPaltiel's study estimated the frequent screening would cost $470 per student per semester, according to the Washington Post. The professor acknowledged Monday that \"our recommendation may very well be beyond the financial and logistical reach of many universities ... I don't think it's prohibitively expensive, but that's for the schools and the students and their families to decide for themselves.\"\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe professor went on to warn that some colleges \"are considering the option of carefully monitoring students for just symptoms of COVID and using those signs [or] symptoms to trigger testing and isolation and contact tracing.\n\n\"We explored thousands of scenarios and we've failed to find even one possible circumstance under which that would be sufficient and the reason is pretty clear,\" he added. \"This is a virus that is very easily spread asymptomatically by silent spreaders. You can't play catch up with this virus.\"\n\nHe added, \"Schools that test and respond only when symptoms have been observed is like a fire department that responds only to calls when the house is already burned to the ground.\"",

Cosmetic procedures are generally not covered by insurance and the bill can range from a couple of thousand dollars for eyelid surgery or a facelift to $25,000 for a whole body makeover.\n\nRecent patrons of cosmetic surgeons explained that because they no longer have the ability to spend on travel, ticketed events or other luxuries, they've been able to redirect their spending.\n\nBefore the infectious disease gripped the United States, cosmetic surgery had been on the decline. Instead, Americans favored minimal tweaks, like lip-fillers and Botox injections.\n\nThe American Society of Plastic Surgeons says that over the past 20 years, the number of injectable procedures has seen an increase of 878%, while facelifts and eyelid surgeries have fallen.\n\nOne doctor told the Times she had \"never done so many facelifts in a summer as [she'd] done this year\" and that \"pretty much every facelift patient that comes in says '[they've] been doing these Zoom calls and ... look terrible.'\"\n\nThe pandemic has predictably hurt mental health in the U.S.\n\nAn even heavier reliance on social media to fill downtime for those in solitude coupled with unhealthier habits and the constant use of Zoom and FaceTime makes for a dangerous combination.\n\nAt the beginning of the month, NBC News reported that Zoom users around the world were experiencing worsened symptoms of body dysmorphia during their frequent video calls.\n\nOne in four young adults between the age of 18 and 24 also reported having seriously considered suicide in the 30 days before completing the same survey.",
