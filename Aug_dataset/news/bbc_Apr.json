    "'Cabin fever': Sailors tell of months stuck on ships": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "Seafarers across the world are stuck on their ships, spending months without shore leave as ports ban crew transfers.\n\nWhile most are being paid and some are getting extra pay, they are doing their jobs without the expected breaks, often 12 hours a day and seven days a week.\n\nSince March, many ports are refusing to allow crew changes or shore leave, meaning for some that a three-month contract becomes almost twice as long.\n\nMost crew members say they've had contracts extended in the past, when illness or bad weather delays their relief crew. But mariners with long memories say a situation like this, with no end in sight, is unprecedented.\n\n\"We are all stuck out here and we don't know what to do,\" says an officer on a tanker vessel.\n\n\"Everybody's waiting as to what your home country will do. Only when the home country is ready to accept their own citizens, we can go home.\"\n\nThe hardest part is not the length of time on board.\n\nIt's the fact that they don't know the length of time they'll spend on board\n\n\"We have been under pressure for quite some time. It takes a toll on your mental health. If you don't know what's going to happen it's more frustrating mentally on you,\" the officer says.\n\nThe BBC has interviewed crews on tanker vessels, container ships and cruise liners.\n\nMost don't want to be named as they have not been authorised by their employers to speak to the media. While shipping is a critical industry for global trade, it's also one which faces many challenges - previously amid US-China trade tensions and now the economic effects of coronavirus.\n\nOver the decades, the trend has been towards larger ships and smaller, cheaper crews in order to cut costs in a competitive market.\n\nThe tanker officer should have been on a three-month contract, but he will spend almost six on his ship. Once he does get home, he says he expects to be in quarantine for up to a month to help stop the spread of the virus.\n\n\"On top of that, you will be worried you don't catch it, and if you do catch it you don't give it to your loved ones.\"\n\nBefore the prospect of quarantine, he needs a port that will let him off, and where there are flights home. If a planned flight is cancelled, he'll be put back on his vessel. Until then, he is stuck, and his company has no news for him.\n\nA particular kick in the teeth was when his home country of India suspended the visas of the crew meant to relieve him, he said.\n\nHe was forced to sail away rather than take some shore leave to see his family.\n\nMost officers will spend three to five months on a ship before they are relieved, and may then have the same amount of time as rest at home. For more junior crew, stints can be nine months, but with shore leave in between.\n\nAs well as not knowing when their contracts will end, a ban on shore leave is what makes the current situation particularly unpleasant, according to an officer on a container ship.\n\n\"Morale is quite low, especially because you can't go out ashore and without that by definition it's cabin fever,\" he says.\n\n\"You're working all the time in the same environment, everyone's groggy, everyone wants to go home, people start making small mistakes and it gets you down. We are trying our best to get along with each other.\"\n\nWhile longer time together is helping build some camaraderie, things are still hard, he says.\n\nWithout a break ashore, or a drink - his vessel is dry - \"it's just Groundhog Day every single day.\"\n\nHis ship makes plenty of stops, which would usually mean plenty of opportunities to see a new city and have some respite. But many Asian ports now demand to see two weeks pass between stops to show that no crew have developed symptoms. It means he may not be able to leave for weeks.\n\nFor the ratings, more junior crew, it can be harder. A steward on his ship is creeping towards a year on board and still getting up at dawn to cook the crew meals.\n\nLockdown hasn't affected the maintenance necessary for running a ship and there's plenty to do for everyone, from navigational duties to maintaining fire safety gear and lifeboats.\n\nHis company has given $1,000 (\u00a3802) to each ship to kit the crew out with any personal items they might need. But at about $40 per crew member, and because of the mark-up a ship's chandler (supplier) charges, it only stretches to basics like toothpaste, soap and razor blades. His employer didn't respond to a request for comment.\n\nMost crew would like more information from their employers, and a little more effort from governments.\n\n\"I see a lot of repatriations - everything organised for holidaymakers - but for sailors it's basically nothing,\" said our container ship officer.\n\nIt's a familiar feeling for mariners, he said, \"They call it sea blindness.\" About 95% of imports and exports for the UK are moved by sea. Yet the industry is low on the public agenda, he feels.\n\nSafe procedures for crew changes would be a good place to start, he said. Some ports are showing early signs of starting this, he said, but the wait is still unknown.\n\nUntil ports do reopen, recorded movies and TV shows as well as patchy internet connections are all that entertain them.\n\n\"A lot of people end up just going back to their cabins and sitting on their phones and watching the same movie again and again,\" he adds. \"There's nothing to look forward to.\"\n\nBut perhaps they are the lucky ones, as they are still being paid. For Matt Burton, who works as an officer on a survey vessel in the offshore oil industry, he would rather be stuck on a ship earning money. He has been a mariner for 32 years. In common with many sailors, if he's not aboard a ship, he's not being paid.\n\n\"I'd rather be there earning money, to be frank, absolutely,\" he said. \"I'm used to being stuck on for longer. I have been stuck on board three or four times, I've done four months when it's supposed to be two months. Things happen, your relief gets called away unexpectedly so they don't have anybody for you.\"\n\nIt's not an easy choice, he admits. Four months compared to two is a tall order.\n\nMr Burton says he applied to work temporarily on UK ships that might themselves be lacking relief crew as visas are cancelled and international workers make their way home.\n\nBut he has heard nothing back, \"so I'm sitting at home twiddling my thumbs. Waiting for borders to open up things to start running again.\"\n\nFor cruise ships, it's a different story.\n\nAccording to one guide on an Antarctic cruise, crew were asked to take huge pay cuts while on board after their original contracts expired, and were only allowed off after sailing all the way to the Canary Islands, nearly a month beyond their planned contracts, passing open ports along the way.\n\nDuring the voyage back, her ship picked up crew from other liners, including one where cases of coronavirus were reported.\n\nThe BBC requested comment from seven of the largest container and tanker companies in the world on how they will be aiding crews stuck at sea and the unemployed ashore. MSC Mediterranean Shipping Company, the second-largest container firm, responded. Ports are starting to open up to crew changes, it insists.\n\n\"For cargo vessels, there are still certain ports where shipping lines can relieve their crew and in past weeks thanks to the recognition by the UN International Maritime Organization and various governments recognising seafarers as key workers, many ports are now allowing crew changes,\" it said.\n\nOrient Overseas Container Line praised its crews and \"their excellent professionalism, dedication and contributions to keeping the cargo moving.\" It said it will be \"keeping a close eye on policy and regulatory updates and maintaining close communications with our colleagues at sea to ensure they are well taken care of.\"\n\nThe sailors who contributed anonymously to this article do not work for either of those two shipping companies.",

        "body": "Five rashes, including Covid toe, are affecting some hospital patients diagnosed with Covid-19, a small study by Spanish doctors has found.\n\nThe rashes tended to appear in younger people and lasted several days.\n\nIt is not uncommon for a rash to be a symptom of a virus, such as the spots that indicate chicken pox.\n\nBut the researchers said they were surprised to see so many varieties of rash with Covid-19.\n\nRashes are not currently included in the list of symptoms of the illness.\n\nThere have been many reports about \"Covid toe\" - a rash appearing on Covid patients' feet even in the absence of other symptoms - but lead researcher Dr Ignacio Garcia-Doval said the most common form of rash in the study was maculopapules - small, flat and raised red bumps that tend to appear on the torso.\n\n\"It is strange to see several different rashes - and some of them are quite specific,\" Dr Garcia-Doval told the BBC.\n\n\"It usually appears later on, after the respiratory manifestation of the disease - so it's not good for diagnosing patients,\" he added.\n\nAll the patients in the study were already in hospital and had respiratory symptoms.\n\nThe peer-reviewed paper was published this week in the British Journal of Dermatology.\n\nAll dermatologists in Spain were asked to share details of Covid patients they had seen who had developed rashes in the previous two weeks. There were 375 in total.\n\nThe five rashes were:\n\nHowever, the researchers stressed that rashes can have many causes, and it can be difficult to differentiate between them without medical expertise.\n\n\"The relevance of this study is not so much in helping people self-diagnose, but rather to help build our wider understanding of how the infection can affect people,\" said Dr Ruth Murphy, president of the British Association of Dermatologists.\n\nDr Michael Head at the University of Southampton said that rashes were a well-known side effect of many viral infections, including pneumonia.\n\n\"With Covid-19, rashes and skin ulcers have been noted in a few per cent of hospitalised patients. We don't yet know the extent of these links, or precisely why this inflammation occurs in some patients but not others.\"",

        "body": "A 21-year-old who spent a week in intensive care fighting coronavirus has told BBC Scotland she thought she was going to die.\n\nLily Burns, who had no underlying health conditions, is now recovering at home and believes it is a \"miracle\" she is still alive thanks to NHS staff.\n\nLily, from Fort William, had initially gone into hospital with a suspected kidney infection.\n\nBut she rapidly deteriorated and Covid-19 attacked all her internal organs.\n\nShe told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme she had been doing a run in aid of the NHS when she first started to feel unwell.\n\n\"I'd come home and was still feeling sick,\" she said. \"We went to out-of-hours but they thought it was a kidney infection. A high temperature was the only coronavirus symptom I had.\n\n\"Because of Covid they didn't want me going into hospital so they sent me home and told me to go to A&E if I got any worse.\"\n\nLily continued to be sick so went into A&E during the night and was admitted with a kidney infection.\n\nShe had an initial test for Covid-19 but it was negative.\n\nShe started to feel a bit better but was sent to Raigmore Hospital as a precaution after a second test came back positive.\n\n\"By the time I got to Raigmore, I had deteriorated,\" she said. \"The Covid had attacked all my internal organs - my heart, my liver, my kidneys.\n\n\"They tried to give me oxygen through my nose, but because I needed so much of it, my body couldn't take it through my nose so they had to put me under sedation and that was me for seven days.\n\n\"The only thing I remember was getting out of the ambulance and being in a room with about 8-10 doctors. It was a bit overwhelming for me and I got a fright.\n\n\"When I came back round after the seven days [under sedation on a ventilator] I thought I'd only been sleeping for one.\"\n\nOnce she started to recover, Lily was able to have daily conversations with her family on Facetime.\n\n\"I think I looked pretty scary,\" she said. \"I think it was way more traumatic for them than it was for me.\"\n\nAfter weeks in hospital and now back at home, she said: \"I'm feeling very emotional about everything now. With me nearly not coming through, my friends have been coming over to the house with gifts, but obviously they can't come anywhere near me, so that's very hard.\"\n\nIn a Facebook post she said: \"I need to take this time to thank the intensive care unit in Raigmore who I literally owe my life to, their practise [sic], support and ability to make me laugh was world-class and these truly are lives [sic] heroes.\"\n\nIn another post she wrote: \"I can't begin to explain the impact this has had on my life. I will never ever be taking anyone or anything for granted.\n\n\"I can only be thankful it was me as I could never ever of coped watching one of my family or friends go through what they had to witness.\"\n\nOn Good Morning Scotland, she added: \"I would advise everyone to stick to the restrictions because after what my family went through, I wouldn't want to put anyone else through that.\"",

She has sat with several residents as they passed away having contracted Covid-19.\n\nShe told BBC News NI she was convinced some residents had \"died before their time\".\n\nSeveral days before our interview took place two residents died within 12 hours of each other.\n\n\"I feel as though I am on autopilot - it never leaves my head. Sometimes I worry that I could have done more,\" she said.\n\n\"These are sad times, scary times too,\" she added.\n\nReferring to the female residents as her \"wee ladies\", Siobhan recalls one particular grandmother who passed away.\n\n\"I came in specially to sit with her on my day off. We knew she was dying,\" she said.\n\n\"I played music and stroked her hand and forehead.\n\n\"She had always taken care of her appearance so another care worker and I tonged her hair, painted her nails and put perfume on her.\n\n\"I sat with her all day. I wouldn't let her die on her own. When she did pass it was just so terribly sad.\"\n\nWhen asked why she did it she said, \"because I love each and every one of them.\"\n\n\"It is so hard for the families. I have to turn away when we FaceTime them with their relative,\" she explained.\n\n\"They are saying to their mum, 'I love you' and they are never going to see her again.\n\n\"Once they leave the home in the coffin that is it,\" she added.\n\nSix residents have died in the home with Covid-19. Those are the cases that have been confirmed, there is a feeling there have been more.\n\nSiobhan told me staff felt not enough was done to prepare them for the pandemic and that workers like her were left to the side.\n\n\"I feel we were left on our own. We as workers were forgotten about as well as the wee residents,\" she said.\n\n\"At the start of all this I just wanted to scream at somebody - could someone please come and help these wee residents? I just didn't want them to die before their time.\"\n\n\"I watched what was happening in other countries and you knew it was coming, but there didn't seem to be an awful lot happening to prepare us.\"\n\nTo date the care home has also dealt with more than 20 positive cases.\n\nFor staff like Siobhan the care is challenging, especially as the residents are men and women with dementia, who do not understand what is going on.\n\nShe feels strongly that some in her care home died \"before their time.\"\n\n\"They are elderly, frail with dementia. Some died before their time, definitely,\" she said.\n\n\"They had no way of describing their symptoms and at the start we just didn't know what exactly we were dealing with,\" she added.\n\n\"Testing would have made such a big difference as we would have known those residents had Covid, we would have known who had it from an earlier stage which would have prevented it from spreading.\"\n\n\"As staff we knew if we were feeling unwell and could speak to our manager.\n\n\"Then we took time off and got tested. But for the wee residents sure they didn't know what was going on as some didn't have a cough or a temperature and could not communicate how they were feeling. \"\n\nSiobhan told BBC News NI she is living in fear of contracting the illness, bringing it home and even bringing it into the care home.\n\n\"That's why all staff need tested and frequently. Sure I might not have it today but I could show positive in a few days.\n\n\"I wear the PPE, but I just don't feel safe. I'd feel so guilty bringing it in here,\" she said.\n\nSiobhan has attended funerals of residents where numbers are strictly limited due to social distancing rules.\n\n\"That's hard too. We are honoured to be included in the 10 people standing there but that just shows you how close we are and how much we are regarded as family.\"",

        "body": "More than 80,000 people with a range of health conditions have received letters from the Department of Health advising them to self-isolate and remain indoors for 12 weeks.\n\nBut despite the loneliness and other difficulties presented by isolation, many would still be reluctant to venture out.\n\nBBC News NI has spoken to a number of those who have not left the house since March.\n\nAngela Barry (39), a mother of two from Crumlin, County Antrim, has a rare condition known as neuromyelitisOptica (NMO).\n\n\"Nobody knows how I would react because I am immune-suppressed.\n\n\"So, we just don't know how I would be if I were to get Covid-19 or to go near anybody with Covid-19 symptoms.\n\n\"So, I just have to stay away and that's what I have been doing since the 13 March.\n\n\"It has been hard.\n\n\"I haven't been to the shops. I have been taking a walk up to the fields and up to the cow sheds with my two little ones because we live in the country.\n\n\"It has been tough not being able to go to the shops or see my family.\n\n\"My four-year-old has autism, so trying to explain to him has been hard as well. He wants to see his granny and granda, and I want to see my mummy and daddy. But we just can't.\n\n\"I do struggle but you have to just get yourself up - you go to bed thinking I am going to have to do the exact same thing as I did today because I can't go anywhere.\"\n\n\"I have been locked down since the 13 March, it's not worth me going anywhere now. I have come this far. I have been through a lot worse.\n\n\"I just take every day as it comes now.\n\n\"I'd love to go out and see my friends and socially distance from them but the risks are just too high.\n\n\"So, it's looking like September for me unfortunately.\"\n\nMagi Hogg, 58, from Glengormley, has a lung condition but said she was surprised to receive the Department of Health shielding letter.\n\n\"It just made it all too real.\n\n\"I knew I had this lung condition but I got by. And it was only seeing it in black and white that the government considers me a vulnerable person.\n\n\"I found that very hard to get my head round because I would have classed myself as a person to help others rather than having to depend on people helping me.\n\n\"I parked my car on Thursday 19 March and other than taking the bins out I haven't left the house.\n\n\"There were a lot of tears and a lot of emotions the first couple of weeks and it didn't take much to trigger the tears.\n\n\"The emotional side has settled and I am just asking one day at a time. I have stopped counting the days because I thought that wasn't healthy.\n\n\"I will do it as long as it takes because it's better than the alternative of going into hospital.\"\n\n\"I know I can do it.\n\n\"There are key workers going to work every day facing all sorts. I am only being asked to sit in my house and it's comfortable.\"\n\nJim Kilpatrick from Donaghadee had a liver transplant in King's College Hospital in London in 2018, after suffering liver failure. He lives with his wife and daughter.\n\n\"Being safe is vitally important for those that are in this position where they are a transplant patient.\n\n\"If it's someone who has had heart, kidney, lungs, liver, it doesn't matter, you're a transplant patient and you fall automatically under what the government defines as extremely vulnerable.\n\n\"When you think that someone, somewhere has been your donor, the last thing you want to do is put any risk against your continued good health and therefore shielding is the correct thing to do, and I haven't come across any of our patients who have queried that at all.\n\n\"When we're retired we tend to do things in a different way.\n\n\"We don't have work companions. We have friends, we have family and we have friends that we call on, and when you can't do that, it becomes very difficult.\n\n\"When you're in this category, where you need to be extremely careful, it is going to be difficult to go back to the normal things that we did and the way that we did them.\n\n\"I'm very pragmatic. We are where we are at the moment. I don't find it difficult, but I know others do.\n\n\"It's there for our health and our safety, and if it has to continue for a few more weeks, so be it.\n\n\"It just makes the joy at the end of it, whenever we can get back with our family and friends, all the greater.\"",

    "'I returned to nursing the day the pandemic was declared'": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "On 11 March Hannah MacDonald returned to work as a nurse. Due to mental ill health her last shift had been 12 years before. March 11 was also the day the World Health Organisation declared Covid-19 a global pandemic.\n\nHannah \"always had a heart\" for caring, even as a child, but by the time she was 18 she had faced multiple traumas: \"I'd had a friend who had drowned, a friend who had taken their own life, and a friend who had been murdered.\"\n\nShe didn't attend the funerals and no one talked to her about the deaths. Instead, she buried the pain and moved on with her life.\n\nFirst she studied at the Royal School of Needlework at Hampton Court Palace then she moved into nursing and worked at a London hospital with HIV patients. It was a job she loved, but it was emotionally challenging.\n\n\"I was seeing other people's pain, and then I just couldn't deal with the emotional pain that was inside me,\" she says.\n\nOver five years, the suppressed trauma related to her friends deaths grew - she wasn't sleeping or eating properly.\n\n\"I was doing quite a good job as a nurse, but actually it was all coming on top of me and then I just broke. I think it was nursing triggering that pain.\"\n\nHannah had been seeing a psychologist. But one session, before a shift, he showed concern.\n\n\"He asked me if I'd ever thought of suicide and I said 'yes', and then he asked me if I'd done anything towards trying to do that and I went silent.\"\n\nHe took her to the emergency psychiatric service where Hannah was seen by a doctor for a mental health assessment. It was decided she needed to be detained under the Mental Health Act.\n\n\"That was just terrifying,\" she says. \"I didn't actually know what was happening to me. Because I was a nurse people thought that I might understand, but I had no clue what was going on.\"\n\nShe was taken to a secure unit at a London hospital. Her nurses uniform still in her bag.\n\n\"In that very first moment my whole world just fell apart. I remember just thinking 'that's it, I'm never going to be a nurse again'.\"\n\nHer comfort, embroidery, was also confiscated - the scissors and needles deemed too dangerous.\n\nHannah was diagnosed with borderline personality disorder (BPD), which affects mood and how a person interacts with others. She believes it stemmed from the unresolved grief of her childhood.\n\nAccording to the NHS, symptoms include emotional instability with often negative, suicidal, thoughts, impulsive behaviour such as self-harm and intense but unstable relationships.\n\n\"You lose how you see yourself. You lose your hopes because you think who's going to want to have a relationship with me now? You then have to deal with the stigma, the self-stigma, but also the losses of physically going into hospital.\n\n\"I was meeting people who had been in that system for 20 years and I just thought, 'this is now my life'.\"\n\nBut there were moments of positivity.\n\nWhen Hannah was \"really unwell\" her friends at the Royal School of Needlework invited her to work on a \"secret project\".\n\n\"I walked in and there was white lace everywhere. It was the Duchess of Cambridge's wedding dress. It was a wonderful, wonderful thing to work on.\"\n\nShe spent eight days on the project which the world marvelled at.\n\nAfterwards, the Duchess visited the craftspeople involved, but by then Hannah had returned to the secure unit.\n\n\"When I said that I'd worked on her dress one of the nurses actually thought I was deluded.\n\n\"That actually was a really beautiful thing for me to work on at that time. It will go with me for the rest of my life.\"\n\nAfter five difficult years, Hannah was referred to Cassel Hospital in west London, a therapeutic community where patients and therapists live alongside each other and contribute to everything - cooking, group therapy, even supporting each other through the night.\n\nAlthough she was sceptical, she found the peer support extraordinarily helpful - \"the patients understand more than the staff do sometimes\" - and credits that with her recovery.\n\nIt gave Hannah the confidence to return to nursing - a two-year process.\n\nSome medics supported her, while others insisted she be assessed by a private psychiatrist. She found it infuriating that some NHS doctors questioned the validity of their own treatment.\n\n\"I became really determined then, to show that people can come through serious mental illness.\"\n\nEarlier this year, Hannah was offered the job at a hospice. The start date was 11 March.\n\nListen to more from Hannah on the BBC Ouch Cabin Fever podcast as she talks about her experience of the mental health system and her recovery.\n\nFor more Disability News, follow BBC Ouch on Twitter and Facebook, and subscribe to the podcast.\n\n\"There was anxiety, but I just sort of went in and said 'I've come back to work after 12 years of illness'.\n\n\"The lady who interviewed me really believed in me. She could see some of the skills that I'd learnt through my own illness could actually be really beneficial to palliative care.\"\n\nEven though working with people who are close to the end of their life is difficult, Hannah thrives in the environment.\n\n\"There's something very beautiful about palliative care nursing - it's about trying to give what you can for families and patients in the last bit of their life. For me, it's realising it's not my pain.\"\n\nCoronavirus has changed how hospices operate. Only one visitor is allowed, celebrations like birthdays are on hold and staff wear PPE.\n\nThe past 12 years makes Hannah worry what could await the general mental health of the country when this pandemic passes.\n\n\"My mental illness was unresolved grief, where I didn't say goodbye,\" she says at a time when funerals and final moments are being by-passed or minimised due to lockdown restrictions.\n\n\"I find that quite heart-breaking. As the years go on I think that will be some of the pain that is left behind by Coronavirus.\"\n\nit's these wider concerns which make her want to tell her story.\n\nAnd although it has been a long process, she achieved her goal, recovered, and returned to nursing.",

    "'I've done the blame game, isolation is my life for a year'": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "People with some serious medical conditions have been told to stay indoors for at least 12 weeks, without leaving home for food or exercise and avoiding any close contact - even with loved ones. The BBC has been following some of their stories.\n\nWhile the rest of the UK looks to ease the lockdown, for nearly two million \"extremely vulnerable people\" - who might have severe respiratory illnesses, some cancers or conditions treated with drugs that suppress the immune system - the situation is less certain for as long as the virus circulates.\n\nEngland's Deputy Chief Medical Officer Jenny Harries said on Saturday that some of their conditions might be reviewed as lower risk, but other people might face \"a very long period of time\" in isolation.\n\nSo how have this \"shielding\" group coped over six weeks and what does the future hold for them?\n\nFor Angela Steatham, adjusting to life in isolation has been \"like a bereavement process\".\n\nShe's been through a bit of anger and frustration (\"I wanted to scream at everybody and say, stop moaning!\"). She's looked for someone to blame (\"It's the government's fault\"). But now she has come to accept that her chronic lymphocytic leukaemia - a blood cancer which can severely damage the immune system - means that she is unlikely to be able to leave her cottage in north Wales for a long time.\n\n\"I think I've mentally prepared myself now, this has to be my way of life now for a year or more,\" she says.\n\nThe 56-year-old has begun to focus on how she wants her life to be in this enforced semi-retirement, taking up art again and planting a herb garden. In her previous life, travelling internationally as a psychologist and leadership coach, the plants would never have survived, she says.\n\nShe and her partner Simon are still unable to spend time in the same room together, in case he is exposed to the virus while running errands for his 90-year-old mother. Even the shopping gets disinfected when it comes into her quarantine zone\n\n\"It would only take one slip for me to get it, then all of this would be for nothing,\" she says.\n\nBefore coronavirus, Rachael Paget would usually expect to see more than a hundred people a day: classes of lively kids that she teaches, the other school staff, a quick family visit on the way home. In those days, it was almost a relief to return to her home in Warrington, where she lives alone. But in the past six weeks her closest human contact has been her dad, dropping off some shopping from the supermarket.\n\n\"He'll knock and go to the end of the drive and I can see him - but that's pretty much it. I've not really seen anybody. I miss it a lot,\" she says.\n\n\"It's frustrating. I've never really considered myself vulnerable,\" she says. She was born with a congenital heart defect and three years ago the sudden onset of severe asthma left her on a ventilator, but she says she's always been encouraged to \"just get on with it\".\n\nThe 35-year-old continues to teach online, but expects she won't be there when schools go back. The year 11 prom has been rescheduled for October, and she doubts she will be there to celebrate the achievements of a group she has watched with pride as they have grown up.\n\n\"It will be much harder once the world starts to go on and you can't,\" she says.\n\n\"Until we get a vaccine I can't really see the vulnerable group being back into mainstream,\" says Michael Winehouse, a charity fundraiser who has cystic fibrosis, a genetic condition which clogs the lungs and puts him at risk of infections. He's been adjusting to the reality of what that means, missing the freedom to go swimming, shop at Tesco, or stroll to the end of the drive even, while others post pictures on social media of their daily exercise.\n\n\"There is that little bit of me that thinks, I'd really love that now, it's been ages. And it doesn't look like that is going to change for a very, very long time,\" he says.\n\nIt could mean missing out on a lot. He's due to be best man at a wedding in October and has organised the stag do. Friends on WhatsApp are chatting about a post-lockdown party in July. But it's doubtful he will be able to attend. At the moment, his wife Amy and four-year-old son Oscar are shielding with him, with none of the family leaving the house. But they face a major dilemma when his wife's furlough ends or his son begins Year 1 in September.\n\nIf Amy and Oscar leave Michael in isolation they could face having to change their clothes and disinfect themselves at the door, hoping they don't accidentally bring the virus home, he says.\n\n\"Are we going to be continually watching and waiting to see if someone has caught the symptoms? Or do we stay away from school and work until a vaccine comes and we can all get it? I just don't know.\"\n\nIf you'd asked Rachel Hall a week or two ago, she would have said shielding isn't that bad. The 31-year-old - who is on immunosuppressant medication to treat lupus, a condition where an overactive immune system attacks healthy cells in the body - says that you adapt, get into your own routine, spend time planning meals and what TV shows you want to watch.\n\nIt helps that she's at home in Kent with her husband: both of them furloughed from their jobs in the construction industry and shielding together.\n\n\"I'm always surprised that me and my husband haven't argued,\" she says. \"Because I keep hearing all these stories about couples breaking up and we've been having a nice time actually, finally getting to spend some time together!\"\n\nBut last week was different, as important family milestones - her father's birthday, her sister's engagement - passed her by while she was isolated. Her sister and brother still live with their parents so the whole family was celebrating. \"I was just on my phone watching it. It was a bit upsetting, to be honest,\" she says.\n\nHer grandmother also recently left hospital after being treated for Covid-19. \"I can't go and see her and say, I'm here for you, I'm happy that you got better,\" says Rachel.\n\nBut her grandmother's experience has also underlined why it has been necessary for Rachel to isolate herself. \"Just to see what it's done to her body and knowing how weak my immune system is at the moment, I know it's been necessary to stay at home. This has been the right thing to do.\"",

    "'Massive' challenge of coronavirus rehab care": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "Providing ongoing support to patients recovering from Covid-19 will be a \"massive\" challenge for the NHS, say specialists.\n\nOccupational therapy and physiotherapy organisations told BBC Wales a national strategy for rehab would be required.\n\nThey claim provision is \"patchy\" and without help people's lives will be harmed.\n\nThe Welsh Government said it had announced an extra \u00a310m to help people recovering from coronavirus.\n\nMaking sure effective support is in place will be key, according to Dai Davies, from the Royal College of Occupational Therapists in Wales.\n\nHe said coronavirus patients were experiencing extreme weakness and fatigue, breathlessness and neurological symptoms like anxiety.\n\nThe effects could last for months, he warned, with occupational therapists (OTs) involved \"from the start\".\n\nDr Davies said: \"It's hard when you've gone from a fully functioning member of society to struggling to get dressed, so that's another major issue our OTs are working on.\"\n\nAs well as helping hospital patients he predicted staff would be attending to many of the 80,000 vulnerable people \"shielding\" at home in Wales.\n\n\"We really need the services to be there to meet the needs of those people,\" Dr Davies said.\n\n\"Rehab is going to be massive for us in the future.\"\n\nHe said he wanted all UK governments to ensure rehab was central to their health and social care models, with \"multidisciplinary teams\" of therapists in the community.\n\nCalum Higgins, of the Chartered Society of Physiotherapy, said the crisis should lead to an NHS culture change so rehabilitation was considered a patient's right.\n\n\"This will save both money and time for the health service,\" Mr Higgins said.\n\n\"Experience shows that if you don't offer appropriate rehab what happens is that people eventually end up coming back in a worse condition.\"\n\nA Welsh Government spokesman said it anticipated \"increasing demand\" for rehab from people recovering from coronavirus.\n\n\"The health minister has announced an extra \u00a310m to support people recovering from coronavirus, including enhanced home care packages,\" a spokesman said.\n\nEdna Unsworth, 88, was discharged from hospital after recovering from Covid-19.\n\nShe said staff at Glan Clwyd Hospital in Denbighshire \"couldn't do enough\" for her.\n\nMs Unsworth, from Rhyl, was handed a self-isolation pack of food, toiletries and activities to help with mental health and daily routines.\n\n\"When they do go home from hospital it's going to be quite a worrying time for them and their families and we just felt that a bit of support with the packs and tips would give them that confidence and reassurance,\" explained Alana MacPherson, the occupational therapist behind the idea.\n\nJamy Ashton, an occupational therapy chief at the Betsi Cadwaladr health board, said there would be a \"huge role\" for staff responding to coronavirus.\n\n\"To come in with a new diagnosis, a scary diagnosis and to have your friends and family not to be able to be in with you, makes it all the more challenging,\" she said.\n\n\"We've done a lot of support work, a lot of counselling and working closely with patients on their goals with them to get them back home again.\"\n\nThe occupational therapist in charge of Ms Unsworth's rehabilitation in hospital, Lindsey Macintyre, has been redeployed from working in the community with young people.\n\nShe said: \"Even when they lift the lockdown there'll be all the people who've been self-isolating, all the elderly people, who've become deconditioned at home, patients who would usually have come into hospital but haven't, and we'll have to try to rehabilitate them back to their usual independence.\"\n\nBack home, Ms Unsworth will be visited twice a day by technical instructor Beth Jones.\n\n\"It's pretty unusual for the acute team to go out of hospital and do this but I'm sure everyone will agree we're more than happy to do it,\" she said.\n\nMs Unsworth said she was happy to be home and couldn't wait to \"look out at the blue sky and the sun and get better.\"",

        "authors": [],
        "body": "It is \"too early\" to start lifting coronavirus lockdown restrictions \"in any meaningful way\", Nicola Sturgeon has said.\n\nThe next review of strict social distancing rules is due on 7 May.\n\nBut the Scottish first minister said the margins for making any changes were still \"very, very tight\".\n\nMinisters are considering ways of gradually lifting the lockdown, but Ms Sturgeon warned that it \"is not going to be a flick of the switch moment\".\n\nShe said the key objective was to \"get the virus to as low a level as possible\" and then keep it there with continued social distancing and a testing and isolation regime.\n\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson is due to set out the UK government's thinking on options for easing restrictions in future, after Ms Sturgeon's government published a paper on the same topic.\n\nHowever, at her daily briefing the first minister said she had to deliver a \"tough message\" that changes will not happen quickly.\n\nShe said: \"I have to be straight with you that it may very well be too early in any meaningful way to safely lift any of the current restrictions.\n\n\"We have worked very hard to bring down the transmission rate of the virus and we are definitely seeing results from those efforts.\n\n\"But our progress against the virus is too fragile for us to let up.\"\n\nMs Sturgeon said there was evidence that people were beginning to venture out more, warning that \"if everyone starts easing off, the virus will quickly take off again\".\n\nShe said car travel - while still far lower than pre-lockdown levels - had increased by 5%, and by 10% in some towns and cities. Uses of concessionary bus travel was up by almost a sixth last week.\n\nThe first minister said she understood people wanted to travel more and spend more time outside, but said \"all of it adds up\".\n\nShe said: \"What I'm asking you to do is to think about whether or not it is the case that right now you are a little more active than you were at the start of lockdown, and why that is the case.\"\n\nShe asked people think about whether their journeys were essential and added: \"If we allow this virus to run out of control again, I'm going to be standing here for a lot longer giving you even more grim statistics.\"\n\nMs Sturgeon has pledged that next week she will update her government's paper with more detailed options on how to begin easing restrictions.\n\nShe has said the country could return to something like the previous \"containment\" phase of dealing with the virus, which would involve a \"test, trace, isolate\" system of tracking down people who have come into contact with infectious patients and have them go into isolation.\n\nShe told ITV's Peston programme: \"It stands to reason you have to protect your NHS from being overwhelmed, which is why we've said all along protecting the NHS is an objective, but its not a sufficient objective in and of itself.\n\n\"The key objective in my view is to get the virus to as low a level as possible, and then through, unfortunately, a period of continued social distancing. And in the next phase test, trace, isolate to keep it as low as possible so we are minimising the harm it does to people and minimising the number of people who die from it.\"\n\nMs Sturgeon said the whole focus should not be on protecting the capacity of the health services, as NHS Scotland currently only has 114 of its 600 intensive care beds filled.\n\nShe said: \"If your only objective was not overwhelming the NHS I could say to you, well we could afford to have the numbers of people in intensive care quadrupling, and we still wouldn't be overwhelming the NHS.\"\n\nBoth the Scottish and UK governments have set targets for ramping up testing by the end of April.\n\nMs Sturgeon has said she is confident that the Scottish government will exceed capacity for 3,500 tests per day, but there have been reports that the full capacity is not always used.\n\nShe has warned that mass testing should not be seen as a \"panacea\", and that the current tests are not always reliable unless patients are showing symptoms.\n\nThe UK government had set a target of 100,000 tests by the end of April, but again has more capacity than is being utilised.\n\nJustice Secretary Robert Buckland said it was \"probable\" that the 100,000 target would not be met by Thursday's deadline but that it would be in the \"next few days\".",

    "'We aren't diagnosing many cancers now'": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "Planned surgery has been cancelled at hospitals across the UK, leaving much work to be done once the Covid-19 emergency is over. But two colorectal surgeons at Bradford Royal Infirmary also believe that the surgical world will be permanently changed - as Dr John Wright discovers in his regular diary.\n\nLike a runner who has discovered halfway through her race that it has changed from a sprint to a marathon, the hospital is coming to terms with a new pace and is recalibrating its stamina.\n\nNumbers of cases have started to fall, but there's no finishing line in sight.\n\nAnd as we continue running, we have to look ahead to the future - we have to work out how we can resume normal business, looking after patients with cancer and heart disease, asthma and arthritis.\n\nAt present, half the hospital is empty, while the other half has become a Covid-19 Red Zone; in time it will contain two parallel universes, Covid and non-Covid.\n\nSurgeons, who have concentrated on emergency operations since the start of the epidemic, will resume planned operations in the non-Covid universe. But until a reliable test is developed that can be used to confirm that a patient is Covid-negative, the assumption will have to be that they are Covid-positive, and this has some important consequences.\n\nI spoke to two consultant colorectal surgeons, Sonia Lockwood and Frankie Mosley, about what has changed for them so far, and what they think will change in future.\n\nThey confirmed that all work except for emergency surgery and some cancer surgery has been put on hold. They also said that keyhole surgery has come to a halt, as evidence from China and some European countries suggests that open surgery is safer for operating theatre staff.\n\nProf John Wright, a medical doctor and epidemiologist, is head of the Bradford Institute for Health Research, and a veteran of cholera, HIV and Ebola epidemics in sub-Saharan Africa. He is writing this diary for BBC News and recording from the hospital wards for BBC Radio 4's The NHS Front Line\n\nIt may now resume, in some cases, with the increased risk to medical staff being weighed against the risks to the patient of a longer stay in hospital, which is one of the consequences of open surgery.\n\nBut increased efforts will also be made to explore non-surgical options. Appendicitis provides a good example of this, Sonia says.\n\n\"We are looking to treat people conservatively, with antibiotics wherever we can. We're doing more complex scanning on patients to try and determine who will be suitable for that. So we're really avoiding operating on patients wherever possible.\"\n\nAnd appendicitis also illustrates another point - people who really need treatment are not always coming to hospital.\n\n\"Where we would normally do appendectomies maybe once a day, maybe two or three a day, at first, after the lockdown, we didn't see any. But then, after a week or so, the patients that are coming in with appendicitis have come in with terrible appendicitis,\" Sonia says.\n\n\"They've waited at home until it's perforated, so what would have been a relatively straightforward illness and operation then becomes a much more significant illness and operation.\"\n\nNormally, there would be a minimum of about 30 admissions coming through the hospital's surgical assessment unit every day but that went down to two or three, Sonia says.\n\nThe surgeons are also dealing with fewer cancer patients.\n\nIn some cases this is because a calculation has been made that the risk of bringing them in is higher than the risking of waiting. But there is another factor too, Frankie says.\n\n\"We certainly, at the moment, aren't diagnosing many cancers at all. Our main modality for diagnosing them is endoscopy - colon endoscopy [a camera inserted into the body on the end of a tube] - and we've more or less ceased that activity,\" she says.\n\n\"We are investigating people - we're scanning them, so we'll pick up the most advanced cancers - but we're not diagnosing anywhere near the normal numbers. So we are just putting this work off for later.\"\n\nBut operations carried out in full personal protective equipment (PPE), as they must be until there is a test for Covid-19, are time-consuming.\n\n\"What we may have been able to do six months ago, in a given day, we can only do half of that - and that's if we get all the theatres back, and all the ventilators back,\" Frankie says.\n\nThe same applies to diagnostic tests - X-rays, camera tests, endoscopy - everything will take longer because of safety procedures that have been put in place in for both patients and staff.\n\nAnd this, combined with the fact that there will be a backlog of operations, will lead inevitably to more prioritisation, Sonia and Frankie believe.\n\nAt present, cancer surgery is a top priority, and for everyone else it's been first come first served, as Frankie puts it. In future they envisage pushing lower-priority operations down the queue.\n\nWhat does that mean in the case of colorectal surgery?\n\n\"For us it will be some of people's haemorrhoid operations. They might have to put up with bleeding - it is inconvenient and unpleasant, but they might have to put up with it for a bit longer than they traditionally have had to,\" Frankie says.\n\nSonia adds that when it comes to general surgery, some hernia patients could be de-prioritised.\n\n\"While they've got lumps and bumps that are maybe uncomfortable and they've got some symptoms, most people have very mild symptoms,\" she says.\n\nThe remarkable drop off we've seen in hospital referrals, has been matched when it comes to A&E attendances. While we're worried about the patients who may not be coming to hospital when they need to, this also suggests that people who are using A&E have not always experienced an accident or an emergency.\n\n\"There are lots of people who use the NHS inappropriately, acknowledging that it's quicker to come to A&E and wait for hours than maybe wait for a GP appointment two weeks from now,\" Sonia says. \"And I think the Covid crisis has actually highlighted that - that people are trying to bypass the system.\"\n\nIn an NHS which is struggling to meet ever increasing demand, we have an opportunity to reduce unnecessary hospital appointments - to do things differently. Patients have discovered the joys of seeing their consultant without leaving the comfort of their own homes, and remote or virtual consultations look like one of the big changes that are here to stay.\n\nThe success of our response to Covid-19 in hospitals across the UK has been down to a grassroots movement of doctors and nurses on the front line. They have been the ones who have taken control of the NHS, put their lives on the line and tamed the Covid dragon.\n\nThis has broken down a barrier between clinical and managerial staff in hospitals, Sonia says, and she looks forward to a continuation of open dialogue as we plan for the future.\n\nIn management theory, there's a classical model about change that describes how to unfreeze the existing system and then refreeze it in a new way of working. It's a neat concept but in reality this never happens. Until now. Covid-19 has defrosted the whole of the NHS, and we have to now work out what we want to keep and what we want to do differently.",

She is a young Salvadoran asylum seeker who has been detained in an immigration centre in the US since October of last year.\n\nAt the centre she is held at in Otay Mesa, in San Diego, California, they were not given any face masks or gloves as protection, despite the fact that there were already confirmed positive cases of Covid-19 inside the facility, says the 23-year-old.\n\n\"There is no medical assistance here, they don't take care of us, they tell us to gargle with salt water, that we are fine, that it is just a cold,\" she says in a phone call on 21 April.\n\nSo Ver\u00f3nica decided with another colleague to put together pieces of T-shirt fabric and, with daily sanitary pads and hair ties, make protective masks.

Only 1,030 detainees have been tested up until the same date.\n\nThere have been no deaths as a result of Covid-19, according to information that ICE sent to the BBC.\n\nDespite the fact that ICE assures on its website that the health, safety and well-being of detainees are \"among the highest priorities\", in recent weeks groups of immigrants have started hunger strikes in protest and several courts have ordered the release of detainees.\n\nVer\u00f3nica says that she sleeps in a cell \"with eight beds, one on top of the other at a distance of about a metre\" and that she lives with four other women. \"We use the same bathroom... we are not in an environment where you can have social distancing\" she says.\n\nThe detention centres are managed by private companies and have different sizes and layouts, but the detainees and organizations BBC spoke to agree that there are often spaces where hundreds of people live together and that cells are shared.\n\nIn addition, detainees are in charge of cleaning the areas they use, including collective toilets, and do so without protection such as gloves or face masks.\n\n\"(Detainees) only have access to one bar of soap for the entire week,\" says Veronica Salama, an immigration attorney at the US human rights organization Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC).\n\nMs Salama warns that her clients \"had no idea of the severity of this disease\" at first and that \"officials did not inform them of anything or gave them any handouts with instructions for hand washing\".\n\n\"There are officials who enter the units where the detainees are to deliver food without gloves or masks,\" she says.\n\nThe situation has led to \"people organising themselves in 30 facilities to demand changes and in 13 of them there has been retaliation\", says Cynthia Galaz, from the organisation Freedom For Immigrants, which has a direct telephone line to connect with detention centres.\n\nMs Galaz has gathered testimonies from people who say they have received threats that they would be sprayed with pepper spray or transferred to a solitary confinement area, informally called \"el hoyo\" (the hole).\n\n\"They throw people into a room where they are alone for a long time and basically people describe it as psychological torture,\" she points out.\n\nIn addition to lawsuits filed in courts calling for the release of specific detainees, a federal judge ordered ICE last week to identify and consider releasing those immigrants in their custody whose age or health condition puts them at risk of getting sick with Covid-19.\n\nJudge Jes\u00fas Bernal, from a federal court in Los Angeles, determined that the evidence presented \"suggests a systematic inaction\" by the government \"that goes beyond a mere 'difference of medical opinion or negligence'\".\n\nThe ICE press office referred BBC to a website with information on its response to the pandemic in detention centres.\n\nThe agency indicates there that nearly 700 people have been released \"after evaluating their immigration history, police record, and whether they pose a possible threat to public safety, or are at risk of flight, or represent a national security concern\". Additionally, they say, they have limited the entry of new detainees.\n\n\"ICE's detained population has dropped by more than 4,000 individuals\" since 1 March, they said. In addition to temporarily suspending all visits, the agency \"decided to reduce the population of all facilities to 70% or less to increase social distancing\".\n\nDetainees with symptoms of fever or respiratory problems are \"isolated and monitored\" for a specified period of time.\n\nThose who do not have the symptoms mentioned above, but \"who are included in the epidemiological risk guidelines\" are monitored for 14 days. Those with moderate to severe symptoms or those requiring \"higher levels of care or monitoring\" are transferred to hospitals.\n\nThe agency, however, did not provide information to the BBC on how many people have been hospitalised.\n\nRosmary Freites is one of the immigrants who, due to her medical condition - she is diabetic and asthmatic - was released from the Broward Transitional Center (BTC) in Florida, after the organisation United We Dream helped her by filing a petition with more than 1,000 signatures for her release before a judge.\n\nMs Freites, a 23-year-old from Venezuela, describes how she was isolated in a room with five other detainees for a couple of days and that when she asked why, officials told her that a person who was there had contact with a lawyer who tested positive for Covid -19.\n\n\"After two days they took us out of the quarantine and they never tested me or gave me a mask,\" she says. The SPLC documented that the Krome detention centre in Miami had four spaces set aside for people in quarantine and that \"people are going in and out, it is not really a quarantine\".\n\nAnother reported problem is the transfer of immigrants from one centre to another, which is what happened to Anette Villa's husband, who is asthmatic.\n\nThe Cuban woman says that in recent weeks her husband went through at least three different centres before finally being admitted to Baker, in north-central Florida.\n\n\"The pandemic was already under way and with all the transfers they made him do while they were processing him, he spent two nights sleeping on the floor\" she describes.\n\nMs Villa, who lives in Florida, says that her husband travelled from Mexico and that he claimed asylum before the border authorities 11 months ago. \"He knows that if he catches the virus, his lungs are going to collapse. He is panicking and I tell him to calm down. I am afraid he will die,\" she says.\n\nOtay Mesa Detention Center, where Ver\u00f3nica is held, currently has the most confirmed cases of Covid-19, with 98 detainees and 8 ICE employees infected. Organisations like the SPLC fear that the number is higher.\n\n\"We don't know all the details of what is happening inside, the situation is not transparent,\" says lawyer Maia Fleischman, referring to all the centres.\n\nOtay Mesa made headlines in recent days after audios were released in which a detainee describes the moment when a group of detainees were allegedly pepper sprayed inside their cells.\n\nThe incident was reported on 10 April, after a group of detainees refused to sign a document, in which they say the company that manages the detention centre was released from responsibility in the events that anyone caught the virus. Only after they signed the documents would they would be given masks, they say.\n\n\"The attack happened in my unit,\" says Briseida Salazar, a 23-year-old Mexican woman who was released on bail days later. Ms Salazar, one of the few who spoke English in the group of more than 60 women, helped translate the document for the others and, as a result, they refused to sign it.\n\n\"At one point we got very frustrated and started to protest and the manager who was there told us that we were making a lot of noise and called the emergency team and they came up with the pepper spray.\"\n\nVeronica, who was on the phone at the time with a member of the organisation Pueblos Sin Fronteras (PSF), shouted that they were being pepper sprayed and that they were handcuffing a detainee suffering from mental health issues. ICE confirmed the facts, but denied that pepper spray had been used.\n\n\"Contrary to numerous reports, there was no use of force or chemical agents dispersed during the incident\", adding that the allegations were \"simply not true\".\n\nAccording to PSF, which exchanges daily calls with detainees in Otay Mesa, there are more than 100 detainees on hunger strike protesting about the lack of testing and protective measures.\n\nIn another part of the facilities, detainee Samuel Gallardo Andara, a 28-year-old Venezuelan nurse, says that in the area where he is being held, of about 100 people, \"half of them have become ill\".\n\n\"Doctors have monitored us and given us Tylenol, that's it.\"\n\nImmigrants' rights organisations have filed lawsuits against ICE detention centres in the past denouncing irregularities with medical assistance inside the facilities. The pandemic has highlighted problems that have existed inside these facilities for a long time, these organisations say.\n\nFrom the phone, Veronica says that she is very stressed and that at the moment she does not see a \"way out of this\".\n\n\"What we are living here is very difficult, very difficult,\" she says right before the time allowed for her call runs out and the line is down.",

    "'We need army of volunteers to track down virus'": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "A public health expert says an army of detectives should be recruited to track the spread of Covid-19.\n\nProf Devi Sridhar told the BBC the UK was still lagging behind other nations in its response to the pandemic.\n\nShe said ministers should emulate Germany which has enlisted medical students and furloughed workers to help \"test, trace and isolate\".\n\nThe strategy involves tracking down and quarantining the contacts of everyone who tests positive for the virus.\n\nThe aim is to arrest the growth of Covid-19 so that lockdown restrictions can be eased.\n\n\"The key here is to keep daily new cases low, because if we keep them low, we can keep a handle on the virus and we can ease other restrictions,\" said Prof Sridhar, of Edinburgh University.\n\nSurveillance systems already in place for the 'flu including random community testing should be expanded, she said, to track any emerging clusters.\n\n\"There's three paths ahead,\" she explained. \"One is we do nothing and a lot of people die.\n\n\"The second is we stay in some kind of lockdown and release cycle while all of us slowly get this virus which would destroy the economy.\"\n\nThe third path, which she favours, is to build \"complex and massive\" public health infrastructures\" to \"keep a handle on this virus\".\n\n\"It requires a lot of people, contact tracers, almost like a whole workforce,\" she said. \"Germany has recruited thousands of people just to do this.\"\n\n\"People are willing to volunteer. They want to help find a solution. And so if we can use that and actually train people and start getting that up and running, that would be a major step forward.\"\n\nProf Sridhar said smartphone apps which use Bluetooth technology to detect when a user has been in proximity with an infected person may be \"a little bit\" useful.\n\nHowever she cautioned that too few people downloaded them in Singapore to make a major difference.\n\nProf Sridhar - who is chair of Global Public Health at Edinburgh University - is also a member of an expert group advising the Scottish government on its response to the pandemic.\n\nShe also chairs a Royal Society working group analysing Covid-19 data, whose findings are reported to the UK government's chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance.\n\nEven with a comprehensive contact tracing programme in place, Prof Sridhar said physical distancing would be with us for a long time.\n\nShe said: \"I think we're going to have to alter our behaviour in terms of having mass gatherings, concerts for the next year, year and a half until we know more about this.\"\n\nProf Sridhar said testing in Scotland needed to be ramped up dramatically from a current Scottish government target of some 3,500 tests a day to a range of 15,000 to 20,000.\n\nEarlier this week the First Minister told MSPs that target was one she broadly recognised, adding that the assessment of the number of contact tracers would depend on what social distancing measures were in place.\n\nNicola Sturgeon signalled that she would publish a detailed paper on her government's test, trace and isolate strategy, \"probably early next week.\"\n\nThe overall UK government target is 100,000 tests per day, a proportion of which is being carried out at sites in Scotland.\n\nAssessing the breadth and depth of testing in Scotland is complicated by the fact that both the Scottish and UK governments are running their own testing centres with different eligibility criteria.\n\nProf Sridhar was an early critic of the UK government's plan to, in the words of Sir Patrick, \"build up some kind of herd immunity\" -- in other words to let the virus spread through the population until it ran out of people to infect.\n\nThe concept, endorsed at an early stage in the outbreak by Scotland's national clinical director Jason Leitch - but since disowned by both London and Edinburgh - was always a \"terrible idea,\" without a vaccine to protect the most vulnerable, she said.\n\n\"The real big difference between the UK as a whole and other countries is that we stopped contact tracing and we stopped containment in early March,\" said Prof Sridhar.\n\n\"What really surprised me was the [12 March] decision to stop testing for minor symptoms and to stop contact tracing, as well as to let mass gatherings go ahead and to let non-essential travel go ahead.\"\n\n\"We had the benefit of time. We knew where this was going.\"\n\nOn the question of whether those early decisions cost lives, Prof Sridhar says they did - and \"probably did result in the virus spreading heavily throughout the UK\".\n\nShe said: \"Those early weeks when we didn't lock down early, we didn't do aggressive containment.\n\n\"We're in a difficult position because now we've basically got to put the genie back in the bottle.\"",

    "A super-spreading funeral that led to three deaths": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "In March, before the lockdown began, the Hussain family held a big funeral in Bradford's central mosque. Tragically, many mourners fell ill with Covid-19, including the dead man's son, Mohammed. But while three family members died, Mohammed eventually pulled through, writes Dr John Wright of the Bradford Royal Infirmary.\n\nBeing intubated and ventilated in intensive care turns out to be a long, rocky road. In Bradford, of the 49 Covid patients who have been admitted to our ICU so far, most have been placed on intubated ventilators. So far seven of these patients have come off ventilation.\n\nMohammed Hussain, a criminal lawyer from Bradford, was one of the first. He is one of our success stories.\n\nThe 51-year-old was unconscious for five weeks and was very disconcerted when he woke up in what looked like a science fiction film with everybody wearing visors and masks and gowns - he couldn't remember how he got there. He had entirely missed the month of April.\n\n\"I remember them asking me to go on the Recovery trial to try certain drugs and I said 'Yes.' But that's my last memory until I was waking up weeks later,\" Mohammed told me.\n\nWhile under sedation, he dreamed that his family had experienced a terrorist attack. And when he came round he remained uneasy.\n\n\"There was some paranoia to begin with. I thought, 'These people are trying to trick me. What's going on, what's all this about?'\"\n\nThis kind of delirium is quite normal for patients who wake up from critical care, says ICU consultant Dr Debbie Horner, clinical director for the anaesthetics and intensive care department. \"It's common for patients to feel very suspicious and anxious about what's going on around them. You can understand it, people are telling you that it's more than a month later and everyone's wearing really strange clothes.\"\n\nUsually it's possible to give people advance warning before they get intubated, but Mohammed deteriorated quickly. He fell ill in March, following the funeral of his father, Noor, who was in his 90s.\n\nNoor Hussain had come over from Pakistan in the 1960s to work in the mills in Bradford. He raised his family here, but it was always his wish to be buried in Mirpur.\n\n\"He was an old soldier who fought in the Second World War, in Burma, and he was a very determined man. He wanted to be buried next to his brother in Pakistan and I honoured that wish for him,\" Mohammed told me.\n\nNoor Hussain died on 10 March. The funeral gathering started that afternoon. It is a very large and respected family, so people travelled from across the UK - about 600 came to pay tribute at Bradford's Central Mosque on the first day.\n\nThe following day Mohammed flew to Pakistan with his father's body - his mum and his wife went with him. But back in Bradford, the funeral continued for another two days. On Thursday 12 March, 500 mourners came and shared a meal.\n\nAbout a week later, people began to fall ill with Covid-19. The first was Mohammed's cousin's 24-year-old son - one of the first Covid patients in Bradford to be admitted to ICU. Three further members of that household also developed symptoms, one of them also going to hospital. And other relatives were hospitalised too, both in Bradford and Oldham.\n\nIt seems clear that someone at the funeral - possibly one of the mourners from Bradford, possibly one of the visitors from further afield - was infected with the coronavirus and that many people contracted it there.\n\n\"If you start looking at the number of cases that have come from that funeral, it's easy to see how quickly it spread,\" says Mohammed's son, Haroon, a radiologist..\n\n\"At the funeral you shake each other's hand and talk to people, you're very close.\n\n\"The country went into lockdown shortly after, and the reports are coming out now that coronavirus was in the population for a significant period of time before we realised. So if you've got a gathering of people, it increases the chances that maybe one of them has it.\"\n\nHaroon can list eight family members who were hospitalised and three who died.\n\nWe have seen other patients who became ill after funerals and family gatherings in this same period, just before the lockdown. It's the close physical contact - hugging and shaking hands - that seems to create such a high rate of transmission. For the same reason, weddings and parties are also super-spreading events.\n\nBy the time Mohammed returned home from Pakistan on 18 March, Haroon and his brother, who live with their parents, had symptoms too.\n\n\"We tried to distance ourselves,\" says Haroon. \"But when you're living in one household that's nigh-on impossible - there's only a certain number of bathrooms, there's only one fridge, one kitchen.\"\n\nMohammed was concerned about catching the virus because he is asthmatic, but that Saturday he developed symptoms. He stayed home for nine days, getting progressively worse, until his sons called 999.\n\n\"We walked him into the ambulance,\" says Haroon. \"That was a very emotional moment as we couldn't go with him and we didn't know when we would see him again.\"\n\nWhen Mohammed arrived at Bradford Royal Infirmary, he saw his uncle in the waiting room, also wearing an oxygen mask. Sadly, he has since died.\n\nProf John Wright, a doctor and epidemiologist, is head of the Bradford Institute for Health Research, and a veteran of cholera, HIV and Ebola epidemics in sub-Saharan Africa. He is writing this diary for BBC News and recording from the hospital wards for BBC Radio.\n\nMohammed was intubated and put on a ventilator. \"During that time, people are deeply sedated and their muscles are paralysed with medicines to allow the oxygen to get into the body,\" says Debbie Horner.\n\nTwice a day, Mohammed was proned, turned from front to back, to try and get as much oxygen into his body as possible by stimulating different bits of the lungs. This was done by a team of radiologists who volunteer to do this - they call themselves the Ratters - the Radiology Turning Team.\n\nAt the start of this crisis, Covid-19 was thought to be primarily a lung disease where the life-saving treatment would be intubated ventilation, with patients sedated in intensive care. As the weeks have passed, clinicians have increasingly turned to less invasive ventilators called CPAP machines, which blow oxygen into the lungs, keeping them inflated - at Bradford we were using them from an early stage of the epidemic and putting patients on them at an earlier stage of their illness than some other hospitals.\n\nPredictions in March were that 30% of patients would be on ventilators in intensive care units. As it's turned out, it's less than 20% nationally and less than 10% in Bradford, suggesting that this early and less invasive treatment is effective.\n\n\"I genuinely believe we've managed to pitch it right here,\" says Dr Tom Lawton, a consultant in critical care. \"By using simple machines that are designed to make it all as easy as possible, and having brilliant staff that are prepared to jump in and do everything - even care that they're not used to delivering in that kind of environment - we haven't brought as many people to intensive care as we thought we would. And yet, our patients don't seem to have suffered as a result.\"\n\nPreliminary data shows the death rate of Bradford Royal Infirmary is 23%, that's lower than national figures. However in ICU the death rate is 50%, in line with other ICU rates.\n\nOnce out of intensive care, Mohammed Hussain began a slow process of rehabilitation on a stroke ward.\n\nHis shoulder was damaged during proning and he needed additional physio - he couldn't move his right arm much and so it was difficult for him to feed himself.\n\nHe is full of gratitude. \"Believe me, the people who work in ICU, in this crisis, putting themselves at risk, they are the most amazing people,\" he says.\n\n\"It's not just the medical treatment, but it's the human touch. It's the depth of the conversations, the genuine interest and how you develop relationships. It contributes massively towards you getting better.\n\n\"I remember when I was first taken upstairs on the ward, this poor doctor was running various tests and he went to get me a drink - he brought me pineapple juice. It was like a drink from heaven.\n\n\"Sometimes the enormity of what we've been through affects me and makes me emotional.\"\n\nDuring the five weeks that his dad was unconscious, Haroon kept everyone updated via Whatsapp.\n\n\"There were so many people worried about him,\" he says. \"My dad is incredibly well-known in the community and the messages were going to hundreds of people throughout the world. Everywhere you go, you meet people who my dad has helped.\"\n\nLooking through the replies from his hospital bed, Mohammed spotted a theme: \"Oh, he's too stubborn, he's too tough, he'll be all right...\"\n\n\"I didn't know that's how I was viewed by people,\" he says.\n\nBut Haroon isn't having it. \"You did know that, that's a lie!\"\n\nMohammed finally left hospital on Tuesday, to a standing ovation from ward staff.\n\nI think one of one of the things that we didn't really do right at the start was celebrate those successes of patients leaving the ward - you tend to focus on the more tragic cases. So we have got better at that, and every patient that is discharged now, is a source of great joy.\n\nA couple of days ago Haroon updated us on what happened next.\n\n\"When I went to collect him from the hospital I didn't tell the rest of the family. I called them all down saying I needed to speak to them, and there was Dad sitting in his armchair. It was an amazing moment, just phenomenal, to have him home.\n\n\"He's just been out in the garden for the first time today and he was elated. He gets very tired very quickly so it's a slow process, but he's surrounded by love.\"\n\nAnd Haroon's mum has now returned from Pakistan, so the family is together again. They're overjoyed.\n\nGovernment advisers have been considering since March whether to include loss of smell among the criteria for deciding whether someone has Covid-19. Evidence that it is one of the symptoms is already strong and some scientists argue this is now an urgent step, as the lockdown is eased.",

Last year the figure was 478.\n\nOf the deaths this April, 368 were recorded as either caused or suspected to be caused by Covid-19.\n\nTesting in care homes in Wales remains more restrictive than in England, where all residents and staff are being tested regardless of symptoms.\n\nFollowing complaints that Wales was not following England on the measure the Welsh Government extended the policy - from testing just staff and residents with symptoms, to all those in a home where someone has tested positive.\n\nNeighbouring care homes may also be tested under a system which will use mobile testing units and home testing kits.\n\nOn Wednesday Mr Drakeford reiterated that the evidence did not exist to show everyone in the sector should be tested.\n\nThe first minister, speaking in the first plenary session of the renamed Welsh Parliament, said he had not seen any evidence that led him to believe testing of non-symptomatic residents and staff in care homes had \"clinical value\".\n\nBut later in the session, conducted over the internet, Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price put it to the first minister testing of people without symptoms was not happening at smaller care homes because of a lack of capacity.\n\nIn reply Mr Drakeford said: \"There was evidence that in larger care and nursing homes there is a clinical point to testing even non-symptomatic settings.\n\n\"They're often focused more on the nursing home end of the care home sector.\n\n\"There is a greater concentration of deaths in care where nursing is part of care than in the rest of the sector, as you might expect given coronavirus attracts people with underlying health conditions.\"\n\nHe said larger care homes have a larger number of people going in and out of them.\n\nMr Price said the limit of 50 was \"arbitrary\" and Mr Drakeford conceded it had a \"component of arbitraryness\".\n\nBut he said it was \"not plucked out of the air\" and is derived from \"the science that lies behind it, the nature of the care home sector and the advice that then goes to ministers\".\n\nHe added care homes with more than 50 people were \"more vulnerable\" to coronavirus.\n\nFollowing the meeting Mr Price claimed the policy unfairly discriminated against smaller care homes in rural and valleys communities.\n\n\"If the underlying reason why testing is being denied to all homes is capacity then the Welsh Government needs to admit it and address it,\" he said.\n\nPaul Davies, Conservative leader in the Senedd, said: \"The people of Wales need to see governments working together at this time of national crisis and the Welsh Government need to work in tandem with the UK government where it can - this includes universal testing for all residents and staff in care homes.\"\n\nA Welsh Government spokesperson said: \"We are now offering testing, regardless of symptoms or positive cases, to care homes with more than 50 beds.\n\n\"Evidence shows there is a greater prevalence of coronavirus in larger care homes. Eight mobile testing units are being made available across Wales to deliver a rapid testing response where needed.\"\n\nIt remains unclear how often the care homes would be tested.\n\nAt the same meeting Mr Drakeford said the Welsh Government had received \"a significant delivery of testing equipment from overseas.\n\n\"Today it is being installed and validated,\" he added.\n\n\"That process is being completed as rapidly as possible, and will lead to a further step up in capacity next week.\"",

    "Bundesliga: 'Bizarre, sterile and eerie' - what it was really like inside one of Germany's 'Ghost Games'": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "Follow live text commentary of Union Berlin v Bayern Munich on the BBC Sport website from 16:30 BST on Sunday\n\nThe eyes of the football world were on Germany when the Bundesliga returned to action on Saturday.\n\nIt became the first major league to return since football was suspended because of the coronavirus pandemic, with six fixtures on Saturday and a further two matches due to be played on Sunday.\n\nAll games were played under heavy precautions laid out by the German Football League. A strict hygiene and safety protocol, including the ban of crowds, was necessary to get the go-ahead from political authorities.\n\nWhat was it like at the first closed-door matches? German football expert Constantin Eckner was at Eintracht Frankfurt's 3-1 defeat to Borussia Monchengladbach for BBC Sport to find out.\n\nEckner: Staging spectator-free matches and thus removing the league's biggest asset, its atmosphere, was a major talking point ahead of the restart on Saturday and will probably remain one, as public gatherings are prohibited in Germany at least until the end of August.\n\nThe television broadcast during the afternoon made immediately clear that every shout, sound of the referee's whistle, and thud of the ball bouncing off the empty stands would create a haunting atmosphere at all of the matches in the upcoming weeks.\n\nThe experience for those inside the stadium was even more bizarre at times. According to the league's hygiene protocol, only up to 320 people, including the players, staff, club officials, journalists, broadcasters, and security personnel were allowed to enter a stadium divided into three sections - the field area, the stands, and the outside area.\n\nJournalists had permission to only go to section two, the stands. We were expected to arrive at the stadium two hours to 90 minutes before kickoff to get through a security check while already wearing a mask.\n\nApproaching Frankfurt's Commerzbank Arena, it was noticeable how uncommonly quiet it was. Usually 90 minutes before a match, the parking lot would already start to fill up, with people swarming towards the entries. Not this time.\n\nThe atmosphere was chastened, with everyone keeping their mouths under face masks and obeying physical distancing rules. There was no chatting with fans or joking with the security personnel. Instead, everyone that wanted to enter the stadium acted seriously, realising how surreal the situation was.\n\nAt the entrance, security officers were waiting to check the accreditations of everyone, but more importantly to receive forms with questions about recent symptoms and infections in the family. Temperature checks were also performed.\n\nMoreover, Eintracht Frankfurt decided to test special small transponders as tracking devices. Around 30 people were asked to wear these transponders the entire time, tracking their movement and alerting them if they came too close to another transponder carrier.\n\nEckner: In Frankfurt's stadium, journalists can reach the press area by elevator. Once the elevator door opened, the empty stands made for a sorry sight while music was sounding over the loudspeakers for whatever reason. Frankfurt's stadium DJ decided to play the Ghostbusters song shortly before kickoff. Spectator-free games are usually called 'ghost matches' (Geisterspiele) in Germany.\n\nThe two teams tried to adhere to the litany of rules included in the hygiene protocol. However, there was still some uncertainty. Assistant coaches and bench players were initially asked to wear masks all the time, but they were not sure whether they had to wear them during warm up on the pitch.\n\nMonchengladbach did also not exactly follow the timeline for the arrival of the teams, as they already changed their clothes in the hotel instead of using the stadium's locker rooms. They only put on their boots before going out on the field.\n\nOnce the pre-match procedure started, the precautions immediately before kick off appeared to be pointless given the full-contact nature of the game. Players were not allowed to shake hands or gather for a team picture. The referee and the two team captains stayed a couple of yards apart for the coin toss.\n\nHowever, the match looked as normal as ever, with players not hesitant to engage in physical duels or getting close to each other the moments before a corner kick. Then moments after a goal, the players kept distance to celebrate.\n\nAs sophisticated as the Bundesliga's hygiene protocol might be, it still has its weak points because some precautions are seemingly only for show.\n\nEckner: As an observer, you got used to the eerie silence. The instructions by the coaches and players echoed around the empty stadium.\n\nWhen one M'Gladbach defender screamed 'Jonas' twice, he demanded midfielder Jonas Hofmann to come closer to him. When Frankfurt head coach Adi Hutter shouted 'play' across the field, he was annoyed that one of his players held on to the ball for too long. Successful tackles or dribbles were accompanied by smattering applause from the bench and the first few rows of the stands where the bench players were sitting.\n\nThis kind of sterile football is isolated from any outside emotion. Fans do not only scream and cheer throughout the match, but they also react to success and failure. Behind closed doors, the matches feel less consequential despite the outcome of the season still being at stake.\n\nThe evening match on Saturday quickly turned into a one-sided affair, with M'Gladbach leading by two goals after only seven minutes. Frankfurt struggled to fight back and could not count on the support of over 40,000 passionate fans as it is usually the case inside the Commerzbank Arena.\n\nWhen Frankfurt's Andre Silva scored a late goal to make it 3-1, the usual celebratory music shrilled over the loudspeakers, even though there was no one there to celebrate and the home team were on the losing track anyway. It was the bizarre ending to a bizarre first day of top-flight football behind closed doors.",

        "body": "Universal testing for Covid-19 should take place across all of NI's care homes immediately, Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill has said.\n\nIt comes as official statistics show that for a second week, there have been more deaths in care homes (71) than hospitals (39).\n\nOverall, there have been 232 care home deaths related to coronavirus.\n\nMs O'Neill said the figures exposed the \"serious battle\" taking place in care homes.\n\n\"There should be a regular programme of testing for all residents and staff and our care homes right now,\" the Sinn F\u00e9in vice-president said on Friday.\n\n\"That would help to be able to identify the virus and actually allow speedy action to be taken.\"\n\nFigures released by Northern Ireland's Statistics Agency (Nisra) on Friday show there have been 516 coronavirus-related deaths recorded overall in NI - including 232 in care homes, and four in hospices.\n\nThree separate care homes in Northern Ireland have publicly reported deaths in double figures, including:\n\nCurrently, residents and staff are only tested for coronavirus in care homes where there is a suspected outbreak, or if they are new entrants to the care home sector.\n\nIn the Republic of Ireland, testing of all care home staff and residents is expected to be completed next week.\n\nNorthern Ireland's Chief Medical Officer Dr Michael McBride said there was a degree of inevitability about the prevalence of the virus in care homes.\n\n\"It could be anticipated that those older people in our society, those with underlying health conditions would pay a higher price,\" Dr McBride told BBC Radio 4's Any Questions? programme.\n\nHe said as community transmission has decreased across the UK, transmission in care setting, including hospitals and care homes, has \"sadly and tragically\" increased.\n\n\"There was an inevitability to that,\" he said.\n\nCare homes house people who are particularly vulnerable to coronavirus effects, according to the NI chairman of the British Geriatrics Society.\n\n\"It's very challenging for care home staff doing their best to help residents, who may not be able to follow the social distancing advice and might need extra help with care,\" Dr Mark Roberts told BBC News NI.\n\nFor staff trying to deliver compassionate, person-centred care - particularly end-of-life care - the Covid-19 pandemic presents a major challenge, added Dr Roberts.\n\nAnalysis by Louise Cullen, BBC News NI health reporter\n\nCare homes are being described as the \"new front line\" in the fight against Covid-19, with BBC News NI reporting deaths in double figures at three separate facilities.\n\nCare homes were recognised from the start as being at high-risk from this new, particularly transmissible virus.\n\nThat is why many homes moved quickly to suspend visiting, increase cleaning and put personal protective equipment in place, limiting the opportunity for Covid-19 to get a foothold.\n\nOnce any kind of virus gets into a care setting like a home, virologists say it can be very difficult to contain.\n\nRead more from Louise here.\n\nThe 236 deaths in care homes and hospices involved 66 separate establishments.\n\nMs O'Neill said the figures demonstrated that Northern Ireland was on a knife-edge.\n\n\"Behind all those figures are families who've lost a loved one and we need to realise that, as it drives home the message why we're asking people to continue doing what we're doing for the next three weeks,\" she said.\n\nThe Commissioner for Older People in Northern Ireland said this week Covid-19 testing for everyone living and working in Northern Ireland's 484 care homes should be the top health priority.\n\nMore than a fifth of Northern Ireland's care homes - 110 of the 484 - are now caring for vulnerable older people with coronavirus or flu-like symptoms, which are logged each day in care homes' forms about virus activity, the BBC understands.\n\nThe homes have a total of 16,000 beds, not all of which are occupied.\n\nThe health department said on Thursday it needed to be sure of the quality of the daily information from care homes before releasing more detailed information.\n\n\"While good progress has been made, work is still required to validate the data and ensure its consistency,\" said the department.\n\n\"Once work on this data set is complete, we believe it will provide us with more complete information on the position in our homes than any other part of the UK or Ireland.\"\n\nBy Marie-Louise Connolly, BBC News NI health correspondent\n\nAccessing information about the spread of Covid-19 in Northern Ireland's care homes has been very difficult.\n\nThe public wants to know what is happening, especially with older and more vulnerable people, but the various health agencies have been providing few verified facts.\n\nCare home owners say they need to manage information about cases and deaths in a controlled, sensitive manner.\n\nWhile this is understandable, it means the information tends to emerge first from concerned staff or families.\n\nThere are arguments about whether the health department should publish data on individual care homes. But there have also been calls for more transparency about the spread of the virus, so that reports on it are as timely and accurate as possible.\n\nConcerned families want - and deserve - to know about their loved ones living and working in these homes; there is no more important time for openness and clarity than during a pandemic.\n\nThere is a considerable difference in the death tolls in the two sets of figures published in Northern Ireland.\n\nWhile Nisra recorded 516 deaths by 1 May, the Department of Health - which records deaths of patients who tested positive for coronavirus, and therefore mostly died in hospital - had recorded 365 deaths by the same date.\n\nNisra's toll is 35% higher because its weekly bulletin, released each Friday, records all fatalities with Covid-19 mentioned on the death certificate, regardless of where the individual died and whether or not they had been tested for the virus.\n\nSo although the health department's daily briefing on Friday recorded 4,022 confirmed cases and five more deaths, taking its toll to 427, the overall death toll will be significantly higher.\n\nThe disparity between the two sets of figures has caused confusion, but the department said there was always a time lag for registering deaths in the community - which can take five days - so Nisra's report could not feasibly be linked to the daily figures.\n\nNisra's report on Friday showed there were 27 patients in intensive care with Covid-19 symptoms, compared to 58 a month ago.\n\nAlthough comparisons between countries and regions are difficult due to differences in how statistics are compiled, Northern Ireland's death rate (27 per 100,000 of the population) is similar to that of the Republic of Ireland (22 per 100,000) and significantly lower than that of Great Britain (43 per 100,000).\n\nA further 626 coronavirus deaths were confirmed across the UK on Friday, taking its total to 31,241.\n\nThe Republic of Ireland reported 27 more deaths, bringing its total to 1,429.",

I know that I have got anxious staff, and I am relying on donations from the public,\" she said.\n\nThe home has 35 residents, aged 83 and older.\n\nThey are isolating one resident, but have been told they would need at least two suspected cases for any tests to be carried out.\n\nThe home's closest official test centre is in Plymouth - meaning a three-hour round trip for staff to get tests.\n\nIn total, 23 care homes spread across England - including some in Oxfordshire, Bristol, Teesside and Yorkshire - said far away drive-thru test centres were a problem, leaving staff who do not have cars unable to access them.\n\nThe BBC also asked care homes and providers about tests for residents, with 127 out of 205 saying none of their residents had been screened for the virus.\n\nAt homes that had seen tests carried out, 334 of 7,391 residents had been tested.\n\nBy Alison Holt, BBC News Social Affairs Correspondent\n\nAlready the signs are that the number of deaths in care homes from coronavirus is going to be distressingly high.\n\nThat's despite many homes going into lockdown early, with even relatives prevented from visiting.\n\nSome care providers believe the extremely limited testing of staff, residents and anyone arriving at or returning to a home from hospital, has made it too easy for the virus to find a way in.\n\nThis week Dr Hans Kluge, regional director of the World Health Organisation (WHO) in Europe, said we need to understand the \"pathways to infection\" that have allowed a \"deeply disturbing picture\" to emerge in care homes.\n\nHe concluded that the pandemic had shone a spotlight on the \"overlooked and undervalued corners of society\".\n\nWords that will strike a chord with those who argue support, like more testing, was needed much earlier to protect this vulnerable group of people.\n\nThere were 975 deaths in care homes in England of people with Covid-19 up to 10 April, according to the Office for National Statistics.\n\nSeparate research by the National Care Forum found care workers were travelling an average 62-mile round trip to test centres.\n\nExecutive director Vic Rayner said: \"A large proportion of care staff rely on public transport to get about.\n\n\"More needs to be done and practical arrangements made to enable care workers to have access to testing centres so that they can have the confidence and reassurance they need in supporting the most vulnerable in our country.\"\n\nHarrogate Neighbours in North Yorkshire run a residential home as well as care services.\n\nChief executive Sue Cawthray said they had had to \"stand their ground\" with the NHS and refuse to take residents back from hospital without a test proving they did not have coronavirus.\n\n\"Up until about a week ago anyone who had been in hospital they weren't testing automatically before they came back into a care setting,\" she said.\n\n\"But they've now started to do that I think primarily they realised people were picking up the virus in hospital and then potentially taking it into the care home setting.\"\n\nA Department of Health and Social Care spokesman said: \"Social care is on the frontline of our fight against coronavirus and the safety of staff and residents is our top priority.\n\n\"All care home residents discharged from hospital will be tested before being admitted into their care home and we are using our increased testing capacity to test all symptomatic care home residents, care staff, and their families.\"",

Her brother in America does the same.\n\n\"It's really difficult to be honest,\" she tells us from her home in Cheshire.\n\n\"It's good that the hospital have got iPads and we're able to do this, but it's really tough not actually being able to see my dad face to face.\"\n\nSue says she has been astounded by her father's resilience.\n\n\"He's an absolute trooper and words can't describe how grateful I am to the NHS for everything they've done,\" she says.\n\n\"My dad's mood is low and he's really fed up, but he's in the best place.\"\n\nNow settled in the ward, Ron agrees. \"I cannot fault the nursing staff,\" he says. \"They've been very attentive.\"\n\nAccording to consultant Dr Kath Anderson, the symptoms of elderly people often present in a different way to younger sufferers, which poses an added challenge for staff.\n\n\"Younger people present more typically with symptoms of a fever or cough,\" Dr Anderson says. \"But elderly people, when they have any illness actually, will present with increasing confusion or a fall.\n\n\"So we just have to have it on our radar to have a high index of suspicion that Covid might be implicated as part of their illness process.\"\n\nDr Anderson says that if somebody develops Covid in a hospital area they need to take steps to isolate them to protect staff and other patients.\n\nShe says this means moving patients around the hospital, something they would not normally choose to do.\n\n\"We know for older people who are vulnerable and might have dementia or cognitive impairment, even a move from one bay to another can worsen that situation for them,\" she says. \"But that's part and parcel of this.\"\n\nAs part of efforts to track the spread of the coronavirus within hospitals, all patients over 70 are now being tested every four days.\n\nNurse Sam Dailly is one of those who does the testing rounds.\n\nShe says: \"I had it three weeks ago so I was isolated, and I came back to work last week. So with this testing procedure I know exactly how it feels and it is quite upsetting, but it has to be done.\"\n\nNurse Dailly says some older patients get distressed by the \"invasive\" swab test for Covid-19.\n\n\"We try to do the procedure as quick as we can and give explanations as we're going along but it is quite distressing,\" she says.\n\nWith families unable to come into the ward to help with feeding or laundry, the nurses are filling these gaps, as well as their usual duties.\n\nAnother obstacle is the protective masks and other PPE which make it harder to communicate with patients who may be deaf of visually impaired.\n\nLike every other area of medicine, elderly care is having to adapt. Covid is not going away any time soon so these measures will be in place for the long term.\n\n\"It is very difficult just thinking about going forward to continue looking after patients in this way,\" says Dr Anderson.\n\n\"We're going to be living with it and we're going to have to nurse and treat people differently for the foreseeable future. So that is something you have to reconcile with yourself.\"\n\nNurse Dailly says she has had a few upsetting incidents on the ward because people are approaching end-of-life.\n\n\"It's difficult because you can't communicate with families face to face and you're having to give them bad news on the phone,\" she says.\n\n\"We have a policy in the ward where when people are approaching end-of-life two visitors can come in, next of kin, which does help, but you find people deteriorate quite quickly and that is really upsetting sometimes.\"\n\nDr Anderson says being prepared for the choices that come at the end of someone's life is crucial.\n\nShe says: \"We'd really like people to think about what they would like if they become really unwell, when they're at home, comfortable and well, and can have that conversation with their GP and their family around them, rather than leaving it until they're in a crisis situation.\"",

        "authors": [],
        "body": "Championship players will have to conduct coronavirus tests themselves at home after the first batch of testing at clubs, according to the EFL's return to training protocol.\n\nThe detailed guidance, which has been obtained by BBC Sport, reveals that after the initial assessment at training grounds on Thursday and Friday, the tests should be \"self-administered\" on the morning of training twice a week.\n\nThe EFL is hoping that clubs can return to phase one of training from Monday, but the protocol says that players who test positive and are not showing symptoms must \"isolate for 14 days\".\n\nThose who test positive and do have symptoms have to \"isolate for seven days\" and would then face no further antigen testing, while those who are negative but do have symptoms should \"isolate for seven days, then retest\".\n\nThis is different to the Premier League, which saw six positive tests come back from the first round of testing of players and staff, but said those affected would isolate for seven days.\n\nBefore training can resume, Championship players will have to actively 'opt in' to the first phase of training, in accordance with the government's guidelines.\n\nThey will do so by providing written confirmation that they have received the \"Covid-19 operational policy\" and that they agree to take part in training.\n\nThe EFL's protocol, which has been distributed to players, says they \"will have the opportunity to 'opt out' of the policy at any stage\".\n\nThe 26-page document covers the pre-return preparations, the plan for the Covid-19 Antigen Testing (CAT) and what the small group training will look like.\n\nSimilar to the Premier League, Championship clubs will have to train in small groups of five for a maximum of 75 minutes, with 15 minutes allowed for warm-up and recovery.\n\nFootballs, GPS units and other equipment will be disinfected pre and post session, with social distancing between individuals essential at all times.\n\nThe protocol also says:\n\nThe protocol outlines that the \"initial testing\" will be carried out at the training ground, and that players will be provided a five-minute time slot for their test. They will also be given their training kit and football boots during this visit.\n\nIt goes on to say: \"Following the initial test, subsequent CATs will be self-administered and are to be performed at home on the morning of training on two specified days each week.\n\n\"This forms part of the latest EFL guidance and will ensure minimal risk of cross-infection.\n\n\"Players and staff will be provided with instructions and guidance to assist with performing this.\n\n\"Samples must be handed to the medical staff on immediate arrival at the training ground so that they can be couriered to the designated lab.\n\n\"The testing laboratory and kits have been selected by the league and as such, we are not in control of these.\"\n\nAnother requirement before the first day of training is that each player will have a brief medical examination with the club doctor, where they will measure heart and lung auscultations [sounds], as well as oxygen saturations.\n\nEFL guidelines also require players and staff to complete a daily medical questionnaire on training days. This has to be submitted before arrival at the training ground, otherwise they will be denied access.",

The work of his headquarters is under his personal control\".\n\nIf confirmed, Mr Kadyrov would be the latest high-profile Russian official to contract the illness.\n\nPrime Minister Mikhail Mishustin only returned to work in the last few days after catching the virus.\n\nPresident Vladimir Putin's press secretary Dmitry Peskov also tested positive, as did culture minister Olga Lyubimova and construction minister Vladimir Yakushev - as well as Mr Yakushev's deputy, Dmitry Volkov.\n\nOn Thursday Russia's reported death toll rose by 127 in the previous 24 hours to 3,099, with confirmed cases jumping to 317,554.\n\nIt is the second highest number of recorded infections worldwide.

        "body": "People could be unwittingly spreading coronavirus despite testing negative because of concerns around test reliability, a professor has said.\n\nAlyn Morice, head of cardiorespiratory studies at Hull York Medical School, was unwell with typical Covid-19 symptoms but tested negative.\n\nHe said it was a \"common story\" among many patients seen by consultants at Castle Hill Hospital in Hull.\n\nThe government said it had \"full confidence in these tests\".\n\nProf Morice started showing signs of the virus last month and was tested at the drive-through swabbing site at Castle Hill Hospital.\n\nHe said: \"It came back negative and I was advised I could go back to work but at that point I couldn't lift my head off the pillow.\n\n\"By the second week I felt very unwell. The lethargy was absolutely dreadful and by day 10 my heart went a bit dicky.\n\n\"There was no point doing another test because clinically it was obvious I had the virus.\"\n\nProf Morice said the test was accurate in terms of a positive result, but that a negative test \"meant nothing\".\n\nIn response, a Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: \"We have full confidence in these tests - they're reliable and our highly-skilled scientists do everything possible to make sure false results are extremely rare.\"\n\n\"More than 1.4 million people have now been tested, and the vast majority have had no issues with their test results.\"\n\nProf Morice said negative tests results could give carriers false confidence to go about their lives as normal and inadvertently spread the disease.\n\nHe added: \"It's vitally important especially now as restrictions are being eased and people are going back to work that if you are displaying symptoms, even if you've tested negative, then you should assume you have the virus and should self isolate.\"\n\nPatrick Lillie, infectious diseases consultant at Castle Hill, said in about 75% of cases, infected patients would get a positive result.\n\nHe said in instances of false negatives, it would be linked to not getting a good enough swab or the virus being too far down in the chest.\n\n\"If you've got classic coronavirus illness and an X-ray which looks like coronavirus, it doesn't matter what the test says, you should treat them as if they have it,\" he said.",

        "body": "Best known for its white chalk rocks and annual music festival, the Isle of Wight is now at the centre of a government trial that leaders hope will help bring the country out of lockdown. The coronavirus contact-tracing app goes live to all islanders on Thursday, but there are mixed feelings on the eve of its public release.\n\nThe app went live for local authority and health workers at 16:00 BST on Tuesday - two days before it goes live to the rest of the island.\n\nBut parish councillor Daryll Pitcher has refused to download it. He said he did not welcome being used as a \"guinea pig\".\n\n\"I am greatly concerned that this trial has been imposed on the Isle of Wight and I believe that the final say should have been local,\" he said.\n\nMr Pitcher, who is the Covid-19 response co-ordinator for the island's Wootton village, said he had concerns regarding his civil liberties and data security, because the app traces anyone who has recently been in contact with someone with the virus.\n\nHe said he felt the island was \"not a suitable testing area\" due to its demographics and geography, both of which vary from the UK's national average.\n\n\"There is no point testing in an area you can be reasonably certain it will never work,\" he added.\n\nShaun Davis, from Newport, said he was \"all for\" the app and believes there has been \"a lot of positivity\" about it from fellow islanders.\n\nMr Davis, who works for a wholesaler providing materials to organisations including the NHS and Ministry of Defence, said he did not share other people's data security concerns.\n\n\"Smartphones are traceable even without the app. We have to do something - the virus isn't going anywhere and we can't all remain in our homes indefinitely,\" he said.\n\nThe 36-year-old told the Press Association that using the app could lead to the eventual easing of lockdown and strict social distancing.\n\n\"I had to chuckle at Matt Hancock's comment, 'where the Isle of Wight leads, the rest of Britain will follow', because it has been joked that the Isle of Wight has always been a generation behind the rest of the country - so there's a first for everything.\"\n\nA nurse living on the island, who wants to remain anonymous, said the app \"needs to be part of an effective strategy, otherwise it's a gimmick\".\n\n\"The idea of using technology to support public health is an excellent idea,\" he said.\n\n\"The issue for me isn't about privacy - what good is that if we're bankrupt or dead? It's about effectiveness and competence.\"\n\nThe nurse said the NHS \"doesn't have a strong history\" of effective IT systems, noting that his own practice still uses paper for records, referrals and clinical requests.\n\nHe said he would download the app \"in the absence of an alternative\", but was critical of how the government had managed the crisis overall.\n\n\"I think this government wants to stamp a 'made in Britain' sticker on a final success,\" he said.\n\nBen South, a 999 call handler, was among a group of NHS workers observed by the media and Cabinet Office staff as he installed the app moments after it went live to key workers.\n\nHe said: \"Initially there's a screen to ask if you have any symptoms and if you don't, it will advise you to stay off the app and to come back when you do display any symptoms.\n\n\"All you need to do is put in your postcode and then you're basically fully signed up and ready to go.\"\n\nAsked what he would say to anyone who had concerns or doubts about using the app, he said: \"I'd just say how easy it is to use and how important it is to use - it's important to keep our NHS running and the country running.\"\n\nCouncillor Debbie Andre who leads the biggest opposition group, Island Independents, on the Isle of Wight Council, has downloaded the app on her phone and said people should get behind it.\n\nMrs Andre said: \"I think it falls to all of us to do everything we possibly can to conquer this virus and prevent a second spike coming back especially on the island, as we have one hospital who have been doing a fantastic job.\"\n\nAnd on the Isle of Wight being the centre of attention in the UK's response to the pandemic, she said: \"We are unique in terms of the fact we are an island, but we are in close proximity to the mainland and to major cities.\n\n\"So it makes us ideal, and it's not the first time we have been in the spotlight.\n\n\"We have a long history of scientific innovation, marine technology - we are the boating centre of the world with Cowes - so the island is quite use to being in the spotlight in a way.\"",

        "authors": [],
        "body": "NHS doctors have been warned to look out for a rare but dangerous reaction in children that may be linked to coronavirus infection.\n\nAn urgent alert sent out to GPs said that intensive care departments in London and other parts of the UK have been treating severely sick children with unusual symptoms.\n\nThis includes \"multi-system inflammation\" with flu-like symptoms.\n\nSome, but not all, tested positive for coronavirus.\n\nIt is unclear how many children have experienced the reaction, although the numbers will be low.\n\nNHS England medical director Stephen Powis said they had become aware of reports of rare, severe illness in children. \"It's only in the last few days that we have seen those reports. We have asked our experts to look into this as a matter of urgency.\"\n\nThe alert, issued by NHS England, said there was \"a growing concern\" that a coronavirus-related inflammatory syndrome is emerging in children in the UK or that there may be another, as yet unidentified, infection linked to these cases.\n\nThese young patients of varying ages were extremely ill. They had similar features to toxic shock syndrome, which can include a high temperature, low blood pressure, a rash and difficulty breathing.\n\nSome also had gastrointestinal symptoms - tummy pain, vomiting or diarrhoea - and inflammation of the heart, as well as abnormal blood test results.\n\nExperts say these are the signs you can see when the body becomes overwhelmed as it tries to fight off an infection.\n\nThe alert advises these cases need urgent treatment.\n\nBut experts stress that very few children become severely ill with coronavirus - evidence from around the world suggests they are the population least affected by the disease.\n\nDr Nazima Pathan, a consultant in Paediatric Intensive Care in Cambridge, said colleagues in Spain and Italy had been reporting similar cases: \"Some of the children have presented with a septic shock type illness and rashes - the kind of presentation we would expect to see in toxic shock syndrome and Kawasaki disease (which affects blood vessels and the heart).\n\n\"Overall, children seem to be more resilient to serious lung infection following exposure to coronavirus, and the numbers admitted to intensive care units are relatively low.\"\n\nNHS England said it knew of fewer than 20 such cases in the country where an association has been noted by clinicians. Investigations will continue, but no link has yet been established, said a spokesman.\n\nThe Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health (RCPCH) said parents should be reassured by this, but if they are concerned about their children's health for any reason, they should seek help from a health professional.\n\nProf Simon Kenny, NHS national clinical director for children and young people, said: \"The advice to parents remains the same: if you are worried about your child for whatever reason, contact NHS 111 or your family doctor for urgent advice, or 999 in an emergency, and if a professional tells you to go to hospital, please go to hospital.\"\n\nWhilst coronavirus is infectious to children, it is rarely serious. If your child is unwell it is likely to be a non-coronavirus illness, rather than coronavirus itself.\n\nThe RCPCH advises parents seek urgent help (call 999 or go to A&E) if their child is:",

These can enter the body through the eyes, nose and mouth, either directly or after touching a contaminated object.\n\nIt depends on your own health risk if you were to catch coronavirus, as well as the health of the people you live with.\n\nPeople most at risk of needing hospital treatment if they catch coronavirus are being asked to stay at home and shield.\n\nThat means they should not go out, even to shop for food or collect medicines.\n\nThe only people in their social bubble will be the people they live with and any carers who need to visit.\n\nIf you live with someone who is shielding, but do not need to shield yourself, you can go out to shop and take exercise but should stick to social distancing rules when you are out, which means keeping 2m (6ft) away from other people.\n\nFrom Wednesday, 13 May, people in England are being told they can start to meet one other person from a different household outdoors.\n\nThis is outside your bubble - you will still need to follow social distancing guidelines and keep 2m apart when you meet.\n\nThe government has asked the independent advisory group Sage to examine if, when and how people might safely be allowed to expand their bubble to include a few select people - another household, for example.\n\nThat could let people who are currently living on their own have some more social contact.\n\nMembers of a bubble would be able to visit one another in their homes.\n\nBut it would still be important to limit the risk of chains of transmission.\n\nIf Household A merges with Household B, Household B could not also link up with another group - Household C - because this would create a chain that could allow the virus to spread widely.\n\nThe bubble concept is already being used in New Zealand and is being considered by the Scottish government.\n\nContinue to stay 2m away from anyone outside your bubble.\n\nWash and dry your hands when you return to your bubble and keep up good hygiene and cleaning practices when you're at home.\n\nIf anyone in your bubble develops coronavirus symptoms, everyone in the bubble would need to self-isolate.",

We need to extraordinarily cautious because we really do not yet know enough about this virus - and we're a long way off beating it.\n\n\"Just because the infection rate and the number of patients being admitted to intensive care are starting to come down, I think we can become far too complacent.\"\n\nProf Hall said she was hopeful that when the lockdown starts to unwind, people will act \"very sensibly\" and not \"rush out to get-togethers and parties, because that's the problem\".\n\nShe has seen for herself the impact on her colleagues as they treat the sickest Covid-19 patients at the University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff.\n\nMost of the 184 people who have died in the Cardiff and Vale University Health Board Trust area with Covid-19 died in hospital.\n\n\"The psychological toll on staff has been tremendous,\" said Prof Hall.\n\n\"People keep saying a second peak is inevitable but oh my goodness, please let's make that second peak as small as possible.\"\n\nWhile the lockdown in Wales will be reviewed this week, First Minister Mark Drakeford has said he was in \"broad agreement\" with a draft UK government strategy for England, seen by the BBC.\n\nHe has also called for the four UK nations to ease restrictions according to a \"common timetable\".\n\nHowever, Prof Hall said: \"I don't think we should act at the same rate as England.\n\n\"We've a different population, we're older and more rural in general, so I think we should make our own decisions.\"",

    "Coronavirus immunity: Can you catch it twice?": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "Can you catch coronavirus again? Why are some people sicker than others? Will it come back every winter? Will a vaccine work? Could immunity passports get some of us back to work? How do we manage the virus in the long-term?\n\nThe immune system is at the heart of some of the most important questions about the coronavirus.\n\nThe problem is we know very little.\n\nOur immune system is the body's defence against infection and it comes in two parts.\n\nThe first is always ready to go and leaps into action as soon as any foreign invader is detected in the body. It is known as the innate immune response and includes the release of chemicals that cause inflammation and white blood cells that can destroy infected cells.\n\nBut this system is not specific to coronavirus. It will not learn and it will not give you immunity to the coronavirus.\n\nInstead you need the adaptive immune response. This includes cells that produce targeted antibodies that can stick to the virus in order to stop it and T cells that can attack just the cells infected with the virus, called the cellular response.\n\nThis takes time - studies suggest it takes around 10 days to start making antibodies that can target the coronavirus and the sickest patients develop the strongest immune response .\n\nIf the adaptive immune response is powerful enough, then it could leave a lasting memory of the infection that will give protection in the future.\n\nIt is not known if people who have only mild symptoms, or none at all, will develop a sufficient adaptive immune response.\n\nThe immune system's memory is rather like our own - it remembers some infections clearly, but has a habit of forgetting others.\n\nMeasles is highly memorable - one bout should give life-long immunity (as the weakened version in the MMR vaccine does). However, there are many others that are pretty forgettable. Children can get RSV (respiratory syncytial virus) multiple times in the same winter.\n\nThe new coronavirus, called Sars-CoV-2, has not been around long enough to know how long immunity lasts, but there are six other human coronaviruses that can give a clue.\n\nFour produce the symptoms of the common cold and immunity is short-lived. Studies showed some patients could be re-infected within a year .\n\nBut the common cold is generally mild. There are two more troublesome coronaviruses - the ones that cause Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (Sars) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (Mers) - in which antibodies have been detected a few years later.\n\n\"The question is not whether you become immune, it's how long for,\" said Paul Hunter, a professor in medicine at the University of East Anglia.\n\nHe added: \"It almost certainly will not last for life.\n\n\"Based on antibody studies in Sars it is possible that immunity will only last about one to two years, though this is not yet known for certain.\"\n\nHowever, even if you are not completely immune it is possible a second infection would not be as severe.\n\nThere have been reports of people appearing to have multiple coronavirus infections in a short space of time.\n\nSome have argued people are genuinely being infected twice. Another school of thought is the virus goes into stealth mode in the body before being reactivated.\n\nHowever, the scientific consensus is that testing is the issue with patients being incorrectly told they were free of the virus.\n\nNobody has been deliberately reinfected with the virus to test immunity, but a pair of rhesus macaque monkeys have.\n\nThey were infected twice, once to build up an immune response and then a second time three weeks later. Those very limited experiments showed they did not develop symptoms again after such a quick reinfection.\n\nThis is not guaranteed and that is why the World Health Organization is nervous about countries using immunity passports as a way out of lockdown.\n\nThe idea is if you pass the antibody test then you are safe to go back to work. This would be particularly valuable for staff in care homes or hospitals who come into contact with those at risk of developing severe symptoms.\n\nBut while you will find some antibodies in nearly every patient, not all are equal. Neutralising antibodies are the ones that stick to the coronavirus and are able to stop it infecting other cells. A study of 175 recovered patients in China showed 30% had very low levels of these neutralising antibodies.\n\nThat is why the World Health Organization says \"that cellular immunity [the other part of the adaptive response] may also be critical for recovery\".\n\nAnother issue is that just because you might be protected by your antibodies, it doesn't mean you cannot still harbour the virus and pass it onto others.\n\nIt matters for obvious personal health reasons and whether you will get Covid-19 multiple times and how often.\n\nImmunity will also affect how deadly the virus is. If people retain some, even imperfect, protection then it will make the disease less dangerous.\n\nUnderstanding immunity could help ease lockdown if it is clear who is not at risk of catching or spreading the virus.\n\nIf it is very difficult to produce long-term immunity, then it could make a vaccine harder to develop. Or it may change how the vaccine needs to be used - will it be a once a lifetime or once a year like the flu shot.\n\nAnd the duration of immunity, whether by infection or immunisation, will tell us how likely we are to be able to stop the virus spreading.\n\nThese are all big questions we still lack answers to.",

    "Coronavirus in Africa: Contained or unrecorded?": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "The World Health Organization (WHO) has warned that nearly a quarter of a billion Africans could contract coronavirus in the first year of the pandemic, with between 150,000 and 190,000 of them dying.\n\nAfrica has had less than 100,000 cases so far, but WHO experts believe the continent will have a prolonged outbreak over a few years - and the huge focus on containing the virus has led to other health issues being neglected.\n\nHere, five BBC reporters give a snapshot of what is happening in their countries:\n\nBy Emery Makumeno, Kinshasa\n\nThe Democratic Republic of Congo confirmed its first case of Covid-19 in early March, but a doctor in the capital, Kinshasa, believes the disease arrived earlier.\n\n\"During December and January, I can't remember how many patients came for medical treatment, coughing and with fever and headaches,\" he said, referring to Covid-19 symptoms listed by the WHO.\n\n\"I am convinced that we, the medical staff, have been exposed to coronavirus already, without knowing it, and we have built a sort of immunity,\" he added.\n\nBut DR Congo has carried out few tests to check the Covid-19 status of people, because of a lack of medical equipment.\n\nCountries with successful testing strategies, such as South Korea and Germany, have rapidly reached at least 1% of their population, UK medical journal The Lancet points out.\n\nIf equipment is available, many African states could ramp up tests - they did more HIV tests between 1 October and 31 December than the 1% target for Covid-19 testing, The Lancet says.\n\nSources: Africa CDC; The Lancet\n\nSo far, DR Congo has recorded more than 1,600 cases of the virus - the ninth-highest number in Africa, according to WHO.\n\nThe first Covid-19 case was detected in La Gombe, the main business district in Kinshasa. The government moved swiftly to introduce a lockdown, but the virus has since spread to seven of the country's 26 provinces - including the mining hub of Lubumbashi.\n\nThe outbreak comes at a time when DR Congo - which has poor health services, and has been hit by decades of conflict in the east - is also grappling with an Ebola outbreak. It has killed more than 2,000 people since 2018.\n\nThe UN children's agency, Unicef, has also raised concern about a reduction in vaccination rates, saying gains made from immunisation over the past two years could be erased.\n\nUnicef said vaccinations were already declining at the beginning of this year, and that the effects of coronavirus will make it worse.\n\nHundreds of thousands of children had not received polio, measles, yellow fever and other vaccines.\n\nDR Congo might lose its polio-free status and there could be a resurgence of other deadly diseases.\n\nHealth workers lacked equipment to protect themselves or the children from Covid-19, and parents were afraid to bring them to vaccination centres.\n\nBy Mercy Juma, Nairobi\n\nA major public hospital in Kenya's capital, Nairobi, saw an almost 40% increase in respiratory illnesses such as tuberculosis, pneumonia and asthma between December and early March, a doctor who works there told the BBC.\n\nHowever, the hospital had a sharp decline in such cases since mid-March, said the doctor, who spoke to the BBC on condition of anonymity as he was not authorised to speak to the media, added.\n\nOne reason was that the government had imposed a nationwide dusk-to-dawn curfew to contain the spread of coronavirus.\n\nThis has resulted in a drop in night-time admissions, but an increase in the number of dead people being brought to the hospital's mortuary, the doctor said.\n\nPeople also seemed to be avoiding hospital for fear of being diagnosed with Covid-19 and being sent to quarantine centres, he said.\n\nThis is because quarantining has been controversial in Kenya, with the government forcing suspected Covid-19 patients to pay for their own confinement.\n\nThe price ranges from $20 (\u00a316) to $100 a night, depending on the centre, though the government has now promised to cover costs at public quarantine centres.\n\nSources: Africa CDC; The Lancet\n\nHostels at schools and universities as well as private hotels have been used as quarantine centres.\n\nA video clip went viral last month, showing several people scaling a wall to flee a centre in Nairobi.\n\nThose quarantined have complained that some centres are not much better than prisons, with poor hygiene and overcrowding making it impossible to practise social distancing.\n\nBy Ishaq Khalid, Abuja\n\nThere have been reports of more people falling ill and dying in Nigeria's most populous state, Kano, since the outbreak of coronavirus nearly three months ago.\n\nSo, it is not surprising that President Muhammadu Buhari has extended the lockdown in the northern state to the end of the month.\n\nA grave digger at the Abattoir Graveyard in the main city, also known as Kano, told the BBC: \"We have never seen this, since the major cholera outbreak that our parents tell us about. That was about 60 years ago.\"\n\nProf Musa Baba-Shani - the head of department of medicines at Aminu Kano Teaching Hospital, the main hospital in the state - told the BBC that they have been treating more patients with illnesses such as asthma, pneumonia, and tuberculosis, as well as chest pains and sore throats.\n\nThe professor, who works with the respiratory diseases unit of the hospital, said there had been an increase of between 40% and 45% in the number of respiratory cases in about the last months.\n\nHe attributed the rise to the closure of many hospitals in the state, especially private clinics, because of a lack of protective gear for medics. This has forced more patients to seek treatment at the Aminu Kano Teaching Hospital.\n\nProf Baba-Shani said some of those with respiratory illnesses were diagnosed with coronavirus, and referred to the treatment centres set up for Covid-19 patients.\n\nHe decried the slow testing for coronavirus in Africa's most-populous country, which has a population of around 200 million. It would be better for both patients and hospitals if testing was speeded up, he said.\n\nSources: Africa CDC; The Lancet\n\nAnother doctor at the hospital, who asked not to be named because he was not authorised to speak to the media, said some people were avoiding seeking treatment because they feared contracting Covid-19 in hospitals.\n\nIn north-eastern Yobe state, an unusually high number of people - 471 people - have died in the past five weeks.\n\nIt is unclear whether the deaths are linked to coronavirus, but the state's health commissioner, Dr Muhammad Lawan Gana told the BBC that a preliminary investigation had found that most of the dead were elderly people with pre-existing health conditions such as hypertension and diabetes.\n\nNigeria has more than 6,000 confirmed cases of coronavirus, the third-highest in Africa.\n\nThe commercial capital, Lagos, is at the epicentre of the outbreak, but a lockdown imposed at the end of March has been partially eased, raising fears that the virus could spread.\n\n\"It's tough decision, but I think it was the wrong call,\" said Dr Andrew Iroemeh, who works at a Covid-19 isolation centre in the city,\n\n\"It's recommended [that] for a lockdown to be relaxed we should have a consistent reduction in the rate of infection for at least 14 days. We haven't seen that,\" he added.\n\nBy Kalkidan Yibelta, Addis Ababa\n\nRespiratory infections are common in Ethiopia, Africa's second most-populous state, with a population of more than 100 million. Research shows they are the third major cause of death each year, after neonatal disorders and diarrheal diseases.\n\nThe coronavirus outbreak does not seem to have led to more patients with respiratory infections being admitted to hospitals over the past few weeks.\n\nA doctor in the capital, Addis Ababa, told the BBC that he was looking for signs of unreported Covid-19 cases but he did not detect anything unusual.\n\nSources: Africa CDC; The Lancet\n\nThere was no increase, for example, in the number of patients with pneumonia, a severe complication caused by the virus.\n\nSimilar reports were given by a doctor and a nurse the BBC spoke to in eastern and southern Ethiopia respectively.\n\nIn recent days, the number of cases detected daily has risen from single to double digits. This has raised some concern, but the overall number is still low - less than 400.\n\nThis is despite the fact that Ethiopia, unlike many other states, has not introduced a lockdown, taking limited measures, such as a ban on sporting events and gatherings of more than four people, to curb the spread of the virus.\n\nThe doctor in Addis Ababa said Ethiopians might have been spared the worst of the virus because of less foreign travel, or there may be other unknown factors at play.\n\nHe said people should take precautions to prevent the spread of the virus as the possibility of a surge could not be ruled out.\n\nBy Catherine Byaruhanga, Kampala\n\nUganda has imposed one of the strictest lockdowns in East Africa and so far it has one of the lowest number of Covid-19 cases in the region - around 260 - and no deaths.\n\nMost of the testing in Uganda has been on truck drivers who arrive from neighbouring states. Last week, Health Minister Ruth Aceng said that of the 139 confirmed cases at the time, 79 were truck drivers.\n\nThe President of the Uganda Medical Association, Dr Richard Idro, said that doctors around the country had not reported seeing more patients with respiratory illnesses, though the lockdown - which includes a ban on travel - could have prevented them from going to hospital.\n\nPeople with mild symptoms of coronavirus might have also stayed at home, resulting in some cases going unrecorded.\n\nSources: Ugandan government; The Lancet\n\nIn a recent address, Uganda's President Museveni said the government planned to carry out \"verbal autopsies'\" in communities to find out whether people might have died from Covid-19.\n\nThe government has promised to distribute free masks to all citizens above six years old over the next two few weeks before easing lockdown measures.\n\nUgandans on social media have generally been sceptical about the plans, pointing to the delays in giving food to 1.5 million people in and around the capital, Kampala, after they lost their income because of Covid-19 restrictions.\n\nIf the mask distribution is successful, Mr Museveni has promised that shops will be allowed to open, public transport will be back on the road but carrying half the number of passengers and food market vendors - who have been sleeping at their stalls under the president's orders - will be allowed to go home at the end of each day.",

        "body": "More than half of Scotland's coronavirus deaths are now happening in care homes, according to new figures.\n\nData from the National Records of Scotland (NRS) showed that 338 of the 656 deaths recorded between 20 and 26 April were in care homes.\n\nThe figures bring the total number of people to have died with confirmed or suspected cases of the virus to 2,272.\n\nFirst Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the deaths included six members of NHS staff and five social care workers.\n\nMs Sturgeon said that it was \"not necessarily the case\" that all of the staff members contracted the virus through their work, and in some cases people may not have been in their workplace for some time.\n\nShe added: \"It is really important for us to understand how many frontline workers lose their lives from this virus and it is also really important that we ensure appropriate investigation into the circumstances and of course learn any lessons that we can.\"\n\nThe NRS data includes all cases where the virus is mentioned on a death certificate as a potential cause, and provides a wider picture than the figures announced each day, which only cover cases confirmed by laboratory testing.\n\nIn the most recent week covered by the statistics, more than half of the recorded coronavirus deaths were in care homes - with one in seven of all deaths in care homes in 2020 now being linked to virus.\n\nMs Sturgeon said the proportion of deaths in care homes was \"deeply distressing\", but \"broadly in line with proportions being reported from many other countries\".\n\nShe said the latest figures partly reflected the fact that the number of deaths linked to the virus in hospitals \"seems to be declining\".\n\nBut the first minister said care homes were still \"very vulnerable to this virus\" due to the age and frailty of many residents, adding that \"we will continue to take whatever steps necessary\" to make them \"as safe as possible\".\n\nConcerns have been raised in recent weeks about a lack of testing and protective equipment in care homes.\n\nAnd Scottish Conservative leader Jackson Carlaw said the NRS figures showed that the Scottish government was continuing to \"fall well short\" in its support for the sector.\n\nHe added: \"Scores of elderly people are dying every day in care homes - they need action now, not merely a suggestion that things are being monitored and considered.\n\n\"These homes play a key part in the health system at all times, easing strain on councils and the NHS, and helping ease bed-blocking.The residents and staff need access to testing - they deserve absolutely no less.\"\n\nThe latest increase in the number of deaths in care homes confirms they have now become the front line in the battle against coronavirus.\n\nThere appears to be a split - while the spread of the virus in the community has been slowed, it remains stubbornly difficult to control in care homes.\n\nDo we need a new strategy? The first minister was asked this and pointed out that care homes have proved a challenge for all countries during this outbreak.\n\nShe was also pressed on the difference in testing between Scotland and England - where all care home staff and residents can now be tested even if they don't have symptoms.\n\nNicola Sturgeon indicated we should expect to hear more details on testing before the end of the week.\n\nKeeping our most vulnerable safe is proving an incredibly difficult challenge. But the first minister promised there had been no complacency.\n\nOf the 2,272 deaths linked to the virus since the outbreak began, just over half have happened in hospitals, with 39% in care homes and 9% at home or in non-institutional settings.\n\nPeople aged 75 or over have accounted for 74% of the deaths, with only 17 of those who died being under the age of 45.\n\nCoronavirus was involved in more than a third - 36% - of all deaths registered in Scotland between 20 and 26 April.\n\nThe virus has also affected some areas more severely than others. The Greater Glasgow and Clyde health board area has reported the highest rate of deaths, at 6.3 per 10,000 people, while the Western Isles has reported no deaths at all.\n\nThe data also shows that there have been 3,116 more deaths in the last four weeks than would be expected based on the average of the past five years.\n\nWhile the majority of these were linked to coronavirus, concerns have been raised about \"excess\" deaths due to other causes.\n\nThis includes 340 deaths linked to dementia or Alzheimers, and 194 of heart disease or stroke patients.\n\nMs Sturgeon said the number of excess deaths was lower than in previous weeks, but was still \"a source of concern\" and \"a much higher number than we would want to see\".\n\nShe said: \"Overall they are far too high, but on the most recent comparable data we have in Scotland, the proportion of excess deaths at this stage is slightly lower than it is in England and Wales.\"\n\nThe first minister said there was a danger of people feeling \"dispirited and powerless\" when hearing the rising death toll, but stressed that \"every one of us has the power to protect our loved ones and communities\" by abiding by lockdown restrictions.\n\nShe said: \"These measures are tough for all of us, and they are getting tougher. But they are having a positive impact, notwithstanding some of the upsetting news today.\n\n\"The converse of that point is equally stark - easing up on these restrictions would have a negative impact that would be felt very rapidly. We do need to stick with it.\"",

    "Coronavirus nurses: 'I'm proud of my work'": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "With more than four million reported cases worldwide, the coronavirus pandemic has brought the work done by nurses into the spotlight.\n\nTo mark International Nurses Day, the BBC spoke to nurses working on four different continents, to learn about the challenges they face in the battle against Covid-19.\n\nNursing day is celebrated on 12 May, the birthday of Florence Nightingale, the founder of modern nursing.\n\n\"At first my family weren't comfortable with me joining the fight against Covid-19. But when they saw the pictures of my protective gear they understood that I am protected enough,\" says Mzwakhe Mohlaloganye.\n\nMzwakhe, a 37-year-old father-of-two, has been a nurse for five years and has been part of the mobile Covid-19 team in Johannesburg for two months.\n\nSouth Africa has done an exceptional job at \"flattening the curve\" and many people say that community testing and awareness is a big part of that.\n\nThe team screens and tests people in the local community, prioritising those over the age of 59 and those with chronic medical conditions.\n\nMzwakhe has found the role rewarding, seeing it as an opportunity to learn about the disease and how it connects with the different kinds of conditions in his patients.\n\nHowever, his family were initially reticent about his new role and were concerned about his welfare.\n\n\"Mum told me she feels grateful to have a son like me - one of the people who are out there fighting for them.\"\n\nReflecting on the efforts made by his team on the frontline and his work as a nurse, Mzwakhe feels he plays an important role, not just helping to raise awareness but helping to save communities.\n\n\"It makes me feel like a superhero because I feel like I am a lifesaver in my country.\"\n\nHe also feels that nurses are appreciated now more than ever.\n\n\"For nurses all over the world my message is don't give up. You must do whatever you can to help contain the virus. Never feel like a failure.\"\n\nIt became a symbol of a country overwhelmed: a photo of an exhausted nurse in her facemask slumped asleep over her computer. Italy had been struck by the virus - the first western country to be hit so badly - and the picture of Elena Pagliarini encapsulated the devastation it was wreaking.\n\n\"It was such a dramatic situation\", Elena told the BBC, \"some patients were dying in front of me. We worked all night. At 6am, I stopped and rested briefly on the desk and a doctor took this picture. It was an angst-ridden moment.\"\n\nShe says she hadn't realised the importance of the photo until she was contacted by journalists and people she didn't know.\n\n\"I realised the picture became bigger than just the moment it captured. It was moving but also unsettling.\"\n\nBy mid-March, when hospitals in northern Italy were at bursting point and hundreds were dying each day, Elena herself became infected, losing her sense of smell and taste. She stayed at home for 23 days and returned to work on 2 April, as Italy reached the peak of the outbreak.\n\nSince then, infections have fallen dramatically and intensive care occupancy has dropped to a manageable level. Italy has started to ease its lockdown - the world's longest. \"We're now in phase two\", Elena says, \"we still have cases coming in but the symptoms are lighter: sore throat, dehydration, strong headaches - but it's not an emergency situation.\"\n\nAt least 160 health workers have died in Italy. The country's medics - as everywhere - are seen as the heroes of this battle.\n\n\"I'm proud of my work\", says Elena. \"That photo shows just me but it should represent all nurses and doctors.\"\n\nGabriela Serrano, a nurse working in the US, has fond memories of the day she saw her first Covid-19 patient discharged.\n\n\"She was so happy when I wheeled her out of the hospital. She said: 'It is so good to see the sun shine and breathe fresh air'\".\n\nGabriela has been a nurse for seven years. During the pandemic she worked in a hospital on the outskirts of San Francisco.\n\n\"The two Covid-19 patients I was taking care of had underlying health conditions and were above 70. Yet they managed to survive. This gives me hope.\"\n\nGabriela, 31, has seen three non-coronavirus deaths in the past two months. She described how she had cared for a dying woman.\n\n\"She was a bit responsive on the first day but was non-verbal. l explained everything I was doing to her, even though she wasn't able to talk back to me.\"\n\nThe next day, the patient was not even opening her eyes.\n\nThe hospital authorised a visit from relatives during the patient's final hours. Unfortunately, she had no close family and her best friend opted to stay away from the hospital.\n\n\"I sat with her, held her hand and just told her it was going to be okay. I was there. She had someone with her,\" says Gabriela.\n\n\"I don't know if she could hear me at that point, but it was the best I could do for her.\"\n\nHer hard work didn't save her job. She is a travel nurse, as they call those working on short-term contracts. General patient admissions are down, as people fear contracting the virus and many stay away from hospitals for all non-emergency treatment, so the hospital she was working at decided to terminate her employment.\n\n\"I'm pretty optimistic about getting a job within a month. I'll take what I can get.\"\n\n\"On 24 March we had our first Covid-19 positive case. Immediately I thought about two tribal patients in my hospital. I asked them to leave,\" says Shanti Teresa lakra.\n\nShanti has made a name for herself providing health services for the rapidly declining tribal groups of India's Andaman and Nicobar islands and is a recipient of the Florence Nightingale award, the highest professional recognition for nurses in India.\n\nShe was taking care of a five-year-old boy from the Jarawa tribe affected by pneumonia, as well as a woman from the Shompen tribe seeking fertility treatment.\n\nJarawas made contact with the outside world only in 1997. The naked hunter-gatherers live in a forest reserve about 80km (50m) from Port Blair, where Shanti now works.\n\nA week after the boy was discharged, she went to the forest area to check on him.\n\n\"He had fully recovered. Since I can speak a bit of their language, I told them to move deep into the jungle and stay there.\"\n\nIsolation served as a shield for these aboriginal groups for thousands of years, but expanding settlements over the past century have decimated their population. Shanti says there are currently some 450 members of the Jarawa tribe.\n\n\"Their immunity is low. A single infected person can threaten the whole population.\"\n\nReporting by Swaminathan Natarajan, Mark Lowen and Christian Parkinson",

        "body": "Despite the horrific death toll caused by the coronavirus, many thousands of people have now survived the experience of having Covid-19.\n\nThe vast majority will have suffered relatively mild symptoms.\n\nBut those who were very ill and needed admission to intensive care, can face a long recovery.\n\nThat might mean weeks or months working with physiotherapists before they are even approaching recovery.\n\nOne of these is Roy Burton.\n\nMountain biking was one of Roy's passions, and he would head out into the hills around his Yorkshire home several times a week.\n\nBut after falling ill with Covid-19, this previously fit and healthy 53-year-old is a shadow of his former self\n\nAs he became more sick, Roy needed help with his breathing, leading to six days in intensive care.\n\nNow, back at home, he's struggling with the reality of rehabilitation.\n\n\"When I first came home (from hospital), I just took everything off and my partner helped me have a shower.\n\n\"Just doing that, I had to sit and rest. I just couldn't breathe.\n\n\"And then the next stage was to get myself up to bed - absolutely shattering, just no energy, not enough oxygen going in.\"\n\nAnd it's not just the physical aftermath of the virus that has hit Roy hard.\n\n\"There's all the mental scars of Covid-19,\" says Roy.\n\n\"You're constantly worried: Are you going to infect somebody? Are you still infected? Are you going to get it again?\"\n\nBoth the virus and the treatment needed to save a life can have a profound impact on patients.\n\nThe virus can leave them with scarring on the lungs - which makes it difficult to breathe - as well as extreme fatigue.\n\nAnd an extended period immobile in intensive care can leave muscles withered, and can even affect brain function.\n\nIntensive care consultant Carl Wardmann, from the Faculty of Intensive Care Medicine, says treating Covid-19 patients, many of whom needed to be on ventilators to help them breathe, has presented its own set of challenges.\n\n\"A term was coined which is called 'post intensive care syndrome' - which is if you've been critically ill, you could have a whole variety of these symptoms which could stop you getting back to your normal life.\n\n\"The way we've had to ventilate patients, for instance, is very different to what we normally do. Their lungs are so difficult to ventilate we've had to really anaesthetise them.\n\n\"The muscle-wasting is quite intense, which means we can't rehabilitate them in intensive care.\n\n\"The other thing is, if they're very heavily asleep, you can't assess their brain, and we may miss patients that have some problems with brain function.\"\n\nSusan Calvert, the lead critical care physiotherapist at the Queen Alexandra Hospital in Portsmouth, says recovery can be a lengthy struggle for some.\n\n\"It can take some critical-care patients 18 months to really get back to their normal selves, psychologically, strength-wise, fatigue-wise.\"\n\nRuth Ten Hove of the Chartered Society of Physiotherapists warns that a growing number of patients are going to need a lot of help in the coming months: \"The response from the community will go on much, much longer, as people will take much longer to recover.\n\n\"I think what's really important at the moment is to start planning for that, and to think about a long-term rehabilitation strategy to enable the population to get back to full health and recovery, from both the pandemic and the period of lockdown as well.\"\n\nFor many people, the initial illness caused by the coronavirus was just the beginning.",

        "body": "Loss of smell or taste have been added to the UK's list of coronavirus symptoms that people should look out for and self-isolate with.\n\nUntil now, only a fever and cough were triggers for people to shut themselves away in self-isolation in case they had and could spread the infection.\n\nEar, nose and throat doctors had been warning for weeks that more symptoms should be included.\n\nScientific advisers told the government to update the advice.\n\nIf you or someone you live with has any of these symptoms - a new, continuous cough, fever or loss of smell or taste (also called anosmia) - the advice is stay at home for seven days to stop the risk of giving coronavirus to others.\n\nCough and loss of smell or taste can persist after seven days. You do not need to keep self-isolating after seven days, unless you have a high temperature or are unwell, says the advice.\n\nLoss of smell and taste may still be signs of other respiratory infections, such as the common cold. Experts say fever and cough remain important symptoms of coronavirus to look out for.\n\nUsing an app, researchers at King's College London have gathered symptom information from over 1.5m people in the UK who believe they might have had coronavirus.\n\nThey say there are even more symptoms - such as tiredness and stomach pain or diarrhoea - that could be included as possible coronavirus symptoms.\n\nSome other countries and the World Health Organization are already citing them.\n\nLead researcher Prof Tim Spector said: \"We list about 14 symptoms which we know are related to having a positive swab test.\n\n\"These are not being picked up by the NHS. This country is missing them all and not only underestimating cases but also putting people at risk and continuing the epidemic.\n\n\"There's no point telling people to be alert if they don't know the symptoms.\"\n\nProf Nirmal Kumar from ENT UK, the body that represents ear, nose and throat doctors, said the change was \"better late than never\".\n\n\"We had been asking for this almost eight weeks ago. The delay has not helped at all. Many, many people have contacted us with concerns about loss of smell and taste and whether these are symptoms they should act upon.\"\n\nEngland's deputy chief medical officer, Prof Jonathan Van-Tam said it was important to update advice at the right time \"when we think it's going to make a difference moving forwards to how we pick up cases\".\n\nDowning Street said the UK's chief medical officers were continually reviewing symptoms of the virus based on advice from experts.\n\n\"They are now confident that encouraging self-isolation with a loss of sense of smell or taste will pick up slightly more cases and help to further control the spread of the virus,\" the prime minister's official spokesman said.\n\nThe World Health Organization says along with the most common symptoms of fever, cough and tiredness, people may have:\n\nOn Monday NHS England announced 122 new deaths of people who had tested positive for Covid-19. A further six deaths were recorded in Northern Ireland, four in Wales, and two in Scotland.\n\nThe overall UK death toll remains the highest in Europe, and was at 34,636 as of Sunday.",

    "Coronavirus testing falls short of daily target": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "Testing for coronavirus fell sharply on Saturday, days after Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the government had met its daily target of 100,000 tests.\n\nIn the past 24 hours, ministers said just under 76,500 tests were carried out, a drop of more than a third on the 122,000 tests carried out on 30 April.\n\nNHS England medical director Prof Stephen Powis acknowledged that testing had taken a \"little bit of a dip\".\n\nOn Friday Mr Hancock described the 100,000 target as \"audacious\".\n\nThe health secretary set the goal on 2 April, when the UK was on 10,000 tests a day.\n\nAnnouncing the government's success, Mr Hancock suggested the 100,000 goal had a \"galvanising effect\", adding that the bolstered testing capacity would \"help us to unlock the lockdown\".\n\nHowever, the government came in for criticism for including 40,000 tests which were dispatched by post and may not have been taken.\n\nSince then, the number of tests has dropped by about 40,000, according to official statistics.\n\nAt the Downing Street briefing on Sunday, cabinet minister Michael Gove praised Mr Hancock's \"amazing achievement\" in reaching his target.\n\nMr Gove said the massive increase in tests had been an example of what \"the public sector and the private sector working together under a very strong political leadership can achieve\".\n\nHe said the dip in the number of tests was due to the fact that fewer people were at work over the weekend.\n\n\"Thanks to the hard work of so many across the NHS, Public Health England, our pharmaceutical sector and our universities, we have tested over 200,000 key workers and their families, allowing those who don't have the virus to go back to work and protecting those who do.\"\n\nAlso speaking at the briefing, Prof Powis said testing capacity \"had ramped up very quickly\".\n\n\"We are now at a very high level of testing, over 100,000 - a little bit of a dip in the weekend - but we anticipate that that testing capacity will continue to increase,\" he said.\n\nDr Elisabetta Groppelli, a lecturer in global health at St George's, University of London, said 76,500 was still a \"fantastic number\" and that the UK was \"becoming comparable\" to countries with similar population sizes.\n\n\"What is important is that the UK has steadily increased the number of tests that have been performed,\" she said.\n\nTesting was expanded in England last week to millions more people with symptoms including over-65s, those who have to leave home to work, and people living with someone in these groups.\n\nIn Scotland, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon announced earlier that testing would be expanded to over-65s with symptoms and also all those in care homes where there had been an outbreak.\n\nAnd on Friday, the Welsh government extended coronavirus testing to people in care homes even if they are not showing symptoms of the disease.\n\nThe UK government is hoping the enhanced testing regime, alongside contact tracing and continued social distancing, can stay on top of transmission rates and prevent a second wave of infection.\n\nA \"comprehensive\" road map on a gradual easing of lockdown measures is expected at the end of next week.\n\nA total of 28,446 people have now died with coronavirus across the UK.\n\nThat number includes deaths in hospitals, care homes and the community, but only for those who have tested positive for Covid-19.",

        "authors": [],
        "body": "The first hints that a vaccine can train people's immune system to fight coronavirus have been reported by a company in the US.\n\nModerna said neutralising antibodies were found in the first eight people who took part in their safety trials.\n\nIt also said the immune response was similar to people infected with the actual virus.\n\nLarger trials to see whether the jab actually protects against infection are expected to start in July.\n\nWork on a coronavirus vaccine has been taking place at unprecedented speed, with around 80 groups around the world working on them.\n\nModerna was the first to test an experimental vaccine, called mRNA-1273, in people.\n\nThe vaccine is a small snippet of the coronavirus's genetic code, which is injected into the patient.\n\nIt is not capable of causing an infection or the symptoms of Covid-19, but is enough to provoke a response from the immune system.\n\nThe vaccine trials, run by the US government's National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, showed the vaccine led to the production of antibodies which can neutralise the coronavirus.\n\nHowever, testing for these neutralising antibodies has only taken place on the first eight, out of 45, people on the trial.\n\nThe people on the trial were taking either a low, middle or high dose. The highest dose was linked to most side-effects.\n\nHowever, Moderna said that even people taking the lowest dose had antibodies at the same levels seen in patients who recover from Covid-19.\n\nAnd antibodies \"significantly exceeded\" those in recovered patients for people on the middle dose.\n\nThe study is known as a phase 1 trial as it is designed to test whether the vaccine is safe, rather then whether it is effective.\n\nIt will take larger trials to see if people are protected against the virus. However, experiments on mice showed the vaccine could prevent the virus replicating in their lungs.\n\n\"These interim phase 1 data, while early, demonstrate that vaccination with mRNA-1273 elicits an immune response of the magnitude caused by natural infection,\" said Dr Tal Zaks, chief medical officer at Moderna.\n\n\"These data substantiate our belief that mRNA-1273 has the potential to prevent Covid-19 disease and advance our ability to select a dose for pivotal trials.\"\n\nModerna said it was hoping to start a large-scale trial in July, and that it was already investigating how to manufacture the vaccine at scale.\n\nA vaccine pioneered by the University of Oxford is also being tested in people, but there are no results from those trials yet.\n\nHowever, concerns have been raised about the results of experiments in monkeys.\n\nTests showed vaccinated animals had less severe symptoms and did not get pneumonia. However, they were not completely protected from the virus and signs of it were detected at the same level in the monkeys' noses as in unvaccinated animals.\n\nProf Eleanor Riley, from the University of Edinburgh, said: \"If similar results were obtained in humans, the vaccine would likely provide partial protection against disease in the vaccine recipient but would be unlikely to reduce transmission in the wider community.\"\n\nHowever, until human trials have been performed it is impossible to know how the vaccine will perform in people.",

He had diarrhoea and stomach pain and a temperature. I was on the phone to the GP pretty much every day. Phoning, videoing.\"\n\nOn the Friday, Marley was very ill, and he had symptoms that were scaring Hayley.\n\n\"He was really tired and he had a roaring, high temperature that wouldn't go down. His neck glands were swollen.\n\n\"His hands and feet were bright red and his eyes were bloodshot. And he was breathing really fast. It was terrifying.\n\n\"I called the GP again, but decided to take him to hospital. I followed my gut instinct.\"\n\nThe doctors in the paediatric unit admitted Marley and started running tests to figure out what might be wrong.\n\nThey suspected a few possible causes, including a bad reaction to coronavirus.\n\nDoctors around the UK have been warning about a rare but serious syndrome that could be linked to the pandemic virus.\n\nSome of these very ill children have had a septic-shock type illness with a rash and difficulty breathing.\n\nHealth Secretary Matt Hancock has said that he is very worried about it and that experts are looking into this rare condition.\n\nMarley's coronavirus test came back negative and his doctors are now treating him for atypical Kawasaki disease.\n\nThis is another rare condition that mainly affects children under the age of five. Children who develop it may be genetically predisposed to doing so.\n\nThe symptoms are like those seen when the body is trying hard to fight off an infection. And it is one of the conditions that mimics the new mystery illness which doctors think might be linked to coronavirus.\n\nSymptoms include swollen lymph nodes, fever and in severe cases, inflammation of arteries of the heart.\n\nMarley has been discharged from hospital but Hayley hopes sharing her story will help other parents who may face a similar dilemma to her own.\n\n\"All I can do is share this message. Seek help immediately if your child is unwell and your gut is telling you something isn't right. You know your child.\n\n\"I know people are reluctant to go to hospital because of coronavirus. You might think you are doing them a favour by keeping them at home but if they are really ill then you have got to seek help.\"",

Only 15,994 tests were conducted in the UK (excluding Northern Ireland) in the 24 hours to 09:00 on 15 April.\n\nWhen it comes to testing capacity - the amount of tests which could theoretically be carried out on any one day - that stood at more than 30,000 by mid-April.\n\n\"I am now setting the goal of 100,000 tests per day by the end of this month - that is the goal and I am determined that we will get there\" - Matt Hancock, 2 April\n\nOutcome:\n\nWith a day to go, the government is a little over halfway towards this target.\n\nIn the 24 hours to 0900 on 29 April, 52,429 tests were carried out across the UK.\n\nDaily testing capacity is over 73,000.\n\nPreviously, Matt Hancock has suggested that there has been a \"lack of demand\" from NHS and other key workers for tests. But the bodies which represent them say there have been problems getting tested.\n\nHe has extended testing to all those who live and work in the care sector and is also offering tests to over 65s and those who have to go out to work - if they are showing symptoms. Mr Hancock insists the government is \"on track\" to meet its testing target.\n\nThe devolved administrations in Wales and Scotland also made pledges on coronavirus testing.\n\nBut Wales's health minister Vaughan Gething announced they were abandoning their promise of conducting 5,000 tests a day by mid-April, blaming problems obtaining testing kits.\n\nLikewise, Nicola Sturgeon admitted at a press briefing on 23 April that Scotland was unlikely to achieve its original target of 10,000 tests per day by the end of April, saying \"we are working towards a capacity of 3,500 by the end of April\".\n\n\"We are working with Boots and other partners to set up over 50 regional test centres around the country by the end of April\" - Matt Hancock statement, 4 April\n\nOutcome:\n\n43 of the 50 regional test centres were operational by 27 April.\n\nThe \"drive-through\" test centres - for NHS and other key workers - are run by Boots and other commercial providers, with one walk-in centre run out of the Nightingale Hospital in London.\n\nA DHSC spokesperson confirmed to the BBC they \"expect 50 drive-through sites opened by the end of the month\".\n\n\"On the personal protective equipment, the answer is by the end of this week.\" - Boris Johnson, 25 March\n\nOutcome:\n\nOn 25 March, Boris Johnson was asked in parliament when \"every single person\" working in care homes around the country would get the personal protective equipment (PPE) they needed and he replied: \"The answer is by the end of this week.\"\n\nBut that didn't appear to happen. In early April, Nadra Ahmed, from the National Care Association, said: \"The issue we hear most is: 'I am desperate for masks. Has anyone got any gloves? I am down to my last stock.' Once you run out, it is a question of being down to Marigolds and bin liners.\"\n\nAccording to those working in the care home sector, the situation has improved more recently but is yet to be completely resolved.\n\nMartin Green, from Care England, said on 20 April that \"access to PPE remains problematic\" and that care homes still need \"a consistent supply\".\n\nA DHSC spokesperson said that by 27 April \"over 997 million items of PPE\" had been delivered \"across the health and social care system within England\".\n\nHowever, according to the BBC's Panorama programme, more than half of all the PPE items are surgical gloves - and in most cases, each individual glove is counted rather than pairs.\n\nAre NHS staff getting enough protective gear?\n\nConcerns about the availability of PPE in care homes have also been raised in Scotland and Wales.\n\n\"Making sure that the NHS always has the capacity to treat patients is also mission critical\" - Matt Hancock, 17 April\n\nOn 29 April, the Health Secretary Matt Hancock said that there were 3,260 spare critical care beds across the UK.\n\nThe DHSC said there were 7,199 critical care beds in the UK, not including the thousands of beds available at the temporary Nightingale hospitals.\n\nThe spare capacity reflects the falling numbers of patients requiring intensive care treatment for Covid-19.\n\nThe government insists that nobody in need of critical care has been unable to get it due to a lack of beds or equipment.\n\n\"Our goal, instead of the 30,000, is that we need 18,000 ventilators over the coming two weeks\" - Matt Hancock, 5 April\n\nOutcome:\n\nSo far, the government has managed to make 10,900 mechanical ventilators available in the NHS. Matt Hancock's 18,000 target was for this type of ventilator, according to the DHSC.\n\nThe original UK target had been higher but was reduced, Mr Hancock said, because the lockdown and social distancing measures were working to slow the spread of the virus.\n\nA spokesperson for the DHSC said: \"Every patient who needs a ventilator has been able to receive this treatment and we are confident that there will be enough ventilators available for everyone who needs one. We continue to keep capacity ahead of demand.\"\n\n\"I am making available an initial \u00a3330bn of guarantees...that means any business who needs access to cash to pay their rent, the salaries, suppliers, or purchase stock, will be able to access a government-backed loan, on attractive terms\" - Chancellor Rishi Sunak, 17 March\n\nOutcome:\n\nAs well as support for larger firms, the \u00a3330bn scheme offered help to small and medium-sized businesses (SMEs) through the Coronavirus Business Interruption Loans Scheme (CBILS).\n\nThis involved the government guaranteeing 80% of loans to SMEs up to \u00a35m made by various lenders such as High Street banks, as well as paying the charges and fees for the first year.\n\nUK Finance, which represents the banking industry, said on 30 April that 52,807 applications for loans had been received so far, of which 25,262 had been approved. It said \u00a34.1bn of loans had been guaranteed.\n\nOn 27 April, the chancellor introduced a new scheme for small businesses called Bounce Back Loans, which would be 100% guaranteed by the government for loans up to \u00a350,000.\n\nIt is designed to be simpler, requiring applicants to fill in a two-page self-certification form online and will come into force on Monday 4 May.\n\nThe British Chambers of Commerce welcomed the new scheme and the number of businesses that had been able to access the original loans, but said \"a concerningly high number of firms continue to struggle to access this crucial lifeline.\"\n\n\"The UK government and financial institutions should simplify and standardise the CBILS application processes to unlock access for more businesses of all sizes.\"\n\nA Treasury spokesperson said: \"More than 435,000 businesses have so far claimed \u00a33.75 billion to pay the wages of furloughed staff - and half a million firms have benefitted from \u00a36 billion of business grants.\"\n\nThis article was updated on 30 April to reflect the latest statistics.",

He married his long-term partner in hospital after he began showing symptoms of Covid-19.\n\nMr Wilson, who tested negative for the virus, married Jill Hird after securing special dispensation from the Archbishop of Canterbury.\n\nBefore the government announced the lockdown on 23 March, the Church of England restricted wedding ceremonies to five people - including the bride and groom, the priest and two witnesses.\n\nSome couples have opted to hold virtual wedding ceremonies, inviting their friends and family to watch them via video conferencing apps.",

    "Coronavirus: Children affected by rare Kawasaki-like disease": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "Scores of UK and US children have been affected by a rare inflammatory disease linked to coronavirus.\n\nIn a tiny number of children it can cause serious complications, with some needing intensive care.\n\nUp to 100 children in the UK have been affected and studies suggest the same reaction is being seen in children elsewhere in Europe.\n\nIt is likely to be caused by a delayed immune response to the virus which looks like Kawasaki disease.\n\nIn April, NHS doctors were told to look out for a rare but dangerous reaction in children .\n\nThis was prompted by eight children becoming ill in London , including a 14-year-old who died.\n\nThey all had similar symptoms when they were admitted to Evelina London Children's Hospital, including a high fever, rash, red eyes, swelling and general pain.\n\nMost of the children had no major lung or breathing problems, although seven were put on a ventilator to help improve heart and circulation issues.\n\nDoctors are describing it as a \"new phenomenon\" similar to Kawasaki disease shock syndrome - a rare condition that mainly affects children under the age of five. Symptoms include a rash, swollen glands in the neck and dry and cracked lips.\n\nBut this new syndrome is also affecting older children up to the age of 16, with a minority experiencing serious complications.\n\nDr Liz Whittaker, clinical lecturer in paediatric infectious diseases and immunology, at Imperial College London, said the fact that the syndrome was occurring in the middle of a pandemic, suggests the two are linked.\n\n\"You've got the Covid-19 peak, and then three or four weeks later we're seeing a peak in this new phenomenon which makes us think that it's a post-infectious phenomenon,\" she said.\n\nThis means it is likely to be something related to the build up of antibodies after infection.\n\nProf Russell Viner, president of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, said the majority of children who have had the condition have responded to treatment and are getting better and starting to go home.\n\nThe syndrome is \"exceptionally rare\", he said.\n\n\"This shouldn't stop parents letting their children exit lockdown,\" Prof Viner added.\n\nHe said understanding more about the inflammatory disease \"might explain why some children become very ill with Covid-19, while the majority are unaffected or asymptomatic\".\n\nChildren are thought to make up just 1-2% of all cases of coronavirus infection, accounting for less than 500 admissions to hospital.\n\nMichael Levin, professor of paediatrics and international child health at Imperial, explained that most of the children tested negative for coronavirus, but tested positive for detection of antibodies.\n\n\"So we really think that the biology of the disease, somehow involves an unusual immune response to the virus,\" he said.\n\nHowever Prof Levin said there was \"a vast amount to learn\" about the reaction, which had only been known about for two to three weeks.\n\nChildren appear to be affected up to six weeks after they have been infected with the virus, which could explain the appearance of the new syndrome several weeks after the peak of UK cases.\n\nThere have been similar cases in the US, Spain, Italy, France and the Netherlands.\n\nAt least 15 US states are looking into the rare condition, according to New York governor Andrew Cuomo.\n\nOut of 82 diagnosed cases of the inflammatory syndrome in New York, 53 children tested positive or had antibodies for Covid-19.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control (CDC) in the US is set to issue an alert and updated definition of the syndrome to healthcare providers this week.\n\nMeanwhile, according to a study by doctors in northern Italy , 10 children have been affected by the disease.\n\nAll 10 of the children in the study were admitted to a hospital in Bergamo - the city at the centre of the worst outbreak in Italy - between mid-February and mid-April, and recovered.\n\nThe children, who had an average age of seven, tended to have severe symptoms such as heart complications and signs of toxic shock syndrome. They also needed additional treatment with steroids.\n\nIn antibody tests on the children, eight appeared to have already had the coronavirus while the other two had not. But the researchers said the tests were not 100% accurate. Swab tests to detect the virus are not thought to be useful because the reaction tends to occur many weeks after infection.\n\nDr Lucio Verdoni, report author and doctor at the Hospital Papa Giovanni XXIII in Bergamo, said: \"Although this complication remains very rare, our study provides further evidence on how the virus may be affecting children.\"\n\nChild health experts in the UK say it may not be something which just affects children.\n\nThey are now working with researchers in the US and across Europe to find out more about what they have called paediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome or (PIMS-TS).",

        "body": "Delirium and confusion may be common among some seriously-ill hospital patients with Covid-19, a study in The Lancet suggests.\n\nLong stays in intensive care and being ventilated are thought to increase the risk, the researchers say.\n\nDoctors should look out for depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) after recovery.\n\nMost patients, particularly those with mild symptoms, will not be affected by mental health problems.\n\nThe evidence is based on studies of patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) and Middle-East respiratory syndrome (Mers), as well early data on Covid-19 patients.\n\nThe researchers, from the UK and Italy, found evidence of confusion and agitation in more than 60% of intensive care patients with Covid in a small number of studies, mostly from China.\n\nThey warned that PTSD could become an issue in some patients, based on the fact that 33% of survivors of Sars and Mers experienced post-traumatic stress more than two years after they were seriously ill.\n\nThere were also frequent reports from these patients of recalling traumatic memories, memory problems, fatigue, insomnia and low mood, during their recovery.\n\nBut it is still not clear how the current pandemic will affect people's mental health without more research, the study concludes .\n\n\"Our analysis of more than 3,550 coronavirus cases suggests that most people will not suffer from mental health problems following coronavirus infection\", says Dr Jonathan Rogers from University College London, who co-led the research.\n\nBut he warned that delirium - which can cover everything from patients hallucinating and being agitated to sitting completely still - could affect some patients.\n\nConfusion is not uncommon among patients in intensive care, he said, but it could be hitting older patients, who are already vulnerable, hardest.\n\nAnd the longer they stay in hospital without any contact with relatives, the worse the confusion can become.\n\nA UK study, not yet peer-reviewed, found that around 20% of people admitted to hospital with severe Covid-19 had confusion.\n\n\"Monitoring for the development of symptoms should be a routine part of the care we provide,\" Dr Rogers said.\n\nCommenting on the study, Dr Iris Sommer from the University Medical Centre, Groningen, in the Netherlands, said patients with Covid-19 who needed to be treated in ICU were \"an ultra high-risk group for developing acute psychiatric disorders, especially delirium\".\n\nUnlike Sars and Mers survivors, she said, they were returning to a society \"in deep economic crisis\" with some countries \"still in lockdown and enforcing physical isolation\".\n\nShe said this would keep stress levels high after recovery and could increase the risk of anxiety and depression.",

        "authors": [],
        "body": "Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus outbreak this Monday evening. We'll have another update on Tuesday morning.\n\nHealth Secretary Matt Hancock, giving the daily No 10 briefing, has said families of front-line NHS and social care staff who die with coronavirus will receive a \u00a360,000 payment. Mr Hancock announced the \"life assurance scheme\" as he confirmed 82 NHS staff and 16 care workers have died. There will be a minute's silence across the UK at 11:00 BST on Tuesday to remember key workers who have lost their lives. It comes as the number of hospital deaths from coronavirus in the UK rose by 360 to 21,092.\n\nBoris Johnson has urged the public not to lose patience with the lockdown, saying the UK is at \"the moment of maximum risk\" in the coronavirus outbreak. The PM, who spoke outside No 10 for the first time since recovering from the virus, said he refused to \"throw away\" people's \"effort and sacrifice\" by relaxing restrictions too soon. BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg called the speech \"serious\", but \"largely designed to hold the line\".\n\nGPs have been told to look out for a rare but dangerous reaction in children that may be linked to coronavirus. An urgent alert issued by NHS England said there was \"growing concern\" that a coronavirus-related inflammatory syndrome was emerging in children in the UK. It is unclear how many have been diagnosed, although the numbers will be low. Symptoms can include a high temperature, low blood pressure, a rash and difficulty breathing. But experts stress that very few children become severely ill with coronavirus.\n\nSmall firms are to get access to 100% taxpayer-backed loans after they raised concerns about slow access to existing coronavirus rescue schemes. Chancellor Rishi Sunak said the scheme would start next week, offering firms loans up to \u00a350,000 within days of applying. It comes as the chairman of the retail firm Timpson warned that some High Street shops won't survive the lockdown. Meanwhile, Greggs is to become the latest food retailer to reopen some of its outlets despite the restrictions.\n\nA football-mad 10-year-old girl has urged people to help her do 7.1 million keepy-uppies, one for each UK key worker, to raise money for charities. Imogen Papworth-Heidel, whose parents work for the NHS, said she was inspired after seeing war veteran Captain Tom Moore, 99, doing laps of his garden to raise millions for the NHS. She hopes to raise \u00a31,300 by keeping her football up in the air as many times as she can.\n\nGet a longer coronavirus briefing from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning, by signing up here.\n\nYou can find more information, advice and guides on our coronavirus page.\n\nHere's some advice on the rules concerning self-isolation and exercise during the pandemic.\n\nWhat questions do you have about coronavirus?",

    "Coronavirus: Five and overs in UK now eligible for test \" Heykayjones Blog": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "Everyone aged five and over in the UK with symptoms can now be tested for coronavirus, Health Secretary Matt Hancock has announced.\n\nHe was speaking in Parliament after the loss of taste or smell was added to the list of Covid-19 symptoms, alongside a fever and a new persistent cough.\n\nMr Hancock said the government was \"expanding eligibility for testing further than ever before\".\n\nHe added 100,678 tests had been conducted on Sunday.\n\nTesting in England and Scotland has been limited to people with symptoms who are key workers and their families, hospital patients, care home residents, over-65s and those who need to leave home to work.\n\nIn Wales and Northern Ireland it was just key workers, hospital workers and care home residents.\n\nMr Hancock said that priority for testing would still be given to NHS staff and care home workers and residents to \"protect our most vulnerable\".\n\nA further 160 coronavirus deaths have been recorded in the UK as of 17:00 BST on Sunday taking the official total to 34,796 - the highest figure in Europe.\n\nEarlier, Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon announced the extension of testing there as she revealed lockdown measures would be eased from 28 May.\n\nMeanwhile, Northern Ireland has also announced an easing of lockdown including new rules to allow groups of four to six people who do not share a household to meet outdoors.\n\nThe UK government has ramped up testing and made it part of its five goals to meet in order to leave lockdown.\n\nThe prime minister has set a target for a daily capacity of 200,000 by the end of the month and last week the UK had reached a capacity of 150,000 a day.\n\nSo far the most tests done in a day is 136,000, on Friday, but this included kits posted out and not necessarily returned.\n\nHealth professionals have raised concerns about the accuracy of some tests as well as the time it takes for results to be returned to patients.\n\nNHS Providers, the association of NHS trusts in England, said the average test return was five days with the longest wait being 13 days.\n\nChief executive Chris Hopson said the testing regime was \"still a very long way from being fit for purpose\" and said that the gap between the tone struck in public statements and the reality on the ground was \"painfully wide\".\n\nOne person who had been tested at Lea Valley in north London, Michael Saunders, told the BBC's Hugh Pym it was \"disappointing\" that he had been waiting for five days for his result.\n\n\"If you are going to make testing a central part of how we deal with this virus you have got to make it right,\" he said.\n\nShadow health and social care secretary Jonathan Ashworth pressed the government on the time taken for results to be received on whether someone had Covid-19 or not.\n\nHe also asked if facilities could be set up to allow poorer people to be able to self-isolate if they are required to do so and whether those in insecure work would be guaranteed sick pay if they were asked to isolate.\n\nThe expansion of the testing programme may grab the headlines.\n\nIt is a significant milestone - in less than two months the UK has gone from only being able to test hospital patients and health and care staff to offering it more or less population-wide.\n\nBut it should not mask the difficulties that remain getting the test, track and trace system up-and-running.\n\nThis will be essential to contain local outbreaks as we ease ourselves out of lockdown.\n\nTests are still taking too long to turnaround for some - significant numbers are thought to be waiting several days - while the piloting of the tracking app on the Isle of Wight is not yet finished.\n\nOne particular concern is that the app does not yet let users know if the person they have had contact with ends up testing positive. Instead, it has only let them know if the contact has developed symptoms.\n\nThat is a major problem. It means people have been left in limbo and incorporating that feature into the app will be important.\n\nProgress is being made, but getting a workable and efficient system in place soon is still a monumental challenge.\n\nMr Hancock also said the government is in the \"closing stages\" of negotiations to purchase new Covid-19 antibody tests.\n\nA test developed by Swiss pharmaceutical company Roche was approved for use by Public Health England last week.\n\nMr Hancock said developments in tracking and tracing meant England was on course to meet the requirements for the next stage of easing lockdown restrictions on 1 June.\n\nHe told parliament 21,000 people had been recruited to conduct contact-tracing in England, including 7,500 healthcare workers.\n\nThis is when people who have come into contact with someone with the virus are tracked down and potentially asked to self-isolate.\n\nThe new recruits will be trained to identify people and advise them on whether to isolate.\n\nSpeaking at the Downing Street press briefing, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab defended the government's record on testing and the development of the test and trace app.\n\nHe said: \"We are learning all the way as we go through this pandemic, not just on the scientific side but on the innovation that we need to get a grip on it.\n\n\"We are making good progress on the testing and on the tracing and on the pilot in the Isle of Wight in relation to the app.\"\n\nThe foreign secretary said the app would be ready in \"the coming weeks\" but could not confirm it would be ready before children start returning to school.\n\nEngland's deputy chief medical officer Prof Jonathan Van-Tam told Monday's press briefing that only once there was a vaccine \"really capable of suppressing disease levels\" will the country be \"out of this\".\n\n\"So from that perspective we may have to live, and learn to live, with this virus in the long-term, certainly for many months to come if not several years,\" he said.\n\nHe added it was unclear if there was seasonality to the virus and whether it would come back in autumn and winter.\n\nOn Sunday the government announced it had an agreement for 30 million doses of a vaccine if a trial at the University of Oxford was successful.\n\nThe first hints that a vaccine can train people's immune system to fight coronavirus have been reported by a US company.\n\nAnosmia - the loss of smell - has officially been added to the main symptoms of Covid-19 but Prof Van-Tam said it was rare for it to be present without other symptoms.\n\nTesting eligibility, like lockdown measures, is devolved for individual nations to set their own rules. Mr Hancock made his announcement on the extension of testing across the UK after all four nations agreed to the change.",

    "Coronavirus: France's first known case 'was in December'": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "A patient treated in a hospital near Paris on 27 December for suspected pneumonia actually had the coronavirus, his doctor has said.\n\nThis means the virus may have arrived in Europe almost a month earlier than previously thought.\n\nDr Yves Cohen said a swab taken at the time was recently tested, and came back positive for Covid-19.\n\nThe patient, who has since recovered, said he had no idea where he caught the virus as he had not travelled abroad.\n\nKnowing who was the first case is key to understanding how the virus spread.\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) says it is possible more early cases will come to light, and spokesman Christian Lindmeier urged countries to check records for similar cases in order to gain a clearer picture of the outbreak.\n\nThe French health ministry told the BBC that the government was obtaining confirmation on the case and that it would consider further investigations if they proved necessary.\n\nFrance is not the only country where subsequent testing points to earlier cases. Two weeks ago, a post-mortem examination carried out in California revealed that the first coronavirus-related death in the US was almost a month earlier than previously thought.\n\nDr Cohen, head of emergency medicine at Avicenne and Jean-Verdier hospitals near Paris, said the patient was a 43-year-old man from Bobigny, north-east of Paris.\n\nHe told the BBC's Newsday programme that the patient must have been infected between 14 and 22 December, as coronavirus symptoms take between five and 14 days to appear.\n\nThe patient, Amirouche Hammar was admitted to hospital on 27 December exhibiting a dry cough, a fever and trouble breathing - symptoms which would later become known as main indications of coronavirus.\n\nThis was four days before the WHO's China country office was informed of cases of pneumonia of unknown cause being detected in the Chinese city of Wuhan.\n\nMr Hammar told French broadcaster BFMTV that he had not left France before falling sick. Dr Cohen said while two of the patient's children had also fallen ill, his wife had not shown any symptoms.\n\nBut Dr Cohen pointed out that the patient's wife worked at a supermarket near Charles de Gaulle airport and could have come into contact with people who had recently arrived from China. The patient's wife said that \"often customers would come directly from the airport, still carrying their suitcases\".\n\n\"We're wondering whether she was asymptomatic,\" Dr Cohen said.\n\nCould coronavirus have been circulating in Europe in late 2019, many weeks before it was officially recognised and declared a threat there? That is the suggestion being made after a French doctor has revealed that he treated a patient in Paris with all of the symptoms of coronavirus just after Christmas.\n\nHow does this change what we know about the pandemic? It might be that the test result is an error and so does not change a thing.\n\nBut it if is correct, it could mean spread of the disease was going unchecked in Europe while all eyes were on the East in Wuhan.\n\nCertainly, any laboratories in Europe with samples from patients sick with similar symptoms around that time might want to run a test for coronavirus to see what it reveals so that we can learn more about this new disease.\n\nUntil now, what were thought to have been the France's first three cases of coronavirus were confirmed on 24 January. Of those, two had been to Wuhan - where the outbreak was first detected - and the third was a close family member.\n\nMr Hammar's positive test result suggests the virus was present in France much earlier.\n\nThe first human-to-human transmission within Europe had until now thought to have been a German man who was infected by a Chinese colleague who visited Germany between 19 and 22 January.\n\nRowland Kao, a professor of veterinary epidemiology and data science at the University of Edinburgh, said that if confirmed, Mr Hammar's case highlighted the speed at which an infection starting in a seemingly remote part of the world could quickly seed infections elsewhere.\n\n\"It means that the lead time we have for assessment and decision-making can be very short,\" Prof Kao said.\n\nDr Cohen told the BBC that he had the idea to look back at all patients who had been in intensive care units with suspected pneumonia between 2 December and 16 January.\n\nHe found 14 patients who had tested negative for pneumonia. He defrosted their samples and tested them for traces of Covid-19.\n\nHe said that out of the 14 samples, one tested positive for traces of Covid-19. A second test on that same sample also came back positive. He added that the patient's chest scan was also compatible with the symptoms of Covid-19.\n\nA full report was due later this week, and would be published by the International Journal of Antimicrobial Agents, Dr Cohen added.",

        "authors": [],
        "body": "Passengers arriving from France will be exempt from forthcoming UK coronavirus quarantine measures.\n\nBoris Johnson said on Sunday the rules would be imposed on people coming into the UK, to prevent Covid-19 being brought in from overseas.\n\nAs yet, no start or end date for the measures has been announced.\n\nThe government has already indicated that people arriving from the Republic of Ireland will not be made to go into quarantine.\n\nHowever, the measures will apply to UK holidaymakers returning from other destinations.\n\nTravel industry analysts said that meant a one-week or two-week holiday abroad would be followed by another two weeks in self-isolation.\n\nThe World Travel and Tourism Council expressed concern about the new measures, saying they would damage confidence among would-be travellers.\n\nIn his address to the nation on Sunday, the prime minister said: \"I am serving notice that it will soon be the time - with transmission significantly lower - to impose quarantine on people coming into this country by air.\"\n\nThe government later clarified that the rules would apply not just to air passengers, but also those arriving by other means of travel.\n\nUK airlines previously said they had been told that any quarantine period would last for 14 days, and that people might be expected to provide an address when they arrive at the border.\n\nFollowing Mr Johnson's speech, No 10 confirmed a reciprocal deal with the government in Paris meant restrictions would not apply to passengers from France.\n\nIn a joint statement, the UK and French governments said they had agreed to \"work together in taking forward appropriate border measures\", adding: \"This co-operation is particularly necessary for the management of our common border.\"\n\nThe statement added: \"No quarantine measures would apply to travellers coming from France at this stage; any measures on either side would be taken in a concerted and reciprocal manner.\n\n\"A working group between the two governments will be set up to ensure this consultation throughout the coming weeks.\"\n\nWillie Walsh, chief executive of British Airways owner IAG, said it was more bad news for the travel industry.\n\n\"There's nothing positive in anything I heard the Prime Minister say yesterday,\" he told MPs in parliament's Transport Committee.\n\nWhen asked why travellers from France will not be quarantined over, for example, Germany, he said: \"That's the bit I don't understand.\n\n\"We will have to wait and see the final details of what the Prime Minister intends to do.\"\n\nHe added that the quarantine measures will mean his company will have to review its plan to return to 50% capacity by July,\n\nVirginia Messina, managing director of the World Travel and Tourism Council, told the BBC's Today programme she was \"concerned\" about the government's new policy.\n\n\"Quarantines work when implemented early, so it should have probably been applied much earlier in the UK,\" she said.\n\n\"We believe this is going to highly damage the confidence of people who are wishing to travel or at least make some plans in the near future.\"\n\nMs Messina pointed out that some airports in other countries were testing passengers for the virus on arrival and exempting them from quarantine if they tested negative.\n\nRajeev Shaunak, head of travel and tourism at MHA Macintyre Hudson, said: \"Full details are expected this week, but it's believed the quarantine for passengers in the UK will become effective at the end of May, usually the start of the busiest period for the UK travel industry.\n\n\"The prime minister also said nothing to suggest current [Foreign Office] advice against all but essential travel throughout the world was likely to change any time soon. The message 'Stay home' has now become 'Don't leave the country'.\"\n\nMr Shaunak described the policy as \"a disaster\", adding that it could cost package holiday operators between \u00a34.5bn and \u00a35bn worth of business for this year.\n\nAirline and airport bosses spoke to the aviation minister on Sunday about the new measures.\n\nHowever, they told the BBC that they were still in the dark over basic details such as when they would come into force, when they would end and whether they would be continuously reviewed.\n\nAirlines are calling for additional government support after the prime minister confirmed a quarantine period will come into force.\n\nAirlines UK chief executive Tim Alderslade said: \"We all, including government, need to adapt to the new normal, but closing off air travel in this way is not the way to achieve this.\"\n\nThe government faces a two-pronged attack over its travel quarantine, even though the detail on the policy is still sparse.\n\nThe pandemic is already causing acute damage to the UK's aviation sector, and airline and airport bosses believe the quarantine will make things a whole lot worse.\n\nThey did not receive the reassurances they wanted during a call with the aviation minister earlier on Sunday.\n\nOpposition MPs are also wading in with the question: \"If now, why not before?\"\n\nIt's estimated that about 100,000 people have arrived in the UK since 23 March, when the lockdown was brought in.\n\nMany people coming home in recent weeks have been left confused over whether they were supposed to self-isolate.\n\nGovernment advice that people arriving from China and Italy who didn't have symptoms should stay at home for two weeks was withdrawn on 13 March.\n\nHeathrow airport said it supported the government's aim of avoiding a second wave of infection, even though a 14-day quarantine plan amounted to a temporary closure of borders.\n\nHowever, the airport's chief executive, John Holland-Kaye, said the government \"urgently\" needed to lay out a roadmap for how it would reopen borders once the disease had been beaten.\n\nAir travel has ground to a halt because of the global coronavirus pandemic, prompting steep job cuts by the industry.\n\nRyanair has said it plans to axe 3,000 workers and has asked remaining staff to take a pay cut.\n\nBA has said it will cut 12,000 of its workforce and has warned that it might not reopen at Gatwick Airport once the pandemic passes.",

        "body": "For an app with so much riding on it, NHS Covid-19 is at first sight very simple and extraordinarily unexciting.\n\nAt this stage, it is available to only NHS and council workers on the Isle of Wight.\n\nOn Thursday, other residents of the island will receive a leaflet containing a link that will trigger a download.\n\nAnd eventually anyone will be able to download it directly from the UK versions of Apple's App Store and the Google Play Store.\n\nI have been given special early access.\n\nWhen you install it, you are asked to enter the first half of your postcode.\n\nThen, you are asked to set up app permissions.\n\nFirst, you have to allow the app to use Bluetooth Low Energy to determine when it is near another phone using the app, keeping Bluetooth on at all times.\n\nNext, you approve push notifications so the app can alert you if you have been near someone with symptoms of the virus.\n\nFinally, you end up on a very simple home screen.\n\nIt offers the current advice on stopping the spread of the virus and asks a question: \"How are you feeling today?\"\n\nThere is a menu option: \"I feel unwell - I have a high temperature or continuous cough and want to know what to do next.\"\n\nIf you choose this, you are asked whether you have a high temperature or a continuous cough.\n\nIf you answer yes to either question, you are asked when the symptoms started.\n\nIf you are not on the Isle of Wight, you can submit this information but, at the moment, nothing more happens.\n\nBut if you are on the island, you are told to self-isolate and to call an 0800 number to have a swab test delivered to your home.\n\nIt also triggers alerts to those people with the app whose phones have been in contact with yours in recent days.\n\nAt first, these will be fairly cautious messages about observing social distancing.\n\nBut if a test comes back positive, contacts will be told to self-isolate.\n\nMost of the time, however, there will be hardly any reason to interact with the app at all.\n\nSome technical experts have said the NHS app will not work properly on an iPhone unless it is kept open and running in the foreground.\n\nThe team behind it insists this is not the case - although that is impossible for me to verify.\n\nWhat I can say is it does not appear to be a power hog, with just 2% of my battery used by the app over the past few hours.\n\nBy contrast, you won't be surprised to hear Twitter accounted for 25%.\n\nOf course, as I am the only person for miles around with the app, I have not been having Bluetooth interactions with others, so I don't know whether that would have made a difference.\n\nBut VMWare Pivotal Labs - the software company contracted to build the product - told BBC News it should not change things significantly and battery usage should remain \"very low\".\n\nThere has also been concern the app might trigger too many false positives or fall victim to mischievous people claiming they had symptoms when they had none.\n\nBut there could be the opposite problem.\n\nI have been told users should receive, on average, only one alert every six months, to say they had probably been in contact with someone infected.\n\nWith the Isle of Wight having a relatively low rate of infection, the trial could end up producing very little data - and might leave users wondering what all the fuss was about.\n\nOne thing I have learned is the decision on when to send alerts isn't quite as simple as it's sometimes been described.\n\nSo it's not just a case of: if Jack was within 2m (6ft) of Jill for 15 minutes or longer, then send an alert if he becomes ill.\n\nInstead, the app uses three metrics to work out a risk score:\n\nFurthermore, the score is calculated by taking into account all the risky interactions an app user has had over a period of two weeks, rather than on just one occasion.\n\nAnother discovery is the developers have taken into account the fact some users will sometimes be wearing personal protective equipment.\n\nA section marked \"important instructions for healthcare workers\" tells them to turn off Bluetooth \"when you put on your PPE\", to prevent those obviously in close contact with infected patients being told to stay home.",

        "body": "People living in more deprived areas of England and Wales are more likely to die with coronavirus than those in more affluent places, new figures suggest.\n\nOffice for National Statistics analysis shows there were 55 deaths for every 100,000 people in the poorest parts of England, compared with 25 in the wealthiest areas.\n\nMortality rates are normally higher in poorer areas.\n\nBut the ONS said coronavirus appeared to be adding to the problem.\n\n\"This is something that we are worried about and looking at,\" Health Secretary Matt Hancock said.\n\nSpeaking at the daily coronavirus briefing, Mr Hancock said his department was looking into the various ways the virus impacts different groups to understand it \"as much as we possibly can\".\n\nAcross the country, the highest rates of deaths have been in urban areas where lots of people live. The overall mortality rate in London has been almost double that of the next highest region.\n\nThe data also shows the Covid-19 mortality rate in the most deprived areas of England has been higher among men, with 76.7 deaths per 100,000 people, compared with 39.6 per 100,000 women.\n\n\"General mortality rates are normally higher in more deprived areas, but so far Covid-19 appears to be taking them higher still,\" said Nick Stripe, ONS head of health analysis.\n\nShadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said the report showed the virus thrived on inequality.\n\n\"Ministers must target health inequalities with an overarching strategy to tackle the wider social determinants of ill-health,\" he said.\n\nThe ONS used the Index of Multiple Deprivation, a relative measure of poverty last updated in 2019.\n\nThe index takes into account factors such as an area's income, employment, crime and health deprivation and disability.\n\nThe ONS studied the 20,283 deaths involving Covid-19 that took place between 1 March and 17 April. In England, it found the mortality rate in the most deprived areas was 55.1 deaths per 100,000 population, while the rate was 25.3 deaths per 100,000 in the least deprived areas.\n\nIn Wales, statisticians found the most deprived fifth of areas had a mortality rate of 44.6 deaths per 100,000 population, almost twice as high as the rate for the least deprived areas of 23.2 deaths per 100,000.\n\nIt also found:\n\nDavid Finch, a senior fellow at the Health Foundation, said people in deprived areas were at higher risk of exposure to Covid-19 because they were likely to live in cramped housing conditions.\n\nHe said those people were also more likely to have one or more long-term health condition, meaning they would be at greater risk of suffering severe symptoms from the virus if exposed.\n\nChief executive of children's charity Barnardo's Javed Khan said the ONS study was \"worrying\" but \"unfortunately not surprising\".\n\n\"Vulnerable children and families - and those already experiencing disadvantage - risk becoming the forgotten victims,\" he added.\n\n\"Without intervention, this crisis will be devastating for a whole generation - their mental health, safety, education and job prospects are on the line.\"\n\nIn a statement, the government said it had commissioned urgent work from Public Health England to understand the different factors that could influence the way someone was affected by the virus and would set out more details in due course.\n\n\"We are ensuring financial support for the poorest in society by increasing universal credit payments and speeding up the payment of statutory sick pay, as well as introducing the coronavirus job-retention scheme, the self-employment income support scheme, mortgage holidays and greater protection for renters.\"\n\nThe ONS analysis comes as a separate study from the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) says coronavirus patients from black African backgrounds in England and Wales are dying at more than triple the rate of white Britons.\n\nThe IFS said a higher proportion of people from ethnic minority backgrounds lived in areas hit harder by Covid-19.",

    "Coronavirus: How does contact tracing work and is my data safe? \" Heykayjones Blog": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "Millions of people in the UK will soon be asked to track their movements to limit the spread of coronavirus.\n\nThe government says hiring is well under way for a team of 18,000 to trace the contacts of those infected.\n\nCommunities Secretary Robert Jenrick says \"all of society\" will have to play their part in contact tracing, by downloading a nationwide app when it is released in a few weeks' time,\n\nSo how does contact tracing work, do you have to take part - and what happens to your data?\n\nContact tracing is a method used to slow down the spread of infectious outbreaks. It is commonly used in sexual health clinics, when infected patients are told to contact anyone with whom they have been intimate.\n\nIn the coronavirus pandemic, it means tracking down anyone sufferers have been in prolonged contact with, to potentially ask them to self-isolate.\n\nThis is often done through phone calls to the friends and family of coronavirus sufferers, complemented by an automated location-tracking mobile app.\n\nUnlike tracing in sexual health clinics, it can be difficult to know who you've come into close enough contact with to spread coronavirus. And scientists don't entirely agree what \"close contact\" is.\n\nThe World Health Organization recommends staying one metre apart, while the UK government recommends two.\n\nIts scientific advisers say two seconds spent one metre apart is as dangerous as spending one minute two metres apart.\n\nOnly distance will be captured by the app, so it will miss many of these key risk factors, like length of time spent in proximity with some and in what setting (inside or outside, well-ventilated or not).\n\nThese will have to be picked up in discussions with the \"army\" of contact tracers.\n\nContact tracing is already being used extensively by various countries, including Hong Kong, Singapore and Germany.\n\nThe UK is planning to roll out its contact tracing app and phone team by the middle of May.\n\nThe 18,000-strong team will feature about 3,000 civil servants and health workers, and 15,000 call handlers.\n\nThis telephone system will be used in tandem with a tracing app, available to download on smartphones.\n\nUsing Bluetooth, the free app tracks when its users come into contact with each other, automating the tracing process. If a user develops coronavirus symptoms, it is up to them to let the app inform the NHS.\n\nTheir disclosure may trigger an anonymous alert to users with whom they recently had significant contact, again potentially asking those people to go into quarantine or be tested.\n\nFor those without smartphones, an alternative could be a Bluetooth-enabled wristband, like those being used in other countries to detect lockdown breaches.\n\nContact tracing has been credited with helping to lift restrictions in other countries, when combined with other measures.\n\nSouth Korea never went into lockdown thanks to an early strategy of extensive tracing, combined with mass testing.\n\nThe nation not only asked citizens to recall their movements, it used credit card transactions, CCTV footage and mobile phone tracking to piece together where they had been. After a daily peak of 900 cases, it is now diagnosing just a handful of new daily cases.\n\nIf adopted widely enough, contact tracing might help ease UK restrictions, although it is unlikely citizens will be tracked to that extent.\n\nThe UK government first attempted contact tracing early on in the outbreak, before there were too many cases for it to be effective.\n\nHowever, less movement under lockdown means new outbreaks should now be easier to track.\n\nPhone tracing can be very labour intensive and time consuming, with tracers in Ireland reporting making about 40 phone calls per infected person.\n\nThe mobile app is easier, but take-up will have to be colossal for the virus to be totally supressed. Academics advising the NHS estimate 80% of smartphone users - 60% of the population - would have to actively use it.\n\nBy comparison, about 67% of UK smartphone users have downloaded messaging app WhatsApp.\n\nPeople would also have to be honest about displaying any potential symptoms and inform the NHS.\n\nNot everyone is happy with the government and third parties being given access to people's data. Civil rights group Liberty said the government must take the risks seriously, and should not make installing the app a condition to leaving the lockdown or returning to work.\n\n\"Millions of us are going to need to trust the app and follow the advice it provides,\" says NHSX, the digital development arm of the health service. It says the information gathered will only ever be used for health and research purposes, and that the app can be deleted at any time.\n\nThe UK app will use a centralised model, meaning the matching process will take place on a computer server.\n\nAn alternative, decentralised model was put forward by Apple and Google, where the exchange happens on people's handsets.\n\nThe tech giants say their version makes it harder for hackers or the authorities to use the computer server logs to track and identify specific individuals.\n\nBut NHSX says its centralised system will help give it more insight into how the disease spreads and help it to make the app more efficient.",

    "Coronavirus: How long does it take to recover? \" Heykayjones Blog": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson is about to return to work after recovering from Covid-19, but for many patients it could take a long time to get back to full health.\n\nRecovery time will depend on how sick you became in the first place. Some people will shrug off the illness fast, but for others it could leave lasting problems.\n\nAge, gender and other health issues all increase the risk of becoming more seriously ill from Covid-19.\n\nThe more invasive the treatment you receive, and the longer it is performed, the longer recovery is likely to take.\n\nMost people who get Covid-19 will develop only the main symptoms - a cough or fever. But they could experience body aches, fatigue, sore throat and headache.\n\nThe cough is initially dry, but some people will eventually start coughing up mucus containing dead lung cells killed by the virus.\n\nThese symptoms are treated with bed rest, plenty of fluids and pain relief such as paracetamol.\n\nPeople with mild symptoms should make a good and speedy recovery.\n\nThe fever should settle in less than a week, although the cough may linger. A World Health Organization (WHO) analysis of Chinese data says it takes two weeks on average to recover.\n\nThe disease can become much more serious for some. This tends to happen about seven to 10 days into the infection.\n\nThe transformation can be sudden. Breathing becomes difficult and the lungs get inflamed. This is because although the body's immune system is trying to fight back - it's actually overreacting and the body experiences collateral damage.\n\nSome people will need to be in hospital for oxygen therapy.\n\nGP Sarah Jarvis says: \"The shortness of breath may take some considerable time to improve... the body is getting over scarring and inflammation.\"\n\nShe says it could take two to eight weeks to recover, with tiredness lingering.\n\nThe WHO estimates one person in 20 will need intensive care treatment, which can include being sedated and put on a ventilator.\n\nIt will take time to recover from any spell in an intensive or critical care unit (ICU), no matter what the illness. Patients are moved to a regular ward before going home.\n\nDr Alison Pittard, Dean of the Faculty of Intensive Care Medicine, says it can take 12 to 18 months to get back to normal after any spell in critical care.\n\nSpending a long time in a hospital bed leads to muscle mass loss. Patients will be weak and muscle will take time to build up again. Some people will need physiotherapy to walk again.\n\nBecause of what the body goes through in ICU, there's also the possibility of delirium and psychological disorders.\n\n\"There does seem to be an added element with this disease - viral fatigue is definitely a huge factor,\" says Paul Twose, critical care physiotherapist at Cardiff and Vale University Health Board.\n\nThere have been reports from China and Italy of whole-body weakness, shortness of breath after any level of exertion, persistent coughing and irregular breathing. Plus needing a lot of sleep.\n\n\"We do know patients take a considerable period, potentially months, to recover.\"\n\nBut it is hard to generalise. Some people spend relatively short periods in critical care, while others are ventilated for weeks.\n\nWe don't know for sure as there is no long-term data, but we can look at other conditions.\n\nAcute respiratory distress syndrome (called Ards) develops in patients whose immune systems go into overdrive, causing damage to the lungs.\n\n\"There is really good data that, even five years down the line, people can have ongoing physical and psychological difficulties,\" says Mr Twose.\n\nDr James Gill, a GP and lecturer at Warwick Medical School, says people also need mental health support to improve recovery.\n\n\"You're finding breathing difficult, then the doctor says 'We need to put you on a ventilator. We need to put you to sleep. Do you want to say goodbye to your family?'.\n\n\"PTSD [post-traumatic stress disorder] in these most severe patients is not unsurprising. There will be significant psychological scars for many.\"\n\nThere remains the possibility that even some mild cases may leave patients with long-term health problems - such as fatigue.\n\nGetting an accurate figure is difficult.\n\nAs of 26 April, Johns Hopkins University reported about 820,000 people had recovered out of 2.9 million people who had been infected.\n\nBut countries use different recording methods. Some are not publishing recovery figures and many mild infections will be missed.\n\nMathematical models have estimated between 99-99.5% of people recover.\n\nThere has been much speculation, but little evidence, on how durable any immunity is. If patients have successfully fought off the virus, they must have built up an immune response.\n\nReports of patients being infected twice may just be down to tests incorrectly recording they were free of the virus.\n\nThe immunity question is vital for understanding whether people can be reinfected and how effective any vaccine may be.",

        "body": "People in England, Scotland and Northern Ireland are now being advised to wear face coverings while at the shops or on public transport to help limit the spread of coronavirus.\n\nWhile medical face masks and respirators are prioritised for health and care workers, you might want to try making your own face covering.\n\nHere's our guide to different types and step-by-step instructions on how to make them.\n\nWhether you're handy with a sewing machine, like cutting up old t-shirts or just want a quick fix, the principles are the same: the more layers of material the better, and the mask needs to fit snugly around the face, and you should be able to breathe comfortably.\n\nOne study has shown that the best materials to use are tightly woven cottons or twill, natural silk or quilted cotton material. But you can also make do with what you have around your home.\n\nLet's start with an easier one.\n\nThe government advises washing your hands or using hand sanitiser before putting on and after taking off face coverings.\n\nYou should also:\n\nOur next example uses an old t-shirt, preferably thick cotton or a cotton and polyester mix. And still nothing to sew.\n\nHomemade masks are not necessarily intended to help the wearer, the government says, but they could help stop you inadvertently passing on the disease to others if you have it but are not showing symptoms.\n\nIf you do have coronavirus symptoms - such as a high temperature or continuous cough, you should stay indoors and isolate at home.\n\nWhichever face covering you use, they are not a substitute for other lockdown rules. Hand hygiene especially is just as important as before - so washing your hands with soap for at least 20 seconds when you get home.\n\nOur third example needs a few stitches, but they can be as simple or as complicated as you like - as long as it all holds in place and survives a few washes.\n\nThere are plenty of other ways to make a face covering - and many examples on social media from professional, designer logo'd masks to cut up sports socks.\n\nHave fun giving them a go. Remember you might need more than one, so you have something to use while the other is being washed.\n\nFace coverings should not be used for children under the age of two years or people who might not be able to fit them correctly.\n\nUK government: How to make a face covering",

        "body": "An NHS app that aims to track the spread of coronavirus is being rolled out for the first time, as part of a trial on the Isle of Wight.\n\nCouncil and healthcare workers will be the first to try the contact-tracing app, with the rest of the island able to download it from Thursday.\n\nIf the trial is successful, it could be available nationwide within weeks.\n\nConcerns have been raised over privacy, though ministers say the app has been designed with this \"front of mind\".\n\nThe app aims to quickly trace recent contacts of anyone who tests positive for the virus.\n\nIt is part of the government's strategy for coming out of lockdown, which aims to have widespread testing and contact tracing in place to monitor and reduce any future outbreaks.\n\nIf the trial is successful, the app will be rolled out nationwide by the middle of May, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said.\n\nMeanwhile, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has called for a \"national consensus\" on tackling the virus when the UK begins to move out of lockdown.\n\nIt comes as the the number of coronavirus-related deaths in the UK reached 28,734, an increase of 288.\n\nThe daily increase in deaths is lower than at any point since the end of March, but the figures reported at the weekend tend to be lower and are expected to rise, Mr Hancock said.\n\nThe new app - published on Apple and Google's app stores - works by using a Bluetooth connection.\n\nIt records when two people who have the app are within a certain distance of each other for longer than a specified amount of time.\n\nIf one of those people later reports having symptoms, all the other app users they came into significant contact with over recent days will be alerted and, if judged necessary, told to self-isolate.\n\n\"The exact advice on what you should do will depend on the evolving context and approach,\" the NHS has said.\n\nRead more here.\n\nMr Hancock urged everyone on the Isle of Wight to download the app when it was available to them. Social distancing rules would still be in place during the trial, he said.\n\n\"By downloading the app, you are protecting your own health, you are protecting the health of your loved ones and the health of your community,\" he said.\n\n\"Where the Isle of Wight goes, Britain follows.\"\n\nThe island was chosen for the trial because it has a lower number of new infections, is covered by a single NHS trust and because travel to and from the island is quite restricted.\n\nMr Hancock told BBC Breakfast the app would be an \"incredibly important part\" of the fight against the virus and the more people who downloaded it, the more lockdown restrictions could be eased.\n\nSir Keir said he hoped the app would be successful but questioned whether take-up would be high enough.\n\n\"I am a bit concerned that a similar app in Singapore only had, I think, something like a 20% take-up rate in the public,\" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.\n\nThe Labour leader added that traditional methods of tracing, for example phoning people, would have to be used alongside the technology.\n\nThe \"centralised\" model of the app - meaning there is a central computer server which works out which phones have matched - has raised some privacy concerns.\n\nThis is different to the \"decentralised\" model used by Apple and Google, where the matches take place on users' handsets.\n\nSome have argued a \"centralised\" approach gives the app advantages, for example by making it easier to spot hotspots where the disease is spreading. But others say a central system increases the risk from potential hackers.\n\nLaw professor Orla Lynskey said the option on the app for users to opt in and share their location data \"poses a big risk\".\n\nBut NHSX - the part of the health service that developed the app - said the app will be voluntary, and the only personal data stored by the app at the start would be the first part of the user's postcode.\n\nAdditional location data will only be recorded if users agree to a further opt-in request, NHSX added.\n\nMr Hancock said the software was \"designed with privacy and security front of mind\". He said the data was stored on the phone and only sent to the NHS when someone needs a test.\n\nThe UK's \"test, track and trace\" strategy has seen testing be scaled up over the last month, following Mr Hancock's pledge to reach 100,000 tests by the end of April. The UK passed the target, providing more than 122,000 tests on the last day of April. Latest figures show there were 85,186 tests on Sunday.\n\nMeanwhile, the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), which has been advising the government on the pandemic, has published some of the evidence which informed its guidance .\n\nThe documents cover the group's meetings up to 14 April.\n\nAmong the papers published by Sage is one from a meeting on 2 April, which suggests lockdown restrictions should be eased \"very gradually\" to avoid measures needing to be reintroduced, which could undermine public trust.\n\nIn other developments:\n\nHow have you been affected by coronavirus?

        "body": "The military is to begin testing essential workers around the UK for coronavirus in mobile units which will operate in \"hard to reach\" areas.\n\nThe new pop-up facilities, which can be set up in 20 minutes, will travel to care homes, police and fire stations, prisons and benefits centres.\n\nIt comes as the government looks to reach its target of carrying out 100,000 tests per day by Thursday.\n\nMeanwhile, the PM will return to work in Downing Street on Monday morning.\n\nIt is just over two weeks since Boris Johnson was released from hospital, where he was treated in intensive care for coronavirus.\n\nOn Saturday, the number of people confirmed to have died with Covid-19 in hospitals in the UK passed 20,000, with another 813 deaths announced.\n\nLatest figures show that 28,760 coronavirus tests were conducted by 09:00 BST on 25 April - far short of the government's target of 100,000 by the end of April.\n\nSome health and care workers have previously reported having to make long journeys to their nearest drive-through testing centres.\n\nMany care homes have said none of their staff have been tested , while others have spoke of struggles to access official test centres after reporting online they have symptoms.\n\nOf 210 care providers contacted by the BBC earlier this week, 159 said none of their workers had been tested.\n\nThe new pop-up facilities will see swabs collected by \"specially trained\" military personnel and taken to one of three \"mega labs\" to be processed, with results expected within 48 hours.\n\nEight mobile units will test key workers on Sunday, in areas including Salisbury, Southport and Teesside.\n\nThe Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) said the units would travel to areas where there was \"significant demand\", and it plans to have 96 units up and running by the start of May.\n\nThe armed forces will staff 92 of the units, while civilian contractors will operate a further four located in Northern Ireland, the DHSC said.\n\nProf John Newton, who is co-ordinating coronavirus testing for the government, said these new mobile testing units would help achieve the goal of performing 100,000 tests a day by \"providing tests to vital frontline workers wherever they need them\".\n\nHe said efforts to increase capacity had resulted in \"scores of new testing facilities and Britain's largest network of diagnostic labs in history\".\n\nSince Friday, millions of key workers and people they live with have been able to book appointments online to be tested. Those too ill to travel should also be able to order home kits - although numbers are limited.\n\nSince the website opened, slots for these tests have been booked up within hours and applications have had to close because of high demand.\n\nThe tests offered are swab tests that determine whether people currently have the virus - rather than whether they have had it in the past.\n\nApplications to the UK government website was initially open only to people in England, but tests became available to people in Scotland on Saturday.\n\nBoris Johnson is set to take charge of the government's response to the outbreak when he returns to No 10 on Monday.\n\nHe has been recuperating from the virus at his country retreat, Chequers.\n\nMr Johnson prepared for his return with a three-hour summit meeting on Friday with Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab - who has been deputising for him - and Chancellor Rishi Sunak.\n\nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer has called on the PM to set out an \"exit strategy\" for lifting the lockdown.\n\nIn a letter to Mr Johnson, Sir Keir said the UK was in danger of falling behind other countries again - including the devolved administrations in Scotland and Wales - which were already engaged in \"adult\" conversations with their citizens as to how the restrictions could be eased.\n\n\"Simply acting as if this discussion is not happening is not credible, especially when other governments and our own devolved administrations have been able to communicate so much more,\" he wrote.\n\nAt the daily No 10 briefing on Saturday, Home Secretary Priti Patel said the government was working towards returning the UK to normal, but said it was still too soon to begin easing up.\n\n\"We know that people are frustrated but we are not out of danger yet,\" she said.\n\nNHS England medical director Prof Stephen Powis said the virus would start to \"spread more\" if social distancing measures were lifted.\n\nMeanwhile, the British Medical Association (BMA) has accused ministers of dragging their feet over calls for families of healthcare workers who lose their lives fighting coronavirus to be financially supported.\n\nThe doctors' trade union said it had written twice to the chancellor raising the issue, but had yet to receive a response.\n\nThe government said it was currently considering the financial support for the families of those on the front line.\n\nThe BMA has also called for all key workers to be provided with face masks to combat the spread of the virus.\n\nBMA chairman Dr Chaand Nagpaul told the Daily Telegraph that giving masks to \"transport workers, shopkeepers, carers or supermarket staff\" would offer \"a level of protection, however small\".\n\nHe added: \"The government must pursue all avenues of reducing the spread of infection. This includes asking the public to wear face coverings to cover mouths and noses when people leave home for essential reasons.\"\n\nHow have you been affected by coronavirus?

        "body": "Millions more people are to be eligible for coronavirus tests, according to government announcements on Tuesday.\n\nIn England, all care home residents and staff will be able to access tests from Wednesday, regardless of whether they have symptoms.\n\nPeople over 65 and those who must leave home to work, as well as those they live with, will be able to get tested if they have symptoms of Covid-19.\n\nScotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are expected to follow suit.\n\nIt comes after figures revealed a third of all coronavirus deaths in England and Wales are now happening in care homes.\n\nSpeaking at the daily coronavirus briefing, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said: \"From construction workers to emergency plumbers, from research scientists to those in manufacturing, the expansion of access to testing will protect the most vulnerable and help keep people safe.\"\n\nMr Hancock also announced that a small number of hospitals in England will begin testing all patients for coronavirus, regardless of if they are showing symptoms, as part of a pilot.\n\nThe government has pledged to carry out 100,000 tests a day by the end of April, but the latest figures showed just over 43,000 tests took place across the UK on Monday - less than half its goal.\n\nThe health secretary said daily testing capacity had increased to 73,400 and insisted the UK was \"on track\" to hit 100,000 tests a day by Thursday.\n\nThis represents a massive expansion of who is eligible for testing - and means we are now one step away from allowing everyone to access a test if they have symptoms.\n\nThat will be crucial when lockdown restrictions are eased as part of the \"test, track and trace\" strategy to keep coronavirus at bay.\n\nIt is being made possible by the roll-out of home-testing kits and mobile units staffed by the armed forces.\n\nThe problems experienced getting more people tested have - to some extent - been because the network of drive-through testing centres have not always been in convenient locations.\n\nThere is plenty of lab capacity to process the tests now the three mega labs are up-and-running in Milton Keynes, Glasgow and Cheshire.\n\nThe expansion has also allowed the government to do something that could prove crucial in tackling the epidemic in care homes - the testing of residents and staff without symptoms.\n\nA big concern is that the virus has been able to get a foothold in care homes via people transmitting it before they develop symptoms or if they are asymptomatic.\n\nBut promising something is one thing - delivering it is another.\n\nWhile the capacity looks like it will be there to test 100,000 a day by the end of the month, the numbers actually getting tested are currently less than half that.\n\nMeanwhile, in Scotland, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said all patients over 70 who are admitted to hospital for any reason will now be tested for Covid-19.\n\nIn Northern Ireland, testing has begun in some GP practices and will also be expanded in hospitals and care homes. Wales has adopted a needs-based approach to testing for NHS and \"critical\" non-NHS workers.\n\nOffice for National Statistics data showed there were 2,000 coronavirus care home deaths in England and Wales in the week ending 17 April, double the previous week.\n\nIt brings the total number of deaths in care homes linked to the virus since the start of the pandemic to 3,096.\n\nCoronavirus deaths in hospitals across the UK, have reached 21,678 - a rise of 586 from Monday.\n\nThe health secretary said from Wednesday the government will publish daily figures on deaths in care homes and the community.\n\nHe said the change aimed to \"bring as much transparency as possible\" to the figures and \"add to our understanding of how this virus is spreading day by day\".",

        "body": "Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus outbreak this Saturday morning. We'll have another update for you at 18:00 BST.\n\nAn Ebola drug has been authorised for emergency use by the US's Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treating people who are severely ill in hospital with coronavirus.\n\nA recent clinical trial found remdesivir helped shorten the recovery time for the seriously ill, but experts have warned the drug shouldn't be seen as a \"magic bullet\" for coronavirus.\n\nCommuters could be asked to take their temperature before leaving home as part of proposals to make public transport safer. It's one of a number of ideas being considered for when the coronavirus lockdown is eased.\n\nNext Thursday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson will unveil his \"road map\" on how to restart the economy, reopen schools and how people can travel to work.\n\nIt comes as Health Secretary Matt Hancock said on Friday the government had provided more than 122,000 coronavirus tests on Thursday, surpassing its target of 100,000 daily tests by the end of April.\n\nBut BBC health correspondent Nick Triggle says the biggest challenge is yet to come on testing.\n\nNHS England is urging parents not to miss appointments for their children during the coronavirus pandemic, saying it is still offering essential vaccinations.\n\nVisits to clinics and GP surgeries are allowed as long as none of the family is experiencing symptoms of Covid-19. Some surgeries are even offering a \"drive-through\" service to make the process as socially distant as possible.\n\nThe National Trust has warned it could lose up to \u00a3200m this year following the coronavirus outbreak - putting some of its key projects at risk. The conservation charity has been forced to close its properties, green spaces, car parks, cafes and shops to stem the spread of the virus.\n\nIts director Hilary McGrady said the sharp drop in the trust's revenues has already led to the pausing of key environmental programmes. She called on the government to offer the same financial support to nature, wildlife and environmental groups that it has to other businesses.\n\nNew photos have been released to mark Princess Charlotte's fifth birthday, showing her delivering care packages to those in need in Norfolk during the coronavirus crisis.\n\nThe princess joined her parents, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, and brothers Prince George and Prince Louis to make the deliveries, which included homemade pasta the family had made the day before.\n\nGet a longer coronavirus briefing from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning, by signing up here.",

There is no date for when it will be rolled out, but Health Secretary Matt Hancock said earlier this week the government was in \"the closing stages of commercial negotiations\".\n\nOn Wednesday, Superdrug became the latest business - and first high street retailer - to offer the antibody test. The kit costs \u00a369 and buyers need to take a blood sample at home, which is sent off to a lab for testing.\n\nSpeaking at the No 10 daily briefing on Wednesday, Prof Powis said: \"Public Health England have been evaluating the new antibody tests, the commercial tests that are becoming available.\"\n\nBut he added: \"I would caution against using any tests that might be made available without knowing quite how good those tests are... I would caution people against being tempted to have those tests.\"\n\nSetting out some of the uncertainties around the commercial tests, Prof Powis said: \"Once you have the virus, the body's immune system develops antibodies against it and it's those antibodies that are detected typically a number of weeks after you've had the virus.\n\n\"What we don't absolutely know at the moment is whether having antibodies and having the antibodies that are tested in those tests means that you won't get the virus again.\n\n\"So I wouldn't want people to think just because you test positive for the antibody that it necessarily means that you can do something different in terms of social distancing, in the way you behave.\n\n\"Because until we are absolutely sure about the relationship between the positive antibody test and immunity, I think we as scientists would say we need to tread cautiously going further forward.\"\n\nSuperdrug said it was \"confident\" in the accuracy and reliability of the test, which it said has a sensitivity of 97.5%. That means it will detect positive antibodies 97.5% of the time, so there is a chance a negative result may be wrong.\n\nThere is a variation in the accuracy of tests. A test developed by scientists in Scotland and Switzerland had a 99.8% accuracy rate for giving a positive result.\n\nDr Colin Butler, from the University of Lincoln, said the commercial tests \"should give a good indication\" of whether an individual has been infected with Covid-19.\n\nBut he added: \"Whilst this may be an indication of functional immunity, confirmation of this is awaited from large scale studies presently under way. Until it is, individuals should not assume they are fully immune to further infection.\"\n\nThe World Health Organization says there is no evidence people who have recovered from Covid-19 and have antibodies are protected from being infected again.\n\nThe new coronavirus, called Sars-CoV-2, has not been around long enough to know how long immunity lasts, but there are six other human coronaviruses that can give a clue.\n\nFour produce the symptoms of the common cold and immunity is short-lived. In two coronaviruses - the ones that cause Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (Sars) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (Mers) antibodies have been detected a few years later.",

That means it will detect positive antibodies 97.5% of the time, so there is a chance a negative result may be wrong.\n\nThere is a variation in the accuracy of tests. A test developed by scientists in Scotland and Switzerland had a 99.8% accuracy rate for giving a positive result.\n\nDr Colin Butler, from the University of Lincoln, said the commercial tests \"should give a good indication\" of whether an individual has been infected with Covid-19.\n\nBut he added: \"Whilst this may be an indication of functional immunity, confirmation of this is awaited from large scale studies presently under way. Until it is, individuals should not assume they are fully immune to further infection.\"\n\nThe World Health Organization says there is no evidence people who have recovered from Covid-19 and have antibodies are protected from being infected again.\n\nThe new coronavirus, called Sars-CoV-2, has not been around long enough to know how long immunity lasts, but there are six other human coronaviruses that can give a clue.\n\nFour produce the symptoms of the common cold and immunity is short-lived. In two coronaviruses - the ones that cause Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (Sars) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (Mers) antibodies have been detected a few years later.",

        "authors": [],
        "body": "Prime Minister Boris Johnson will chair a cabinet meeting later and then lead the daily coronavirus briefing for the first time since his return to work.\n\nNo 10 said the PM, whose fiancee gave birth on Wednesday, will update the UK on the \"fight against this disease and the steps we are taking to defeat it\".\n\nBut political editor Laura Kuenssberg said he was unlikely to give \"chapter and verse\" on lifting the restrictions.\n\nNo 10 also faces the deadline for its target of 100,000 daily virus tests.\n\nHealth Secretary Matt Hancock pledged to reach the goal by the end of April. The latest figures show it reached just over 52,000 coronavirus tests on Tuesday.\n\nA scientist advising the government on testing, Prof John Newton, said he is confident the target will be met, but warned there will be a lag in the data.\n\nThe government's chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, and chief medical officer, Prof Chris Whitty, will appear alongside the PM at Thursday's briefing.\n\nMr Johnson, who has just recovered from Covid-19, returned to work in Downing Street this week but missed Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday following the birth of his son with his fiancee Carrie Symonds.\n\nWhat's next? The prime minister will not give chapter and verse later today on exactly how and when the country's doors will re-open.\n\nBut after meeting his cabinet virtually, Boris Johnson will seek to explain to the public how and why, if not exactly when, they will make the decisions that are vital, not just to our health, but the country's suffering economy too.\n\nHe'll restate the hurdles that must be passed before any restrictions are lifted, including making sure the NHS can cope, with tests, and equipment, and a consistent fall in the death rate.\n\nCrucially he will emphasise the importance of the so-called \"R\" rate of infection - in other words, the extent to which people with the virus are passing it on.\n\nThat rate has come down significantly since the lockdown was imposed, slowing the spread of the disease. But Mr Johnson will outline how the \"R\" rate will be a crucial yardstick of whether to lift, or even reinstate, restrictions as the weeks go on.\n\nRead Laura's full blog here.\n\nIt comes as the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), which is working on a range of options for easing lockdown restrictions, prepares to meet later. The lockdown is due to be reviewed on 7 May.\n\nEarlier this week, Mr Johnson said the lockdown would not be relaxed too soon and details on any changes would be set out over the \"coming days\".\n\nAt Wednesday's press conference, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said he \"did not know\" whether the five tests for lifting lockdown had been met and warned that the country was at a \"delicate and dangerous moment in this challenge\".\n\nHe said that the UK was still \"coming through the peak\" of the virus and called for people to maintain social distancing measures \"until we are out of the woods\".\n\nThe total number of people who have died in the UK with coronavirus has now passed 26,000, as official figures include deaths in the community, such as in care homes, for the first time.\n\nA new method of counting includes retrospective deaths since the beginning of March.\n\nThe health secretary set out the government's daily testing target of 100,000 per day on 2 April, even though Mr Johnson initially identified the aim to carry out 250,000 tests a day.\n\nThe latest figures announced during Wednesday's briefing showed 52,429 people were tested for Covid-19 in the UK on Tuesday, despite Mr Hancock announcing a massive expansion of the groups eligible for testing earlier in the week.\n\nMinisters say that there is capacity for about 73,000 tests per day, and Downing Street has repeatedly said it is aiming to reach its target by Thursday.\n\nProf Newton, director of public health improvement for Public Health England (PHE), said on Wednesday that he was \"pretty confident we will hit that target.\"\n\nHe said there would be a lag due to receiving the data but it would be clear whether the government has reached the target by the end of the week.\n\nBut a report by NHS Providers, which represents hospitals and NHS trusts in England, dismissed the target as a \"red herring\".\n\nDescribing the target as \"arbitrary\", the report said it risked preventing the development of a \"proper, next stage testing strategy\", adding: \"It may be testing for testing's sake.\"\n\nChris Hopson, the chief executive of NHS Providers, said trust leaders needed \"clarity\" on the testing regime and how it will be developed.\n\nA spokesman for the Department of Health and Social Care said testing was \"absolutely critical\" and capacity at NHS and PHE laboratories had more than doubled within weeks.\n\nPeople over 65 and anyone who cannot work at home are also among millions able to apply for a coronavirus test if they have symptoms, under the government's expanded testing programme.\n\nThe expansion in eligibility beyond just essential workers and hospital patients means 25 million people can now book through the government's test-booking website.\n\nSome 14,700 home tests and 33,000 drive-through appointments were booked on Wednesday.",

        "body": "The Scottish government has recommended people cover their faces while in some enclosed public spaces, such as shops and public transport.\n\nFirst Minister Nicola Sturgeon said there could be \"some benefit\" in wearing a cloth face covering in places where safe social distancing was difficult.\n\nBut she said it was \"not a substitute\" for existing lockdown restrictions.\n\nThe government guidance is not mandatory and will not be enforced.\n\nMs Sturgeon stressed that the guidance related to cloth garments such as a scarf rather than \"medical grade facemasks\" like those used by health and care workers.\n\nThe first minister said evidence about the usefulness of face coverings was \"limited\", but that there may be \"some benefit in wearing a face covering if you enter an enclosed space where you will come into contract with multiple people and safe social distancing is difficult\".\n\nShe said: \"To be clear, the benefit comes mainly in cases where someone might have the virus but is not aware of that because they are not experiencing symptoms and thus not isolating completely.\n\n\"Wearing a face covering in those circumstances could reduce the risk of that person spreading the virus.\"\n\nMs Sturgeon said there was no evidence to suggest that wearing a face covering outdoors was of any benefit.\n\nThe first minister warned that she did not want people to \"think they are invincible\" while covering their face in enclosed spaces such as shops.\n\nShe said: \"It may do some good in limited circumstances, but it cannot and should not be seen as a substitute for the other rules and guidelines.\"\n\nThe Scottish government's national clinical director, Prof Jason Leitch, said earlier this month there was \"no evidence\" to support members of the public wearing protective face masks.\n\nThe government advice says face coverings should not be used by people with asthma or children under the age of two.\n\nIt adds: \"When applying or removing the covering, it is important that you wash your hands first and avoid touching your face.\n\n\"After each use, you must wash the face covering at 60 degrees centigrade, or dispose of it safely.\"\n\nThe guidance also says that it is \"not being made mandatory and will not be enforced at this stage\" due to the \"relatively weak\" evidence of the impact of face coverings on transmission of the virus.\n\nHowever, Ms Sturgeon said this would be kept under review as the government considers how to ease lockdown restrictions.\n\nOther countries have brought in different rules around the wearing of face masks.\n\nThey are to become compulsory on public transport in Germany, and in supermarkets and pharmacies in Austria.\n\nResidents in Lombardy in Italy must cover their nose and mouth when outside and the French government plans to give out masks to the general public.\n\nAir passengers in Canada must wear a non-medical mask or a face covering, and in the USA, people are advised to wear \"cloth face coverings\" in supermarkets and pharmacies.\n\nMs Sturgeon also announced that all over-70s in Scotland will now be tested for Covid-19 on admission to hospital. They will also be tested every four days throughout their stay.\n\nThe latest figures show that 10,721 people have tested positive for the virus in Scotland, of which 1,754 people are in hospital, and 126 are in intensive care - figures which Ms Sturgeon said \"continue to give us case for cautious optimism\".\n\nMs Sturgeon said a further 70 people who had tested positive for the virus have died, bringing the total under that measure to 1,332.\n\nWider statistics including deaths where Covid-19 was a suspected cause will be published on Wednesday.\n\nMs Sturgeon said: \"These numbers are not and never will be seen as just statistics - behind each and everyone of these numbers is a unique and irreplaceable individual whose loss is a source of grief for their friends and family.\"",

    "Coronavirus: Testing falls short of 100,000 daily target \" Heykayjones Blog": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "Testing for coronavirus fell sharply on Saturday, days after Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the government had met its daily target of 100,000 tests.\n\nIn the past 24 hours, ministers said just under 76,500 tests were carried out, a drop of more than a third on the 122,000 tests carried out on 30 April.\n\nNHS England medical director Prof Stephen Powis acknowledged that testing had taken a \"little bit of a dip\".\n\nOn Friday Mr Hancock described the 100,000 target as \"audacious\".\n\nThe health secretary set the goal on 2 April, when the UK was on 10,000 tests a day.\n\nAnnouncing the government's success, Mr Hancock suggested the 100,000 goal had a \"galvanising effect\", adding that the bolstered testing capacity would \"help us to unlock the lockdown\".\n\nHowever, the government came in for criticism for including 40,000 tests which were dispatched by post and may not have been taken.\n\nSince then, the number of tests has dropped by about 40,000, according to official statistics.\n\nAt the Downing Street briefing on Sunday, cabinet minister Michael Gove praised Mr Hancock's \"amazing achievement\" in reaching his target.\n\nMr Gove said the massive increase in tests had been an example of what \"the public sector and the private sector working together under a very strong political leadership can achieve\".\n\nHe said the dip in the number of tests was due to the fact that fewer people were at work over the weekend.\n\n\"Thanks to the hard work of so many across the NHS, Public Health England, our pharmaceutical sector and our universities, we have tested over 200,000 key workers and their families, allowing those who don't have the virus to go back to work and protecting those who do.\"\n\nAlso speaking at the briefing, Prof Powis said testing capacity \"had ramped up very quickly\".\n\n\"We are now at a very high level of testing, over 100,000 - a little bit of a dip in the weekend - but we anticipate that that testing capacity will continue to increase,\" he said.\n\nDr Elisabetta Groppelli, a lecturer in global health at St George's, University of London, said 76,500 was still a \"fantastic number\" and that the UK was \"becoming comparable\" to countries with similar population sizes.\n\n\"What is important is that the UK has steadily increased the number of tests that have been performed,\" she said.\n\nTesting was expanded in England last week to millions more people with symptoms including over-65s, those who have to leave home to work, and people living with someone in these groups.\n\nIn Scotland, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon announced earlier that testing would be expanded to over-65s with symptoms and also all those in care homes where there had been an outbreak.\n\nAnd on Friday, the Welsh government extended coronavirus testing to people in care homes even if they are not showing symptoms of the disease.\n\nThe UK government is hoping the enhanced testing regime, alongside contact tracing and continued social distancing, can stay on top of transmission rates and prevent a second wave of infection.\n\nA \"comprehensive\" road map on a gradual easing of lockdown measures is expected at the end of next week.\n\nA total of 28,446 people have now died with coronavirus across the UK.\n\nThat number includes deaths in hospitals, care homes and the community, but only for those who have tested positive for Covid-19.",

    "Coronavirus: The US resistance to a continued lockdown": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "In these times, the sight of a public gathering of hundreds of people mostly without face masks is alarming.\n\nBut that is what happened at a demonstration against the shutdown measures in Washington State.\n\n\"We believe that the state governor has gone beyond his constitutional authority in shutting down businesses and ordering people to stay at home,\" organiser Tyler Miller says from the grounds of the state capitol.\n\nIn mid-March, Washington Governor Jay Inslee announced an emergency proclamation mirroring many issued around the world; closing restaurants and bars and banning large gatherings.\n\nBut protesters say that was unconstitutional.\n\n\"The state constitution says that the right of the people to peaceably assemble shall never be abridged. We believe that the (emergency coronavirus) proclamations that the governor here ordered violate that,\" Mr Miller says.\n\nMr Miller said he was not protesting against the recommendations from the public health bodies and respected the need to 'flatten the curve'.\n\n\"I even self-quarantined for 14 days back at the very beginning of this myself, when I had an illness that mirrored some of the symptoms,\" he says.\n\n\"The fact I am protesting does not mean I think it is a good idea to have gatherings, I just believe that the government has no authority to prohibit them.\"\n\nThroughout the crisis, Mr Miller has also been able to continue his work as an engineering technician with the US Navy.\n\nHe says the thing that has angered him is what he feels is an un-American overreach of power by the Democratic governor.\n\nThe restrictions differ from state to state, and about 20 states have had protests against the measures. These demonstrations vary in size from a few dozen people to thousands.\n\nThey come as the US finds itself still very much in the grip of this crisis.\n\nThere has not yet been a sustained drop in the numbers of US deaths linked to Covid-19 and yet the clamour to lift restrictions is coming not just from those taking to the streets but from politicians too.\n\n\"The hysteria that surrounded the coronavirus from the beginning was disproportionate,\" says Rick Becker, of North Dakota.\n\n\"There was an overreaction by state governments with regard to mandatory shut downs, shelter in place, and so forth,\" he says.\n\nWhen it is put to the state representative that tens of thousands of people have died across the country and that it could have been many more if restrictions were not in place, he dismisses the notion.\n\n\"That is something that you're going to be able to say no matter what; that there may have been more deaths,\" says Mr Becker, who is also a qualified doctor.\n\n\"You're taking the 'if it saves just one life' argument, and I would say that if I would drive 20mph instead of 50mph, it's possible that I might not kill somebody, and you can look at all aspects of our lives that way. But our whole way of life in this country would collapse and we can't live life that way.\"\n\nIn neighbouring South Dakota, one of those who died with the coronavirus was Bob Glanzer, a state representative.\n\n\"He was a very caring, giving, listening type of individual and certainly faith was a big part of his life. He's going to be sorely missed in the legislature,\" says party colleague Jean Hunhoff.\n\nRepresentative Hunhoff describes how she and other legislative members lined the route of Mr Glanzer's funeral procession waving American and South Dakota flags.\n\nThere were social distancing measures in place for the commemorations, even though South Dakota is one of a handful of states where a state-wide stay at home order has never been imposed.\n\n\"I support the decisions of our governor. She laid out guidelines and then really left the decisions up to local communities,\" says Jean Hunhoff, who also has a public health background.\n\n\"I am a registered nurse and I believe it is data that should drive decision making and I think we have done that here. It is easy to stand on the outside and post judgment.\"\n\nThere has been criticism of states like South Dakota that have refused to issue state-wide shut down directives in spite of coronavirus outbreaks there.\n\nPolls show the majority of Americans are still in favour of measures imposed to try to curb the spread of the virus. And some are vehemently opposed to the protests.\n\nMary Turner, a nurse leader in an intensive care unit in Minnesota, describes them as a \"kick in the teeth\" because of the risks she and her colleagues are taking.\n\n\"These protests here are so discouraging. With no one doing social distancing or wearing masks, and they all say they are outraged. I don't know if this is a problem anywhere else in the world.\"\n\nBut the placards at the demonstrations decrying government interference suggest those involved feel there are bigger issues at stake than public health.\n\n\"Scepticism of the government is a deep strain in America. It waxes and wanes - though we're in a period where it's been waxing for quite a while,\" says Theda Skocpol, author and professor of government and sociology at Harvard University.\n\nWith regard to the anti-shutdown protests, Professor Skocpol says it is political beliefs and not economics that have definitely been the driving force.\n\nShe cautions against the notion that they are an organic reaction to the crisis, feeling instead that there is a level of national organisation.\n\n\"You don't see the US Chamber of Commerce in the vanguard here. These are ideological forces at play, with some professionally run conservative advocacy groups behind the protests,\" Professor Skocpol says.\n\n\"Their cause is to make sure Americans don't become too trusting of government. They don't worry whether the motives of the people on the ground are exactly the same as theirs. They're probably not. I think most of the people at the protests are just passionate Donald Trump supporters.\"\n\nWhile some at the protests say they are there because they are losing money during the shutdown, Trump 2020 flags, hats and shirts have been very evident, particularly at the large demonstrations in states run by Democratic governors. They have taken on the look of small Trump rallies.\n\nThe politicians most vocally calling for the shutdown to be lifted now, like Dr Rick Becker of North Dakota, are mainly Republicans. All of the governors who did not impose stay at home orders, like the governor of South Dakota, also belong to the president's party.\n\nWhile the GOP does have its libertarian streak, Professor Skocpol feels that there is more to it than that, and that many of the people and politicians protesting are taking their cues from the president.\n\n\"Donald Trump is really not all that secretive about what he's thinking, he sort of says it. I think that there's a lot of evidence that he's worried that this terrible pandemic and his handling of the early stages, combined with the economic impact, could sink his presidency,\" she says.\n\n\"You can't expect him, his party and those who support him to sit back and take that lightly, so what is plan B or C? It is to go from blaming Obama, the Chinese, the WHO, to now blaming those who are leaving restrictions in place.\"\n\nIndeed, over recent weeks, Donald Trump has openly supported the protesters.\n\nBut mixed messages from the White House have been a feature of this crisis. After signalling that he wanted some Democratic-run states \"liberated\" and opened up, the president then said he was \"unhappy\" when the Republican governor of Georgia made the decision to reopen the economy.\n\nWith many hundreds still dying of the virus here each day, state governors are in the tough position of trying to make the right decisions to keep people safe.\n\nBut it is the face of a deadly virus on the one hand and massive economic and political pressure on the other.",

    "Coronavirus: The lives lost in a single day": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "Each day brings confirmation of hundreds more coronavirus deaths in the UK, each one marking a devastating loss for a family or community somewhere in the country.\n\nThe UK announced its first coronavirus fatality in early March. By 12 April, which was Easter Sunday, there had been more than 10,000 confirmed hospital deaths. Less than two weeks later, that figure doubled again.\n\nThe scale of the pandemic means it's easy for the stories of many of the virus' victims not to be heard.\n\nOn 12 April alone, at least 1,174 people died in England and Wales. These are the stories of seven of those.\n\nRobert Savory, or Bob to all who knew him, would normally be organising Easter egg hunts or games like \"pin the carrot on the rabbit\". A doting grandad, Bob was rarely happier than when he was spending quality time with his family.\n\nIt was a family tradition for everyone to gather at Bob and his wife Jo's house in Gloucestershire at weekends and on special occasions.\n\nBut the house that would have been full with four children and seven grandchildren was quiet this year, as isolation measures prevented everyone getting together. By then, Bob had been admitted to hospital. He passed away that day.\n\nBob was best known locally for his involvement in rugby club Chosen Hill Former Pupils RFC.\n\nThe club said he was \"Chosen Hill through and through\", having held positions there from player to chairman.\n\nIt was in the changing rooms of the club that Bob's shoulder-length mousy brown hair was shaved off some 40 years ago. His shaved head became his trademark look and following his death, friends and family shaved their own heads to raise money for local hospitals in honour of the man they jokingly called Dr Bob.\n\nMore than 150 miles to the north-west in Cumbria, another sportsman and doting parent also died on Easter Sunday.\n\nBrian Arrowsmith spent his career in the lower reaches of the football league, but was a hero to the fans of his hometown club Barrow AFC.\n\nHe started out playing at right-back in the 1960s, but was a versatile defender and served as captain when the club won promotion from the old Fourth Division.\n\nNo-one made more appearances in the league for Barrow than Brian, and his impact was celebrated three years ago when the club named a stand after him.\n\nHe was particularly proud of playing for his local team. He was born and bred on Walney Island, a sliver of land on the southern tip of Barrow-in-Furness that he described as \"God's little acre\".\n\n\"He was well known in the town and Brian couldn't walk past anybody without stopping and chatting,\" Jean, his wife of 56 years, said.\n\nBrian remained faithful to the football team for his entire life, transitioning from the pitch to the stands.\n\nThe last match he would ever attend was in early March. Brian's beloved Barrow were defeated 0-2 by Notts County - their first home league loss since September. As usual Brian was offering his support at the sidelines, still hoping his club would win promotion.\n\nWeeks later the father-of-two contracted coronavirus and passed away in hospital, almost three months before his 80th birthday. Jean said he was at peace in his final moments.\n\n\"He would tell you if he was here that he had a great life.\"\n\nNot everyone who passed away on Easter Sunday died in a hospital.\n\nMary Andrew was one of at least 339 people in England and Wales to die in a care home that day. Those deaths were not included in the more than 10,000 announced by the government up to that point.\n\nMary had moved into a Derbyshire nursing home about seven months earlier, after a life defined by her independence.\n\nShe started a career as a dispensing chemist, but her life's passion was the card game bridge.\n\nMary set up her own bridge club in the 1960s and played tournaments, working her way up to the top of the standings to become a grandmaster, meaning she was one of the few people able to make a living from the game.\n\nHer son David, who jokingly refers to himself as a \"bridge orphan\", says the game was an obsession for Mary, who organised tournaments, clubs and holidays.\n\nAn intellectual and gregarious woman, she was drawn to bridge because it was mentally stimulating and an opportunity for her to socialise.\n\nIt also led to an unlikely encounter with a Hollywood heartthrob, when Mary played in a tournament with Lawrence of Arabia actor Omar Sharif at a London hotel in the 1960s.\n\nMary shared her love for the game with hundreds of others, teaching people to play even in her 80s.\n\nShe was also a \"scatterbrain\", says her son - she once took him and their family pet to the local shop and accidentally returned with only the dog.\n\nThe last time David saw his 92-year-old mother, he was informed that there was a suspected case of coronavirus at the care home, meaning visits would be forbidden and residents kept in their rooms.\n\nWithin weeks he got a call to say Mary had contracted coronavirus and that she would be put on an \"end of life pathway\".\n\nMary had held on to the ashes of her husband, who died in 2012, so that they could be interred together. In their 63 years together, the couple had rarely spent a night apart.\n\nCoronavirus has not only taken the lives of people in care homes like Mary, but also the people looking after them, like Rahima Sidhanee.\n\nCaring was in her nature. Her home was full of orchids that she bought cheaply when they were past their best and then nursed back to life. If you invited her round for dinner, she would almost certainly bring some of her own food.\n\nThe 69-year-old nurse was renowned among friends, family, neighbours and colleagues for her delicious and eclectic cooking. Her samosas stirred excitement at school fairs and efforts by family members to emulate her legendary roti always fell short.\n\nThe last dinner her son Abu shared with her was just before the lockdown. He and his wife urged Rahima, who suffered from respiratory problems, to retire or at least take a break from work until the situation improved.\n\nBut Rahima was a compassionate woman. She had been working at the Grennell Lodge nursing and care home in the town of Sutton for the past 20 years and was not prepared to give up when they needed her most.\n\nShe continued working, and contracted coronavirus three weeks later.\n\nRahima had what her son described as a basic upbringing on the Caribbean island of Trinidad, with no electricity, gas, or running water at home.\n\nShe moved to the UK in the 1960s as part of a drive for recruitment into the NHS, and worked as a nurse and midwife before moving into the care sector.\n\nHer family were Hindu, but Rahima converted to Islam when she married. Despite divorcing some 20 years ago, the mother-of-three remained committed to her Muslim faith for the rest of her life.\n\nDescribed by Abu as quiet and understated, Rahima had suffered from depression in recent years. This meant that she wasn't as socially active as she might once have been, but she always maintained a close relationship with her family, particularly through the regular meals they would share at each other's houses.\n\nAt this time in the Islamic calendar, Rahima and her loved ones would normally meet for iftar, the evening meal when Muslims break their fast during Ramadan.\n\nShe died 11 days before the Muslim holiday began. One family friend, for whom she made chilli sauce every year, said Ramadan would never be the same again.\n\nAbdul Karim Sheikh also emigrated to the UK in the 1960s.\n\nBorn in Jalalpur Jattan in Pakistan's Punjab province as the eldest of 10 children, Abdul was always driven by dreams of a better life.\n\nThat led him to the UK, where he settled in Newham, in east London. Abdul quickly became a central member of the community, dedicating his life to civic causes.\n\n\"It would literally not matter to him whether he was sleeping - you could knock on the door and he would wake up and answer the call. It didn't matter what time of day you came to our door,\" his son Saleem said.\n\n\"He always put himself second.\"\n\nIn one of his first acts in the community, Abdul helped found one of Newham's first mosques, serving the religious, social and cultural needs of the area's growing Muslim population.\n\nHe was particularly dedicated to promoting racial equality and dialogue between different faiths, in what is one of London's most racially and culturally diverse boroughs.\n\nWith a passion for debate and ideas for change, politics was a natural career choice for Abdul. He became a local councillor in 1990 and ceremonial mayor of Newham in 1998.\n\nHis work took the boy from Punjab to Buckingham Palace, when his service to the Muslim community recognised through the British Empire Medal.\n\nHis son Saleem said his achievements were a source of great personal pride to Abdul. \"Coming from humble backgrounds to [being a mayor] in the UK was amazing,\" he said.\n\nEven in his 80s, Abdul continued to work on the causes close to his heart. His sons say he remained healthy and independent, and had recently returned from a trip overseas.\n\nBut in April, Abdul developed a temperature and breathing difficulties. He was admitted to hospital and passed away within days.\n\nHis family have been inundated with calls and cards from those whose lives he touched.\n\n\"He was loved by everybody. He's being missed by everyone in the community,\" his son Naeem said.\n\nWhile coronavirus has disproportionately affected older people, young people are also among those dying.\n\nAt 37 years old, with a thriving business and children she adored, Salina Shaw had everything to look forward to.\n\nSalina strove to make the most of every moment, and employed her favourite phrase each day in urging loved ones to live their \"best life\".\n\nSalina was a \"vibrant character who stood out within a crowd\", her sister Simone said - someone who proved to others it was possible to be happy and successful as a single parent.\n\nShe ran a child-minding business in Southend-on-Sea, Essex, and had also set up an affordable holiday club, which she hoped would bring communities together and allow parents to continue work during the school holidays.\n\nTo Simone, she was a great listener who could always be relied upon to offer sound advice.\n\nHer biggest passion in life was her children. When the coronavirus outbreak hit the UK, she was heavily pregnant with her third daughter.\n\nShe was admitted to hospital on 1 April, with suspected Covid-19.\n\nOther than gestational diabetes - a condition that can occur during pregnancy but usually disappears after giving birth - Salina was a healthy young woman with no other health conditions.\n\nHer baby was delivered via Caesarean section on 4 April, but Salina passed away just over a week later.\n\nHer daughters are now being looked after by family. Simone said Salina would \"shine within her children forever\".\n\nIn the nearby Essex town of Romford, Keith Parker was also in hospital with coronavirus.\n\nWith several underlying health conditions, Keith, 53, was among those particularly vulnerable to the pandemic. But he had overcome so much that family members jokingly called him \"the cat with nine lives\".\n\nJoanna first met Keith at school, when she had a crush on his best friend. The pair lost touch before their paths crossed again as adults in 2001. They agreed to meet for a meal, and three years later they married on the hottest day of the year.\n\nIn recent years, Joanna had been his full-time carer.\n\nHe was known among family and friends for his sense of humour. At a cousin's wedding, he started a flour and squirty cream fight. An old home video shows him putting M&Ms in his nose and blowing them out.\n\nThe family loved going on holiday to Butlins, where Keith would be the first person to raise his hand to get up on stage.\n\nHe fell ill with coronavirus in the week leading up to Easter Sunday. Other members of the family had also been unwell, but with relatively mild symptoms.\n\nBy the Friday morning, Keith's condition had deteriorated - Joanna says his face had turned grey and his cheeks and nose purple from lack of oxygen.\n\nAfter he was taken to hospital, it quickly became clear that he would not survive.\n\nJoanna was allowed a short visit to say goodbye. Dressed in a gown, gloves and mask she struggled not to kiss or hug him. All she could do was hold his hand.\n\nWhen Joanna left the room, she stole a final look through a window into the room.\n\n\"I knew that was going to be the last time I was going to see him,\" she recalled. \"That would be it.\"\n\nThe family are now grappling with the reality of life without him.\n\nHis infant granddaughter knew him as Grandad Munchkin. Every night she waves at a picture of him and blows a kiss.",

        "body": "People living thousands of miles apart with nothing in common are today united in their struggle against coronavirus.\n\nMore than three million people around the world have tested positive for the virus since it first emerged in China late last year. Close to 230,000 have died.\n\nThere are only a handful of countries that haven't been touched by the pandemic.\n\nOn Thursday, we told you about the lives of seven people in the UK who died on 12 April, the day the country officially surpassed 10,000 hospital deaths.\n\nThese are the stories of four other deaths on three continents that also happened that day.\n\nMaria Pollidori was admitted to hospital in central Italy in late February for a stomach cancer operation. Everything seemed to have gone smoothly, and her family looked forward to her return.\n\nBut on 9 April they received a call from the hospital saying the 84 year old had tested positive for coronavirus.\n\nItaly is at the epicentre of the global pandemic, recording more coronavirus-related deaths than any other country in the world. The central region of Marche, where Maria and her family live, has recorded thousands of cases.\n\nBut Maria's family had no idea that she had been showing any symptoms.\n\nThree days after they received the call from the hospital, she passed away.\n\nHer son Pierluigi said the hardest thing was not being able to be close to her \"at the time she needed us most\".\n\nMaria's death was not only felt by her family. As a nurse and midwife of 25 years she was well known in and around the small seaside town of Porto Potenza.\n\nBut because of the pandemic, no-one was able to pay their respects to her at a funeral.\n\nIt is a story that echoes throughout the country.\n\nThousands of miles away in the US state of Texas, Phillip Tsai-Brooks and his husband Anthony were both in hospital with Covid-19 on 12 April.\n\nIt was love at first sight when the pair were introduced through mutual friends.\n\nThey married in 2014 on a cruise ship in San Francisco Bay, and brought Phillip's widowed mother on their honeymoon to Puerto Rico - as they often did on their much-loved international travels.\n\nIn a statement to the BBC, Phillip's brothers said Phillip and Anthony were able to break barriers, and were accepted as a couple in the city of San Antonio, where they were known for the joy they brought to people's lives.\n\nPhillip, one of five brothers, had always dreamed of being a hair stylist and one day opening his own salon. His ambitions were realised when he opened the Extreme Opulence Hair Studio. More recently, he had been teaching others in the profession.\n\nOnly child Anthony, known as Tony, spent several years in the US Air Force before working for his local council, helping with budget planning for the city of Live Oak.\n\nA colleague said he was \"smarter about city budgets than most people\", and described him as \"one of the nicest guys you'll ever meet\".\n\nThe charismatic military veteran would regularly bring sweets into work for the local mayor, dropping them in a jar on her desk, he said.\n\nRelatives and friends of the men described them as the perfect couple. They dreamed of one day adopting their own children.\n\nBut their lives and dreams were tragically interrupted by the outbreak of coronavirus.\n\nIn a Facebook post in late March, 42-year-old Phillip said he was feeling unwell and had been told to quarantine as a precaution.\n\nSix days later, he said he was in hospital with confirmed coronavirus.\n\n\"Be here for a couple of days... then quarantine,\" he wrote.\n\nAnthony, 52, was taken to a different hospital, suffering similar symptoms.\n\nIn what Phillip's brothers described as the final chapter of their love story, Tony was moved from another healthcare system into the same hospital as Phillip. As their conditions deteriorated, they lay in rooms next to each other.\n\nPhillip passed away on 12 April after suffering a heart attack as a complication of Covid-19. Just two days later, Anthony died.\n\n\"Such a tragic loss but their love will last forever,\" Phillip's brothers said.\n\nElsewhere in North America, Victor Batista Falla had recently returned to Cuba, the country of his birth, for the first time in 60 years.\n\nThe 87 year old was born into one of the wealthiest families in the country, with his father's side founding a bank and his mother descending from rich sugar planters.\n\nHe fled the country in 1960, after Fidel Castro and his revolutionary forces ousted President Fulgencio Batista.\n\nVictor then became a prominent figure of Cuban exile literature, founding the journals Exilio and Escandalar in New York.\n\nAfter moving to Madrid, he opened the publishing house Colibr\u00ed, through which he published numerous essays about Cuba.\n\nFrance-based Cuban writer William Navarrete met Victor in the Spanish capital in 1996 at a cafe popular with Cuban exiles. After their first meeting, the pair saw each other whenever William was in Madrid.\n\nWilliam described Victor as a man who hated confrontation and gossip, and who was protective of his privacy.\n\n\"He was a bon vivant, but very measured,\" William said of his friend.\n\n\"He never ostentatiously displayed relationships and never boasted about the things he did.\"\n\nVictor's high-profile relationships extended far beyond Cuba. He was the uncle of the Grand Duchess of Luxembourg and a statement from the duke and duchess said his death was a \"great loss\" for the family.\n\nWilliam said Victor never spoke of his connection to the royals and did not like to talk about his family's vast wealth.\n\n\"Once I asked him if he was nostalgic for the lavish life he had had in Cuba until the age of 27,\" William recalled. \"He replied that he was nostalgic for the things he wanted to do and that he had not done.\"\n\nAfter 60 years away from the country, Victor quietly returned to Cuba in February. It's not clear what led him to return.\n\nWilliam did not know anything of the trip until he read a newspaper article telling him that his friend had died there of Covid-19.\n\nIn the early hours of 3 December, 1984, a valve broke in a storage tank inside a chemical factory in the central Indian city of Bhopal.\n\nSoon after, a deadly cloud of gas escaped from the factory into the surrounding neighbourhoods. It became one of the deadliest industrial disasters in modern history. Thousands of people died, and tens of thousands more needed treatment.\n\nAmong them was Imran Khan, who was just a young boy when the disaster happened. Two years ago, he developed mouth cancer, believed to be a result of the leak, and had to give up work.\n\nAfter surviving his initial cancer, it returned again, and he was forced to undergo more chemotherapy.\n\nHis condition deteriorated in recent weeks and he died on 12 April. Later tests confirmed that he had contracted coronavirus.\n\nA group representing survivors of the gas tragedy have accused the local government of turning their backs on people like Imran.\n\nThey say five gas leak survivors died of coronavirus within days of each other.\n\nA hospital set up for gas victims was converted into a facility for coronavirus patients. The Bhopal Group for Information and Action says gas victims were then ignored, despite being particularly vulnerable to the virus because of their health conditions.\n\nImran's older brother Rashid Khan is now looking after his wife and son.\n\n\"The wellbeing of his entire family is on my shoulders,\" he told BBC Hindi.",

        "body": "A UK trial to see whether specialist medical sniffer dogs can detect coronavirus in humans is set to begin.\n\nThe dogs are already trained to detect odours of certain cancers, malaria and Parkinson's disease by the charity Medical Detection Dogs.\n\nThe first phase of the trial will be led by the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, along with the charity and Durham University.\n\nIt has been backed with \u00a3500,000 of government funding.\n\nInnovation minister Lord Bethell said he hoped the dogs could provide \"speedy results\" as part of the government's wider testing strategy.\n\nThe trial will explore whether the \"Covid dogs\" - made up of Labradors and cocker spaniels - can spot the virus in humans from odour samples before symptoms appear.\n\nIt will establish whether so-called bio-detection dogs, which could each screen up to 250 people per hour, could be used as a new early warning measure to detect Covid-19 in the future.\n\nThe first phase will involve NHS staff in London hospitals collecting odour samples from those infected with coronavirus and those who are uninfected.\n\nSamples of breath and body odour could come from a number of sources, including used face masks.\n\nSix dogs - Norman, Digby, Storm, Star, Jasper and Asher - will then go through training to identify the virus from the samples.\n\nThe charity said the training could take as little as six to eight weeks.\n\nAfter an initial trial phase of three months, the government will decide where it believes the dogs will be most useful.\n\nOne possibility is that they could be used at points of entry into the country, such as airports, to detect potential carriers of the virus. The dogs could also be used at testing centres, as another form of screening alongside swab tests.\n\nMore than 10 years of research gathered by Medical Detection Dogs has shown the dogs can be trained to sniff out the odour of disease at the equivalent dilution of one teaspoon of sugar in two Olympic-sized swimming pools of water.\n\nDr Claire Guest, the charity's co-founder and chief executive, said she was \"sure our dogs will be able to find the odour of Covid-19\".\n\nIf that proves to be the case, the dogs will then move into a \"second phase to test them in live situations, following which we hope to work with other agencies to train more dogs for deployment\", she said.\n\nDogs have previously been trained to detect malaria from \"foot odour samples\" - in this case, nylon socks worn by apparently healthy children in the Gambia.\n\nProf James Logan, from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said: \"Our previous work has shown that malaria has a distinctive odour, and with medical detection dogs, we successfully trained dogs to accurately detect malaria.\n\n\"This, combined with the knowledge that respiratory disease can change body odour, makes us hopeful that the dogs can also detect Covid-19.\"\n\nThe researchers have also successfully trained dogs to detect cancer and Parkinson's disease in humans.",

    "Coronavirus: UK death toll passes Italy to be highest in Europe": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "The UK now has the highest number of coronavirus deaths in Europe, according to the latest government figures.\n\nThere have been 29,427 deaths recorded across the UK - a figure Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said was \"a massive tragedy\".\n\nThe latest total for Italy, previously the highest in Europe, now stands at 29,315.\n\nBut experts say it could be months before full global comparisons can be made.\n\nBoth Italy and the UK record the deaths of people who have tested positive for coronavirus.\n\nBBC head of statistics Robert Cuffe said Britain reached this figure faster in its epidemic than Italy.\n\nBut he said there are caveats in making such a comparison, including the UK population being about 10% larger than Italy's.\n\nEach country also has different testing regimes, with Italy conducting more tests than the UK to date.\n\nSpeaking at the daily coronavirus briefing, Mr Raab said the 29,427 lives lost was \"a massive tragedy\" the country has \"never seen before... on this scale, in this way\".\n\nBut he would not be drawn on international comparisons, saying: \"I don't think we will get a real verdict on how well countries have done until the pandemic is over, and particularly until we get comprehensive international data on all-cause mortality.\"\n\nProf Sir David Spiegelhalter, of the University of Cambridge, said we can be \"certain\" that all reported figures are \"substantial underestimates\" of the true number who have died with the virus.\n\nHe said: \"We can safely say that none of these countries are doing well, but this is not Eurovision and it is pointless to try and rank them.\"\n\nHe added the \"only sensible comparison is by looking at excess all-cause mortality, adjusted for the age distribution of the country\" [but] \"even then it will be very difficult to ascribe the reasons for any differences.\"\n\nThis is a sobering moment. Italy was the first part of Europe to see cases rise rapidly, and the scenes of hospitals being overwhelmed were met with shock and disbelief.\n\nBut we should be careful how we interpret the figures.\n\nOn the face of it, both countries now count deaths in a similar way, including both in hospitals and the community.\n\nBut there are other factors to consider.\n\nFirst, the UK has a slightly larger population. If you count cases per head of population, Italy still comes out worse - although only just.\n\nCases are confirmed by tests - and the amount of testing carried out varies.\n\nThe geographical spread looks quite different too - half of the deaths in Italy have happened in Lombardy.\n\nIn the UK, by comparison, they have been much more spread out. Less than a fifth have happened in London, which has a similar population to Lombardy.\n\nThen, how do you factor in the indirect impact from things such as people not getting care for other conditions?\n\nThe fairest way to judge the impact in terms of fatalities is to look at excess mortality - the numbers dying above what would normally happen.\n\nYou need to do this over time. It will be months, perhaps even years, before we can really say who has the highest death toll.\n\nMeanwhile, the personal stories of those who have died are still emerging. They include three members of the same family who died within weeks of each other after contracting the virus.\n\nKeith Dunnington, 54, a nurse for more than 30 years, died at his parents home in South Shields on 19 April. His mother Lillian, 81, died on 1 May and her husband Maurice, 85, died days later.\n\nMeanwhile, Momudou Dibba, a house-keeper at Watford Hospital who went \"above and beyond\" in his job, died with the virus on 29 April .\n\nIn a statement, West Hertfordshire NHS Trust said Mr Dibba, known as Mo, was \"kind, caring and considerate\".\n\nMeanwhile, 14 people from the same care home in Northern Ireland have died from Covid-19 related symptoms.\n\nThere have now been 1,383,842 tests for coronavirus across the UK, including 84,806 tests yesterday, Mr Raab told the No 10 briefing.\n\nFor the third day in a row, the government has failed to hit its target of 100,000 daily tests.\n\nHealth Secretary Matt Hancock set the target at the beginning of April and the government announced on Friday and Saturday that it had hit the 100,000-plus mark.\n\nSeparately, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) published data on Tuesday showing that by 24 April there were 27,300 deaths where coronavirus was mentioned on the death certificate.\n\nIncluding deaths reported to the ONS since 24 April, it brings the total number to more than 32,000.\n\nThese figures can also include cases where a doctor suspects the individual was infected, but a test was not carried out - whereas the daily government figures rely on confirmed cases.",

    "Coronavirus: UK deaths pass 26,000 as figures include care home cases \" Heykayjones Blog": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "The number of people who have died with coronavirus in the UK has passed 26,000, as official figures include deaths in the community, such as in care homes, for the first time.\n\nThe foreign secretary said this did not represent \"a sudden surge\", as the figure includes deaths since 2 March.\n\nDominic Raab also warned the UK was at a \"dangerous moment\", saying that the peak of the virus had not passed.\n\nThe total only includes people who died after testing positive for coronavirus.\n\nMeanwhile, figures show 52,429 coronavirus tests were carried out on Tuesday, still short of the government's target of 100,000 tests per day by Thursday.\n\nThe total number of coronavirus deaths in the UK is 26,097, Public Health England said, including an additional 3,811 deaths in England since the start of the outbreak.\n\nOf these, around 70% were outside hospital settings and around 30% were in hospital.\n\nThere were 765 deaths reported in the 24 hours to 17:00 BST on Tuesday.\n\nThe shadow minister for social care, Liz Kendall, said Wednesday's figures \"show that further action is urgently required to reduce the spread of the virus and keep care users and staff safe\".\n\nAt the Downing Street briefing, the BBC's health editor Hugh Pym asked why testing in care homes had not started sooner.\n\nMr Raab said such a move would have required \"enormous testing capacity\".\n\nHe said that the government had expanded eligibility to include \"anyone in a care home whether resident or staff\", but admitted there had been \"a distribution issue\".\n\n\"There is no sugar coating the challenge we have had with that,\" he said.\n\nHowever, Mr Raab said the government was now doing \"everything that we possibly can\" to improve supply and delivery.\n\nCare home residents and staff, people over 65 and anyone who cannot work at home are now among millions able to apply for a coronavirus test if they have symptoms, under the government's expanded testing programme.\n\nThe expansion in eligibility beyond just essential workers and hospital patients means 25 million people can now book through the government's test-booking website.\n\nSome 14,700 home tests and 33,000 drive-through appointments were booked on Wednesday.\n\nAsked whether deaths might have been avoided with better testing in care homes, Mr Raab said there was \"always learning in an unprecedented crisis like this\".\n\n\"The key thing above all is to manage the ebb and flow of people into those care homes that might carry the virus,\" he said.\n\nPHE's medical director, Prof Yvonne Doyle, said there had always been intervention where there have been outbreaks in care homes.\n\nShe said officials had \"learned a lot about how the virus is behaving in different populations\", including how coronavirus affects people over 75.\n\n\"One of the reasons that the deaths are high there is that they demise quite quickly if they get the dose of this virus,\" Prof Doyle said.\n\nShe explained that it may not have been possible for them to get to the test by the time the event happened.\n\nProf Doyle added: \"Whether testing would have made a huge difference or not is impossible to say at the moment, and that's one thing we want to learn.\n\n\"I think there are possibly more fundamental and structural issues about how care homes are run in an epidemic.\"\n\nOn lifting the lockdown, the foreign secretary said he \"did not know\" whether the five tests for easing restrictions had been met because the government was waiting for update advice from the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) in early May.\n\nHe said \"until we are out of the woods\" the public should continue to follow social distancing guidelines.\n\nAlso at the briefing, Prof Jonathan Van Tam, the deputy chief medical officer for England, warned the virus would return if lockdown measures are not eased very carefully and said it was \"premature\" to discuss school returns.\n\nHe said it was \"clear\" that outdoor spaces with higher degrees of ventilation were less problematic environments for transmission than indoors, but he called for \"careful\" thinking when asked about a possible return of outdoor activities such as beach trips, drinking in pub beer gardens or the opening of garden centres.\n\n\"We have to be extremely sure-footed and extremely painstaking about this,\" he said. \"This is with us for quite some time, potentially for as long as until we get a vaccine.\"\n\nProf Doyle said Sage had been looking at measures ports could implement to prevent people arriving from overseas spreading coronavirus, including a compulsory 14-day quarantine for travellers arriving in the UK.\n\nThe range of different bodies reporting death figures can make interpreting the data extremely confusing.\n\nThese updated daily figures do not provide a comprehensive picture of what has happened so far because of the lack of testing in the community in the early days. Therefore, it means the figures are an underestimate of what has been happening.\n\nBut as more testing is rolled out, the daily figures from now on will provide a more accurate picture of what is happening than has been the case so far.\n\nA better guide to the impact so far in care homes comes from figures published by the Office for National Statistics in England and Wales and its counterparts in Northern Ireland and Scotland.\n\nThat data shows to the middle of April - there is a lag in reporting because it relies on death certificates rather than positive tests - there had been over 3,700 deaths in care homes across the UK.\n\nGiven the number is rising, you could expect by now there will have been over 6,000 deaths in care homes - with half of coronavirus deaths probably now happening in care homes, as the number of new hospital deaths are coming down.\n\nThere are essentially two separate epidemics - one in care homes that is raging and one in the general population, who end up in hospital when severely ill, which is coming under control.\n\nWhere does that leave us in comparison with other countries? It is really hard to tell at this stage given the different ways information is collected and the fact other countries are at different stages of the pandemic.\n\nBut it seems reasonable to suggest the impact in the UK is pretty similar to that in Italy, France and Spain.\n\nPHE said it has developed a new method of reporting daily Covid-19 deaths in England, to give a more complete number of those who have died from the virus.\n\nThe figures announced on Wednesday have been retrospectively revised by PHE since the first coronavirus death on 2 March to include additional data on deaths in the community.\n\nFrom the start of the pandemic, the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) has reported a daily figure of Covid-19 deaths in hospitals in England, with deaths in other settings included from Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.\n\nProf Doyle said tracking the daily death count was vital to help understand the impact of coronavirus but acknowledged data from the Office for National Statistics includes suspected cases where a test has not taken place and would continue to include more deaths than the government figures.",

        "body": "Up to 100 children in the UK have been affected by a rare inflammatory disease linked to coronavirus, medics say.\n\nSome needed intensive care while others recovered quickly - but cases are extremely rare.\n\nIn April, NHS doctors were told to look out for a rare but dangerous reaction in children.\n\nThis was prompted by eight children becoming ill in London, including a 14-year-old who died.\n\nDoctors said all eight children had similar symptoms when they were admitted to Evelina London Children's Hospital, including a high fever, rash, red eyes, swelling and general pain.\n\nMost of the children had no major lung or breathing problems, although seven were put on a ventilator to help improve heart and circulation issues.\n\nDoctors are describing it as a \"new phenomenon\" similar to Kawasaki disease shock syndrome - a rare condition that mainly affects children under the age of five. Symptoms include a rash, swollen glands in the neck and dry and cracked lips.\n\nBut this new syndrome is also affecting older children up to the age of 16, with a minority experiencing serious complications.\n\nDr Liz Whittaker, clinical lecturer in paediatric infectious diseases and immunology, at Imperial College London, said the fact that the syndrome was occurring in the middle of a pandemic, suggests the two are linked.\n\n\"You've got the Covid-19 peak, and then three or four weeks later we're seeing a peak in this new phenomenon which makes us think that it's a post-infectious phenomenon,\" she said.\n\nThis means it is likely to be something related to the build up of antibodies after infection.\n\nProf Russell Viner, president of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, said the majority of children who have had the condition have responded to treatment and are getting better and starting to go home.\n\nThe syndrome is \"exceptionally rare\", he said.\n\n\"This shouldn't stop parents letting their children exit lockdown,\" Prof Viner added.\n\nHe said understanding more about the inflammatory disease \"might explain why some children become very ill with Covid-19, while the majority are unaffected or asymptomatic\".\n\nChildren are thought to make up just 1-2% of all cases of coronavirus infection, accounting for less than 500 admissions to hospital.\n\nMichael Levin, professor of paediatrics and international child health at Imperial, explained that most of the children tested negative for coronavirus, but tested positive for detection of antibodies.\n\n\"So we really think that the biology of the disease, somehow involves an unusual immune response to the virus,\" he said.\n\nHowever Prof Levin said there was \"a vast amount to learn\" about the reaction, which had only been known about for two to three weeks.\n\nChildren appear to be affected up to six weeks after they have been infected with the virus, which could explain the appearance of the new syndrome several weeks after the peak of UK cases.\n\nThere have been similar cases in the US, Spain, Italy, France and the Netherlands.\n\nChild health experts in the UK say it may not be something which just affects children.\n\nThey are now working with researchers in the US and across Europe to find out more about what they have called paediatric inflammatory multisystem syndrome or (PIMS-TS).\n\nAt least 15 US states are also looking into the rare condition, according to New York governor Andrew Cuomo.\n\nOut of 82 diagnosed cases of the inflammatory syndrome in New York, 53 children tested positive or had antibodies for Covid-19.\n\nCalifornia, New Jersey, Connecticut and Massachusetts are among the other states with cases of the syndrome.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control (CDC) in the US is set to issue an alert and updated definition of the syndrome to healthcare providers this week.",

    "Coronavirus: What's the risk on public transport?": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "Since the UK went into lockdown, there have been reduced services on trains, buses and planes, and the government has advised against all but essential travel.\n\nNow, with restrictions being eased in England, more people are being encouraged back to work.\n\nThe government says they should avoid public transport and walk, cycle or drive instead.\n\nBut if they can't, what are the risks of taking the bus or train?\n\nA lot of the potential risk of infection on trains and buses depends on how crowded they are, and so how far away you can keep from other people. This applies both on the vehicles and at stops and stations, and will vary in different parts of the country and on different routes.\n\nVentilation also plays an important role as fresh air can help droplets containing the virus dissipate faster, so being able to open a window can be an advantage.\n\nCoronavirus spreads when an infected person coughs, sneezes or exhales small droplets packed with the virus into the air.\n\nThese droplets can enter the body through the eyes, nose and mouth, either directly or after touching a contaminated object.\n\nThe government's consistent message has been to stay 2m (more than 6ft) apart from people outside your household.\n\nPrevious research has suggested a link between commuting on the London Underground and the likelihood of catching respiratory illnesses.\n\nDr Lara Gosce, at the Institute of Global Health, says her research (published in 2018) showed people who used the Underground regularly were more likely to suffer flu-like symptoms.\n\n\"Particularly, it shows that boroughs served by fewer lines - where inhabitants are forced to change line one or more times when travelling on the Underground - have higher rates of influenza-like diseases, compared to well-served boroughs where passengers reach their destination by one direct trip,\" she said.\n\nIf you're travelling on a relatively empty train or bus, though, your risks would be different. How long you spend on transport will also play a role - spending more time in contact, and coming into contact with more people will increase your risk.\n\nSo, \"limiting the number of close contacts with potentially infected individuals and objects is important,\" according to Dr Gosce.\n\n\"In terms of travel, avoid peak hours if possible,\" she says, suggesting, where viable, passengers should choose routes involving only one means of transport.\n\nThe government says people should \"consider all other forms of transport before using public transport\". If they can't walk, cycle or drive to their destination, they are advised to:\n\nThe government acknowledges that there may be situations where people can't keep 2m away from each other, such as at busy times or getting on or off public transport. In these cases, the advice is to avoid physical contact and face away from others.\n\nGovernments in England, Scotland and Northern Ireland have also recommended people wear face coverings on public transport.\n\nThe Welsh government has said people can choose to wear them, but adds the evidence is \"not strong enough\" to make them mandatory.\n\nFace coverings can help reduce the risk of transmission in some circumstances. In particular, they are to stop the wearer passing on coronavirus, rather than protecting them from others.\n\nTransport networks around the country are enhancing their safety measures to protect staff and passengers.\n\nArriva Buses is only accepting contactless payment and will no longer give change for cash payments.\n\nTransport for London is installing hand sanitisers at all tube, rail and bus stations and has introduced a rigorous cleaning schedule.\n\nIt says it will only be able to carry 13-15% of its normal number of passengers on the Underground and buses.\n\nOn Wednesday morning, national rail reported a 10% rise in passengers compared with the same time last week.\n\nLondon's Tube saw a 7.3% rise, with 83,293 journeys by 10am. But this was a fraction of normal passenger volume, which saw 1.2m journeys by 10am on the same day last year.\n\nPeople in England who are allowed to return to work have been asked not to use public transport if possible.\n\nPeople in Wales have been told to avoid it where possible.",

    "Coronavirus: Why are they isolating in Antarctica?": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "It's cut off from the rest of the world for months at a time - and there's not been a single case of coronavirus. So why are the research teams at Antarctica following isolation rules to combat the virus when it's probably not even on the continent?\n\n\"A case of Covid-19 here could be disastrous. So we are taking lockdown measures, too. It feels like we are isolated within the isolation. Prevention is much better than the cure,\"\n\nThat's Pradeep Tomar - a medical doctor on a research mission to India's Bharati base, in Antarctica.\n\nHe is five months into a year-long deployment to the station.\n\nAnd if Covid-19 reached an Antarctic research base, it could be devastating. There's nowhere else to go, medical facilities are limited - and the likelihood of spreading it to others would be high.\n\nAnd so despite being on the only continent without any cases of coronavirus, the 23-strong team at the facility has been on lockdown since February.\n\nAnyone coming to Antarctica is now quarantined for 14 days.\n\nAnd if someone starts showing Covid-19 symptoms in Antarctica, they must be isolated immediately, alongside anyone they've had contact with.\n\nThere are 29 countries with bases in Antarctica.\n\nAnd before lockdown started, there would be regular visits to Bharati from neighbouring expeditions.\n\nThe visitors' national flag would be raised for their arrival. The different teams would celebrate important national days together. And if one of the bases needed equipment they did not have to hand, they would borrow it from their neighbours.\n\n\"This level of harmony among nations is not visible in the real world,\" Dr Tomar says.\n\nBut he has not seen anyone from another facility since the beginning of March, when joint activities were paused.\n\nWhen Dr Tomar arrived at Bharati, on 15 November 2019, to study the psychological effects of a polar expedition on the researchers, the world was much the same as it had always been. Now, he says, there is a constant anxiety on the site, fuelled by the lack of information about coronavirus - and constant worrying about their families back home.\n\nDr Tomar and his colleagues have only a vague idea of what the global pandemic and subsequent lockdowns entail.\n\nHe is relying on friends and family for updates.\n\nAnd some consequences of the social distancing he is struggling to imagine at all.\n\n\"Friends have been telling me that they are surviving in a situation like ours, isolated and glued at home,\" he says.\n\n\"It is beyond my imagination to realise the entire world going out with their masks on.\"\n\nWith quarantine measures in place around the world, travelling to and from the base and others may become difficult.\n\nAnd it could mean scientists will have to stay for many more months longer than they expected in the cold and inhospitable climate.\n\nSituated on the Larsemann Hills, overlooking the Southern Ocean, the Bharati base, which started operations in 2012, is one of the remotest research outposts on the planet. The nearest mainland is South Africa, more than 5,000km (3,000 miles) away. The only transport is by boat - and then only in the Antarctic summer, between November and the end of March.\n\nThose in such an inhospitable place are uniquely aware of how people cope with lockdown.\n\nYou may also be interested in:\n\nEveryone works from \"home\" for the duration of their stay at the facility.\n\nThere are no shops. There is no option for a casual stroll. Outside, the threat is the temperature dropping as low as -40C.\n\nAll the team at Bharati received comprehensive training before they arrived, to learn how to mentally and physically survive Antarctic winters.\n\nThe constant social isolation and lack of sunlight puts them at risk of developing depression.\n\nAnd on a continent that spends many winter months with no sunlight at all, maintaining a regular sleep pattern can be difficult.\n\n\"We encourage people to practise good sleep hygiene here,\" Dr Tomar says.\n\nWhen Dr Tomar arrived, he was wary of the dangers of the Antarctic landscape.\n\n\"There is a constant threat to life when you are here,\" he says. \"Vast sheets of ice are packed with hidden crevices to fall into.\"\n\nBut now, he is more fearful for the people at home. The world as Dr Tomar knows it could change beyond recognition during his year on the frozen continent. While he had been trained for the social isolation, compatriots at home have not.\n\n\"I truly wish I could serve my country in this time of need,\" he says. \"Nobody has ever witnessed something like the ongoing crisis. I hope to see the same world again when we go home.\"",

Depois, tive duas semanas em que achei estar melhorando, que estava apenas muito cansado.\"\n\n\"Mas a\u00ed, tipo na s\u00e9tima semana, eu tive nova reca\u00edda e minha terceira onda, felizmente muito mais suave, mas ainda significativa.\"\n\nTrabalhando com a ideia de que era melhor prevenir do que remediar, David continuou se autoisolando, comendo sozinho, dormindo sozinho e trocando de roupa nas raras ocasi\u00f5es em que deixava a sala para ir ao banheiro.\n\nSua esposa levava Millie, sua filha de 10 meses de idade, para a janela da sala para que David pudesse v\u00ea-la atrav\u00e9s do vidro.\n\nA doen\u00e7a deixou David exausto e incerto sobre o que aconteceria a seguir.\n\n\"Provavelmente uma das coisas mais estressantes \u00e9 tentar descobrir em que ponto voc\u00ea pede ajuda. Voc\u00ea n\u00e3o quer incomodar o sistema p\u00fablico de sa\u00fade, porque obviamente existem pessoas em situa\u00e7\u00f5es muito piores que eu. Mas certamente, no meu momento mais fraco, eu n\u00e3o queria cair na armadilha de n\u00e3o pedir ajuda e depois algo ruim acontecer porque n\u00e3o pedi ajuda\", diz.\n\n\"Quando eu reca\u00ed pela primeira vez, quando fiquei pior, foi uma experi\u00eancia assustadora, porque voc\u00ea n\u00e3o sabe se isso significa que voc\u00ea est\u00e1 piorando, piorando, piorando...\"\n\n\"Ent\u00e3o \u00e9 bastante assustador piorar quando voc\u00ea pensa que est\u00e1 melhorando.\"\n\nFelicity, de 49 anos, moradora de Londres, completou seis semanas de recupera\u00e7\u00e3o ap\u00f3s adoecer com sintomas da covid-19.\n\nMas, como David, sua experi\u00eancia esteve longe de ser suave.\n\n\"Acho que a parte mais dif\u00edcil foi, depois de superar os primeiros 10 dias em que fiquei muito doente, eu pensar que estava melhorando, mas ver as coisas ficando muito, muito piores novamente.\"\n\nEla diz que, na quinta semana, sentiu dores abdominais \"t\u00e3o horr\u00edveis que estava apenas gritando com extrema agonia.\"\n\n\"\u00c9 t\u00e3o dif\u00edcil saber: esse \u00e9 o resultado do v\u00edrus? \u00c9 a resposta do sistema imunol\u00f3gico? \u00c9 uma inflama\u00e7\u00e3o cont\u00ednua? N\u00e3o tive problemas no est\u00f4mago antes de adoecer, mas a quinta semana foi simplesmente horrenda.\"\n\nNem Felicity nem David foram testados para a covid-19 na Inglaterra, mas ambos foram informados pelos m\u00e9dicos de que provavelmente tinham o v\u00edrus.\n\nEles tamb\u00e9m tiveram a garantia de que n\u00e3o s\u00e3o mais infecciosos.\n\nMas Felicity se esfor\u00e7ou para se livrar de seus sintomas e as semanas de doen\u00e7a cobraram seu pre\u00e7o.\n\n\"Eu passo muito tempo na cama tentando me recuperar. Toda essa experi\u00eancia, de estar doente e tentar se recuperar, foi mentalmente avassaladora.\"\n\nParte do problema \u00e9 que muita coisa sobre o coronav\u00edrus ainda \u00e9 desconhecida, por exemplo, por que algumas pessoas experimentam sintomas relativamente leves que duram alguns dias, enquanto outras pessoas perfeitamente saud\u00e1veis ficam sofrendo por semanas.\n\nPhilip Gothard, m\u00e9dico do Hospital de Doen\u00e7as Tropicais de Londres, diz que a maioria dos pacientes tem uma recupera\u00e7\u00e3o completa e mais r\u00e1pida que David e Felicity.\n\n\"Alguns t\u00eam tosse persistente e estamos come\u00e7ando a ver pacientes com fadiga e exaust\u00e3o profundas que duram talvez tr\u00eas, quatro, cinco ou seis semanas. \u00c9 muito angustiante se voc\u00ea \u00e9 uma pessoa jovem e saud\u00e1vel, \u00e9 algo com o qual voc\u00ea n\u00e3o est\u00e1 acostumado. E, portanto, \u00e0s vezes \u00e9 um choque que essa recupera\u00e7\u00e3o seja t\u00e3o lenta\", diz.\n\n\"Mas em muitos pacientes que se recuperam de outras doen\u00e7as agudas voc\u00ea tende a ver esse tipo de efeito de aumento e diminui\u00e7\u00e3o do ritmo de melhora, voc\u00ea tem bons e maus dias.\"\n\nTim Spector, professor de epidemiologia gen\u00e9tica no King's College London, diz que os dados do aplicativo Covid Symptom Study mostram que, em m\u00e9dia, s\u00e3o necess\u00e1rios 12 dias para as pessoas come\u00e7arem a se recuperar lentamente.\n\n\"Tamb\u00e9m estamos vendo um n\u00famero significativo de pessoas relatando sintomas que podem durar muito mais tempo do que isso, em alguns casos por 30 dias ou mais. \u00c0 medida que coletamos mais dados e continuamos a usar aprendizado de m\u00e1quina (machine learning) e intelig\u00eancia artificial, em breve seremos capazes de identificar qual combina\u00e7\u00e3o de sintomas e fatores de risco torna uma pessoa mais ou menos propensa a sofrer com esses sintomas de longo prazo.\"\n\nDavid e Felicity esperam que agora estejam finalmente se recuperando e possam come\u00e7ar a voltar \u00e0 vida normal. Mas a covid-19, uma doen\u00e7a que ainda tem apenas alguns meses, continua a trazer surpresas para n\u00f3s, e nenhuma delas \u00e9 bem-vinda.",

        "authors": [],
        "body": "A test to find out whether people have been infected with coronavirus in the past has been approved by health officials in England.\n\nPublic Health England said the antibody test, developed by Swiss pharmaceutical company Roche, was a \"very positive development\".\n\nThe blood test looks for antibodies to see if a person has already had the virus and might now have some immunity.\n\nUntil now, officials have said such tests are not reliable enough.\n\nThe government previously spent a reported \u00a316m buying antibody tests which later proved to be ineffective.\n\nSources told the BBC the Roche test was the first one to offer serious potential.\n\nAntibodies are made by our immune system as it learns to fight an infection.\n\nFinding antibodies that attack the coronavirus show that person has been infected in the past, but they do not prove they are protected against it in the future.\n\nExperts at the government's Porton Down facility evaluated the Roche test last week, Public Health England said.\n\nRoche found that if someone had been infected, it gave the correct result 100% of the time.\n\nIf someone had not caught coronavirus then it gave the correct result more than 99.8% of the time.\n\nIt means fewer than two in 1,000 healthy people would be incorrectly told they had previously caught the coronavirus.\n\nHealth minister Edward Argar said the tests would mainly be used on those in the NHS and social care settings to begin with.\n\nHe could not give an exact date for when the testing could start.\n\nProf John Newton, national coordinator of the UK coronavirus testing programme, said: \"This is a very positive development because such a highly specific antibody test is a very reliable marker of past infection.\n\n\"This in turn may indicate some immunity to future infection, although the extent to which the presence of antibodies indicates immunity remains unclear.\"\n\nRoche is understood to be in talks with the Department of Health and Social Care about possible use by the NHS in England, though other testing products are also being assessed.\n\nHealth officials in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland make their own decisions, but are likely to follow suit if England does adopt it.\n\nThe test already has approval from medical regulators in the EU and the United States.\n\nThe main use of an antibody test is to find out how many people have been infected.\n\nThe official figures are only a fraction of the total number - not everybody is getting tested and some people are being infected without developing symptoms.\n\nAntibody tests will help answer questions such as how far and how easily the virus has spread and, crucially, how deadly it really is.\n\nThe second use - helping to lift lockdown - is highly controversial.\n\nThe idea is if you have antibodies, then you can go back to work. This could be particularly helpful in hospitals and care homes full of vulnerable people, if you could guarantee the staff were immune.\n\nBut having antibodies does not automatically mean you cannot get sick or harbour the virus and pass it on to others.\n\nWorld Health Organization scientists advise against using so called \"immunity passports\" because of the lack of evidence.\n\nThe swab tests currently being carried out in the UK determine whether someone has the virus at the time of the test.\n\nThese will remain the core part of the government's test, track and trace strategy for containing the spread of the virus.\n\nAnother 428 coronavirus deaths have been recorded across the UK, bringing the total number of deaths for people who have tested positive for the virus to 33,614.\n\nSir John Bell, regius professor of medicine at Oxford University, described the Roche test as a \"major step forward\".\n\nBut although it could determine whether someone had had the infection, it did not determine \"for sure\" whether they would be protected from the virus in future, he said.\n\n\"We have still yet to completely understand what a positive result actually means,\" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. \"So we're not there yet.\"\n\nThe prime minister's official spokesperson said: \"We have talked about, in the future, the potential for some kind of health certificate related to whether or not you have antibodies.\"\n\nBut the spokesperson stressed more information was needed on immunity and coronavirus \"to better understand the potential of the test\".\n\nThe World Health Organization has previously warned governments not to issue so-called \"immunity passports\" or \"risk-free certificates\" as a way of easing lockdowns.\n\nLast week, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the UK was in talks with Roche about a \"very large-scale roll-out\" of coronavirus antibody testing.\n\nBut he acknowledged there had been \"false hope before\" and that he would only make an announcement when the government was \"absolutely ready\".\n\nBBC Reality Check correspondent Chris Morris said other European countries were already carrying out limited antibody testing programmes.\n\nIn Germany, 61,299 antibody tests were conducted last week, according to the Accredited Laboratories for Medicine association (ALM).\n\nIn Spain, the health ministry said on Wednesday that preliminary results of one study, based on more than 60,000 antibody tests around the country, suggested about 5% of the population had been infected by coronavirus so far.",

        "body": "Crew members from the coronavirus-hit cruise ship Greg Mortimer have been allowed to disembark in Uruguay, after almost two months at sea.\n\nOf the more than 60 crew members, 36 tested positive for the virus.\n\nThe ship's passengers had already disembarked last month and flown home.\n\nMeanwhile, two crew members became seriously ill with Covid-19 and were hospitalised. One, who was from the Philippines, later died. The other recovered and was flown home to Poland.\n\nAfter disembarking on Tuesday, crew members who had tested positive were taken to a hotel in Montevideo to be quarantined, while the others were taken to a separate hotel in the city.\n\nThe Greg Mortimer, owned by the Australian firm Aurora Expeditions, was taking more than 200 people to Antarctica, South Georgia and Elephant Island - but the tour was called off on 20 March.\n\nThis was because the nearest South American countries - Argentina and Chile - had closed their borders and imposed lockdowns.\n\nIt eventually anchored off Montevideo on 27 March, but wasn't allowed to dock in the port until 10 April.\n\nUruguay's Foreign Minister Ernesto Talvi said it was necessary to allow the crew to disembark because the people who were infected with the virus were not recovering.\n\n\"If we don't remove them, they won't heal,\" he said at the port. \"We took the decision to disembark them, taking all health measures for the citizenry.\"\n\nMr Talvi added that none of the 36 crew who had tested positive were showing symptoms, and that the ship would be thoroughly disinfected.\n\nThe hotels in which the crew will be quarantined are closed to the public, and are being supervised by the health ministry. The crew won't be allowed to leave their rooms and will have daily health checks.\n\nAfter two weeks, people with no symptoms and a negative test result will be allowed to leave Uruguay on commercial flights.\n\nAnother 20 crew members are remaining on board, however, because they are considered essential to the boat's safety. They have all tested negative for the virus.\n\nIf they still test negative \"in two or three weeks\", the boat will sail to Las Palmas in Spain, Mr Talvi said.",

        "body": "When our immune systems mobilise, they can sometimes go into overdrive, triggering a destructive over-reaction called a cytokine storm. Why does it happen, and how can we stop it?\n\nAs Covid-19 cases fill the world's hospitals, among the sickest and most likely to die are those whose bodies react in a signature, catastrophic way. Immune cells flood into the lungs and attack them, when they should be protecting them. Blood vessels leak, and the blood itself clots. Blood pressure plummets and organs start to fail.\n\nSuch cases, doctors and scientists increasingly believe, are due to an immune reaction gone overboard - so that it harms instead of helps.\n\nNormally, when the human body encounters a germ, the immune system attacks the invader and then stands down. But sometimes, that orderly army of cells wielding molecular weapons gets out of control, morphing from obedient soldiers into an unruly, torch and pitchfork-bearing mob. Though there are tests and treatments that could help to identify and tamp down this insurrection, it's too early to be sure of the best course of therapy for those who are suffering a storm due to Covid-19.\n\nVariants on this hyperactive immune reaction occur in an array of conditions, triggered by infection, faulty genes or autoimmune disorders in which the body thinks its own tissues are invaders. All fall under the umbrella term \"cytokine storm,\" named because substances called cytokines rampage through the bloodstream. These small proteins -- there are dozens - are the immune army's messengers, transiting between cells with a variety of effects. Some ask for more immune activity; some request less.\n\nHere's what scientists know about cytokine storms and the part they play in Covid-19.\n\nRising storm\n\nWhen the cytokines that raise immune activity become too abundant, the immune system may not be able to stop itself. Immune cells spread beyond infected body parts and start attacking healthy tissues, gobbling up red and white blood cells and damaging the liver. Blood vessel walls open up to let immune cells into surrounding tissues, but the vessels get so leaky that the lungs may fill with fluid, and blood pressure drops. Blood clots form throughout the body, further choking the blood flow. When organs don't get enough blood, a person can go into shock, risking permanent organ damage or death.\n\nYou might also like:\n\nMost patients experiencing a storm will have a fever, and about half will have some nervous system symptoms, such as headaches, seizures or even a coma, says Randy Cron, a paediatric rheumatologist and immunologist at the University of Alabama at Birmingham and co-editor of the 2019 textbook Cytokine Storm Syndrome. \"They tend to be sicker than you expect,\" he says.\n\nDoctors are only now coming to understand cytokine storms and how to treat them, he adds. Though there's no failsafe diagnostic test, there are signs that a storm may be underway. For example, blood levels of the protein ferritin may rise, as may blood concentrations of the inflammation indicator C-reactive protein, which is made by the liver.\n\nThe first hints that severe Covid-19 cases included a cytokine storm came out of Chinese hospitals near the outbreak's epicentre. Physicians in Wuhan, in a study of 29 patients, reported that higher levels of the cytokines IL-2R and IL-6 were found in more severe Covid-19 infections.",

        "authors": [],
        "body": "The government is facing the deadline for its daily coronavirus testing target of 100,000 per day, after reaching just over 52,000 on Tuesday.\n\nHealth Secretary Matt Hancock pledged to reach the goal by the end of April.\n\nA scientist advising the government on testing, Prof John Newton, said he is confident the target will be met, but warned there will be a lag in the data.\n\nMeanwhile, the PM is set to lead the daily Downing Street briefing later, following his return to work this week.\n\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson \"will give an update on the country's fight against this disease and the steps we are taking to defeat it\", his spokesman said.\n\nHowever, BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said the PM will not give \"chapter and verse on exactly how and when the country's doors will re-open\".\n\nThe government's chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, and chief medical officer, Prof Chris Whitty, will also appear at Thursday's briefing.\n\nMr Johnson, who has just recovered from coronavirus, returned to work in Downing Street on Tuesday following the birth of his son with his fiancee Carrie Symonds.\n\nIt comes as the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), which is working on a range of options for easing lockdown restrictions, will meet on Thursday. The lockdown is due to be reviewed on 7 May.\n\nEarlier this week, Mr Johnson said the lockdown would not be relaxed too soon and details on any changes would be set out over the \"coming days\".\n\nAt Wednesday's press conference, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said he \"did not know\" whether the five tests for lifting lockdown had been met and warned that the country was at a \"delicate and dangerous moment in this challenge\".\n\nHe said that the UK was still \"coming through the peak\" of the virus and called for people to maintain social distancing measures \"until we are out of the woods\".\n\nWhat's next? The prime minister will not give chapter and verse later today on exactly how and when the country's doors will re-open.\n\nBut after meeting his cabinet virtually, Boris Johnson will seek to explain to the public how and why, if not exactly when, they will make the decisions that are vital, not just to our health, but the country's suffering economy too.\n\nHe'll restate the hurdles that must be passed before any restrictions are lifted, including making sure the NHS can cope, with tests, and equipment, and a consistent fall in the death rate.\n\nCrucially he will emphasise the importance of the so-called \"R\" rate of infection - in other words, the extent to which people with the virus are passing it on.\n\nThat rate has come down significantly since the lockdown was imposed, slowing the spread of the disease. But Mr Johnson will outline how the \"R\" rate will be a crucial yardstick of whether to lift, or even reinstate, restrictions as the weeks go on.\n\nRead Laura's full blog here.\n\nThe health secretary set out the government's daily testing target of 100,000 per day on 2 April, even though Mr Johnson initially identified the aim to carry out 250,000 tests a day.\n\nThe latest figures announced during Wednesday's briefing showed 52,429 people were tested for Covid-19 in the UK on Tuesday, despite Mr Hancock announcing a massive expansion of the groups eligible for testing earlier in the week.\n\nMinisters say that there is capacity for about 73,000 tests per day, and Downing Street has repeatedly said it is aiming to reach its target by Thursday.\n\nProf Newton, director of public health improvement for Public Health England (PHE), said on Wednesday that he was \"pretty confident we will hit that target.\"\n\nHe said there would be a lag due to receiving the data but it would be clear whether the government has reached the target by the end of the week.\n\nIn the Commons on Wednesday, Mr Raab said the 250,000 tests a day target remained \"an aspiration\" in response to questions from Labour Party leader Sir Keir Starmer.\n\nLater in the press conference, the foreign secretary admitted there had been a \"distribution issue\" in getting tests for care home staff and residents.\n\nHe said: \"We have expanded the eligibility - eligibility now includes anyone in a care home, whether resident or staff.\n\n\"We have obviously had a distribution issue, there is no sugar coating the challenge we have had with that.\"\n\nBut he said the government was now doing \"everything we possibly can\" to improve supply and delivery.\n\nPeople over 65 and anyone who cannot work at home are also among millions able to apply for a coronavirus test if they have symptoms, under the government's expanded testing programme.\n\nThe expansion in eligibility beyond just essential workers and hospital patients means 25 million people can now book through the government's test-booking website.\n\nSome 14,700 home tests and 33,000 drive-through appointments were booked on Wednesday.\n\nThe total number of people who have died in the UK with coronavirus has now passed 26,000, as official figures include deaths in the community, such as in care homes, for the first time.\n\nA new method of counting includes retrospective deaths since the beginning of March.",

    "Deal agreed for antibody virus tests on NHS": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "Health and care staff will be the first to receive antibody tests to check if a person has had coronavirus, after the government agreed a deal with a large pharmaceutical company.\n\nThe tests will be available on the NHS for \"those who need them\", No 10 said.\n\nAt the moment, the only testing available are swab tests to check if someone currently has Covid-19.\n\nThe UK-wide antibody tests will help scientists with virus research, BBC health correspondent Nick Triggle said.\n\nIt comes as the government announced on Thursday a further 338 people had died after testing positive for the virus.\n\nThe deal follows talks between the government and Swiss firm Roche.\n\nThe prime minister's official spokesman said: \"The tests will be free for people who need them, as you would expect. NHS and care workers will be prioritised for the tests.\"\n\nThe Health Secretary Matt Hancock is expected to give more details this evening.\n\nThe coronavirus tests already available to all adults and children aged over five on the NHS involve taking a swab up the nose or from the back of the throat. These tests tell you if you currently have Covid-19.\n\nThe antibody test is a blood test that looks for antibodies in the blood to see whether a person has had the virus. Antibodies are made by our immune system as it learns to fight an infection.\n\nHowever, having antibodies does not automatically mean you cannot get sick or harbour the virus and pass it on to others, says BBC health correspondent James Gallagher.\n\nThe World Health Organization says there is no evidence people who have antibodies are protected from being infected again.\n\nAntibody testing attracts huge attention. But this development needs to be kept in context.\n\nWe still do not know how strong any antibody response is and therefore the potential for long-term immunity.\n\nSo the logic in offering it to health and care workers is to help with that research.\n\nThey will not suddenly be casting aside their PPE at work.\n\nInstead, officials will be keeping an eye on whether those who have antibodies are at lower risk of re-infection.\n\nThe test may also help with surveillance in time.\n\nA large sample of the population could be tested to look for signs of antibodies.\n\nOne of the great unknowns is just how many people have been infected but have not developed symptoms.\n\nIt comes after NHS England's medical director Prof Stephen Powis cautioned people against using antibody tests which are being sold by some retailers.\n\nOn Wednesday, Superdrug became the latest business - and first High Street retailer - to offer the antibody test. The kit costs \u00a369 and buyers need to take a blood sample at home, which is sent off to a lab for testing.\n\nPublic Health England approved Roche's antibody test last week, calling it a \"very positive development\".\n\nThe government previously spent a reported \u00a316m buying antibody tests which later proved to be ineffective.\n\nPublic Health England said experts at the government's Porton Down facility had evaluated the Roche test.\n\nRoche found that if someone had been infected, it gave the correct result 100% of the time.\n\nIf someone had not caught coronavirus then it gave the correct result more than 99.8% of the time.\n\nIt means fewer than two in 1,000 healthy people would be incorrectly told they had previously caught the coronavirus.\n\nHealth minister Edward Argar previously said the tests would mainly be used on those in the NHS and social care settings to begin with.\n\nIt comes as the NHS Confederation, which represents health service trusts, warned that time was running out to finish a test, track and trace strategy. It warned a contact tracing system was critical to prevent a second wave of the virus.\n\nNorthern Ireland already has a telephone contact tracing system in place, while the Scottish government is currently trialling one. The Welsh government wants its \"test, trace, protect\" programme operational by the end of May.\n\nIn England, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said 25,000 contact tracers, able to track 10,000 new cases a day, would be in place by 1 June.\n\nContact tracing identifies those who may have come into contact with an infected person and warns them via phone, email or an app.\n\nMeanwhile, lockdown restrictions in Scotland are likely to be relaxed slightly from next Thursday.\n\nFirst Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the first phase will include allowing people to meet outside with people from one other household.\n\nBut schools - which are planned to begin a phased reopening from 1 June in England - will not reopen until the school new year begins on 11 August.",

    "Did VE Day parties cause a spike in Covid-19 cases?": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "One day last week the number of new coronavirus cases registered at Bradford Royal Infirmary jumped to 30. Dr John Wright thinks there could be a link to VE Day parties that ended in fist fights, or in embraces.\n\nThe day after the Prime Minister announced an easing of the lockdown, the number of new Covid patients in the hospital fell to a reassuring three. And two of them were my medical colleagues.\n\nThe low figure partly resulted from delays in reporting, which happen every weekend, but there was still a collective sigh of relief. Maybe everything was going to be all right after all?\n\nBut three days later, on Thursday 14 May, the number of new Covid-positive patients had shot up to 30.\n\nIt's just one figure, and in normal times we might discount it as random variation. However these are times of alertness, and every flicker of the Covid dashboard needle triggers nervous anticipation of a possible spike.\n\nThere is a delay between infection and symptoms, usually about five-to-seven days. So these cases would have been incubating since the week before - and possibly since the communal gatherings on VE Day, six days earlier.\n\nVE Day - the 75th anniversary of the Allied victory in Europe in World War Two - would normally have been a massive street party across the UK. Even in the lockdown, communities did what they could - decorating their homes with bunting, sitting outside in deckchairs, socialising with neighbours in street parties, keeping 2m apart.\n\nBut as alcohol began to have its effect, staff in our accident and emergency unit began seeing evidence of a collapse in social distancing.\n\n\"On VE day we had patients in who had been assaulted in the middle of street parties,\" says A&E consultant David Greenhorn.\n\n\"There were a number of assaults and it was quite clear that as the alcohol flowed, the street parties became closer and they were no longer street parties, and more garden parties - and then eventually front-room parties. And then, as often happens with parties, they were boxing matches.\"\n\nAs he points out, it's not possible to punch someone from 2m away.\n\nPeople rarely end up in A&E after falling in love so David has less evidence to support his next theory, but he speculates that the parties also helped to incubate Covid cases in another way.\n\n\"It was a clear night and people were out and looking at the stars and singing, 'We'll meet again.' There is a lot of pent-up emotion and I understand that frustration - I know why people would want to have a drink, and once you've had a few drinks your inhibitions and judgement go and you forget to stay 2m away, and you get that 'I love you' moment.\n\nProf John Wright, a doctor and epidemiologist, is head of the Bradford Institute for Health Research, and a veteran of cholera, HIV and Ebola epidemics in sub-Saharan Africa. He is writing this diary for BBC News and recording from the hospital wards for BBC Radio.\n\nAfter Thursday, the daily number of new cases at Bradford Royal Infirmary fell back to less than 15.\n\nEven before the prime minister's announcement on 10 May, the lockdown had been slowly leaking, and the legacy of any leak is an increase in the number of Covid cases.\n\nIt was reported on Friday that the R number - the average number of people each infected person passes the coronavirus to - has been creeping back up across the country, and nowhere more so than in Yorkshire and the North East.\n\nConsultant in respiratory medicine Dinesh Saralaya has concerns, therefore, about members of Bradford's Muslim population gathering in the evening to buy hot food from the South Asian restaurants the city is well-known for.\n\n\"A few of us have been talking about a breakdown in social distancing - I'm worried about the possibility that this might be happening as we approach the end of Ramadan,\" he says.\n\nHe points out that people are doing less cooking at home during Ramadan, when they fast every day until sunset, and that some restaurants have opened takeaways outside.\n\n\"They want the food to be hot when they break their fast, so they start queuing from around 8.30pm,\" Dinesh says. \"You can see lots of cars pull up and there are lots of people waiting. I think that it could be exposing people and worry that we will start to see some impact of that.\"\n\nThe end of Ramadan is approaching, with Eid-al-fitr, the breaking of the fast, being celebrated this bank holiday weekend by roughly a third of Bradford's population. Mosques would normally fill with grateful worshippers, and when Eid falls at this time of year it is particularly joyous - the city's streets and parks would typically be filled with sunshine and festivities. But this year, under the Covid cloud, the mosques will remain closed and gatherings ruled out.\n\nThe message remains unchanged in our city: Stay at home, Eid at home, save lives.",

    "Disease meets deforestation at heart of Brazil's Amazon": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "In the middle of the rainforest, the virus has taken hold. Manaus, the Amazon's biggest city, is at breaking point. They are digging mass graves, or trenches. It is the only way overwhelmed authorities can cope with the deaths from Covid-19.\n\nPeople are asking whether this city, the capital of the Brazilian state of Amazonas, will become the next Guayaquil. It is hard not to compare the two, as the images of unburied bodies in Ecuador are still etched on many peoples' minds here.\n\nAmazonas has one of Brazil's highest infection rates and also one of the most underfunded health systems, a combination that has brought chaos to the heart of the jungle.\n\nIn April, Manaus saw a rise of 578% in the number of people who died from respiratory problems. They are not officially noted as victims of Covid-19 but experts believe there can only be one explanation. With testing still low, there is a massive underreporting of the real numbers.\n\nBut even the official figures - about 92,000 confirmed cases and more than 6,500 deaths - saw Brazil reach a grim milestone as it passed China where the outbreak started.\n\n\"We don't want miracles,\" said the mayor of Manaus, Arthur Virgilio Neto. It was a dig at President Jair Bolsonaro, who mocked the rising numbers of deaths by joking that his middle name was Messiah but he did not work miracles.\n\n\"What we need is a plane full of scanners, ventilators, medicines and PPE,\" he said, referring to protective equipment for health workers. But help has been slow, while Mr Bolsonaro continues to downplay the severity of the virus.\n\nHome to nearly two million people, Manaus is the seventh-biggest city in Brazil and its most isolated urban centre. Amazonas also has the largest number of indigenous in the country, many of whom now live in the city.\n\nPoverty, malnutrition and displacement make tackling the virus an even bigger challenge for these communities, some of Brazil's most vulnerable.\n\nIn Parque das Tribos, on the outskirts of Manaus, several women are busy at sewing machines. History has taught people that viruses from outside bring devastation. Their only defence now are home-made masks, but much more is needed to protect them.\n\n\"We already have lots of people in the community with symptoms,\" says resident Vanderleia dos Santos. \"We don't have a doctor here, or a nurse to look after us.\"\n\nDuring the coronavirus crisis, she says, indigenous communities in the city are being attended to by the public health system, known as SUS. Rural indigenous communities have their own special health service, the Special Secretariat for Indigenous Health (Sesai).\n\nShe worries though that the system masks the true numbers of indigenous suffering from Covid-19. She says indigenous are not being registered as such, instead they are put down as \"white\".\n\n\"Our identity is being questioned all the time,\" she says. \"And it means we can't map the relatives who could be infected.\"\n\nWith nearly half of Brazil's indigenous communities now in cities, it is not a small problem.\n\n\"The indigenous in urban areas feel abandoned,\" says Sonia Guajajara, who heads up the Association of Brazil's Indigenous People. \"They're exposed to contagion and death because they're not being attended to straight away.\"\n\nFor those living deep in the rainforest, the closest medical help is often days away by boat. Some communities have shut themselves away, fearful of contagion. Others remain uncontacted, but their livelihoods are at threat when there is also less oversight from indigenous and environmental agencies.\n\n\"It's a double whammy,\" says Jonathan Mazower of Survival International. \"Many of the field agents who would have been working to protect reserves from invasions have pulled back and are not patrolling anymore.\"\n\nThat has huge consequences in a country where illegal loggers and miners have been emboldened by a government set on getting rid of protected areas and developing the Amazon.\n\n\"Many people are eyeing up these lands,\" Mr Mazower says. \"Undoubtedly they're taking advantage and staking their claim.\"\n\nThe figures speak for themselves. In the first three months of the year, deforestation rose 51%.\n\n\"At the same time as adopting measures to combat Covid-19, we can't forget the incursions and attacks that keep happening and are never resolved,\" says Sonia Guajajara. \"Looking out for Covid-19 makes the other issues invisible.\"\n\nShe says illegal miners, loggers, hunters and evangelicals wanting contact with uncontacted tribes \"aren't in quarantine\", adding: \"They are using this time to explore and they are the principal vectors.\"\n\nAnd there is an added urgency as fire season begins.\n\nLast year an unprecedented number of fires devastated huge swathes of forest in the Amazon. Peak fire season is from July which some experts worry could coincide with the peak of the coronavirus crisis.\n\n\"This will be double-trouble,\" says Romulo Batista of Greenpeace in Manaus.\n\nIn 2019, there were more than two and a half times the number of people with lung problems than usual, he said. And municipalities closer to the fire areas, like Porto Velho in the state of Rond\u00f4nia, will suffer the most.\n\n\"When you have a lot of fires, you have a lot of people going to hospital and when you have a hospital full of Covid-19, it will be madness when the fires start this year.\"",

        "body": "A senior emergency doctor has described how he suffered a \"deeply unpleasant\" form of the Covid-19 virus.\n\nSean McGovern, who works as clinical director at the Ulster Hospital, Dundonald, first experienced the unusual symptom of back pain.\n\nHe later developed a \"frightening\" episode of respiratory symptoms, but his condition improved.\n\n\"Over a period of about 12 hours I developed a headache and felt very fatigued and unwell,\" he said.\n\n\"So I decided to avail of the trust opportunity as a frontline worker to be tested the following morning and the result came back the next morning to say that I was positive,\" said Dr McGovern.\n\nHis first symptoms lasted five or six days, and he thought he was getting better, only to experience the \"dip\" that is a recognised part of this coronavirus infection.\n\nHe developed respiratory symptoms, with prolonged coughing and shortness of breath.\n\n\"That was the most frightening, because you've a cough, you started to cough up some blood because you tear a small vessel.\n\n\"You become short of breath because you've coughed so much, so that was a frightening episode.\n\n\"Could I deteriorate to a level that I need hospitalization? I wanted to avoid that.\n\n\"And then once you get hospitalized, do you end up on a ventilator? Those negative thoughts do enter in if you've had 24, 48 hours of fairly rough respiratory symptoms.\n\n\"But after about five or six days of the respiratory symptoms, I knew I was on the mend.\"\n\nAlthough he had access to front-line worker testing, he believes there needs to be more testing in the community, particularly before we reach the traditional winter flu season.\n\n\"It's crucial that we get testing. Testing both for the people who are actively having the disease and antibody testing, to prove that people have actually had it.\n\n\"Those are going to be game changers in terms of how we manage the disease and in terms of how we open up society again.\"\n\nAnd he says there are lessons to be learned about how Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) is managed.\n\n\"In times of a pandemic that's going to last a long period of time, it's clearly the case that we need to have an ongoing supply and that needs to be local in my view.\n\n\"Northern Ireland has not had the London experience or indeed the Lombardy experience that people have seen on TV.\n\n\"We've the capacity, the system has managed and there have been transformational changes made to enable capacity to be at its maximum in Northern Ireland.\"\n\nDr McGovern says some of those changes in the healthcare system to manage Covid-19 should be sustained in the long-term.\n\n\"The health service should look different. We should seize upon the opportunity that's been afforded to us to actually revaluate and what brings added value to the care system.\n\n\"There are clearly lessons in health and social care in terms of managing care homes and of having appropriate PPE and all of those things across the system so I think yes, we have to harness it, and the driver for change has to be that we're doing it better, not that we're just changing it for the sake of changing.\"\n\nBut after recovering from the virus, he says complacency is not an option.\n\n\"This is a virus that's new, it is virulent, it is highly contagious.\n\n\"It will have a detrimental effect on a significant number of vulnerable in society, and until we can get a vaccine, then we must social distance and must move forward on that line.\n\n\"So I think people either make a judgement in terms of the next weeks, a stepwise progression with opening up society, whilst still shielding the most vulnerable.\n\n\"I feel the most vulnerable in society will continue to need shielded until such times as we're comfortable with herd immunity - or we've got a vaccine - or both.\"",

    "Does hospital deaths milestone mean failure for UK?": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "The first death linked to coronavirus in the UK was announced in early March. It was a woman in her 70s.\n\nThere have now been more than 20,000 fatalities since, according to the government's daily figures.\n\nThe tragic milestone is significant - at the outbreak's start, chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance said keeping the death toll to that figure would be \"horrible\" but a \"good outcome\" given the country's challenge.\n\nThe government had been warned that up to 500,000 people could die if the virus's spread was not stopped.\n\nDoes reaching this landmark mean the UK has failed to achieve its goals, and what happens from here?\n\nCoronavirus is a mild illness for most - it is estimated only about one in 20 cases that develop symptoms need hospital treatment.\n\nThere have been cases involving health workers, younger adults and children, but the virus has - as expected - preyed largely on older people, particularly the frail and those with existing health problems.\n\nData from hospitals in England last week showed more than nine in 10 deaths have been in the over-60s and there is a similar picture in the rest of the UK.\n\nThe Office for National Statistics (ONS) has also looked at the deaths, analysing what proportion had pre-existing health conditions.\n\nAgain, more than nine out of 10 did, with the average between two and three. Heart disease was the most common.\n\nThe government figures are deaths that have happened in hospitals. They do not take into account fatalities in care homes or the community - so in reality the 20,000 mark would have been passed before now.\n\nBut it is still an important measure - as these deaths are the ones being monitored in terms of judging when the lockdown should be lifted (one of the key five tests is a sustained fall in deaths).\n\nThe good news from that point of view is that the numbers seem to be coming down. When you look at the deaths by the date they happened, it appears that the peak happened in the first half of April - in England at least. Comparable data is not available in the rest of the UK.\n\nIn comparison, the deaths in care homes are rising across the UK - and probably at a more rapid rate than the official figures show.\n\nThe ONS has been tracking this through death certificates, and because of this the data lags behind the hospital figures.\n\nThe latest information shows that up to 10 April, there have been just over 1,000 deaths so far in England and Wales. But that looks like it is a underestimate.\n\nThat's because during that week, and indeed the week before, there were actually many more extra deaths above what you would normally expect.\n\nThese extra cases did not mention coronavirus on the death certificate but experts believe they point to an under-reporting of coronavirus deaths.\n\nIt is noticeable that government officials have started talking about \"all-cause mortality\" when asked about the growing number of deaths.\n\nThey mean that the best way to judge the rising death rate is to track whether the total number of people dying is above average levels to get an idea of the number of excess deaths being caused.\n\nBetween 1,000 and 2,000 people die every day normally. If you look at the current weekly figures, which again lag behind by a week or so, the number of deaths has started increasing more rapidly than is normal.\n\nThe week leading up to 10 April saw the highest number of deaths in England and Wales in a single week - 18,500 - for 20 years. A similar pattern has happened in Scotland and Northern Ireland.\n\nThat was enough to push the total number of deaths in 2020 above what you would normally expect at this time of year - a situation which is bound to get worse as the deaths in the past week or so are counted in the ONS data.\n\nWhat is not clear is what will happen over the course of the coming months.\n\nIt is possible, especially if the outbreak is brought under control, that the numbers dying could drop below average levels later in the year, thus reducing the level of excess deaths over time.\n\nThat is because there will be significant overlap between those at risk of dying with coronavirus and those at risk of dying anyway during the course of the year.\n\nThe risks are strikingly similar from the early 20s upwards - children are more at risk of dying from something else than if they are infected with the virus.\n\nThis does not mean the risk of death is doubled if you are infected, nor does it mean there is no extra risk.\n\nIt is also worth pointing out this is all based on those who are infected and show symptoms. There is evidence that significant numbers of people do not show symptoms, and therefore the overall risk of death from coronavirus may be even lower.\n\nGoing forward, what is crucial to help minimise extra deaths is to avoid a second peak after the lockdown is eased, and controlling outbreaks in care homes - unless a treatment or vaccine emerge.\n\nBut even that will not be enough. It is noticeable UK chief medical adviser Prof Chris Witty has talked often recently about \"indirect deaths\".\n\nThese are deaths not from coronavirus but related to the lockdown: people who cannot access care for other conditions, such as cancer, strokes or heart attacks, and those who take their own lives or suffer ill-health because of emotional struggles and the economic downturn.\n\nSteps will be needed to safeguard against these, and, therefore, it is perhaps unsurprising that Sir Patrick says it is difficult to speculate how many will eventually die.\n\nThere are two main factors determining the number of deaths at this stage of the coronavirus pandemic - the health service's ability to cope and the point at which lockdown started.\n\nIn terms of the NHS, the UK has coped well, relatively speaking. Health Secretary Matt Hancock has said anyone who has needed intensive care has got it.\n\nCurrently more than a quarter of intensive care beds are available, while there are about 15,000 free beds on wards.\n\nThe distressing scenes in Italy where hospitals became overwhelmed have not materialised here.\n\nBut on the lockdown, there are questions to be asked.\n\nThe lack of early testing may have masked how widespread the virus was in the UK, says University of Oxford's Prof James Naismith, which resulted in delays announcing the lockdown.\n\nEven a few days can have a \"huge impact\" on future cases and deaths, he says.",

So what does science say about easing lockdown rules?\n\nPrime Minister Boris Johnson has set out a provisional plan to start easing restrictions in England using \"baby steps\".\n\nChanges will be gradual to avoid the risk of a second peak of infections that could overwhelm the NHS.\n\nAnd he says the plan is conditional on infection and death rates staying low.\n\nAnd if there are any signs they are starting to rise, the brakes will go back on.\n\nThis is some of the thinking behind this week's main announcements.\n\nOne of the key questions arising from the new guidance is why it's being suggested young children should return to school from the beginning of June.\n\nReception, Year 1 and Year 6 children would be the first to return.\n\nAs well as having particular educational needs, it is suggested:\n\nYoung children are considered a high risk group when it comes to flu.\n\nBut they appear to be at low risk of becoming very ill with Covid-19.\n\nExperts do not know, however, to what extent they can carry coronavirus and spread the disease to adults and each other.\n\nAnd starting the return to school with only some year groups will allow them to assess the impact on infection rates.\n\nYounger pupils may find it more difficult to use face coverings, which are not being recommended for children, and follow social-distancing rules, however.\n\nSo the focus will be on handwashing and other hygiene measures.\n\nIn theory, meeting two or more people at a time from the same household should result in a roughly similar risk of infection as meeting just one.\n\nBut Health Secretary Matt Hancock told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the one-person rule would keep gatherings of people from different households small, making it easier to stick to the overarching principle of staying 2m (more than 6ft) apart.\n\nSomewhere between 1-2m is generally accepted around the world as the distance within which there is most risk of inhaling droplets from another person's coughs and sneezes.\n\nThe best evidence suggests coronavirus is most commonly spread by these droplets entering through the eyes, nose and mouth, either directly or after touching a contaminated object.\n\nBut there is some evidence the virus can form aerosols, clouds of lighter particles that hang around in the air for longer, particularly in hospitals during procedures such as intubation.\n\nActivities such as golf and tennis will be permitted but only alone or with one other person.\n\nAnd playgrounds and outdoor gyms, where there is a higher risk of close contact and touching surfaces, will remain shut.\n\nOnce expelled, droplets fall relatively quickly to the ground.\n\nBut indoor environments have more surfaces for them to land on that others could then touch - and less ventilation.\n\nAnd independent scientific advisers say the risk of infection is significantly lower outside.\n\nAs more people go back to work, buses, Tubes and trains will become busier.\n\nAnd the government is now advising people to wear a face covering when they come into contact with others they do not normally meet, in enclosed spaces where social distancing is not always possible - for example, on public transport or in some shops.\n\nThe science behind the advice is somewhat patchy and controversial.\n\nBut there is some evidence face coverings might help stop people who are contagious but have no symptoms from unknowingly spreading the virus.\n\nOne of the five tests the government says must be met before lockdown can be substantially eased is the rate of infection decreases to \"manageable levels\".\n\nThe reproduction (R) number - how many people each infected person passes their illness on to - needs to be well below one.\n\nAt the moment, the R number across the UK is estimated to be between 0.5 and one.\n\nBut it is thought to be higher in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.\n\nSo there is less room for restrictions to be eased.\n\nEven within England there are differences.\n\nFor example, the R will be much higher in care homes and hospitals where there are more cases of the disease.\n\nOutside of those settings, the spread of coronavirus in the community appears to have been reduced, potentially to below epidemic levels, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS).\n\nIt estimates 0.24% of people in the general community - about 136,000 people - are currently infected with coronavirus, based on testing a representative sample of more than 7,000 people in England between 26 April and 8 May.",

    "Drug has 'clear-cut' power to fight coronavirus": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "There is \"clear-cut\" evidence that a drug can help people recover from the coronavirus, say US officials.\n\nRemdesivir cut the duration of symptoms from 15 days down to 11 in clinical trial at hospitals around the world.\n\nThe full details have not been published, but experts said it would be a \"fantastic result\" if confirmed, but not a \"magic bullet\" for the disease.\n\nA drug would have the potential to save lives, ease pressure on hospitals and allow parts of lockdown to be lifted.\n\nRemdesivir was originally developed as an Ebola treatment. It is an antiviral and works by attacking an enzyme that a virus needs in order to replicate inside our cells.\n\nThe trial was run by the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) and 1,063 people took part. Some patients were given the drug while others received a placebo (dummy) treatment.\n\nDr Anthony Fauci who runs the NIAID said: \"The data shows remdesivir has a clear-cut, significant, positive effect in diminishing the time to recovery.\"\n\nHe said the results prove \"a drug can block this virus\" and were \"opening the door to the fact that we now have the capability of treating\" patients.\n\nThe impact on deaths is not as clear cut. The mortality rate was 8% in people given remdesivir and 11.6% in those given a placebo, but this result was not statistically significant, meaning scientists cannot tell if the difference is real.\n\nIt is also not clear who is benefiting. Is it allowing people who would have recovered anyway to do so more quickly? Or is it preventing people from needing treatment in intensive care? Did the drug work better in younger or older people? Or those with or without other diseases? Do patients have to be treated early when the virus is thought to peak in the body?\n\nThese will be important questions when the full details are eventually published, as a drug could have the twin benefit of saving lives and helping to lift lockdown.\n\nProf Mahesh Parmar, the director of the MRC Clinical Trials Unit at UCL, who has overseen the trial in the EU, said: \"Before this drug can be made more widely available, a number of things need to happen: the data and results need to be reviewed by the regulators to assess whether the drug can be licensed and then they need assessment by the relevant health authorities in various countries.\n\n\"While this is happening we will obtain more and longer term data from this trial, and other ones, on whether the drug also prevents deaths from Covid-19.\"\n\nIf a medicine can stop people needing intensive care then the risk of hospitals being overwhelmed is smaller, and there is less need for social distancing.\n\nProf Peter Horby, from the University of Oxford, is running the world's largest trial of Covid-19 drugs. He said: \"We need to see the full results, but if confirmed this would be a fantastic result and great news for the fight against Covid-19.\n\n\"The next steps are to get the full data out and work on equitable access to remdesivir.\"\n\nThe US data on remdesivir has come out at the same time as a trial of the same drug in China, reported in the Lancet medical journal, showed it was ineffective.\n\nHowever, that trial was incomplete because the success of lockdown in Wuhan meant doctors ran out of patients.\n\n\"These data are promising, and given that we have no proven treatments yet for Covid, it may well lead to fast-track approval of remdesivir for treatment of Covid,\" said Prof Babak Javid, a consultant in infectious diseases at Cambridge University Hospitals.\n\n\"However, it also shows that remdesivir is not a magic bullet in this context: the overall benefit in survival was 30%.\"\n\nOther drugs being investigated for Covid-19 include those for malaria and HIV which can attack the virus as well as compounds that can calm the immune system.\n\nIt is thought the anti-virals may be more effective in the early stages, and the immune drugs later in the disease.",

        "body": "Elite athletes will now be able to return to group training, provided social distancing is maintained and safety requirements met, in what the government has called a \"milestone\" on the road to sport's return.\n\nNo contact between athletes will be permitted at this stage, venues will need deep-cleaning and training equipment will need to be \"suitably cleaned and disinfected\".\n\nGuidance on the steps required for training to take place amid the current phase of the coronavirus pandemic was developed with input from Olympic and Paralympic sports, professional sports and athletes, and has been published by the government.\n\nIt says athletes and support staff must actively \"opt in\" before returning to training, and screening for coronavirus will involve temperature checks as a minimum.\n\nIf athletes opt out at any time, the guidance says they must be able to do so \"without unreasonable steps being taken against them consequently\".\n\nThe next phase will involve some \"social clustering\" within training, with athletes able to engage in contact such as \"close quarters coaching, combat sports sparring, teams sports tackling, equipment sharing\".\n\nHowever, the protocols for this stage have not yet been finalised and will need government approval.\n\nThe guidance comes as the Premier League begins consultations with players, managers, the Professional Footballers' Association and the League Managers' Association before a planned resumption in training next week.\n\nHowever, the Rugby Football Union responded by saying the announcement was \"welcome\" but that there was \"significant work to do before any kind of training can resume\" in rugby's Premiership.\n\nUK Sport developed the guidance with the government and representatives of professional sports.\n\nIts chief executive Sally Munday says the organisation \"fully expects different sports will return to training at different times\" and urged sports to ensure the welfare of athletes and staff was their \"number one priority\".\n\nShe added there would be some people with \"genuine concerns or personal circumstances that make this challenging\".\n\nCulture secretary Oliver Dowden said: \"I know our sports stars are keen to get back to training and this guidance will enable them to do so in a safe way. Our top priority is protecting the health of athletes, coaches and support staff.\n\n\"Enabling athletes to get match-fit is an important milestone towards restarting competitive sport behind closed doors - but we have not given a green light yet. We are clear that this can only happen on the advice of medical experts and when it is safe to do so.\"\n\nThe risk assessments that sports and independent venues will need to carry out include \"outlining how regular screening for Covid-19 symptoms will take place before each entry to the training environment\". Screening should include a questionnaire and temperature check as a minimum, the guidance adds.\n\nIt also says providers must outline \"how equipment being brought into the training venue will be suitably cleaned and disinfected\".\n\nVenues must also be \"deep cleaned\" before training can start.\n\nMunday said: \"We are asking all sports to work through the guidance carefully, to give confidence to both athletes and support staff that they can 'opt in' to any return to training safely.\n\n\"Ultimately the decision on when to return to organised training must be taken by each sport, in conjunction with relevant training facility providers, understanding all of the complexities and intricacies of individual sports.\"",

    "First workers to trial NHS virus tracing app": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "An NHS app which aims to track the spread of coronavirus will be rolled out for the first time today, as part of a trial on the Isle of Wight.\n\nCouncil and healthcare workers will be the first to try the contact-tracing app, with the rest of the island able to download it from Thursday.\n\nIf the trial is successful, it could be available nationwide within weeks.\n\nConcerns have been raised over privacy, though ministers say the app has been designed with this \"front of mind\".\n\nThe app aims to quickly trace recent contacts of anyone who tests positive for the virus.\n\nIt is part of the government's strategy for coming out of lockdown, which aims to have widespread testing and contact tracing in place to monitor and reduce any future outbreaks.\n\nIf the trial is successful, the app will be rolled out across the whole of the UK by the middle of May, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said.\n\nThe new app - published on Apple and Google's app stores - works by using a Bluetooth connection.\n\nIt records when two people who have the app are within a certain distance of each other for longer than a specified amount of time.\n\nIf one of those people later reports having symptoms, all the other app users they came into contact with over the last seven days will be alerted and told to self-isolate.\n\nMr Hancock urged everyone on the Isle of Wight to download the app when it was available to them. Social distancing rules would still be in place during the trial, he said.\n\n\"By downloading the app, you are protecting your own health, you are protecting the health of your loved ones and the health of your community,\" he said.\n\n\"Where the Isle of Wight goes, Britain follows.\"\n\nThe island was chosen for the trial because it has a lower number of new infections, is covered by a single NHS trust and because travel to and from the island is quite restricted.\n\nIt comes as the the number of coronavirus-related deaths in the UK reached 28,734, an increase of 288.\n\nThe daily increase in deaths is lower than at any point since the end of March, but the figures reported at the weekend tend to be lower and are expected to rise, Mr Hancock said.\n\nThe type of approach used to design the app has raised some privacy concerns.\n\nThe app has been designed with a \"centralised\" approach, meaning there is a central computer which works out which phones have matched and should receive an alert.\n\nThis is different to the \"decentralised\" model used by Apple and Google, where the matches take place on users' handsets.\n\nSome have argued a \"centralised\" approach gives the app advantages, for example by being able to spot hotspots where the disease is spreading. But others say a central system increases the risk from potential hackers.\n\nThe UK's data privacy watchdog, the Information Commissioner's Office, said \"as a general rule, a decentralised approach\" would be more in keeping with its principle that organisations should minimise the amount of personal data they collect.\n\n\"But that does not in any way mean that a centralised system can't have the same kind of privacy and security protections,\" said Information Commissioner Elizabeth Denham on Monday.\n\nAt a virtual meeting on Monday, Parliament's Human Rights Committee also discussed privacy fears. Law professor Orla Lynskey said the option on the app for users to opt in and share their location data \"poses a big risk\".\n\nBut NHSX - the part of the health service that developed the app - said the app will be voluntary, and the only personal data stored by the app at the start would be the first part of the user's postcode.\n\nAdditional location data will only be recorded if users agree to a further opt-in request, NHSX added.\n\nNHSX chief executive Matthew Gould said: \"The app is designed so you don't have to give it your personal details to use it - it does ask for the first half of your postcode but only that.\n\n\"You can use it without giving any other personal details at all - it doesn't know who you are, it doesn't know who you've been near, it doesn't know where you've been.\"\n\nMr Hancock said the software was \"designed with privacy and security front of mind\". He said the data was stored on the phone and only sent to the NHS when someone needs a test.\n\nThe UK's \"test, track and trace\" strategy has seen testing be scaled up over the last month, following Mr Hancock's pledge to reach 100,000 tests by the end of April. The UK passed the target, providing more than 122,000 tests on the last day of April. Latest figures show there were 85,186 tests on Sunday.\n\nTo track the virus and study how the virus spreads through the population, 20,000 households will be recruited at random and routinely tested over 12 months.\n\nIt comes after draft government plans for getting people back to work during the coronavirus pandemic were leaked. It urges employers to stagger shift times and maximise home-working.\n\nTrade unions warned the guidance could compromise workers' safety and asked for stricter rules for businesses.\n\nIn other developments:\n\nHow have you been affected by coronavirus?

    "Five and overs in UK now eligible for virus test": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "Everyone aged five and over in the UK with symptoms can now be tested for coronavirus, Health Secretary Matt Hancock has announced.\n\nHe was speaking in Parliament after the loss of taste or smell was added to the list of Covid-19 symptoms, alongside a fever and a new persistent cough.\n\nMr Hancock said the government was \"expanding eligibility for testing further than ever before\".\n\nHe added 100,678 tests had been conducted on Sunday.\n\nTesting in England and Scotland has been limited to people with symptoms who are key workers and their families, hospital patients, care home residents, over-65s and those who need to leave home to work.\n\nIn Wales and Northern Ireland it was just key workers, hospital workers and care home residents.\n\nA further 160 coronavirus deaths have been recorded in the UK as of 17:00 BST on Sunday taking the total to 34,796 - the highest figure in Europe.\n\nMr Hancock said 21,000 people had been recruited to conduct contact-tracing in England, including 7,500 healthcare workers.\n\nThis is when people who have come into contact with someone with the virus are tracked down and potentially asked to self-isolate.\n\nThe new recruits will be trained to identify people and advise them on whether to isolate.\n\nThe health secretary said: \"Over the past seven weeks this country has taken a small specialised diagnostics industry and scaled it at breathtaking pace into a global champion.\"\n\nShadow health and social care secretary Jonathan Ashworth pressed the government on the time taken for results to be received on whether someone had Covid-19 or not.\n\nHe also asked if facilities could be set up in order to allow poorer people to be able to self-isolate if they are required to do so and whether those in insecure work would be guaranteed sick pay if they were asked to isolate.\n\nThe expansion of the testing programme may grab the headlines.\n\nIt is a significant milestone - in less than two months the UK has gone from only being able to test hospital patients and health and care staff to offering it more or less population-wide.\n\nBut it should not mask the difficulties that remain getting the test, track and trace system up-and-running.\n\nThis will be essential to contain local outbreaks as we ease ourselves out of lockdown.\n\nTests are still taking too long to turnaround for some - significant numbers are thought to be waiting several days - while the piloting of the tracking app on the Isle of Wight is not yet finished.\n\nOne particular concern is that the app does not yet let users know if the person they have had contact with ends up testing positive. Instead, it has only let them know if the contact has developed symptoms.\n\nThat is a major problem. It means people have been left in limbo and incorporating that feature into the app will be important.\n\nProgress is being made, but getting a workable and efficient system in place soon is still a monumental challenge.\n\nThe prime minister has set a target for a daily capacity of 200,000 by the end of the month and last week the UK had reached a capacity of 150,000 a day.\n\nSo far the most tests done in a day is 136,000, on Friday, but this included kits posted out and not necessarily returned.\n\nMr Hancock also said the government is in the \"closing stages\" of negotiations to purchase new Covid-19 antibody tests.\n\nA test developed by Swiss pharmaceutical company Roche was approved for use by Public Health England last week.\n\nTesting eligibility, like lockdown measures, is devolved for individual nations to set their own rules. Mr Hancock made his announcement on the extension of testing across the UK after all four nations agreed to the change.\n\nEarlier, Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon announced the extension of testing there as she revealed lockdown measures would be eased from 28 May.\n\nMeanwhile, Northern Ireland has also announced an easing of lockdown including new rules to allow groups of four to six people who do not share a household to meet outdoors.",

The A35 between Bere Regis and Morden Park Corner has also been shut and motorists have been advised to check their route to work on Tuesday morning.\n\nCraig Baker of DWFRS said it remained a \"significant fire\" and fire fighters would continue to tackle it through the night.\n\n\"It was a wind-driven fire that was roaring across the health land, so we asked for 25 engines and other support vehicles that can get into the real centre of the fire where we need it to.\n\n\"We had other difficulties to deal with - a major National Grid power line runs right through the area so we've had to take necessary precautions as a result.\"\n\nThe cause of the fire will be investigated.\n\nEarlier this week the fire service issued an alert for Dorset, with easterly winds, low humidity and dry heath land increasing the risk of wildfires.\n\nBy Mike Apps, BBC South reporter\n\nTravelling towards Wareham Forest, we could see smoke filling the sky.\n\nI counted seven sources of smoke sending vast plumes for miles across the Dorset countryside.\n\nThis is a huge fire and firefighters are facing a long operation tonight - one of the challenges is the strong winds fanning the flames and smoke is being sent towards the conurbations of Bournemouth and Poole.\n\nThere are now multiple road closures in place as police try to keep people away from the scene of the fire.",

    "France mandates masks for schools and transport": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "France will make face masks compulsory on public transport and in secondary schools when it starts easing its coronavirus lockdown on 11 May, Prime Minister Edouard Philippe has said.\n\nSchools will reopen gradually, starting with kindergartens and primary schools.\n\nPupils aged 11-15 will be expected to wear face masks.\n\nIt comes as hard-hit Spain also outlined its lockdown exit plan, aiming for what its prime minister called \"a new normality\" by the end of June.\n\nNon-essential shops and markets will open their doors again from 11 May, but not bars and restaurants.\n\nStores will have the right to ask shoppers to wear masks, and should ensure they remain a metre (3ft) apart, the prime minister said.\n\nIn a relief to many, the French will be able to go outside again without a certificate confirming their intentions, and public gatherings of up to 10 people will be allowed. Cr\u00e8ches will also reopen - but with a maximum of 10 children in each group.\n\nFrance has suffered one of the highest Covid-19 death rates in Europe, along with the UK, Italy and Spain.\n\nOn Tuesday the number of people who have died with the virus rose by 367 to 23,660, the country's health ministry said. Some 129,859 people have been infected.\n\nHospital admissions and the number of patients in intensive care have been falling, however, giving cause for cautious optimism.\n\nAddressing parliament, Mr Philippe said the lockdown had saved an estimated 62,000 lives in France in a month, but that it was time to ease measures to avoid an economic collapse.\n\n\"We will have to learn to live with the virus,\" he said, until a vaccine or effective treatment is available.\n\nHe summed up France's priorities as \"protect, test, isolate\".\n\nParliament backed his proposals after a debate by a large majority. Only 75 of almost 600 French MPs were allowed into the chamber for reasons of social distancing, with others voting by proxy.\n\nMr Philippe stressed that France must take strict precautions to avoid a second wave of coronavirus infections.\n\n\"The risk of a second wave, which would strike a weakened hospital fabric, which would impose a 're-confinement', which would ruin the efforts and sacrifices made during these eight weeks, is a serious risk,\" he said.\n\nThe lockdown will not be eased on 11 May if new cases don't stay below 3,000 a day, he added.\n\nFrance has seen about 2,162 new cases a day on average over the past two weeks.\n\nThe government has set a target to carry out at least 700,000 coronavirus tests per week from 11 May, the prime minister said, and will cover the cost of testing.\n\n\"Once a person has tested positive, we will begin to identify and test all those, symptomatic or not, who have had close contact with them. All these contact cases will be tested and will be asked to isolate themselves,\" he said.\n\nMr Philippe said that where possible, people should keep working from home beyond 11 May.\n\nAs the prime minister said, never in history - not in war, occupation or disease - has France had to confront such massive disruption. And now from the best fonctionnaire brains in the land comes an exit strategy that might just measure up to the disaster.\n\nAs ever in hyper-rational France, the plan is built round numbers, categories and systems.\n\nThe key figure is 3,000. That is what the government reckons will be the number of daily infections in the weeks ahead. By setting up local \"brigades\" of investigators to track the trail of infection, they reckon they will test 20 contacts per infection - so 420,000 tests a week, which is well within planned capacity.\n\nThose found to have the virus will be expected to self-isolate, either at home with their families or in requisitioned hotels. And as for the rest of the population, life will very gradually resume.\n\nProtection, testing, isolation. That is the system. Which is itself then conditioned by three imperatives: acceptance of the enduring nature of the virus, progressive implementation, and regional adaptation.\n\nIt always sounds a mouthful when a French technocrat expounds on a plan. But sometimes it may be exactly what the country needs.\n\nAddressing the shortage of masks in France, Mr Philippe said they would be widely available by 11 May. He called on all companies to provide staff with masks, and said the government would help small firms if necessary.\n\nMasks will also be sold on the website of the French post office, and five million washable masks will be set aside each week for the most vulnerable.\n\nFrom 11 May everyone using public transport, including trams, trains or the metro, will have to wear a face mask.\n\nIt comes after Germany made wearing cloth masks compulsory on public transport, and in shops in some regions.\n\nIn schools, France's kindergarteners will not be expected to wear masks unless they start showing symptoms during the school day. Middle school children (aged 11-15) will be expected to, however, and the government will make masks available for students who can't access them.\n\nClasses will be no larger than 15 students, the prime minister said.\n\nElementary schools will begin opening from 11 May. Middle schools in districts with milder outbreaks may be allowed to reopen from 18 May, and high schools at the end of the month.\n\nThe prime minister noted that some parts of the country had suffered worse outbreaks than others, and said mayors and local authorities would be allowed to adapt the government's strategy to their locality.\n\nThe framework to decide which areas need a stricter form of lockdown easing will be fixed on 7 May, he said.\n\nSome areas will be categorised as \"green\" and others as \"red\", depending on their tally of new cases, testing capacity, and the pressure on local hospitals.\n\nNationwide restrictions that will remain in place include:",

People are looking to buy them, but the most related search is what to write in them. You imagine it may be people who have never had to send one before. My heart goes out to them.\"\n\nAnd on a lighter note, there's one question which pops up on Nalina's charts every Friday.\n\n\"'What time can you buy alcohol in Scotland?' is a regular Friday search. We all need to mark the weekend somehow.\"\n\n(It's between 10am and 10pm - you're welcome).\n\nRedbrain is an e-commerce platform. The firm has access to the data of millions of shopping searches and how they translate into sales.\n\nThe UK's top shopping searches during the months of March and April included free weights, lawn mowers, plants, seeds and hair dye.\n\nIn March, Redbrain recorded more than 2.1m searches for free weights, up nearly 4,000% from February's activity. There were over a million more again in April.\n\nThere were also one or two noticeable short-lived trends: in March by far the most sought-after item was toilet roll with nearly five million searches... and in April there were 2.1 million searches for women's lingerie.\n\n\"It's easy to think the world has stopped and life is put on hold but our data tells a different story,\" said Redbrain's chief growth officer Alistair Campbell.\n\n\"We are all going through similar experiences and buying lots of the same things, at the same times.\n\n\"Is the nation settling down into the new 'normal'? It's hard to tell at the moment but the insights into purchasing and volumes certainly show that online retail is evolving and healthy.\"\n\nThe rocketing of internet use during lockdown has been \"incredible\" to observe, said John Graham-Cumming, chief technology officer of website security company Cloudflare.\n\n\"There's a natural growth that you would expect to see over time - as internet connections into people's homes improve, people do more stuff online.\n\n\"But in 2020 we saw one year of growth in three months.\"\n\nBut not everyone is using the net to find out how to fix their hair - Cloudflare has noticed that part of that \"growth\" has been an increase in low-level cyber-crime.\n\nThis is commonly in the form of small-scale distributed denial-of-service (DDOS) attacks - when a website is flooded with internet traffic to try to knock it offline.\n\n\"It's vandalism-type stuff,\" said Mr Graham-Cumming. \"It's often done by students - we typically see an increase in these attacks during university vacation time.\"",

        "body": "When you're suddenly tasked with co-ordinating emergency food parcel deliveries to vulnerable local people during a pandemic, the ability to think creatively comes in useful.\n\nAs artistic director of one of the UK's most innovative theatre companies, Alan Lane is used to coming up with imaginative solutions.\n\nBut they normally involve finding ways to stage epic community theatre shows, not making sure hundreds of people have the food and medicines they need in a lockdown.\n\n\"Today we find ourselves with a Transit van full of crisps,\" he says on the phone from Leeds. \"Which is amazing.\n\n\"But yesterday we didn't have any vegetables. And tomorrow we're not going to have any eggs.\n\n\"So constantly I'm on the phone doing deals. The other day, I swapped a load of tote bags that I got from the university for some face masks, which I split in half and swapped the other half for a lot of cream.\n\n\"It's constant creative thinking, constant problem solving.\"\n\nSix weeks ago, Lane and his company Slung Low were asked by Leeds City Council to co-ordinate the community response in Holbeck and Beeston, meaning any requests for help from the 10,000 households in the area have been passed to them.\n\nThey are mainly from people needing food, but prescriptions need dropping off too, and they are often asked to just phone lonely people for a chat.\n\nLane is in charge of around 90 volunteers, including some from the region's other arts organisations - from Opera North and Yorkshire Sculpture Park to theatre company Red Ladder. Bafta-winning TV writer and producer Mark Catley is driving a van two days a week.\n\nManaging them is not the only new role Lane has taken on during the pandemic. When not scrounging and delivering food, he has become a game show host, and a very entertaining one at that - appearing online every fortnight from Slung Low's HQ to keep locals' spirits up.\n\nHe says that makes Slung Low the only people in the UK to be putting on regular live performances from a theatre stage during the lockdown.\n\nOn top of that, he has launched an open-air art gallery, posting residents' lockdown pictures on lampposts. And Slung Low has just made a short film - shot before coronavirus rewrote Lane's job description - which went online on Friday.\n\n\"We didn't know this at the time, but having a short film to release at the moment is much better than having a play,\" he says.\n\nExcept - he will be taking an enforced break from all that frenetic activity for a while. When we spoke on Tuesday, he had just been for a Covid-19 test. It came back negative, but he has symptoms so is isolating and recovering. Others have stepped in to ensure Slung Low's work goes on.\n\nIn truth, it has never been a conventional theatre company.\n\nIt made its name by staging big outdoor plays using professional actors and local volunteers, but in 2018 opened a cultural community college on a double decker bus, and in 2019 took over the UK's oldest working men's club.\n\nIt still runs the Holbeck as a working men's club - or did before the lockdown. In normal times, the function room hosts gatherings ranging from majorette award ceremonies to African funeral wakes as well as Slung Low's experimental theatre and cabarets.\n\n\"Everybody turns up to the cabaret,\" Lane says. \"It's proper old-fashioned fun, and we serve dinner in the middle, and they normally go on for too long, and the band plays out, and everyone staggers out drunk.\"\n\nWhen lockdown put paid to that, he decided to do an online version and came up with You Can Bet!, a game show that sees him don a tuxedo and bow tie to do silly challenges.\n\nViewers can phone in and gamble on whether he can jump over an ironing board without touching it, or beat his four-year-old son in an obstacle course while dressed as a dinosaur.\n\nIn fact, young David is the real star of the show. And yes, it is just a bit inspired by 1980s and 90s game show You Bet! - whose former host Matthew Kelly sent a tongue-in-cheek message for their first episode.\n\n\"The vast majority of our members are absolutely right in the middle of that crisis group that you really don't want leaving the house,\" Lane says.\n\n\"But it's been a long month for them now. So for half an hour a week, they get to tune in and roll their eyes at how silly we are.\"\n\nYou Can Bet! is very different from the short film Slung Low has just put online, The Good Book, which is set in Leeds at the start of a future civil war. It features dozens of locals alongside professional actors like Fleabag's Angus Imrie, and is the first work from Slung Low offshoot Leeds People's Theatre.\n\n\"We realised that in order to be in a Slung Low [theatre] show, you have to give up three evenings and every weekend for three months. And that means that only certain types of people can be in those shows,\" Lane says.\n\n\"Whereas being in a film, some people only gave up one weekend, and they still got to have a really rich experience.\"\n\nThe connection with the local community is what sets Slung Low apart from other theatre companies and means it can adapt to doing things like delivering food during a crisis, Lane says.\n\nOther venues have been busy putting their shows online and continuing their education and outreach activities digitally, but Lane thinks they could be doing more with their facilities.\n\n\"There are a lot of vans currently sat in the car parks of arts organisations because they couldn't quite work out the insurance to get them doing food bank work,\" he says.\n\nHe adds: \"We spend a lot of time talking about what we're for at Slung Low. What we're for is not putting on a show for people to pay for tickets.\n\n\"It's something we do quite a bit, and something that we can be quite good at on a good day. But it's not what we're for. And therefore, when you can't do that, it doesn't mean we stop.\"",

    "German coronavirus app takes different path to NHS": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "Germany's forthcoming coronavirus contact-tracing app will trigger alerts only if users test positive for Covid-19.\n\nThat puts it at odds with the NHS app, which instead relies on users self-diagnosing via an on-screen questionnaire.\n\nUK health chiefs have said the questionnaire is a key reason they are pursuing a \"centralised\" design despite privacy campaigners' protests.\n\nGermany ditched that model in April.\n\nAnd on Wednesday Chancellor Angela Merkel said there would be a \"much higher level of acceptance\" for a decentralised approach, which is designed to offer a higher degree of anonymity.\n\nAutomated contact tracing uses smartphones to register when their owners are in close proximity for significant amounts of time.\n\nIf someone is later found to have the virus, a warning can be sent to others they may have infected, telling them to get tested themselves and possibly go into quarantine.\n\nIn the centralised model, the contact-matching happens on a remote computer server.\n\nAnd the UK's National Cyber Security Centre has said this will enable it to catch attackers trying to abuse the self-diagnosis system.\n\nBy contrast, the decentralised version carries out the process on the phones themselves.\n\nAnd there is no central database that could be used to re-identify individuals and reveal with whom they had had spent time.\n\nBBC News technology correspondent Rory Cellan-Jones said: \"The NHS is taking a big gamble in choosing to alert app users when they have been in contact with someone who has merely reported symptoms.\n\n\"It could make the app fast and effective - or it could mean users become exasperated by a blizzard of false alarms.\"\n\nMs Merkel said SAP and Deutsche Telekom - which are co-developing Germany's app - were waiting for Google and Apple to release a software interface before they could complete their work.\n\nAnd BBC News has learned the two US technology companies plan to release the finished version of their API (application programming interface) as soon as Thursday.\n\nDetails of Germany's Corona-Warn-App published on the code-sharing site Github say it depends solely on medical test results to \"avoid misuse\".\n\nThose who test positive will be given a verification code that must be entered into the app before it anonymously flags them as being a risk to others.\n\nGermany has led the way in testing in Europe and currently has capacity to analyse about 838,000 samples per week.\n\nThe UK is catching up - but scientists advising the NHS say they can save more lives by also drawing on self-diagnosis data.\n\n\"Speed is of the essence,\" Prof Christophe Fraser, of the Oxford Big Data Institute, said last week.\n\nIt can take several days to obtain Covid-19 test results.\n\nAnd self-reported symptoms can be acted on instantly.\n\nBut an ethics advisory board advising Health Secretary Matt Hancock on the app has warned too many resulting \"false positive alerts could undermine trust in the app and cause undue stress to users\".\n\nThe NHS is currently trialling its app on the Isle of Wight.\n\nThere have been reports of some suspected false alerts.\n\nBut a Department of Health spokeswoman said this had been expected.\n\n\"In a matter of days, more than 50,000 people have downloaded the app with overwhelmingly positive feedback,\" she told BBC News.\n\n\"But as with all new technologies, there will be issues that need to be resolved in how it works, which is why it is being trialled before a national rollout.\"\n\nThe NHS is also exploring use of the Apple-Google API, which would entail a switch to the decentralised model.\n\nBut it intends to offer users the centralised version first, unless plans to complete the rollout within a fortnight go awry.\n\nOne sticking point could be calls for limits on how the data is used - possibly requiring a new law.\n\nThat would avoid the risk of a repeat of the situation in Norway, where the local data protection watchdog has accused the country's health authority of failing to carry out a proper risk assessment of a centralised contact-tracing app.",

This will be extended to 20 kilometres on 8 June, with visitors possibly allowed from 29 June.\n\nThe third phase may see open competitions return on 29 June while booking tee times for all five phases must be done in advance online or by telephone.\n\nClubhouses will remain closed with pro-shops opening for check-ins, while locker rooms will reopen for retrieval of golf equipment. Toilet facilities will also reopen.\n\nThe Unions stressed that the onus is on golfers to demonstrate that golf can return in a \"safe, socially distant manner\" while admitting that the sport is in a \"very privileged position to be allowed to return at this stage.\"\n\nThey also urged people who are displaying Covid-19 symptoms to stay away from the golf course and clubhouse.\n\n\"All clubs, golfers and staff have a shared responsibility to ensure the protocol is adhered to,\" read the statement.\n\n\"We ask that clubs pledge their commitment to implementing the protocol by signing up using the link sent by email to the club.\n\n\"We are aware that there are several other unofficial guidelines in circulation. These documents have not been reviewed by the relevant government departments and state agencies. Therefore, golf clubs and golfers must exclusively adhere to the protocol as published by the GUI and ILGU.\n\n\"The ongoing Covid-19 public health emergency remains our primary concern and overriding priority. The Unions acknowledge the tremendous efforts of all frontline workers which has allowed golf and society in general to consider this gradual return to normal life.\"",

The overall mortality rate in London has been almost double that of the next highest region.\n\nThe data also shows the Covid-19 mortality rate in the most deprived areas of England has been higher among men, with 76.7 deaths per 100,000 people, compared with 39.6 per 100,000 women.\n\n\"General mortality rates are normally higher in more deprived areas, but so far Covid-19 appears to be taking them higher still,\" said Nick Stripe, ONS head of health analysis.\n\nShadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said the report showed the virus thrived on inequality.\n\n\"Ministers must target health inequalities with an overarching strategy to tackle the wider social determinants of ill-health,\" he said.\n\nThe ONS used the Index of Multiple Deprivation, a relative measure of poverty last updated in 2019.\n\nThe index takes into account factors such as an area's income, employment, crime and health deprivation and disability.\n\nThe ONS studied the 20,283 deaths involving Covid-19 that took place between 1 March and 17 April. In England, it found the mortality rate in the most deprived areas was 55.1 deaths per 100,000 population, while the rate was 25.3 deaths per 100,000 in the least deprived areas.\n\nIn Wales, statisticians found the most deprived fifth of areas had a mortality rate of 44.6 deaths per 100,000 population, almost twice as high as the rate for the least deprived areas of 23.2 deaths per 100,000.\n\nIt also found:\n\nDavid Finch, a senior fellow at the Health Foundation, said people in deprived areas were at higher risk of exposure to Covid-19 because they were likely to live in cramped housing conditions.\n\nHe said those people were also more likely to have one or more long-term health condition, meaning they would be at greater risk of suffering severe symptoms from the virus if exposed.\n\nChief executive of children's charity Barnardo's Javed Khan said the ONS study was \"worrying\" but \"unfortunately not surprising\".\n\n\"Vulnerable children and families - and those already experiencing disadvantage - risk becoming the forgotten victims,\" he added.\n\n\"Without intervention, this crisis will be devastating for a whole generation - their mental health, safety, education and job prospects are on the line.\"\n\nThe ONS analysis comes as a separate study from the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) says coronavirus patients from black African backgrounds in England and Wales are dying at more than triple the rate of white Britons.\n\nThe IFS said a higher proportion of people from ethnic minority backgrounds lived in areas hit harder by Covid-19.",

        "authors": [],
        "body": "More than 100 healthy babies have been born to mothers infected with the novel coronavirus in one hospital in India's western city of Mumbai.\n\nThree of the 115 babies born to infected mothers at the Lokmanya Tilak Municipal General Hospital in the past month initially tested positive for Covid-19, but subsequent tests cleared them, doctors said.\n\nTwo other infected pregnant women died at the hospital, including one who died before her baby was born.\n\nWith nearly 20,000 reported infections and more than 730 deaths so far, India's financial and entertainment capital has become the epicentre of Covid-19.\n\nMore than half of the babies born to infected women at the hospital - also called Sion Hospital - were delivered through C-section, while the rest were natural births, officials said. Fifty-six of them were boys, while 59 were girls. Twenty-two of these infected mothers were referred to from other hospitals: it is not clear whether the majority of these women contracted the infection at home, outdoors or in a hospital ward.\n\nA team of 65 doctors and two dozen nurses have been treating these Covid-infected mothers in a 40-bed special ward. With the surge of infections, the hospital is planning to add another 34 beds for infected pregnant patients.\n\nThe deliveries are happening on half a dozen tables in three operation theatres where doctors, and nurses and anaesthetists are using protective gear.\n\n\"We are fortunate that most of the women who have tested positive are showing no symptoms at all. Some of them had fever and reported breathlessness. We have treated them and sent them home after delivery,\" Dr Arun Nayak, head of gynaecology at the hospital, said.\n\n\"There is a lot of anxiety among the mothers. They keep telling us they might die but we have to make sure that the child is healthy.\"\n\nAfter giving birth, the mothers remain in the special ward for Covid-19 patients for a week and are administered hydroxychloroquine. After that they are quarantined up to 10 days in a separate centre. The babies are not isolated and are breastfed by mothers wearing facemasks.\n\nIn February, a Chinese newborn was diagnosed with the new coronavirus just 30 hours after birth in Wuhan, the epicentre of the virus.\n\nAnd in March, an infant who had tested positive for Covid-19 died in Chicago - the first known death of a child younger than a year infected with the virus in US. A six-week-old infant reportedly died of complications relating to Covid-19 in Connecticut. And earlier this month, a three-day-old baby died after his mother tested positive for the virus in Wales.\n\nMother to child transmission of the virus - in the womb or at the time of delivery, prior to contact of the infant with the mother's respiratory secretions - is rare, Dr Adam Ratner, the director of paediatric infectious diseases at New York University School of Medicine and Hassenfeld Children's Hospital at NYU Langone Health, told me.\n\nThis is, of course, with a caveat, he says, that \"this is a rapidly changing situation and new data may arise\".\n\nDr Ratner says there is some emerging data that suggests that the novel coronavirus can be detected in placental tissues.\n\nThere have also been reports of babies dying in the foetus in pregnant women with acute infection, he said, \"but that may be for reasons other than direct infection of the foetus\".\n\nDr Ratner said there has also been a report of \"antibody responses\" in newborns that could be \"consistent with infection in the womb or at delivery\". That would mean that the baby could have been infected in the womb.\n\n\"It is very important to continue to examine these questions and look at the outcomes of infants born to mothers with Covid-19, even if they are not infected in the womb,\" Dr Ratner said.\n\nDr Ratner said he had helped care for a number of infants born of infected mothers at his hospital.\n\n\"We have allowed feeding of expressed breast milk and we are trying to find arrangements to protect the infant from acquiring the virus in early life.\n\n\"The very young children that I have seen with the infection have generally done well,\" he said.\n\nAt the Mumbai hospital, the number of infants born to Covid-19 positive mothers have been a little more than 20% of the total babies born in the same period.\n\n\"The one time we felt really upset when a 28-year-old infected mother passed away last week after delivering a healthy boy. Her liver was failing and she was sinking fast,\" Dr Nayak told me.\n\n\"He realised how helpless we were during treatment. She kept asking, helplessly, 'Can anything be done?'\"",

        "body": "The Welsh Government has now joined a UK government portal for booking coronavirus tests - but the process remains different here.\n\nIf you think you need a test, there are different ways to do it - depending on whether you're a member of the public or a key worker.\n\nIf you have at least one symptom of Covid-19 - a new continuous cough, a fever, loss of smell or taste - you should be able to order a home test kit online.\n\nThe service has experienced high demand, however, and for long periods on Tuesday the option was unavailable.\n\nHealth and social care workers with symptoms are advised by the Welsh Government to speak to their employer for advice on how to get tested.\n\nOther \"critical workers\" with at least one symptom of Covid-19 can apply for a home test kit here.\n\nAlthough the public can receive a kit, critical workers are being prioritised.\n\nOr, critical workers can book a slot at a drive-through testing centre or mobile testing unit.\n\nTo do that, people need to contact their nearest centre. The centres and contact details for them are listed here. A list of professions deemed critical workers in Wales can be found here.\n\nUnlike in England, Scotland and Northern Ireland it is not possible to make a booking for a drive-through centre or a mobile unit via the UK online system.\n\nClicking on the Wales option on that page simply takes you to the Welsh Government website which advises you to contact your local test centre, as explained above.\n\nIt is expected to be more fully integrated later, but a date has not been given for when this will be in place.\n\nUnlike in England, Scotland and Northern Ireland, the general public are not currently able to book slots at drive-through test centres or mobile units.\n\nLast week, the Welsh Government said both critical workers and the general public will be able to use the UK-wide website to book tests at drive-through centres and mobile units \"soon.\"\n\nIt is also important to note that you need to take the test in the first five days of having symptoms.\n\nThe government advice is that it is best to apply for the test in the first three days as it may take \"one or two\" days to arrange.\n\nThis test simply looks for the presence of the virus. It does not tell you if you have ever had it.",

    "How does coronavirus contact tracing work?": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "Millions of people in the UK will soon be asked to track their movements to limit the spread of coronavirus.\n\nThe government is deploying 18,000 people to trace the contacts of those infected, and the wider public will be asked to get involved too.\n\nSo how does contact tracing work, do you have to take part - and what happens to your data?\n\nContact tracing is a method used to slow down the spread of infectious outbreaks. It is commonly used in sexual health clinics, when infected patients are told to contact anyone with whom they have been intimate.\n\nIn the coronavirus pandemic, it means tracking down anyone sufferers have been in prolonged contact with, to potentially ask them to self-isolate.\n\nThis is often done through phone calls to the friends and family of coronavirus sufferers, complemented by an automated location-tracking mobile app.\n\nContact tracing is already being used extensively by various countries hit by coronavirus, including Hong Kong, Singapore and Germany.\n\nThe UK is planning to roll out its contact tracing app and phone team by the middle of May, in the hope that weeks of social distancing will have made new outbreaks easier to track.\n\nThe 18,000-strong team will feature about 3,000 civil servants and health workers, and 15,000 call handlers. They will ask coronavirus patients about their recent movements, and then contact anyone with whom they have had extended contact.\n\nThis telephone system will be used in tandem with a tracing app, available to download on smartphones in the next few weeks.\n\nUsing Bluetooth, the free app tracks when its users come into contact with each other, automating the laborious contact tracing process. If a user develops coronavirus symptoms, it is up to them to let the app inform the NHS.\n\nTheir disclosure may trigger an anonymous alert to users with whom they recently had significant contact, again potentially asking those people to go into quarantine or be tested.\n\nFor those without smartphones, an alternative could be a Bluetooth-enabled wristband, like those being used in other countries to detect lockdown breaches.\n\nContact tracing has been credited with helping to lift restrictions in other countries, when combined with other measures.\n\nSouth Korea never went into lockdown thanks to an early strategy of extensive tracing, combined with mass testing.\n\nThe nation not only asked citizens to recall their movements, it used credit card transactions, CCTV footage and mobile phone tracking to piece together where they had been. After a daily peak of 900 cases, it is now diagnosing just a handful of new daily cases.\n\nIf adopted widely enough, contact tracing might help ease UK restrictions, although it is unlikely citizens will be tracked to that extent.\n\nThe UK government first attempted contact tracing early on in the outbreak, before there were too many cases for it to be effective.\n\nHowever, less movement under lockdown means new outbreaks should now be easier to track.\n\nPhone tracing can be very labour intensive and time consuming, with tracers in Ireland reporting making about 40 phone calls per infected person.\n\nThe mobile app is easier, but take-up will have to be colossal for the virus to be totally supressed. Academics advising the NHS estimate 80% of smartphone users - 60% of the population - would have to actively use it.\n\nBy comparison, about 67% of UK smartphone users have downloaded messaging app WhatsApp.\n\nPeople would also have to be honest about displaying any potential symptoms and inform the NHS.\n\nNot everyone is happy with the government and third parties being given access to people's data. Civil rights group Liberty said the government must take the risks seriously, and should not make installing the app a condition to leaving the lockdown or returning to work.\n\n''Millions of us are going to need to trust the app and follow the advice it provides,'' says NHSX, the digital development arm of the health service. It says the information gathered will only ever be used for health and research purposes, and that the app can be deleted at any time.\n\nThe UK app will use a centralised model, meaning the matching process will take place on a computer server.\n\nAn alternative, decentralised model was put forward by Apple and Google, where the exchange happens on people's handsets.\n\nThe tech giants say their version makes it harder for hackers or the authorities to use the computer server logs to track and identify specific individuals.\n\nBut NHSX says its centralised system will help give it more insight into how the disease spreads and help it to make the app more efficient.",

    "How furlough can you go?": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "It's proving quite easy to spend a gobsmacking amount of money to keep the economy from collapse.\n\nIt's more problematic to lend it by the tens of billions. It will almost certainly prove more difficult again to stop splashing government moola.\n\nApplying the brakes to the spending, while firing up the boilers on the battered British economy, is now where the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, has turned his attention.\n\nHe's looking at the bills for the Job Retention Scheme, or furloughing, which now covers nearly quarter of employed workers. That's 6.3 million pay packets the Treasury is having to flood, in reverse, through the PAYE system.\n\nThe number of self-employed people, on a different income support scheme, is yet to become clear. And 1.8 million more people have applied for Universal Credit since the health and economy crisis began.\n\nFurloughing is, by a long way, the element of support for both firms and individuals that has been most welcomed.\n\nBut it's still got problems and holes in it. The Scottish Tourism Alliance has just published a survey showing half of its respondents are using it, and only 22% of firms in the sector say it works well for them.\n\nYet however critical they are of the dates for qualifying or any complexity in admin, they know there would and will be a lot of pain without it.\n\nAsked last month, and looking to the removal of furlough payments, the tourism survey by TRKR found 47% of firms won't be able to employ any staff at all.\n\nOne question that raises: if the future is bound to involve redundancy, is it good use of borrowed government funds only to be putting off that date?\n\nBut such expectations could be confounded if the exit from furlough is well designed and implemented.\n\nWith business and trade unions asked to comment on draft plans for the ways in which businesses can reopen, one theme running through their responses is that spending taps cannot simply be turned off at the end of June, when the furlough and self-employed schemes are currently due to end.\n\nAnd Mr Sunak gets what they're saying. On Monday, he told ITV News: \"There will be no cliff edge to the furlough scheme. I am working to figure out the most effective way to wind down the scheme and ease people back into work in a measured way.\n\n\"But some scenarios have suggested we are potentially spending as much on the furlough scheme as we do on the NHS, for example. Now clearly that is not a sustainable situation.\"\n\n(The Chancellor did not say this to ITV's partner on Channel 3, STV News. Had he linked to the Glasgow newsroom, he would have found that John MacKay, its lead anchorman and the face of the station has... been furloughed. Strange times.)\n\nSo exit from furlough will have to be tapered, and for several reasons. One is that people are being asked to take a leap off the rescue boat, and back into some extremely choppy waters. To go from 80% of usual income into a dark void of income uncertainty is a big ask.\n\nWorkers do not know the health risks they may face back at work. They may face future illness as infection continues to spread.\n\nWith contact tracing now being put in place, we may get a call from a stranger, telling us to go into isolation for 14 days. How is our boss going to feel about that?\n\nThose who rely on contracts from other businesses will find many of those clients shell-shocked and unwilling to commit to new spending.\n\nWhere customers are the public, they are being told to be very cautious until there's a vaccine, and that's probably a long way off.\n\nThe other reason for tapering the furlough is to allow employees to do some work. Unlike the self-employed, those on furlough payments are barred from doing anything for their employer.\n\nWhen the time comes to crank up the office, numerous changes will be required to manage the use of space and impose social distancing.\n\nA lot of yellow tape will be applied to workplace floors to manage one-way flows and keep people two metres apart.\n\nPersonal protective equipment will have to be sourced in advance, with supply chains stretched tight. None of that can be done in advance of a restart by staff who are not allowed to work.\n\nAnd there's another risk of furlough being withdrawn too quickly: some companies will move from furlough straight to redundancy. A careful government policy should seek to minimise that, with tapering and perhaps other incentives to employers.\n\nCan and will it be done differently in Scotland and England? That question betrays the default position of a pre-Covid-19 mindset.\n\nYes, it could be done differently. Nicola Sturgeon has said there are good ideas in Whitehall's draft guidelines for easing people back to work, but the first minister also raised trade union concerns that should be addressed: about workplace health precautions being \"considered\" rather than mandated. The Scottish government will consult on the guidelines/rules, and can adapt them as necessary.\n\nBut this is not merely familiar tension between Holyrood and Westminster. \"Unlockdown\", as the prime minister is reported to call the process, could also be done differently around the regions of England.\n\nIn a paper published in London last week, the Institute for Government pointed out that a regional approach has been tried in South Korea and Japan, and now in Italy.\n\nBy lifting restrictions in different regions and nations, it allows the path of infection to be tracked, to see what works best. But the institute also points out the risk of confusing the public with a more complex message.\n\nThere will have to be some thought given to travel restrictions between high-restriction and low-restriction areas.\n\nAnd a big complication is how continued support for furlough costs in one part of the UK would be funded, while there's withdrawal from another part.\n\nThe divergence will likely be between sectors of the economy. Outdoor work has been flagged up as being at the front of the queue, while hospitality looks likely to be among the last to start trading under the \"new normal\".\n\nAnd there could be demographic divergence. Can all those aged over 70 continue to face incarceration when the state of their health varies so much?\n\nCan children - who may yet be proven to have lower infection rates, and less dire escalation of symptoms - be given the opportunity to choose a \"bubble\" of friends for play as well as learning, so long as they stick to the same bubble members?\n\nAs young adults may be at less risk from the virus and at more risk than other groups from the economic impact on their finances and job prospects, can they be given priority for relaxed rules?\n\nAnd if it's true that women are less susceptible to the life-threatening complications from Covid-19 that afflict men, could there be an easing of restrictions on women without men? I wouldn't bet on it.\n\nIt's clear that whichever route is taken - and there could be several such divergences around the UK at one time - the increased complexity risks not only confusion, but a sense of unfairness. And if people don't feel the application of rules is reasonable or fair, that's where the surprisingly high levels of compliance in phase one could be undermined in subsequent phases.\n\nThe Institute for Government points out that it will not be sufficient simply to withdraw restrictions, as if economic activity will naturally and quickly flow back into the space occupied by constraints. It won't.\n\nFor those reasons of stickiness of purchasing decisions by both business clients and consumers, there will also be a requirement on Rishi Sunak to stimulate activity.\n\nAs well as spending, there are tax levers available. Companies could be incentivised to invest in anti-infection measures around workplaces, which will be an added cost to cash-strapped firms.\n\nOr consumer choices can be stimulated. VAT cuts targeted at specific sectors of consumer goods, for instance? In Germany, there's already been an announcement that VAT will have a temporary cut for restaurant meals starting in July. It gives customers and restaurateurs something to book and look forward to.\n\nTo boost rehiring of people, one controversial idea from the Institute of Government report is holding back on further increases to the legislated minimum wage, though this would be at a time when low-paid key workers have won a lot of public sympathy.\n\nAnd could there be a car scrappage scheme, similar to the one we had 11 years ago to help jump-start the economy out of the financial crunch, but weighted heavily towards low-emission vehicles? In the USA, it was known as \"cash for clunkers\". This could hit the twin objectives of stimulating the economy while lowering emissions from the nation's fleet of vehicles.\n\nRelaxing the rules will have to be complex as well as cautious. It will require encouragement and incentives, and the continuation of a very large bill for government.",

    "How will Scotland's virus tracing system work?": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "The Scottish government has set out its plans for a \"test, trace, isolate, support\" system to keep coronavirus in check. How is this going to work - and will its introduction signal the end of lockdown?\n\nUnder the proposed system, when someone starts to feel symptoms consistent with Covid-19 they will be asked to go into self-isolation and it will be arranged for them to be tested.\n\nIf they test negative, they can be released from self-isolation. But if they test positive, they must stay there for seven days - and the contact-tracing system kicks in to identify anyone they have been close to.\n\nThis includes anyone who has been within two metres of an infected person for a period of 15 minutes or longer.\n\nThese people will be asked to go into isolation for 14 days. A support system will be put in place to help those who might struggle to do so.\n\nIt is important to stress that this \"test, trace, isolate\" (TTI) strategy will not be the only restriction in place post-lockdown - the government says it will only work alongside other measures such as physical distancing, hand-washing and use of face coverings.\n\nPeople who are asked to self-isolate for 14 days will be urged to \"remain at home completely during this time\", keeping away from other members of their household if possible.\n\nMinisters recognise that this may be difficult for some, and are drawing up plans to help them based on how the existing \"shielding\" group is supported.\n\nSome people may need to be provided with somewhere to isolate away from the rest of their household, or have deliveries of food or medicine arranged. Mental health and wellbeing support may also be needed.\n\nThe Scottish government is also talking to the UK government about employment rights and benefits, and how people can access financial support if they are sent into isolation due to contact tracing.\n\nNot yet. A lot of things have to be built up before a nation-wide TTI system will be fully up and running.\n\nTo start with, \"extensive\" testing will be needed. The government estimates that tests for up to 2% of the population will be required, and that 15,500 per day may need to be carried out under an \"enhanced\" TTI system.\n\nThis is significantly more than can currently be done, so further work on expanding capacity is needed.\n\nExtra staff will also need to be taken on to run the contact tracing side of the operation, which is far from a simple data-gathering task. In total, up to 2,000 additional specialist workers could be taken on.\n\nThese are the staff who will do the groundwork of contact tracing - phoning up people who are undergoing testing and finding out where they have been over the last 48 hours and who they have been in contact with.\n\nDigital infrastructure is also to be expanded to make sure as much of the process as possible can be automated. Some contact tracing systems already exist within the NHS and Public Health Scotland, but new tools are being developed.\n\nThis will include a \"secure web-based tool for the NHS in Scotland\", which will allow ordinary users to input details of people they have been close to so that they can be forwarded to contact tracing teams.\n\nIn the first instance, contact tracing is chiefly done by straightforward telephone calls as outlined above. However, the UK government is also leading the development of a proximity-tracing app which people could download to their smartphones, with trials to begin soon.\n\nThis would use Bluetooth technology to identify other users close by, and could be useful in flagging up when someone has come into contact with an infectious stranger - for example on public transport.\n\nHowever, Nicola Sturgeon has warned that a large proportion of people might need to have the app in order for it to be effective, underlining the importance of people having trust in the security of the system and the use of their data.\n\nShe said that while an app could eventually be an \"important enhancement\" to the system, \"old-fashioned contact tracing\" was still going to be key.\n\nAs with a lot of other responses to the virus, mass contact tracing isn't going to be turned on like a light switch one day.\n\nThe introduction will be phased as capacity is increased, starting with the priority groups of people currently undergoing testing.\n\nSome health boards are already in a position to do some tracing work, and the Scottish government has targeted having all of them in a position to run an \"enhanced\" system by the end of May.\n\nDifferent systems will need to be tailored to local areas - Ms Sturgeon noted that the challenges in central Edinburgh are different to those in more rural areas like the Borders.\n\nNot necessarily. Ms Sturgeon has warned that TTI is not a \"quick fix\" or a \"magic\" answer to the virus, and even when up and running it will only work alongside a series of other measures.\n\nIt also cannot be taken for granted that once the system is ready, Scotland will immediately emerge from lockdown.\n\nMs Sturgeon has said there will be \"an element of trying to balance things as we go\", as the country adjusts to a \"new normal\".\n\nThe harsher restrictions of lockdown will be replaced with other measures, like TTI, that can help keep the virus suppressed overall - but this will be a gradual, careful process.\n\nUltimately, everything hinges on the virus and how quickly it spreads. If the infection rate - the much talked about \"R number\" - starts to rise again, severe restrictions could be imposed again with little warning.",

This figure does not include those care home residents who died after being transferred to hospital.\n\nQuestions are now being asked whether more lives could have been saved had testing rules been different.\n\nCare Forum Wales, which represents more than 450 care providers, began asking for widespread testing back in March.\n\nIt commissioned a snapshot survey of 87 of the industry body's members across the country, which has been seen by BBC Wales Investigates.\n\nSome reported waiting up to 20 days to be tested, while another said it took 10 days to get the results of a test back.\n\nOf the 38 care homes who responded, 16 said they had felt pressurised into taking patients who were either Covid-19 positive or untested.\n\nOne care home owner who said he felt pressured to take patients from hospitals despite them not being tested for coronavirus was Nigel Clark in Port Talbot.\n\nHe said they decided early on that they would not take patients unless they had been tested, something which he says did not go down well with the local health authority Swansea Bay University Health Board.\n\n\"They would ring every day to ask what vacancies we had in the home,\" said Mr Clark.\n\n\"If we had vacancies we were asked why can't we take people in?\"\n\nMr Clark says he was told he needed to help out by easing the pressure on hospitals, and was even told his resistance would be taken to a higher authority.\n\n\"She (a health board representative) said she would go to the Care Inspectorate to ensure I had to start taking people into this care home if they had tests or not because I had to help Neath Port Talbot to release beds.\"\n\nBut the Care Inspectorate supported Mr Clark's decision.\n\nSwansea Bay University Health Board said it could never condone the behaviour Mr Clark alleges, and that all patients are now tested before being sent into care homes.\n\nFor many families, the cost of coronavirus has been high.\n\nPhil Crean's mother Joyce suffered a stroke late in 2019 and ended up in hospital.\n\nAs the coronavirus spread and elderly patients were being moved into care homes to free up space, she was tested in hospital and the results came back negative.\n\nHer family say they were told she would be tested again before being moved, and when they took a call to say she had been taken to the 70-bed Romilly Care Home in Cardiff, they assumed the test had been done. But it hadn't.\n\nThat was at the end of March. Early in April, the family were told their mother was showing signs of having caught coronavirus, and that care home staff recognised the symptoms as they had seen them in other residents.\n\nMr Crean said: \"You can imagine if we'd heard that Covid-19 had been at that care home, we wouldn't have allowed her to be transported there.\"\n\nHis mother died 10 days after arriving at Romilly, one of several deaths at the home in the Canton area.\n\nBBC Wales Investigates has discovered that just days before Joyce died, the Welsh Government issued guidance saying hospitals could discharge Covid-19 patients to care homes and that patients without common symptoms didn't have to be tested before they were moved.\n\nMr Crean says that is \"an absolute disgrace\".\n\n\"It's basically throwing sheep to the wolves isn't it? Personally I think it's extremely poor policy, and it's very cold of them to have done it.\"\n\nHe has also called for the health minister to resign.\n\n\"When you think Vaughan Gething is the health minister, surely he is ultimately responsible for the shambles and for the high numbers of unnecessary deaths that have happened in care homes,\" said Mr Crean.\n\n\"I personally would like to see him stand down.\"\n\nThe Romilly said it was told Mrs Crean was not tested because she did not have common symptoms, but agreed with Mr Crean that more comprehensive testing at the time may have saved lives.\n\nKaren Healey runs the Tregwilym care home in Newport.\n\nShe says when the first resident began showing signs of coronavirus, it took three weeks for the results to come back.\n\nIn the meantime, people in her home were dying.\n\n\"We had the first symptoms on 22 March. Sadly our first death came on 23 March and it escalated very quickly,\" she said.\n\n\"We were getting 10 to 12 residents a week showing signs and symptoms.\n\n\"Probably the worst time was Easter weekend when we had three deaths in a day.\"\n\nTo date, 18 residents have died since lockdown began, 16 with common symptoms of coronavirus.\n\nDormy Care Communities runs the Foxhunters home in Abergavenny, Monmouthshire and another home across the border in Herefordshire.\n\nChief executive Helen Davies-Parsons said: \"There have had to be numerous phone calls to Public Health Wales local health boards in order to get the testing done; in England, it was one phone call.\n\n\"Having worked across the two countries, what I would say in Wales, there has been a flagrant disregard for the social care sector and they have not recognised how quickly that the Covid-19 would spread in a care home.\"\n\nShe says even when Welsh Government policy changed and her residents were eligible for tests, Public Health Wales \"didn't have a clue\" about the new rules.\n\nShe added she was proud of her \"amazing\" staff, but the emotional impact of being denied testing and losing several residents to the virus had been \"extraordinary\".\n\n\"I've never, ever in 33 years of nursing, I've never ever been in a situation of feeling so helpless,\" she said.\n\n\"It's an absolute tragedy. It's a national disgrace.\"\n\nHelena Herklots, Older People's Commissioner in Wales, believes the delay in making testing available to care homes deserves investigating.\n\nShe wants an investigation from the Equality and Human Rights Commission, which upholds equality and human rights ideals and laws across England, Scotland and Wales.\n\n\"I have serious concerns that older people's human rights have been breached; the fundamental right to life,\" she said.\n\n\"The fact that testing wasn't in place as quickly as it needed to be for every resident and every member of staff.\n\n\"I'm extremely disappointed and saddened that the Welsh Government hasn't moved quickly on this.\n\n\"That is why I believe the Equality and Human Rights Commission needs to investigate how older people have been treated throughout this pandemic.\"\n\nFigures from Public Health Wales, obtained by BBC Wales, show up to 17 May, more than 8,500 residents and staff in care homes had been tested.\n\nThis breaks down as 4,027 residents and more than 4,500 staff.\n\nOn 6 May, when the Welsh Government extended the policy to include blanket testing of all residents and staff in larger care homes, there were 119 tests.\n\nNumbers tested daily have risen since. The most recent figure shows 935 tests - 519 staff and 416 residents.\n\nMr Gething says that while the testing in Wales has not been perfect, it has been based on scientific advice.\n\nHe said: \"What I do accept is that in some parts of Wales there are some examples of where some care homes were wrongly refused tests.\n\n\"It took much longer than I would want to see my very clear policy choice implemented.\"\n\nMr Gething refutes suggestions that a lack of testing has cost lives needlessly.\n\nHe said: \"I don't think you can draw a direct line between those because as I say, the advice and the evidence we had at the time was that people who weren't symptomatic, there wasn't a value in testing them.\n\n\"We changed the approach on testing people who were leaving hospital on 22 April onwards.\n\n\"I don't recognise that we have violated the rights of older people.\n\n\"As a minister I'm making choices to keep people safe.\"\n\nIn response to the Older People's Commissioner's concerns the EHRC's head in Wales, Ruth Coombs, said it was \"deeply concerned\" about \"serious potential breaches\" of older people's human rights.\n\nShe said: \"The slow response by Welsh Government to testing residents and staff in care homes, discharge of Covid-19-positive older people from hospital into care homes, examples of inappropriate blanket healthcare decisions on issues such as 'Do Not Attempt Resuscitation' notices, and the lack of sufficient PPE for care workers have contributed to considerable distress, lack of confidence that their rights will be protected and ultimately to loss of life.\"\n\nMs Coombs said the EHRC was \"working closely\" with the the commissioner and other partners and was \"considering the use of all our powers to protect their rights now and following the coronavirus pandemic\".",

    "In lockdown with autism: 'I feel sick with worry'": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "For most people the Covid-19 crisis is an unsettling, confusing time. But for hundreds of thousands of adults with autism in the UK the problems are acute.\n\nFamilies and charities say this vulnerable group has been forgotten in the pandemic and they are often not receiving the care they need. Here some of them describe what things have been like since the lockdown began.\n\nIn a few weeks Simon will be 53. He was diagnosed with autism when he was three and has been in residential care his whole life.\n\nHe has very limited communication but can say when he wants a cup of tea. In normal times, he would go riding and swimming once a week.\n\n\"He's a very active young man,\" says his mother Andrea. \"And to me he's still a young man.\"\n\nBut two weeks ago Simon fell ill, with a high temperature and severe cough.\n\n\"I just felt sick with worry,\" Andrea says. \"I mean what's going to happen to him if he is so ill he has to go into hospital?\"\n\nDespite having typical symptoms, like thousands of others, Simon has not been tested for coronavirus and Andrea is not allowed to see him.\n\nShe has nothing but praise for the care home staff but says: \"No doctors will come and that is the whole problem. We don't know what we are dealing with.\n\n\"It's been terrible - probably the most stressful week in my life.\"\n\nSimon has no way of communicating how he's feeling, whether he's getting better or worse, and no way of processing what is happening to him.\n\n\"I can't imagine what he's thinking,\" Andrea says.\n\n\"Even his favourite cup of tea has disappeared because they are giving him cold drinks to keep his temperature down. He can't even say to someone, I'd really love to have a cup of tea.\"\n\nUnder NHS guidelines if someone with autism or a learning disability does need hospital treatment for Covid-19 then a single family member or carer can visit.\n\nBut Andrea still thinks Simon would struggle to cope.\n\n\"He would be absolutely terrified,\" she says. \"Most hospitals have very, very limited staff who can deal with autism and learning disabilities. I just don't know what would happen.\"\n\nShe says Simon's condition has started to improve and he is now eating small amounts and sitting in the garden with a drink.\n\nDavid* was diagnosed with autism and multiple learning disabilities as a child. Now in his 50s, he's spent the last 30 years living in three different residential care homes.\n\nHe is worried about what will happen if the virus spreads in the home and says people like him have been forgotten.\n\n\"Testing should be done daily on residents and care workers,\" he says.\n\n\"If my care workers get it or other residents get it, I'm stuck. What protection do I have? I am concerned about the lack of PPE for all care providers not just my own.\"\n\nLike many people with autism, Christopher finds it hard to handle the unpredictable.\n\n\"He gets very confused, very frustrated, with any form of change to his timetable or his daily routines,\" says his mother Jane. \"So when situations like this arise you get a lot of anxiety from him.\"\n\nChristopher lives on his own, in his own house. He has two long-term carers who help with meals, cleaning, personal care and other everyday tasks he can't do alone, but last month they both had to resign - one for health reasons, the other to look after their own children - leaving him with no support.\n\nAnd because Jane lives with another vulnerable person, lockdown means she isn't able to help her son face-to-face.\n\n\"Everything has to be done within his drive, keeping the two metre distance,\" she says. \"But that means we can't provide the personal care he desperately, desperately needs.\"\n\nIf - as seems likely - the lockdown continues for weeks, perhaps months, Jane fears it could be \"catastrophic\" for her son.\n\n\"The longer this goes on, the more anxious he's becoming, the more unconfident he's becoming, the more he's losing what we've built up with him over the years.\n\n\"He's a 40-year-old young man who has lots to give. He's an absolute treasure, but I'm so worried about this time for him.\"\n\nLiving in supported accommodation, James* has been used to receiving regular visits from his care workers.\n\nBut since the coronavirus outbreak his contact has been limited to brief phone calls or a knock at the door.\n\nHe has Asperger Syndrome and has recently been discharged from hospital where he was a patient for over 10 years.\n\n\"Gradually he's staying in more, not seeing or speaking to anyone, staying up all night and in bed for a huge part of the day,\" says his mother Kathy.\n\n\"I'm afraid that he's going to lose all his social skills again and get very depressed, ending up back in hospital.\"\n\nBecause of her age, Kathy is having to self-isolate so can only contact her son by email or video call.\n\n\"He keeps saying 'what's the point of living if we're in lockdown'.\n\n\"He's relying more and more on me for mental support rather than turning to his team. So I'm on the receiving end of the brunt of his frustrations. I'll be very glad when the lockdown is over and he can get the full support he needs.\"\n\nJane Harris, Director of External Affairs at the National Autistic Society, says \"Autistic people often have communication difficulties. That means that it's harder to understand what is going on in the first place.\n\n\"But also autistic people don't often have the best support networks to start with so it's really, really hard for them to get support in a crisis, things like shopping or even just a phone call just to check that somebody is okay.\n\n\"There will be thousands of people across the country who are deeply isolated during this crisis and who need support more than ever.\"\n\nThe charity has published guidance for autistic people and their families to help during the pandemic.

        "body": "More than 300 Indians stranded by the coronavirus lockdown have arrived home on flights from Dubai in the United Arab Emirates (UAE).\n\nThose returning on the two UAE flights on Thursday arrived in the state of Kerala and went into quarantine.\n\nIndia suspended all international travel in March before it went into lockdown to curb Covid-19 infections.\n\nNearly 15,000 Indians are expected to return on special Air India flights from 12 countries over the next week.\n\nPassengers have to pay their own fares. They are being tested before boarding flights.\n\nFlights from the US and UK which were due to arrive back on Thursday, for instance, were delayed as Covid-19 tests on crew were not done in time, local media reported.\n\nSince it closed its borders, India has operated a few flights to bring back Indian citizens. But the latest exercise, which has been dubbed the Vande Bharath (Hail India) mission, is the most organised effort so far.\n\nEventually, about 200,000 Indians will be brought back, report local media.\n\nIf successful, this would be India's biggest evacuation mission since 1990, when it rescued 170,000 civilians from Kuwait during the Gulf War.\n\nAir India, the country's national airline, will carry out the mission and fly planes to the US, the UK, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, Qatar and Malaysia, among other countries.\n\nThe Indian mission in the UAE alone has received 197,000 applications to be repatriated so far.\n\nMost of the flights will go to the southern Indian state of Kerala, from where tens of thousands go to work abroad.\n\nIndians wanting to return will be expected to pay for their tickets (the prices will vary based on the port of departure) and will only be able to board if they're not showing any symptoms of Covid-19.\n\nDetails issued by the government said each flight would carry 200 to 250 passengers.\n\nThe crew will be in protective gear, while all passengers will have to wear masks and follow social distancing norms and other health protocols. Anyone who shows symptoms during the flight will be moved to an isolation zone in the aircraft.\n\nThe passengers will also be subject to extensive screening when they return, and will then be quarantined for at least 14 days. States are preparing quarantine beds in hospitals and temporary care homes.\n\nOfficials told the BBC that the elderly, pregnant women, those requiring medical attention and those who are \"stranded in difficult situations\" will get first preference to board the flights.\n\nThe country's naval fleet of warships is also being used to evacuate citizens - two ships are currently en route to Male to evacuate 1,000 Indians stuck in port in the Maldivian capital.\n\nForeign affairs minister S Jaishanker has urged Indians abroad to stay in touch with their local embassies.",

        "body": "A US pharmaceutical firm has signed agreements with drug makers in South Asia to expand supply of the drug remdesivir for treating Covid-19.\n\nThe agreement between Gilead and five generic pharmaceutical companies in India and Pakistan will help make the medicine for 127 countries.\n\nRemdesivir cut the duration of symptoms from 15 days to 11 in clinical trials at hospitals around the world.\n\nThe antiviral drug was originally developed as an Ebola treatment.\n\nIt works by attacking an enzyme that a virus needs in order to replicate inside our cells.\n\nUnder the licensing agreement, the five companies have the \"right to receive a technology transfer of the Gilead manufacturing process for remdesivir to enable them to scale up their production quickly\", a statement from Gilead said.\n\nThe licences would be royalty-free until the World Health Organization (WHO) declares the end of the public health emergency arising out of Covid-19, or until another pharmaceutical product or a vaccine is approved to treat or prevent the disease, the statement said.\n\nThe agreements allow the Cipla Limited, Ferozsons Laboratories, Hetero Labs Ltd, Jubilant Lifesciences and Mylan to manufacture the drug.\n\nThe managing director of the privately-owned Hyderabad-based Hetero Labs told the BBC that it is \"too early\" to determine the pricing of the drug and when the manufacture will begin.\n\n\"Things will be clearer by June. We anticipate controlled usage [of the drug] through government institutions. Our main aim is that India should be self-sufficient in the drug if India chooses to use it,\" Vamsi Krishna Bandi said.\n\nThe $1bn firm is one of the world's largest producers of anti-retroviral drugs, supplying to nearly five million patients of HIV-Aids. Hetero Labs makes some 300 products at 36 manufacturing facilities worldwide.\n\nIndian medical science and drug control authorities will have to first decide how they want to use the drug on patients.\n\nA senior scientist at the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has said that it will consider using the drug if Indian firms are able to make it.\n\n\"Initial data based on an observational study shows that the drug is effective. We will wait for the results from the WHO solidarity trial and also see if some other companies can work on this to proceed further,\" Raman Gangakhedkar said.\n\nThe clinical trial of remdesivir was run by the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) in which 1,063 people took part. Some patients were given the drug while others received a placebo.\n\nD Anthony Fauci who runs the NIAID said: \"The data shows remdesivir has a clear-cut, significant, positive effect in diminishing the time to recovery.\"\n\nHe said the results proved \"a drug can block this virus\" and were \"opening the door to the fact that we now have the capability of treating\" patients.\n\nThe impact on deaths, though, is not as clear-cut. The mortality rate was 8% in people given remdesivir and 11.6% in those given a placebo, but this result was not statistically significant, meaning scientists cannot tell if the difference is real.\n\nThe BBC's health and science correspondent James Gallagher says it is also not clear who is benefiting from the drug and poses a few questions.\n\nIs it allowing people who would have recovered anyway to do so more quickly? Or is it preventing people from needing treatment in intensive care? Did the drug work better in younger or older people? Or those with or without other diseases? Do patients have to be treated early when the virus is thought to peak in the body?\n\nThese will be important factors when the full details are eventually published, our correspondent says.",

A federal inmate is someone inside a prison or jail operated by the federal government as opposed to a particular state.\n\nIt is not clear how many inmates have died in state-run prisons.\n\nThe Marshall Project, a non-profit news organisation which reports on the US criminal justice system, gathered data from state and federal prison agencies across the US and estimated there have been more than 9,400 cases and 131 coronavirus-related deaths.\n\nConcerns over coronavirus have put pressure on US prison authorities to release inmates in order to prevent infections from spreading.\n\nCircle Bear was in prison for charges related to distributing methamphetamines filed by the US government in April 2018, to which she pleaded guilty.\n\nShe was moved from a jail in South Dakota to a federal prison and medical facility in Fort Worth, Texas on 20 March for undisclosed reasons, and quarantined as required by the prison for all new inmates.\n\nThe following week, she was taken to hospital over concerns about her pregnancy. She was discharged later that day.\n\nHowever, she was hospitalised a few days later after displaying Covid-like symptoms and placed on a ventilator.\n\nThe next day her child was born by Caesarean section. She died on 28 April after testing positive for coronavirus earlier this month- the thirtieth federal inmate to die of Covid-19, and believed to be the first woman.\n\nThe US Federal Bureau of Prisons said in a statement she had a pre-existing medical condition, but did not give further details.\n\nThere are 1,625 female inmates at the Federal Medical Center Carswell where Circle Bear was quarantined.\n\nReform campaigners say prisoners face unique risks, due to a lack of hygiene in overcrowded cells and hallways.\n\nThe US has a greater proportion of imprisoned citizens than any other country, with an estimated 2.3 million people behind bars.\n\nUS jails and prisons began releasing inmates in March over concerns about the spread of coronavirus between prisoners and staff.\n\nLater that month, the Attorney General advised federal prisons to transfer inmates to home confinement where possible if they are deemed to be non-violent and at-risk for coronavirus.\n\nFollowing this directive, the Bureau of Prisons has placed 1,751 inmates on home confinement.\n\nHowever, Circle Bear did not appear to be considered a priority for early release. The Bureau of Prisons did not give details on the status of her baby.",

    "Is it time to free the healthy from restrictions?": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "The constant stream of bad news on coronavirus, from the rising number of deaths, to doctors and nurses risking their lives because of a lack of protective equipment has, understandably, caused great anxiety.\n\nThat much is clear from the proportion of adults worried about the threat they believe the virus poses to themselves.\n\nOlder people are the most concerned, but even among younger age groups the majority believe they are at risk.\n\nBut have we got this out of perspective? How much actual risk does coronavirus present?\n\nThe people who are most at risk are older people and those with pre-existing health conditions. The overwhelming majority of deaths has been among these groups.\n\nBut young people are, of course still, dying - by late April there had been more than 300 deaths among the under-45s.\n\nWhat is more, there are many more who have been left seriously ill, struggling with the after-effects for weeks.\n\nSo how should we interpret that? And what does that mean for post-lockdown life?\n\nOur constant focus on the most negative impacts of the epidemic means we have \"lost sight\" of the fact the virus causes a mild to moderate illness for many, says Dr Amitava Banerjee, of University College London.\n\nThe expert in clinical data science believes it is important not to jump to conclusions about the deaths of younger, seemingly healthy adults. Some could have had health conditions that had not been diagnosed, he says.\n\nBut he admits there will be otherwise healthy people who have died - as happens with everything from heart attacks to flu.\n\nIn future, we need to stop looking at coronavirus through such a \"narrow lens\", he says. Instead we should take more account of the indirect costs, such as rising rates of domestic violence in lockdown, mental health problems and the lack of access to health care more generally.\n\nOn Sunday Boris Johnson is expected to set out how restrictions will be eased in England. All indications are that it will be a very gradual process to keep the rate of transmission of the virus down.\n\nBut some believe we do not need to be so draconian.\n\nEdinburgh University and a group of London-based academics published a paper this week arguing restrictions could be lifted quite significantly if the most vulnerable were completely shielded.\n\nThat would require the continued isolation of these individuals and the regular testing of their carers - or shielders as the researchers call them.\n\nIf we could protect them - and that would require very good access to quick testing and protective equipment - the researchers believe we could lift many restrictions and allow a \"controlled\" epidemic in the general population.\n\nGood hand-hygiene, isolating when you have symptoms and voluntary social distancing where possible would be needed. But people could return to work, and school - in a matter of months. The majority could even be eating in restaurants and going to cinemas.\n\nFor the non-vulnerable population, coronavirus carries no more risk than a \"nasty flu\", says Prof Mark Woolhouse, an expert in infectious disease who led the research.\n\n\"If it wasn't for the fact that it presents such a high risk of severe disease in vulnerable groups, we would never have taken the steps we have and closed down the country.\n\n\"If we can shield the vulnerable really well, there is no reason why we cannot lift many of the restrictions in place for others.\n\n\"The lockdown has come at a huge economic, social and health cost.\"\n\nIt is, he says, all about getting the balance of risk right.\n\nIt is a point others have made.\n\nCambridge University statistician Prof Sir David Spiegelhalter has highlighted evidence which shows the risk of dying from coronavirus is very similar to the underlying risk people of all age groups from early 20s upwards have of dying anyway.\n\nHis point is that getting it is like packing a year's worth of risk into a short period of time for adults. The younger you are, the lower the risk all round.\n\nFor children, as you can see on the graph, the risk from the virus is so small that you might be better off worrying about other things. After the first year of life cancers, accidents and self-harm are the leading causes of death.\n\nResearchers from Stanford University in the US have been trying to count the risk another way - equating it to that which we face from dying while driving.\n\nIn the UK, they calculate that those under the age of 65 have faced the same risk over the past few months from coronavirus as they would have faced from driving 185 miles a day - the equivalent of commuting from Swindon to London.\n\nStrip out the under-65s with health conditions - about one in 16 - and the risk is even lower, with deaths in non-vulnerable groups being \"remarkably uncommon\".\n\nPutting risk in perspective is going to be essential for individuals and decision-makers, the authors suggest.\n\nIf we do, we may learn to live with coronavirus. We may have to.",

    "Is lockdown good for your heart?": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "Are people having fewer heart attacks? And should hospitals protect black, Asian and minority ethnic healthcare workers by taking them off the front line? Dr John Wright of Bradford Royal Infirmary considers these questions in his latest diary.\n\nOne of the intriguing observations during the pandemic has been the marked reduction in patients coming to hospital with acute heart attacks or strokes.\n\nOur initial worry was that people were frightened to come in when they needed to - suffering their symptoms at home rather than risking getting infected in hospital. This may still turn out to be the case, but heart attacks and strokes are the sort of episodes in which you would expect patients to seek help. You would expect them to be picked up by health services.\n\nPerhaps the slowing down of our frantic lives from our enforced lockdown, and even the cleaner air we are breathing from the reductions in traffic, are helping to keep us in finer fettle? Our slow living might be nurturing new healthier habits and lifestyles.\n\nOne clue has emerged from people using the Fitbit health and fitness tracker in the US.\n\nHeart rate is a good indicator for heart health - the lower your resting heart rate the better - and Fitbit has found that during lockdown average resting heart rates have fallen.\n\nAlso, while step counts have also fallen, the number of active minutes has actually gone up - people have swapped desk-based routines for more mobile routines at home.\n\nSleep duration has also increased with people going to bed earlier than normal and sleeping longer. It seems as though the lockdown has had the health-promoting effect of a good holiday.\n\nProf John Wright, a medical doctor and epidemiologist, is head of the Bradford Institute for Health Research, and a veteran of cholera, HIV and Ebola epidemics in sub-Saharan Africa. He is writing this diary for BBC News and recording from the hospital wards for BBC Radio 4's The NHS Front Line\n\nProf Alistair Hall, a cardiologist and clinical director for Yorkshire and Humber of the National Institute for Health Research, says he hasn't seen evidence yet of people just staying at home after having heart attacks. On the other hand, he has seen people out exercising in unusually large numbers.\n\n\"I have to drive into the hospital, but as I do I see the roads full of people walking and cycling families. I've never seen anything like it. It looks as if everyone has the time as a family to exercise, and they're taking that opportunity to get out of their homes,\" he says.\n\nHe also thinks that people may be more active throughout the day. Rather than sitting at a desk for hours and hours they're taking more breaks, walking around, or going up and down stairs, even if they are taking fewer steps overall.\n\nBut there's another possible factor at play. He thinks people are remembering to take their medicine.\n\n\"Cholesterol is the single biggest preventable cause of heart attacks and strokes in the world,\" he says. \"And I think there's evidence suggests that during this time people are being much much better at taking medications that otherwise they might be forgetting or missing.\"\n\nAnd that extra bit of sleep? He's also confident it's doing people good.\n\n\"Good quality sleep is very advantageous in terms of health, and I guess people haven't needed to get up as early,\" he says. There's a benefit in terms of heart disease, but also for the immune system, \"which is really important at the time of an infectious pandemic\".\n\nProf Hall does add a note of caution, though: \"I'm sure there's some bad side to this, which might include eating too much chocolate or drinking too much alcohol.\"\n\nBut if so, the effect doesn't appear to be registering just yet. It may become more visible later.\n\nThere is escalating national concern about the heightened risk to black, Asian and minority ethnic patients from Covid-19.\n\nThere are some possible explanations to do with relative poverty, with underlying health problems, with overcrowded housing, and with employment in front-line health and service roles. The suspicion is that there are also genetic factors at play. Whatever the reasons, it could have big implications for the future, particularly in the National Health Service.\n\nThere is a real urgency in addressing this concern in a city like Bradford, where almost a third of our population and NHS staff are non-white.\n\nAnd the fact that 64% of the Covid-positive NHS staff who have died nationwide are BAME has caused ripples of anxiety to spread to the hospital.\n\nPeople face a number of risks, from exposure and infection, to the risk of ending up in hospital, and then the ultimate risk of dying.\n\nWe have looked at the last of these - the risk of dying in hospital - among the first 1,276 patients at Bradford Royal Infirmary who were tested for Covid-19.\n\nOf the 464 patients who tested positive, mortality was 23%, which is lower than some of the national study results, and crucially we've found no evidence of differences by ethnicity. This is timely and reassuring evidence for our communities.\n\nDr Sam Khan, consultant in acute medicine, has been ill with Covid-19 since 20 March - more than six weeks - and at one point he needed hospital treatment. His main symptoms have been a dry hacking cough and tiredness. He hopes to be well enough to return to work on 15 May.\n\nI asked him what he thought about suggestions that BAME staff should be kept away from the front line.\n\nHe points out that that would be very difficult in Bradford, and in the NHS generally, because of the large proportion of BAME workers in the healthcare system - and that it would be odd to tell people who had trained to be a doctor or nurse that they couldn't see patients because they were black or Asian, or from a minority ethnic group.\n\n\"I don't know how you'd do it, you'd have to start thinking differently about recruitment policies,\" he says.\n\nWhat does it mean for an acute physician like Sam in the longer term, bearing in mind that he won't know whether the patients he sees are Covid-positive or not.\n\n\"Do we start testing everybody as they come through the door, like we're doing for HIV now, where we test the majority of people aged between 18 and 65?\" he asks.\n\nI ask him if he is worried.\n\n\"We don't know how immune I'm going to be in the future,\" he replies. \"Yes, it does. It does make me worry. It makes my wife worry more, but it makes me worried.\"\n\nFollow @docjohnwright on Twitter\n\nConspiracy theories have been spreading within parts of the BAME community that hospital staff want them to die, reports Dr John Wright - meanwhile, figures suggest an increase in deaths in Bradford outside hospital.",

    "Isle of Wight app trial - a mixed verdict so far": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "It is 10 days since all Isle of Wight residents were invited to test the NHS app at the heart of the government's test, track and trace strategy. So how's it going?\n\nMixed would probably be a fair verdict, though we may have a clearer idea following a Commons statement by the Health Secretary Matt Hancock this afternoon.\n\nThe big concern was how many people would download it. Epidemiologists suggest that for the UK as a whole, about 60% of the population needs to install and use the software for it to live up to its full potential.\n\nSo when Downing Street says there have been roughly 60,000 downloads, that's not a bad result. The island's population is 140,000, and its inhabitants are slightly older and less likely to own a smartphone than the UK average.\n\nBut one cautionary note - that 60,000 may include some who downloaded it twice or are from the mainland.\n\nStill that compares well with other experiments. About 20% of the population of Singapore downloaded its contact-tracing app, and last week an Australian government app had been installed by roughly a quarter of its population.\n\nBut here's the key question - does it work? Are users being alerted to take action after coming into contact with the virus?\n\nHere, there is very little to go on. What we know is that there are just 173 confirmed cases of Covid-19 on the Isle of Wight. With most people still in lockdown, it is quite unlikely that any single individual using the app would have come into contact with an infected person.\n\nThen there is the fact that what's been offered is an early, unsophisticated version of the app.\n\nAt this stage, it only asks someone who feels unwell about two symptoms - a high temperature and a continuous cough.\n\nDepending on their answers, they may then be directed to a call centre to order a medical test.\n\nPeople with whom they recently came into proximity may be sent alerts, warning them they need to be \"super careful\", as one of the app team put it to me, and be on the lookout for their own symptoms.\n\nBut here's the problem. As it stands, the app does not allow them to enter a test result, positive or negative.\n\nThat means their contacts are effectively left in limbo. Health chiefs had previously suggested that contacts would be given the all-clear or potentially be told to self-isolate depending on whether the original user was determined to have the virus - but the app doesn't do that yet.\n\nOne GP on the island told the BBC: \"My concern when the public realise this, is they will feel 'what's in it for me' and be disincentivised. The truth is very little is in it for them other than the greater good.\"\n\nHis other concern was that if it's marginally easier to obtain a test via the app, people might be tempted lie about their symptoms to get one, triggering pointless notifications as a consequence.\n\nThe NHS and its software developers are now working on an updated version of the app, which addresses some of those issues. It will probably have four questions rather than two, and feature a wider range of symptoms including the loss of sense of taste or smell.\n\nThe algorithm is being tweaked so the answers could either trigger a stronger warning to previous contacts or none at all, pending the results of tests.\n\nAnd the whole testing process should be integrated into the app more effectively, meaning the process of sending people either a red alert or an all-clear becomes much smoother.\n\nThat, at least, is the theory. But will it work in practice?\n\nThe NHS has previously indicated it would go straight from the Isle of Wight trial to a national rollout. Health Secretary Matt Hancock had said the app would be deployed across England in mid-May.\n\nThis afternoon, Downing Street would only commit to saying it aims \"to roll out the app across the country in the coming weeks\".\n\nIt seems the islanders will first be asked to test version two before the rest of us join this great experiment.",

We can get from the [phone] company all the details about the hour, the place, exactly the place... and we can understand who else was around.\"\n\nI ask him a series of questions - some get a response, others don't.\n\nCan people be monitored in real-time? \"I cannot answer your question.\"\n\nHow accurate is the geo-location data? \"Accurate enough. It's a very, very, very sensitive tool, ok? But I don't want to add another word about the sensitivity,\" he says, arguing that it could reveal capabilities to enemies.\n\nCan agents log-in to security cameras to track patients? \"No, No, No. It is against the law.\" The Shin Bet \"saved lives from terror, but it saves lives also from the corona,\" he says.\n\nThe agency believes the system has located almost 4,000 individuals who later tested positive - around a quarter of the confirmed Covid-19 cases in Israel.\n\nHowever, concerns have been raised about whether it is picking up too many people, including those who simply pass a patient in the street. Almost 79,000 people have been sent messages based on the Shin Bet data, the government says.\n\nThe Israel Association of Public Health Physicians told MPs that the programme raised \"the substantial possibility of various errors\", saying that \"close contact\" meant a distance of less than 2m for more than 15 minutes.\n\nMr Brabbing said the system did measure the duration of contact.\n\nOthers believe mass surveillance programmes scrambled to deal with the pandemic are rife for abuse around the world. \"What scares me is that, at least for now, the norm is suddenly changing,\" says cybersecurity analyst John Scott-Railton of the University of Toronto's Citizen Lab.\n\n\"People who have been [quietly] doing these things which are highly questionable are suddenly saying: 'Look, we're your saviours here.'\"\n\nMeanwhile, police in Israel have enforced isolation orders partly drawing on the surveillance data. Since March, more than 110,000 checks have been carried out to confirm people are at home. In one case, officers flew a drone up to the window of an 18th floor flat to check on a coronavirus patient's quarantine. She waved at the aircraft filming her.\n\nPolice spokesman Superintendent Micky Rosenfeld thinks the measures have kept Israel in a \"relatively good position\" in tackling the virus. \"We didn't reach a stage where we had hundreds of thousands of people in hospitals... but we're keeping our heads up and we're staying on top of the situation,\" he says.\n\nA committee of the Knesset, Israel's parliament, has been overseeing the Shin Bet program and authorising its continued use. Israel's ministry of health told the BBC that it was continuing to use the data. It declined to answer a question about privacy concerns.\n\nThe Shin Bet has previously said individuals' data will be used only for providing instructions to save lives, and will be deleted 60 days after the coronavirus emergency is lifted.\n\nMinisters have pledged to underpin the programme with legislation after a Supreme Court challenge by human rights groups.\n\nMr Kotkovsky, the photographer who self-isolated after a government message, says he supports the system but still feels left in the shadows.\n\nHe doesn't believe he actually came into contact with a coronavirus patient but was told he could not receive a test. \"It didn't feel like someone was crushing my privacy,\" he says. \"The problem was that I think it wasn't accurate.\"",

    "Italy battles for both mind and body": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "\"When Covid patients enter the hospital, they think it's the beginning of the end,\" says psychologist Tommaso Speranza.\n\nHis hospital, Rome's Spallanzani infectious diseases institute, has been leading Italy's response to the coronavirus crisis that has claimed more than 30,500 lives.\n\nBut since the beginning of Italy's Covid-19 outbreak, it has seen a parallel and related emergency.\n\nToday, fear of dying, anxiety, depression, anger, panic attacks, insomnia and survivor's guilt - all known to affect survivors of natural disasters and war - have emerged as common symptoms.\n\n\"If the patients don't have to be urgently admitted to the intensive care unit, we have a first therapy session to confront their fear. We try to transform it into hope, telling them they're not alone and encouraging them to trust the staff at the hospital: that they will do whatever they can to save their lives,\" says Dr Speranza.\n\nThe team of psychologists establishes daily contact with family members of Covid-19 patients.\n\n\"Sometimes the family is suffering more than the patient. They can't come to visit; they can just wait. It's emotionally exhausting. We call to give them news and put them in touch by video-calls with their loved ones, if possible. We become their best friends.\"\n\nPsychologists have teamed up from the public, private and NGO sectors, offering their help free of charge in response to the mental health emergency.\n\nLombardy has been on the front line of the crisis. Half of Italy's deaths have been in this northern region.\n\nDamiano Rizzi and his team work inside the San Matteo hospital in Pavia, south of Milan.\n\n\"We're a team of 15 psychologists working inside an intensive care unit supporting doctors, nurses and patients,\" he tells the BBC.\n\n\"The hardest thing for them to do is call patients' family members, not knowing them personally, and tell them their loved ones have died.\" They can be doing this 10 times a day.\n\nThe founder of the group Foundation Soleterre, he has helped staff communicate the deaths and has confronted survivors' guilt among both patients and staff.\n\nDoctors and nurses who feel guilt show permanent stress as well as a feeling of disconnection from reality, Dr Rizzi explains.\n\nThe psychologists work to reassure them that they have done their utmost and have saved hundreds of lives. \"We remind them of the limits of our [medical] professions, and that we'll continue the battle.\"\n\nSometimes members of the same family are fighting for their lives in the same hospital, giving patients a different kind of guilt.\n\n\"When one dies, the other tells us the virus should have killed them and not the other,\" says Dr Rizzi.\n\nThe team aims to limit survivors' anger and other emotions, connecting them with community figures such as a priest, the mayor or local associations to create a network of support. \"It's sad to say, but we can call it the psychology of war that we are applying,\" he admits.\n\nFor his colleagues, the biggest fear is catching the virus themselves and infecting family members at home, Dr Rizzi says.\n\nMostly they work over the phone and by video-call, rarely venturing inside the hospitals for fear of further infections.\n\nFacing such a dramatic death toll and so many people dealing with grief the health ministry launched an emergency help line in late April providing psychological crisis support.\n\nFrancesco Caputo, a psychotherapist with the refugee NGO Mediterranea, launched a hotline.\n\nAt first people came looking for clear information. Soon they were seeking help, devastated by the loss of loved ones. In one case a woman's father had lost his partner of 40 years.\n\n\"She was worried for her father,\" says Dr Caputo. Her mother had died at home, and her father had been left alone with his late wife all night long.\n\n\"She needed an open heart ready to listen to her. The idea of her father alone was unbearable.\" Dr Caputo advised her to video-call her father and ask if he was eating and drinking regularly.\n\nUntil now family members of those who have died of Covid-19 have not been permitted to attend the funerals. But that is now changing and up to 15 relatives will now be allowed to take part.\n\nQuite apart from the high number of deaths is the 219,000 infections reported across Italy.\n\nMany of those discharged from hospital have found it hard to shake off the trauma they've been through.\n\nOnce patients are back home, Tommaso Speranza says the Spallanzani hospital tries to keep in touch.\n\n\"They are relieved [that they are home], but still they can't have contact with their family and are in isolation: being alone, they re-experience the trauma of the hospital, like with PTSD.\"\n\nBefore patients leave hospital, the psychologists prepare them for life outside again.\n\n\"We make sure they know who will bring food, the therapy they will need to follow, we check if they sleep well and try to calm them down if the trauma resurges,\" says Dr Speranza. \"We also engage with the family: every small sign of support can change their day.\"\n\nHe also has to ensure the wellbeing of hospital staff, to prevent them from \"burning out\".\n\nBut the patients themselves are often a beacon of hope too.\n\nOne 75 year old had a panic attack on entering hospital, but after talking to Dr Speranza his attitude changed.\n\nThis virus was not going to kill him, the man decided, and he would wait for his grandson to be born. \"I will go out from here. I have to welcome this baby to this new strange world.\"",

    "Lockdown 'once in a lifetime chance' to cut STIs": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "Self-isolation has meant a huge change in a lot of people's sex lives but experts believe the fact we're not hooking up is a \"once-in-a-lifetime opportunity\" to drive down sexually transmitted infections permanently.\n\nThey say taking STI tests at home while in lockdown could be \"a game changer\".\n\nThat's because people who are following lockdown rules aren't having sex with new people and passing on infections.\n\n\"If we could test and treat everybody for their infections now, that would be a game-changer going forward as people slowly move towards normality,\" Dr John McSorely, a sexual health doctor and president of the British Association for Sexual Health and HIV (Bashh), tells Radio 1 Newsbeat.\n\nHe - and other sexual health professionals - want people to get tested now, even if they have no symptoms.\n\nDue to the coronavirus outbreak, 54% of UK sexual health services have closed, and 38% of sexual health staff have been moved to work in other parts of the NHS.\n\nThat's meant some people are getting STI advice, diagnoses - and in some cases treatment - over the phone or through the post, instead of having to visit a clinic.\n\n\"If people can keep testing going and everyone gets tested while on this break, it's a once-in-a-lifetime event really,\" says Justin Harbottle, who works for SH:24, which provides free home-testing kits online.\n\n\"Even at the start of the HIV epidemic, I don't think you had such a clean-cut period where collectively - as a population - people stopped having sex with new partners.\"\n\nSomeone is most likely to pass on HIV when they've just caught it themselves because that's when the virus is at its highest levels in the body.\n\nGetting a positive HIV diagnosis during lockdown means that person is less likely to have had sex with other people during their most infectious period. They can then start treatment straight away to bring levels of the virus in the body down to undetectable levels, meaning it can't be passed on.\n\n\"We think there may be less and less people around who are super-infectious,\" says Dr Gary Whitlock, who works at London's Dean Street clinic, which diagnoses a quarter of all the HIV cases in gay men in the UK.\n\n\"If they start treatment, or become non-infectious, they can't pass it to anybody so it's a once-in-a-generation opportunity for us to get people at high risk of HIV to test.\"\n\nDuring lockdown, Dean Street clinic has seen people visiting the clinic for PEP prescriptions (a drug taken immediately after exposure to HIV that can stop you catching it) drop from an average of 50 per week to less than 10.\n\nTreatment for most STIs detected during lockdown still needs to be given by professionals, apart from chlamydia, which can be treated with tablets sent through the post.\n\nDr McSorely from Bashh hopes that lockdown is also an opportunity to return syphilis to the history books.\n\n\"Earlier this year, syphilis was back at levels we haven't seen since World War Two. I would like this to be an opportunity to make sure that is no longer the case,\" he says.\n\nHe also believes a move to more online solutions will help people who live a long way from sexual health clinics, or previously felt they were too busy to make an appointment.\n\nBut while Dr Whitlock from Dean Street clinic believes home testing could make NHS sexual health services \"more efficient in some ways\", he's cautious about moving services out of clinics for some patients.\n\n\"The difficulty with home treatment often can be that you might miss the opportunity to do further testing. For instance, with gonorrhoea, there's a worry about resistance,\" he says.\n\n\"There are other services that we offer when people come in, such as risk reduction advice, or the opportunity to have face-to-face consultations - and we need to be sure those aren't lost if we then move in that direction.\"\n\nSexual health professionals also want people in the UK to get their sex lives back as soon as lockdown allows.\n\n\"There seems to be a feeling that everyone's going to go a little bit nuts afterwards - and it feels like a fairly rational response,\" says Justin.\n\n\"If you've been cooped up for months and months, when it ends everyone's going to go out on the pull collectively and blow off some steam.\"\n\nBut before doing that, doctors Gary and John both say getting tested is key.\n\n\"It's not normal for people to be locked down in their homes. Having a happy, safe, healthy sex life is part of what it is to be alive,\" says John.\n\n\"Now is the time to think about sex, to think about the future. Have you had a recent test? If not, then now may be the time to do that.\"\n\nIf you think you've picked up an STI during lockdown, the advice is simple.\n\n\"Have a look online for testing, if that's something you want to do,\" says Gary.\n\nHe also wants people to know that clinics in many parts of the UK are still open for face-to-face appointments.\n\n\"The government is allowing people to access medical care as part of the lockdown, so you're allowed to travel to come to get help.\n\n\"It's important that people know that we're here and that we're providing services.\"",

        "body": "More than 9,000 fines were issued by police in England to people breaking the lockdown. While the vast majority are obeying the lockdown rules, a small minority are resistant to them.\n\nThe government's health advisors say we are just over the peak of the coronavirus pandemic and sticking to the lockdown is crucial save lives. Here, three people explain why they didn't.\n\nTwo of my best friends are in a couple. Both said they had the virus a few weeks ago. They hadn't been tested but they had all the symptoms. Last weekend they sent me a message saying they were coming to East London to see people from a safe social distance.\n\nI said to stop and wave when they got to my house. But when they arrived outside I thought we're going to have to invite them in. Part of it was the weather. It was so beautiful it lulled me into a sense of false security.\n\nI live near a canal path and last weekend I felt there were more people out drinking and getting together. Plus my mum's friends have all been meeting up secretly for walks and they are in the at-risk category as well.\n\nIt was so exciting to see friends again and have that human interaction but very quickly I started to feel very guilty.\n\nWhat are the rules on social distancing?\n\nMy husband wasn't happy about it at all. He said it gave off the impression that we felt we are somehow better than everyone else. We sat outside on the balcony and quickly got spotted by a neighbour. She gave us a dirty look and I felt we had to call an end to it.\n\nThe first 15 minutes or so felt great but within half an hour it did make me feel bad. They were gone within an hour.\n\nMy friends said we should go and visit them next time. But I don't think I would do that again until I had some new advice from the government. Looking back now it does feel irresponsible.\n\nI am a student back from university and living at home. My mum had been on at me for weeks to get a new haircut. My hair is really frizzy and it gets so irritating when it's hot.\n\nWe haven't got razors, clippers or anything like that so cutting it myself just wasn't an option. Mum is in touch with this underground network of hairdressers who have been working from home.\n\nWe drove to a nearby city. We parked down the road and just knocked on the door.\n\nI'd never met the hairdresser before. She was in her 20s and had everything set up in her kitchen: all the proper utensils and a mirror from her bedroom propped up against the table. She said she needed the money. She had just started her own business so couldn't be furloughed and had fallen through the cracks [of the government's different support schemes].\n\nI did spot one of the neighbours as I was coming out of the house and wondered what they were thinking.\n\nI know it wasn't in accordance with the rules and most people would think this isn't essential. But I didn't worry too much about the risks. The whole thing took about half an hour.\n\nMy girlfriend though was upset. She was really irritated at me for doing it and thought it was a risk for no good reason.\n\nWe had been reading about a meteor shower that was meant to be really spectacular on Wednesday night. So around 11.30pm I piled into the car with my mum, dad and younger brother. We had a telescope and binoculars.\n\nThe idea was to drive about four or five miles out of the city to get a better view of the sky at midnight.\n\nWe were less than 500m from our house and a police car pulled out. It had been stationary and parked at the side of the road. It followed us and its lights came on. Then a second police car arrived with lights, sirens, the whole works.\n\nThey asked what we were doing and were perfectly polite. They said this was an unnecessary journey and we had to go home. My dad told them this was our daily exercise but they were not having it.\n\nI can understand their argument but to deny us the right to exercise seems overzealous. It starts to become a night curfew and that's not what the regulations are about.\n\nFor example if I was an essential worker and wanted to go for a late-night run, then what's to stop me doing that? They were saying we should exercise in a local space but the lockdown rules say you are allowed to drive a short distance to exercise.\n\nI did complain to the police in writing afterwards. They replied saying our travel was non-essential but I still don't think we broke the rules.",

    "Long coronavirus test results waits concern GPs": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "The government needs to make sure its coronavirus testing strategy is fit for purpose instead of focusing on hitting targets, says the Royal College of GPs.\n\nIn a letter to Health Secretary Matt Hancock, chaiman Prof Martin Marshall said long wait times were \"undermining confidence\" in the results.\n\nHealth professionals were also concerned about the accuracy of some test results, he said.\n\nThe government said \"95% of tests\" were processed \"in less than 48 hours\".\n\nEnsuring there are enough tests to meet demand is part of the government's five tests it says must be met before easing lockdown restrictions.\n\nHowever, the absence of a clear strategy had left patients vulnerable, according to Prof Marshall.\n\nHe said the RCGP did not currently believe the testing strategy was capable of working to prevent a second wave of infections and \"secure the overall health of the population\".\n\nHowever, he did commed the \"clear strides to improve testing capacity\" in recent weeks.\n\nThe RCGP said it wants the testing strategy to:\n\nThere was a major effort to increase the number of daily tests provided, with a target set of hitting 100,000 tests a day by the end of April.\n\nThe government said it had reached that goal, providing 122,347 tests on 30 April - although it has struggled to maintain testing numbers at that level over the past fortnight.\n\nThe number also included home testing kits which had been sent out but may not end up being returned.\n\nConcerns have been raised that the focus on hitting the target had distracted from the actual purpose of testing.\n\nAt the end of April, NHS Providers deputy chief executive Saffron Cordery told the BBC there were questions to be asked about whether the \"maximum benefit\" had been gained from efforts to meet the 100,000 target, when a plan to test frontline staff regularly \"hadn't been thought through\".\n\nTesting key workers is meant to help those who can get back to work faster.\n\nBut some health professionals have reported waiting more than a week for results. Dr Lucy-Jane Davis, chair of the British Medical Association (BMA) in south-west England, said some people had waited more than 10 days.\n\nA test to see if someone has the virus is only a snapshot in time - it indicates whether the person has enough of the virus in their nose or throat to be detected at that moment.\n\nIf they are re-tested a few days later, it may have cleared up, multiplied enough to become detectable, or show whether they have newly contracted the virus.\n\nSo people receiving their results several days after being tested may find that information is no longer useful or accurate.\n\nThe Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) says 95% of tests across all settings are received back within 48 hours - but that still gives a figure of potentially 5,000 people a day waiting longer than that.\n\nOn top of this there is also a \"void rate\" of just over 5% - where the samples are not viable and so the swabs cannot produce a result.\n\nStaff on the frontline in hospitals and care homes may need to be tested once or even twice weekly, regardless of whether they have symptoms or not, according to Rupert Beale who is leading the Crick Institute's efforts to test NHS staff.\n\nThe DHSC says the key window for testing is the first three days after developing symptoms.\n\nThe ability to have rapid results will also play a key role in the government's \"track, trace, test\" efforts, according to Prof James Naismith at the University of Oxford.\n\nFaster turnaround is needed if testing is to be used to help control the spread of infection, he said.",

The state has so far reported over 48,000 cases and more than 1,900 deaths.\n\nOn Thursday, Mr Garcetti urged all of the city's residents to get swabbed after earlier tweeting that \"LA is now the first major city in America to offer free Covid-19 testing\".\n\nMeanwhile, California Governor Gavin Newsom is expected to sign an executive order to close all beaches and parks in the state after large crowds packed public spaces over the weekend.\n\nWhile some of California's beaches have been closed for weeks, others have remained open with social distancing rules in place.\n\nMr Newsom recently said that he was just weeks away from lifting some restrictions.\n\nBut the recent images of crowded beaches in the most populous US state led to a warning from the Democratic governor that the behaviour of some Californians threatened to undo weeks of work to restrict the spread of Covid-19.\n\n\"We can't see images like we saw, particularly on Saturday, in Newport Beach,\" the governor said on Monday, adding: \"The virus doesn't take the weekend off because it's a beautiful sunny day around our coasts.\"\n\nHe later said, however, that he would not be making changes to orders \"on the basis of pressure\".\n\n\"What we need to do, from my humble perspective, is listen to the public health experts.\"\n\nCalifornia was among the first US states to bring in blanket restrictions, issuing a \"stay at home\" order to residents last month in an effort to stem the march of the coronavirus.",

    "Matt Dawson: England rugby star on concussion and its consequences": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "Matt Dawson enjoyed plenty of success in his rugby career but his mum could hardly bear to watch any of it.\n\nLois Dawson rarely missed any of her son's matches, but she was not watching out of a love of the game. There was little interest in who won or lost. She wanted to be there in case her son got hurt.\n\nLike many rugby players, Dawson did get hurt. To such an extent that he cannot always remember the circumstances of how and has to turn to former team-mate and best friend Paul Grayson for the details.\n\nWhile playing for Northampton against Harlequins, the scrum-half received the ball off a line-out and was immediately smashed to the floor as another player's arm hit him across the head.\n\nThe next thing Dawson remembers is waking up in hospital with his mum at his side. He immediately asked what the score had been.\n\nTen seconds later he asked again. And again. And again, forgetting each time that he had asked the same question only moments before.\n\nThings went on like this for an hour and Dawson says it \"distressed his mum hugely\". It was one of a vast number of concussions the 47-year-old suffered in his 15-year career.\n\nHe believes he was concussed once a year in matches and up to four times a year in training, and it was concern over these injuries that kept his mum coming to games.\n\n\"She was very proud of me and loved the travel and pride that went with it but she couldn't stand watching,\" the former England captain says.\n\n\"After I retired she openly admitted that she really didn't enjoy it and that she didn't tend to watch the games, she would just watch me.\n\n\"She wouldn't be able to tell you how the game went or who scored tries, it would just be if I got knocked out, she would know about it.\"\n\nUnsurprisingly, the concussions still have an impact on Dawson's life now. Movement in his neck is restricted - but more concerning are the possible mental effects.\n\nThe former British and Irish Lion says his short-term memory has suffered.\n\n\"I have to be very conscious of re-reading things and writing notes down,\" he explains.\n\n\"It never used to be that bad. Far too frequently I wouldn't know the details of games I played in and someone would tell me, then I remembered it.\n\n\"If you talk to any of my coaches I was always about the detail. That started to disappear a bit.\"\n\nOne incident made him fly into such a rage that Grayson, who made his international debut alongside the scrum-half in 1995 and played with him for 11 years at Saints, thought Dawson was going to punch him.\n\nDawson had taken a hit to the head in a tackle and was told to go off. Grayson, watching from the stands, saw his friend walk down the tunnel and soon heard loud bangs coming from the changing rooms below.\n\n\"I went in to see if he was alright,\" Grayson recalls.\n\n\"I thought he was going to punch me because he was so enraged and he wouldn't normally get like that.\n\n\"He was going off on one in the changing rooms about his girlfriend at the time. I'm trying to answer his questions about his relationship and it was quite difficult because it didn't matter what I said, he would become more and more enraged.\n\n\"As far as I was concerned I was talking to my mate who was wildly emotional and angry and I've got no idea that had anything to do with a bang on the head.\n\n\"One symptom of concussion is that you have an angry and aggressive demeanour about certain things. But I didn't know anything about concussion then.\"\n\nGrayson had his share of near-misses too, playing in the days before rugby became professional.\n\nIn an amateur game for Waterloo aged 20 the fly-half, now 48, kicked a penalty to take his side ahead. When play restarted he went to tackle a prop and was knocked out.\n\nThe last thing Grayson remembered was the penalty kick but when he lost consciousness he swallowed his tongue, blocking his airways and causing him to go into a convulsive fit.\n\nBeing an amateur game, there was no medical provision but thankfully one of his team-mates, Mike Hayton, was a doctor.\n\nThinking quickly, Hayton grabbed a thick plastic straw from a drinks bottle and used it to open Grayson's airways, saving his life.\n\n\"My next memory was coming round lying on a table in the changing room, the game having finished,\" the former England fly-half says.\n\n\"I went to hospital, was under observation overnight and that was that. Introduction to concussion. Just about as bad as it could get.\n\n\"I tried to have a jog about a week after that. My brain felt heavy, bruised and painful. I felt weird and sick.\n\n\"It does feel scary now to think what the impact of that could have been.\"\n\nWith World Rugby streaming old World Cup matches during the coronavirus pandemic, changes in the game since Dawson and Grayson were playing have been brought into sharp relief.\n\nFans on social media are quick to point out that games from a decade ago are filled with the kinds of tackles that saw Argentina's Tomas Lavanini sent off at the 2019 edition of the tournament.\n\nRugby is still a dangerous game of course - in April Bristol Bears centre Will Hurrell retired after suffering a \"probable stroke\" due to a \"nasty knock\" in a Premiership game - but rugby's organisers are trying to reduce the risks.\n\nThe Head Injury Assessment protocol - a concussion diagnosis and management tool - was launched in 2014, and World Rugby issued new guidance on high tackles four months before the 2019 World Cup, leading to fewer concussions at the tournament.\n\nBut there have been calls for more radical measures over the years: a ban on contact training sessions or even taking tackling out of the game at school level.\n\nDawson has been involved in discussions on the issue before. When a fan shared a video of Springbok Corne Krige's dangerous tackle on the scrum-half back in 2002, Dawson admitted he feared the long-term consequences of such brutal collisions.\n\nBut Krige's physicality that day had short-term consequences too. After the match Dawson felt numbness in his thumb and forefinger and went to see a specialist.\n\nLess than 12 months before a World Cup that he and Grayson would go on to win with England, Dawson was told he had degenerative discs in his neck and was never going to play rugby again.\n\nHe went straight from the doctor's to Grayson's house, where he \"completely lost the plot\".\n\n\"I broke down,\" he recalls. \"I couldn't believe it. They had just told me my career was over.\n\n\"That was one of the lowest points of my career.\"\n\nDawson got a second opinion, then a third and was told he could continue but would have to \"make sure he didn't get hit round the head again\".\n\n\"Now, you would think, 'why would I risk carrying on?'\" he adds. \"But when you're a year away from playing in the World Cup and that's the dream...\"\n\nNow, Dawson does not have to endure the things he put his mum through because neither of his two young sons, Alex and Sami, play rugby.\n\nBut Grayson's experiences have not put him off encouraging his three children to take up the sport.\n\nJames Grayson, Dawson's godson, is a rising star for Northampton while Ethan plays for England Under-18s and twin brother Joel is in the Saints academy.\n\nAnd though Grayson admits his \"heart is in his mouth\" occasionally when it looks like one of them might be hurt, he believes the changes made by World Rugby mean his children are playing a safer game than he did.\n\n\"It's not scary having kids play rugby because they are trying to lessen the impact of concussions and the incidences with the way the game is refereed and the way players are taught,\" he explains.\n\n\"That is a very positive step. There should be less and less serious concussions.\n\n\"It's an inevitable consequence in a contact sport that accidents will happen, but if the game is refereed in a certain way then I'm more confident that it's a safer game to play.\"",

        "authors": [],
        "body": "Millions more people are to be eligible for coronavirus tests, according to government announcements on Tuesday.\n\nIn England, all care home residents and staff will be able to access tests from Wednesday, regardless of whether they have symptoms.\n\nPeople over 65 and those who must leave home to work, as well as those they live with, will be able to get tested if they have symptoms of Covid-19.\n\nScotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are expected to follow suit.\n\nIt comes after figures revealed a third of all coronavirus deaths in England and Wales are now happening in care homes.\n\nSpeaking at the daily coronavirus briefing, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said: \"From construction workers to emergency plumbers, from research scientists to those in manufacturing, the expansion of access to testing will protect the most vulnerable and help keep people safe.\"\n\nMr Hancock also announced that a small number of hospitals in England will begin testing all patients for coronavirus, regardless of if they are showing symptoms, as part of a pilot.\n\nThe government has pledged to carry out 100,000 tests a day by the end of April, but the latest figures showed just over 43,000 tests took place across the UK on Monday - less than half its goal.\n\nThe health secretary said daily testing capacity had increased to 73,400 and insisted the UK was \"on track\" to hit 100,000 tests a day by Thursday.\n\nThis represents a massive expansion of who is eligible for testing - and means we are now one step away from allowing everyone to access a test if they have symptoms.\n\nThat will be crucial when lockdown restrictions are eased as part of the \"test, track and trace\" strategy to keep coronavirus at bay.\n\nIt is being made possible by the roll-out of home-testing kits and mobile units staffed by the armed forces.\n\nThe problems experienced getting more people tested have - to some extent - been because the network of drive-through testing centres have not always been in convenient locations.\n\nThere is plenty of lab capacity to process the tests now the three mega labs are up-and-running in Milton Keynes, Glasgow and Cheshire.\n\nThe expansion has also allowed the government to do something that could prove crucial in tackling the epidemic in care homes - the testing of residents and staff without symptoms.\n\nA big concern is that the virus has been able to get a foothold in care homes via people transmitting it before they develop symptoms or if they are asymptomatic.\n\nBut promising something is one thing - delivering it is another.\n\nWhile the capacity looks like it will be there to test 100,000 a day by the end of the month, the numbers actually getting tested are currently less than half that.\n\nMeanwhile, in Scotland, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said all patients over 70 who are admitted to hospital for any reason will now be tested for Covid-19.\n\nIn Northern Ireland, testing has begun in some GP practices and will also be expanded in hospitals and care homes. Wales has adopted a needs-based approach to testing for NHS and \"critical\" non-NHS workers.\n\nOffice for National Statistics data showed there were 2,000 coronavirus care home deaths in England and Wales in the week ending 17 April, double the previous week.\n\nIt brings the total number of deaths in care homes linked to the virus since the start of the pandemic to 3,096.\n\nCoronavirus deaths in hospitals across the UK, have reached 21,678 - a rise of 586 from Monday.\n\nThe health secretary said from Wednesday the government will publish daily figures on deaths in care homes and the community.\n\nHe said the change aimed to \"bring as much transparency as possible\" to the figures and \"add to our understanding of how this virus is spreading day by day\".",

Now any content that disputes the existence or transmission of Covid-19, as described by the WHO and the NHS is in violation of YouTube policies. For borderline content that could misinform users in harmful ways, we reduce recommendations.\n\n\"We'll continue to evaluate the impact of these videos on communities around the world.\"\n\nby Marianna Spring, specialist disinformation and social media reporter\n\nIn recent weeks, there has been an increase in highly polished videos promoting conspiracy theories being shared on YouTube - and they prove very popular.\n\nSo these findings - although concerning - are not surprising.\n\nThe accurate information shared by trusted public health bodies on YouTube tends to be more complex.\n\nIt can lack the popular appeal of the conspiracy videos, which give misleading explanations to worried people who are looking for quick answers, or someone to blame.\n\nThat includes videos such as Plandemic, which was widely shared online last week.\n\nHigh-quality production values and interviews with supposed experts can make these videos very convincing. Often facts will be presented out of context and used to draw false conclusions.\n\nAnd tackling this kind of content is a game of cat-and-mouse for social media sites.\n\nOnce videos gain traction, even if they are removed, they continue to be uploaded repeatedly by other users.\n\nIt is not just alternative outlets uploading misinformation either. Whether for views or clicks, the study suggests some mainstream media outlets are also guilty of spreading misleading information.",

    "More Scots being diagnosed with cancer": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "More people in Scotland are being diagnosed with cancer, official statistics have revealed.\n\nBut the risk of developing the disease has fallen in the 10 years since 2009.\n\nPublic Health Scotland (PHS), which publishes the annual figures, said the increase reflected Scotland's growing and aging population.\n\nThree out of four cancers were diagnosed in those aged 60 and above, with slightly more women (17,200) diagnosed than men (16,700).\n\nDespite there being more females with cancer compared with males in 2018, the risk of developing cancer was actually higher in men than women.\n\nThis is largely put down to the fact that women tend to live longer than men.\n\nOverall the number of cancers increased from 30,600 in 2009 to 34,000 in 2018, while the risk of developing the disease fell by 3.5% in the same time period.\n\nLung cancer was the most common cancer, with breast cancer the most common in women and prostate cancer the most common in men.\n\nThere are now more cases of lung cancer in women than men, with the disease accounting for 15.8% of all cancers.\n\nThe HPS report said this was due to the differing patterns of smoking between the sexes over the previous decades, with women starting to smoke later than men. There were 5,356 cases in total diagnosed in 2018.\n\nThe report points out that cancer rates are highest in areas of deprivation.\n\nIt said: \"Lung cancer is three times more likely in the most deprived areas compared with the least deprived areas in Scotland.\n\n\"Colorectal (bowel) and cervical cancers are also more likely in the more deprived areas.\n\n\"In contrast, breast and prostate cancers are more common in the less deprived areas.\"\n\nThere were significant increases in rates of thyroid cancer in women in the decade 2009-18(up 60%), liver (up 54%) and uterus (up 19%), while there were significant falls in the rates of cancers of the stomach (down 29%), and the ovary (down 15%).\n\nLeukaemia cases fell 23% and non-Hodgkin lymphoma by 12%.\n\nFor men, there were significant increases in rates of thyroid cancer in the decade (up 56%), liver (up 37%), kidney (up 26%). Malignant melanomas also increased by 15%. There were significant falls in the rates of stomach cancer (39%) and leukaemia (26%).\n\nCancer charities said research into better and kinder treatments, along with effective patient services, was now needed.\n\nMarion O'Neill, head of external affairs in Scotland for Cancer Research UK (CRUK) said it remained vital that cancer was diagnosed as early as possible when treatment was more likely to be successful.\n\n\"This is why patients who are worried about symptoms should get in touch with their GP,\" she said.\n\n\"It's also important that when urgent referrals are made, patients feel confident that they are accessing further investigations and treatment in an environment that's Covid-free.\"\n\nShe called for a widespread Covid-19 testing programme for patients and healthcare staff.\n\nDoctors have warned of a contraction in cancer treatment because of the coronavirus contagion.\n\nMinisters and medics have insisted the NHS remains open for business despite the contagion, and insist anyone with concern over symptoms should be treated.\n\nBut one of the earliest measures taken by the Scottish government to deal with the pandemic was the suspension of screening for breast, bowel and cervical cancers.\n\nHPS said the earlier a patient was diagnosed with cancer, the more likely they were to have a good outcome.\n\nFour out of five breast cancers (79%) were diagnosed at an early stage (I or II). In contrast, almost half of lung cancers (46%) and a fifth of colorectal cancers (21%) were diagnosed at a late stage (Stage IV).",

        "body": "Wide-ranging security flaws have been flagged in the Covid-19 contact-tracing app being piloted in the Isle of Wight.\n\nThe security researchers involved have warned the problems pose risks to users' privacy and could be abused to prevent contagion alerts being sent.\n\nGCHQ's National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) told the BBC it was already aware of most of the issues raised and is in the process of addressing them.\n\nBut the researchers suggest a more fundamental rethink is required.\n\nSpecifically, they call for new legal protections to prevent officials using the data for purposes other than identifying those at risk of being infected, or holding on to it indefinitely.\n\nIn addition, they suggest the NHS considers shifting from its current \"centralised\" model - where contact-matching happens on a computer server - to a \"decentralised\" version - where the matching instead happens on people's phones.\n\n\"There can still be bugs and security vulnerabilities in either the decentralised or the centralised models,\" said Thinking Cybersecurity chief executive Dr Vanessa Teague.\n\n\"But the big difference is that a decentralised solution wouldn't have a central server with the recent face-to-face contacts of every infected person.\n\n\"So there's a much lower risk of that database being leaked or abused.\"\n\nHealth Secretary Matt Hancock said on Monday a new law \"is not needed because the Data Protection Act will do the job\".\n\nAnd NHSX - the health service's digital innovation unit - has said using the centralised model will both make it easier to improve the app over time and trigger alerts based on people's self-diagnosed symptoms rather than just medical test results.\n\nThe researchers detail seven different problems they found with the app.\n\nThey include:\n\n\"The risks overall are varied,\" Dr Chris Culnane, the second author of the report, told BBC News.\n\n\"In terms of the registration issues, it's fairly low risk because it would require an attack against a well protected server, which we don't think is particularly likely.\n\n\"But the risk about the unencrypted data is higher, because if someone was to get access to your phone, then they might be able to learn some additional information because of what is stored on that.\"\n\nNCSC technical director Ian Levy blogged thanking the two researchers for their work and promising to address the issues they identified.\n\nBut he said it might take several releases of the app before all the problems were addressed.\n\n\"Everything reported to the team will be properly triaged (although this is taking longer than normal),\" he wrote.\n\nAn NCSC spokesman said: \"It was always hoped that measures such as releasing the code and explaining decisions behind the app would generate meaningful discussion with the security and privacy community.\n\n\"We look forward to continuing to work with security and cryptography researchers to make the app the best it can be.\"\n\nBut Dr Culnane said politicians also needed to revisit the issue.\n\n\"I have confidence that they will fix the technical issues,\" he said.\n\n\"But there are broader issues around the lack of legislation protecting use of this data [including the fact] there's no strict limit on when the data has to be deleted.\n\n\"That's in contrast to Australia, which has very strict limits about deleting its app data at the end of the crisis.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Harriet Harman, who chairs the Parliament's Human Rights Committee, announced she was seeking permission to introduce a private member's bill to limit who could use data gathered by the app and how and create a watchdog to deal with related complaints from the public.\n\n\"I personally would download the app myself, even if I'm apprehensive about what the data would be used for,\" the Labour MP told BBC News.\n\n\"But the view of my committee was that this app should not go ahead unless [the government] is willing to put in place the privacy protections.\"",

    "NHS reveals code behind virus-tracing app": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "The NHS has released the source code behind its coronavirus contact-tracing app.\n\nMore than 40,000 people have installed the smartphone software so far.\n\nThe health service is targeting the Isle of Wight only, at this stage, but it says this is the first stage of the app's rollout - not a test.\n\nTests carried out on behalf of BBC News confirm the developers have found a way to work round restrictions Apple places on the use of Bluetooth in iPhones.\n\nIn a related development, Health Secretary Matt Hancock has announced that Baroness Dido Harding will head up the wider test, track and trace programme.\n\nThe appointment has surprised some given that when she was chief executive of TalkTalk, the internet provider suffered a major data breach and failed to properly notify affected customers.\n\nThe NHS Covid-19 app is designed to use people's smartphones to keep track of when they come close to each other and for how long, by sending wireless Bluetooth signals.\n\nIf one of them falls ill, they can anonymously trigger an upload of the records so alerts can be cascaded to others they might have infected, asking them to self-isolate, if deemed necessary, potentially before they have any symptoms but are still highly contagious.\n\nAlong with other measures, including manual contact tracing, this may allow lockdown measures to be eased without causing another spike in cases.\n\nNHSX, the health service's digital innovation unit, has opted for a centralised system to power the app, so the contact-matching process happens on a UK-based computer server rather than individuals' smartphones.\n\nAnd there has been a lot of speculation this decision would mean the app was doomed to work badly on iPhones.\n\nApple limits the extent to which third-party apps can use Bluetooth when they are off-screen and running in the background, although it has promised to relax this rule for contact-tracing apps that use a decentralised system it is co-developing with Google.\n\nAnd Singapore and Australia have signalled they will switch from centralised to decentralised apps, for that reason.\n\nBut NHSX had said it had come up with its own solution.\n\nAnd preliminary tests by a cyber-security company suggest it has succeeded.\n\nPen Test Partners installed the app on a handful of \"jailbroken\" iPhones - altered to allow them to monitor activity normally hidden from users.\n\n\"When first placed in proximity to each other, the phones would start to 'beacon' over Bluetooth at either eight- or 16-second intervals,\" co-founder Ken Munro said.\n\n\"Others had expressed concern about the app not being effective when 'backgrounded'.\n\n\"Our tests showed that this did not appear to affect the beaconing, whether the phones had encountered each other for the first time or subsequently been physically moved out and then back into range.\"\n\nA second company, Reincubate, found the app would sometimes \"go quiet\" when run undisturbed in the background for more than 90 minutes but suggested this should not be too big an issue in real-world conditions.\n\n\"A number of reasonable factors can trigger this window being extended, including other use of Bluetooth, the presence of Android devices and the effectiveness of notifications [asking the user to reopen the app],\" it blogged.\n\n\"In our tests, the iOS devices we've run the app on have continued to keep the background service running overnight.\"\n\nThere will be further scrutiny of the app now the source code has been published to Github, allowing others to see how the workarounds were achieved.\n\nEarlier this week, the Joint Human Rights Committee heard evidence that despite the app anonymising users' identities, they could in theory be re-identified, which might allow the authorities - or even hackers - to reveal people's social circles for other purposes.\n\nAnd the committee said a new watchdog should be created to oversee use of the app and the measures taken to keep the data safe.\n\nHarriet Harman, who chairs the committee, said: \"Assurances from ministers about privacy are not enough.\n\n\"There must be robust legal protection for individuals about what that data will be used for, who will have access to it, and how it will be safeguarded from hacking.\"\n\nCritics say a decentralised approach - where contact-matching happens on handsets - would better protect users' privacy.\n\nAnd BBC News has been told members of an ethics group advising NHSX on the app are calling for it to better explain the advantages of a centralised system.\n\nProf Christophe Fraser- an epidemiologist advising NHSX - told BBC News the two main benefits were:\n\nBut he added talks were continuing with Apple and Google.\n\nAnd analysis of how the app was being used in the Isle of Wight would inform decisions on how best to proceed.\n\n\"There's been a lot of discussion of privacy, and rightly so,\" he said.\n\n\"But there is also your ability to save lives.\n\n\"And there is the ability not to be quarantining millions of people.\n\n\"Figuring out how we can find the optimal system that trades off these different requirements is a bit of an open question at this stage.\"",

        "body": "People living in the poorest parts of Scotland account for nearly a quarter of coronavirus cases, new figures show.\n\nThe NHS data reveals 22.7% of confirmed infections come from those in the most deprived areas, while 18.8% come from the most affluent.\n\nSeparate data shows those in the poorest areas account for twice as many Covid-19 calls to NHS24 than the wealthiest.\n\nCoronavirus death rates are worse in the poorest areas of Scotland as well.\n\nNicola Sturgeon has pledged to help the most vulnerable in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic, with a \u00a3350m Scottish government fund in place to help those most affected.\n\nJim McCormick, associate director for Scotland at the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, said: \"It can never be right that someone's life chances are so profoundly affected by where they live or how much money their family has.\n\n\"It's crucial that all aspects of the spread of this virus are carefully examined, but we know that people in areas with higher deprivation scores are less likely to have jobs where they can work from home.\n\n\"This means they may have to face a very significant drop in income or keep going to work, facing greater risks of catching the virus. They are also more likely to live in overcrowded homes, increasing the risk for whole families. \"\n\nThe Scotland-wide deprivation figures are in a paper from Prof Alison McCallum, director of public health at NHS Lothian, for its latest board meeting later.\n\nThe paper carries two graphs from the Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation (SIMD) - a poverty measure which covers seven criteria including income and health - that show Covid-19's impact.\n\nOne shows that people in the most deprived areas made 28% of the calls to NHS 24 about coronavirus, compared with 14% of those in the least deprived areas.\n\nProf McCallum pointed out that many of the callers would not have been tested.\n\nShe added: \"Without widespread implementation of test, trace, isolate and support, therefore, while this reflects the expected pattern of symptoms in the community it is not clear whether this will be the pattern of true positives that persists throughout the pandemic.\"\n\nSeparate figures in the NHS Lothian paper show just under 23% of confirmed cases live in the area with the highest levels of deprivation, compared with 18.8% in the most affluent.\n\nScotland-wide data for Covid-19 deaths by the SIMD deprivation index have not so far been published but similar data has been in England and Wales where those living in the poorest areas are more likely to have died with coronavirus.\n\nOne indicator that Scotland will be in line with the trends elsewhere in the UK is that the country's most deprived council area, Inverclyde, has the highest death rate.\n\nIn addition, figures shown to councillors in Fife suggested that, of the 73 people who had died there with coronavirus by 16 April, 23% were from parts of Fife with the highest levels of deprivation and 15% were from the least deprived areas.",

    "New York becomes Ground Zero again": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "The headlines seemed to be crowding in on us. The coronavirus had reached American shores.\n\nIt had come to the outer suburbs of New York. There were cases in the Bronx, Brooklyn, Queens and Manhattan.\n\nBy now, the news was coming word of mouth. Someone had tested positive in our downtown office complex. A tenant in a neighbouring apartment building had been laid low. Our school was shutting. All the schools were shutting. The whole of New York was soon in lockdown.\n\nBack then I remember thinking how different this was to stories of the past. Whether it was war or disaster, there was always a plane to take you away to safety; always a refuge at the end of a harrowing ordeal. With Covid-19, however, there was no plane; there was no refuge. In this planetary pandemic, the entire world was a trouble-spot.\n\nAlso this was the first time my family was living the same story of disaster that I had to cover. They were subject to the same risks and dangers. They felt the same tensions and concerns. And for us there was an extra layer of anxiety. My wife, Fleur, is seven months pregnant.\n\nSo some of those headlines now came like thunderbolts.\n\nA top New York hospital was barring partners from being present at the birth. Other maternity wards were following suit. Delivery rooms were being placed in Covid isolation: women sequestered from their partners, partners sequestered from their newborns.\n\nNew life in the time of coronavirus. The magical realism of birth was becoming something altogether more dystopian.\n\nIn pre-pandemic times - how quickly we've adopted the language of the before and the after - many New Yorkers suffered from a paranoia known as FOMO. The fear of missing out. Those who can afford it want to dine in the most fashionable new restaurants. Go see the hottest new Broadway show. Attend the latest gallery opening.\n\nBut the virus was something that everyone wanted to miss out on - the talk of the town that nobody wanted to speak of from firsthand experience.\n\nAs the skies emptied of planes and we got used to seeing avenues without yellow cabs, the sound of the city changed. First we could hear the birds. Then they were drowned out by the sirens. Morning, noon and night. A ceaseless din. An unnerving din.\n\nThe city that never sleeps became the city that couldn't sleep. And the fear was the ambulance outside your window would become an ambulance outside your door. To a city known for its bravado and life abundant, the coronavirus brought an overriding sense of fear.\n\nJust as people became scared of paramedics, people became frightened of hospitals - especially those with the white refrigerated trailers ranked outside, the city's mobile morgues that we hadn't seen on the streets since the days after 9/11.\n\nThen, in this home of New World modernity, we witnessed something that seemed grotesquely medieval. The bodies of the unclaimed, those who had no next of kin, placed in plain wooden boxes, ferried across to an island near the Bronx and buried in a mass grave.\n\nThere was something inevitable about the world's most global city becoming the epicentre of a worldwide contagion. But few expected death on such an immense scale.\n\nOnce again, this city has become Ground Zero: that haunting phrase from the attacks of 11 September that New Yorkers hoped would never be applied here again. That was surely the city's most awful day. This surely has been its most awful season.\n\nMy first symptoms came on a Friday night, a weariness I put down to weeks of covering the outbreak, and the new parental juggle of helping to home school our kids. Then came the muscle pain, the cough, the numbing of my taste buds. Much more worryingly, Fleur was developing a fever. Then she had the cough, what felt like a weather system on her lungs, the chronic fatigue and the tell-tale shortness of breath.\n\nNew York attracts optimists. We both believed we'd be among those who only experienced mild symptoms. But Fleur's condition was deteriorating. Those sirens outside sounded even more threatening than before.\n\nThe symptoms got worse in the evening. With the coronavirus, darkness brought more menace. And late one night, when Fleur was struggling to breathe properly, we feared we would have to reach for the phone to call that much-feared number, 911.\n\nFewer things are more frightening than watching a loved one struggle to finish a sentence for lack of breath, and especially when that sentence is a matter of life and death.\n\nSleep usually brought some comfort, and did so again. Thankfully Fleur rallied. Her breathing improved. We could see that her blood oxygen levels were okay. She avoided hospitalisation.\n\nSlowly, over the next few days, the clouds began to part. And eventually came the brilliant sunshine of full recovery. We could be counted amongst the fortunate, and we became even more mindful of the dead, and the loved ones they left behind.\n\nEven in the midst of so much mourning, there have been uplifting New York moments.\n\nThe coronavirus has not crushed the charismatic personality of this city. We've seen firefighters pulling up outside hospitals then standing to applaud the nurses and doctors - the heroes of 9/11 saluting the new superheroes of Covid-19.\n\nThere's been the cheering and pot-banging every evening at seven, reverberating off the glass cliff-faces of Manhattan's skyscrapers and echoing through the outer boroughs. There have even been communal sing-alongs. One night it was Bill Withers Lean on Me. On another it was Frank Sinatra's rousing Big Apple anthem, New York, New York.\n\nBut for those who have suffered not just from the virus, but the economic contagion that has ravaged this city, the famous line from that song - If I can make it there, I'll make it anywhere - must now sound like a taunt.\n\nHow can you make it when your workplace is shutdown? How can you make it when there are no tables to clear or plates to scrub? When your shop is boarded up with plywood, as if a hurricane is about to rip through - which, economically, it has. Every single shutdown day.\n\nIn this hub of immigrant ambition and American abundance, we have witnessed scenes that look like they belong more in the days of the Great Depression. One of the neighbourhoods worst affected is a place called Corona in Queens. And there we have seen queues outside a food bank that stretched more than 200 yards, the length of the line a measure of the desperation.\n\nCleaners, restaurant workers, labourers. The economic victims of Covid-19. People who only six weeks ago had full-time jobs, now forced to rely on welfare to feed their families. Here they lined up for hours for the most meagre of provisions. A sandwich, some sweet corn, a small carton of milk, a pot of apple sauce, in this the land of plenty.\n\nIn low-income immigrant communities, American dreams are being crushed by this global scourge.\n\nMany rich New Yorkers, the city's one per cent, have simply left town, and headed for their country getaways in the Hudson Valley or coastal retreats in the Hamptons. That is not an option for the poor, many of whom live in multi-generational family dwellings, sometimes in one-bedroom apartments shared by 10 people.\n\nSo the coronavirus has been a tale of two cities, with Hispanics and African Americans being killed at twice the rate of white New Yorkers. Poverty has been a propagator of the pandemic. Hardship has been a super-spreader.\n\nWe're living through another time of \"Buddy can you spare me a dime\". Let's hope it doesn't become an era.\n\nWhen Covid hit, the United States was also among the vulnerable, and the virus has exposed so many of its long-term ailments - its income disparities, racial inequality, democratic sickliness, inoperative government, toxic polarisation, decline of reason, the downgrading of science, the lessening of its global influence, the absence of its global leadership.\n\nAll have intersected and metastasized in this fatal moment. For a lifelong lover of America, it has been tragic to witness.\n\nI live in one of the most impatient cities on the planet. They talk here of the New York minute. It means right away, immediately, without hesitation. But while parts of the Empire State will be able to start the gradual process of reopening in mid-May, the urban density of New York City means it will have to go at an uncharacteristically slower pace.\n\nEvery night at nine o'clock, the Empire State Building is illuminated in a red and white siren light to honour the emergency workers providing care. It's a ritual, at once staggeringly beautiful and ominously sinister, that will continue until this crisis is over.\n\nBut that's the unanswerable question - when will New York return to being New York.",

    "New coronavirus data shows London ethnic breakdown": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "New NHS data has revealed ethnic breakdowns among the patients in London hospitals who have died with coronavirus.\n\nBlack people account for 13% of the city's population but 16% of deaths.\n\nEpidemiologist Dr Shikta Das said there was a high rate of ethnic minority people among front line workers, who were exposed to greater risk.\n\nBut Dr Das said it was difficult to draw conclusions as data needed to be more specific to areas of London.\n\nLondon has seen nearly 5,000 deaths linked to the virus.\n\nNHS data, obtained by the BBC, analysed 3,929 deaths by ethnicity and showed a disproportionate number of black people had died from Covid-19 in London hospitals.\n\nThe majority of the patients that died - 55% - were from a white background, but white people make up a larger proportion of the capital's population. Similarly, proportionately fewer Asian people died with coronavirus.\n\nDr Das said she believed one factor was that ethnic minorities were over-represented in many key worker industries and were at a greater risk of becoming infected.\n\n\"Viral load is how much you are exposed to an infectious disease,\" she explained.\n\n\"Twenty per cent of all NHS workforce are from an ethnic minority background. The figure for doctors is 44%.\n\n\"In this situation the BAME group is a doctor, a nurse, a technician, bus drivers, shelf stackers, care workers - all these groups of people are getting more exposed to Covid directly.\n\n\"Bus drivers were meeting people all of the time, doctors and nurses cannot care for a patient 2m away from them\n\n\"The more exposure you have the more lethal that dosage is. So it is no surprise that these people are dying\"\n\nFigures also showed that only 1.3% of London patients who died were under the age of 40, while 87% were aged at least 60 and just under half were 80 or older.\n\nAmong those to have become infected with coronavirus were two sisters, Esther Akinsanya and Mary Idowu.\n\nOn 11 April - and just hours apart - they were taken to the south-east London hospital they had both worked at for decades after showing symptoms.\n\nMs Akinsanya, who was born in Lagos in Nigeria but moved to the UK in the early 1990s, worked as a healthcare assistant at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Woolwich, along with Mary.\n\nHer son Samuel Akinsanya explained that despite his mother having no clear underlying health problems she succumbed to the virus and died suddenly.\n\n\"Even in her last words to me she was telling me to look out for my sister,\" he said. \"She knew something was going on and that's what breaks my heart.\n\n\"That will always stick with me, but what has struck me since is just how well connected my mum was and how well respected she was.\n\n\"So, I need to be strong and continue her legacy.\"\n\nHe added: \"Her mind was colossal, but what baffled me was seeing how she deteriorated so quickly.\n\n\"I've heard a lot about ethnic minorities being affected but it should not matter what skin colour or nationality people are.\n\n\"This virus is killing people and we need to look after our NHS and can't take it for granted.\"",

        "body": "France, Italy and Spain have registered the lowest daily death tolls for weeks as they prepare to ease restrictions.\n\nFrance reported 135 deaths; Spain's 164 were the lowest since mid-March; and Italy's 174 was a two-month low.\n\nMeanwhile French doctor has claimed new tests on samples from patients show the virus was present in the country last year - weeks before the first officially recorded case.\n\nIn Russia the virus appears to be advancing, with 10,000 new infections.\n\nBut Russia's mortality rate remains low relative to other countries. On Sunday it recorded 58 deaths, taking its total to 1,280.\n\nThe UK recorded 315 new deaths and has the third-highest number of deaths behind the US and Italy. However British officials say the outbreak has peaked and the number of new hospital admissions is declining.\n\nGlobally the pandemic has seen nearly 3.5 million people infected and nearly 250,000 people have died.\n\nThe number of new recorded deaths is the lowest since late March, when only deaths in hospitals were being recorded. The new figures include deaths in care homes and have been declining for several days.\n\nMeanwhile an intensive care chief in the Paris region has told local media that the virus was present in France on 27 December - a month before the first cases were confirmed.\n\nYves Cohen told BFMTV that his team had revisited negative tests for flu and other coronaviruses on 24 patients who had been in hospital with respiratory symptoms in December and January.\n\n\"Of the 24 patients, we had one positive result for Covid-19 on 27 December when he was in hospital with us,\" he said, adding that the test had been repeated several times to confirm the result.\n\nDr Cohen said he had reported the case to the regional health authorities and called for other negative tests from the same period to be retested.\n\nFrance is planning to lift its lockdown on 11 May, when children will return to school in phases, some businesses will reopen and people will be able to travel within 100 kilometres (60 miles) of their homes without the need for a document giving a reason for their movement.\n\nHowever on Sunday Health Minister Olivier Veran said this would depend on further falls in the number of new infections, particularly in the worst-affected areas like the Paris region and northeast France.\n\nFrance also clarified that a rule requiring anyone entering the country to go into isolation for two weeks did not apply to people arriving from EU countries, the Schengen area or the UK.\n\nSpain's death toll of 164 was the lowest for a month-and-a-half and was more than a hundred down on Saturday's figure.\n\nOn Saturday adults were able to exercise outdoors on Saturday for the first time in seven weeks. The lockdown was eased for children under 14 a week ago.\n\nPrime Minister Pedro Sanchez said Spain was reaping the rewards of the sacrifices made during the lockdown, one of Europe's strictest.\n\nOn Monday masks will become compulsory on public transport and some small businesses such as hairdressers will open for individual customer appointments.\n\nItaly registered the lowest daily number of coronavirus-related deaths since just after its lockdown started two months ago. Both the numbers of new infections and patients in intensive care have continued to fall.\n\nThe country is relaxing its lockdown from Monday, when Italians will be able to exercise as long as they respect rules on maintaining physical distance. They will also be able to visit relatives - but not friends - within their region.\n\nHowever schools, cinemas and most shops will stay shut. Bars and restaurants are due to start allowing customers to sit at tables in June.\n\nItaly's death toll stands at 28,884 - second only to the US where more than 68,000 people have died.\n\nThe UK's death toll is 28,446 while in Spain and France 25,100 people and 24,729 people respectively have died.",

The walk - although slow - was very hard and I almost missed my train back to London.\n\n\"And that's where I started showing signs of pneumonia, and the doctor was totally convinced it was Covid-19 at the root of it, although I wasn't tested to confirm it formally.\n\n\"I returned to work after three weeks of rest having fully understood what the illness was.\"\n\nIn December, Edwards revealed he had undergone a physical and mental \"transformation\" since taking up boxing training.\n\nThe newsreader also defended the impartiality of the BBC, saying it was attacked equally by those on the right and the left.\n\nConcluding, and speaking about the future of the BBC, he said the \"contribution and reach\" of the corporation was \"undeniable\" and that it had always been the \"convenient whipping servant for politicians of all colours\".",

    "Number of 'excess deaths' in Wales rises by 31%": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "How many people in Wales are dying because of coronavirus?\n\nAccording to Public Health Wales figures, at least 983 people to date have died with Covid-19 in Wales. While the Office for National Statistics - which counts deaths at home, in care homes and in hospices, not just hospitals - had already put the figure at over 1,000 by 28 April.\n\nBBC Wales' Social Affairs Correspondent Daniel Davies looks at whether the country's 'excess deaths' figures could help show the true extent of the pandemic.\n\nThe true extent of Covid-19 deaths will be higher than the daily tally of lives lost in hospitals.\n\nVictims of the virus might not have been tested to confirm they had it, especially those who die at home or in a care home.\n\nThat is why it is worth paying attention to how many more people have died - from all causes - than we would normally expect.\n\nIncreases in deaths above the average for the last five years are known as 'excess deaths' - and they have risen sharply.\n\nIt is a traditional indicator of the severity of pandemics, as well as other dangerous events such as heatwaves and harsh winters.\n\nSince Covid-19 started claiming lives, excess deaths are up 31% in Wales, according to figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS).\n\nThese are all registered deaths, including people who died in the community, not just in hospital.\n\nWales and England saw an unprecedented increase in deaths In the week ending 17 April.\n\nIn Wales, 1,169 people died - much higher than the five-year average of 661.\n\nBut the overall increase is greater than the 409 deaths where Covid-19 was a factor.\n\nCauses of death are given by a doctor who completes a medical certificate of cause of death (MCCD).\n\nThe rules on completing them have been relaxed, so doctors don't have to spend so much time away from patients during the pandemic.\n\n\"With the practice of death certification, a lot of clinical judgement necessarily comes into play,\" said Dr Roland Salmon, a former director of Public Health Wales' communicable disease surveillance centre.\n\n\"Is it caused by the disease that's circulating? Is it caused by another disease that an elderly person might have? Is it caused by some other circumstances?\"\n\nIn some cases people may not have obvious symptoms or the doctor may not be convinced Covid-19 was a factor.\n\n\"There's always this element of judgement that necessarily comes in just to reflect the way that doctors have to practice,\" Dr Salmon said.\n\nThe \"latitude\" that doctors have, as Dr Salmon puts it, could help explain why excess deaths are higher than the death toll directly attributed to Covid-19.\n\nEven where coronavirus has played a role, a doctor completing the certificate might not feel it was the main cause. Some deaths could be recorded as being due to pneumonia or other lung conditions.\n\nHigh levels of excess deaths could also be a sign that people are missing out on healthcare as a result of the pandemic.\n\nA similar picture has emerged across Europe. Deaths have shot up in many countries recently.\n\nAt the start of the outbreak, the NHS's worst-case scenario for coronavirus estimated it could cause up to 35,000 excess deaths in Wales - more than double the number of deaths in a normal year.\n\nDr Salmon said we could have a better idea of how we are faring in June.\n\nMeanwhile, the daily updates on what is happening in hospitals help us understand the spread of the disease - and will be crucial in determining when to lift the lockdown.\n\nBut it will be some time before we get a full picture of how severe coronavirus has been and just how many people have died while it has been circulating.",

        "body": "Nearly half of people in Britain experienced \"high anxiety\" as the country's lockdown began, an Office for National Statistics survey suggests.\n\nAnxiety levels were highest among an estimated 8.6 million people whose income fell, according to the weekly survey on the impact of coronavirus.\n\nRenters and the self-employed were also particularly affected.\n\nMeasures of well-being were at their lowest levels since records began in 2011, the ONS said.\n\nThe survey's finding suggested that more than 25 million people - 49.6% of over-16s in Britain - rated their anxiety as \"high\", more than double the amount who did so at the end of 2019.\n\nThose suffering the greatest level of worry were an estimated 2.6 million people who said they were struggling to pay bills.\n\nThe survey data suggested that 8.6 million people had seen their income fall, with this group also reporting anxiety levels 16% higher than average.\n\nWomen reported anxiety levels 24% higher than men on average, with the ONS saying the difference might be because a larger proportion of women were either economically inactive, in lower paid jobs or working part time.\n\nDavid Shaw, who has been signed off work with anxiety, is trying to juggle providing for his family with the care of his severely disabled 16-year-old daughter, who has scoliosis.\n\nMr Shaw, who manages a supermarket in Brandon, Suffolk, said: \"My daughter would be extremely vulnerable to the virus and I can't risk bringing the virus home to her.\"\n\nThe 43-year-old said his employer was a good company and gave him two weeks carers' leave, but he added he was no longer being paid.\n\nMr Shaw said: \"I can get a mortgage holiday but that is just one bill. I am not sure if the doctor will keep signing me off so I don't know what I will do.\"\n\nHe added he felt guilty that his colleagues were working while he was not but that he had to put his daughter's safety first.\n\nLucy Tinkler, head of the quality of life team at the ONS, said: \"All measures of personal well-being, which include anxiety and happiness, are at their worst levels since we began collecting data in 2011.\"\n\n\"The most recent data showed a slight improvement in anxiety compared to previous weeks, but remained much higher than before the pandemic.\"\n\nThe ONS is carrying out a weekly opinions and lifestyle survey of about 1,500 people to understand the impact of the coronavirus on Britain, and comparing it with the results of a similar survey it normally carries out monthly.\n\nIt found the average reported anxiety level rose from 2.97 out of 10 at the end of 2019 to 5.18 at the end of March as the lockdown was beginning.\n\nIn the most recent survey, from 9 April to 20 April, that fell slightly to 4.2.\n\nAm I experiencing anxiety?\n\nMost people feel anxious from time to time but if it is affecting your life then there are things you can do to help yourself and ways to seek help.\n\nSymptoms of anxiety can include headaches, a faster heartbeat, feeling tense, difficulty sleeping, problems concentrating and not being able to enjoy leisure time.\n\nThe NHS suggests ways to manage anxiety including breathing exercises, eating healthily and exercising. More advice is available from mental health charity Mind which has published wellbeing advice for the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nThe proportion of Britons reporting low happiness also rose sharply from 8.4% at the end of 2019 to 20.7% at the end of March.\n\nFinances were the biggest worry for an estimated 5.3 million people, while 6.2 million were most concerned about their work and 8.5 million most concerned about their well-being, the survey suggested.\n\nLucretia Thomas, a project adviser at Citizens Advice Enfield, said it had had a \"spike\" in people asking for advice about employment, benefits and debt issues as the pandemic prevented many people from working.\n\n\"The loss of income has really had a devastating effect on families, because their normal household expenses have increased,\" she said, explaining that families were often missing out on free school meals.\n\nPeople were also reporting that landlords had been issuing notices in preparation for when evictions might resume in June, she said, adding to the stress for some families.\n\nOthers are saying that their employers are preparing to make them redundant once the furlough period is over.\n\n\"People are ringing us for reassurance, thinking that we might have a timeline for when this is over. A client asked me, 'When do you think my husband might be able to go back to work?' I'm not able to answer that question,\" Ms Thomas said.",

A number of players and sports medics have already voiced their concerns about whether it is safe to return to action.\n\nEamonn Salmon, the chief executive of the Football Medicine and Performance Association (FMPA), has told BBC Sport that opinion among doctors and physios at English football clubs regarding resumption plans was varied.\n\nSpeaking last week, he said: \"I guess the views of our members will be a kind of snapshot of society really.\n\n\"There are those who think it can be done, there are those that are doubtful and there are those that probably suggest it is an impossible task.\n\n\"We have to wait, this is a waiting game all the time, it is such a changing landscape and fluctuating on a day to day basis.\n\n\"This is just the start in some respects, whatever proposals are put there it is then open to debate and for comment and opinion to feed into that.\"\n\nIf training is resumed before social distancing rules are relaxed, BBC Sport understands players will be tested for coronavirus twice a week and would be screened for symptoms every day.\n\nAll tests would be carried out by health professionals at a drive-through NHS testing facility that each club would have access to. Training grounds will be optimised for social distancing and high hygiene levels.\n\nIn addition:\n\nIn Germany, where the Bundesliga is set to become the first major football league in Europe to return to competition, 10 positive results have been returned from 1,724 coronavirus tests from clubs in the top two divisions.\n\nCubs have been training in groups and the tests are being taken before a planned return to training as teams.\n\nMeasures including \"the isolation of the affected person\" have been taken, said the DFL.\n\nTop-flight side Cologne have had no further Covid-19 infections after three people tested positive last week.\n\nBundesliga officials suggested resuming on 9 May but the government delayed the decision and a restart may now be on 16 or 23 May.",

    "Q&A: Is testing in Wales following the science?": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "The phrase \"following the science\" has been ever present throughout the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nIt is a term used by policy makers to justify their response, both in Wales and across the UK.\n\nBut as testing strategies and numbers have begun to differ between Wales and England, is it still right to say everybody is following the science?\n\nAnd what is that science?\n\nBoth nations have been working to increase the number of tests they are able to offer, but England has been more successful at doing this quickly.\n\nThe statistics appear to show that England has been able to pull ahead significantly from the other UK nations in the number of people it has been testing.\n\nAs of 15 May, around one person in every 37 had been tested in England, while it was more like one in every 67 in Wales.\n\nHowever, England's figures include test kits sent out in the post, but not yet complete.\n\nThe other big difference between Wales and England has been the criteria for being tested.\n\nIn Wales, the focus is still mainly on key workers, while in England tests are also being offered to over-65s who have symptoms, as well anyone traveling for work with symptoms, like a plumber.\n\nHowever, there is a debate over whether simply testing more people is helpful.\n\nWales' Chief Medical Officer Dr Frank Atherton has previously suggested he did not believe in \"testing for testing's sake.\" So, is there such a thing?\n\nSian Griffiths, emeritus professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, co-chaired the inquiry into the original SARS outbreak.\n\nShe said testing must have a purpose to be helpful. For the most part, she said that meant being able to follow up any test with a track and trace system.\n\n\"Until we have enough tests to break the transmission of disease, all you're doing is identifying cases,\" she said.\n\n\"That may help you, because you give the close family of that person clarity, but it doesn't help you because you haven't actually traced the disease, understood its epidemiology and the community.\"\n\nCurrently no UK nation is at the stage of being able to test, track and trace.\n\nAs outlined above, England has a wider criteria of people who can be tested, including anyone aged over 65 with symptoms.\n\nThis is where the phrase \"following the science\" comes in, although in reality science has several schools of thought on this.\n\nProf Karl Friston, from University College London, has been working on mathematical modelling for coronavirus and is part of Sage, a group of UK scientists offering independent analysis to the UK government's official advisory group.\n\n\"There's absolutely no rationale for selective testing of people who are 65 and symptomatic,\" he said when asked into which scientific school of thought England's strategy fitted.\n\nPart of the reason for this is because anyone over the age of 65 with symptoms would already be self-isolating and, therefore, could not pass the virus on, regardless of whether resources went in to testing them, he said.\n\n\"There are several reasons why you might be testing.\n\n\"If you're a doctor, or you're a care manager or you're a ward sister, and you need to know where to best care for this person. You need to know whether they're positive.\n\n\"If you are a chancellor and are worried about the economy, your agenda will be to get people back to work.\n\n\"You certainly don't want them sequestered in self-isolation unnecessarily. So you're going to want to test those people.\"\n\nProf Friston said a third school of thought would be to offer random screening tests to large numbers of people. That would help you gauge what proportion of the overall population may be infected at any one time.\n\nThis type of testing was carried out in England last week.\n\nThe perfect science, if you like, for driving virus numbers down would be a robust test, track and trace policy.\n\n\"If person X has symptoms they need a test and then they need to go into isolation,\" said Prof Griffiths.\n\n\"Their contacts need to be identified, traced and told to go into isolation/quarantine.\n\n\"If the test is positive, everyone stays in quarantine for two weeks and contacts should ideally be tested to see if they are infected. If the test is negative everyone can be reassured they don't have Covid.\"\n\nLast week, the Welsh Government announced 1,000 staff would be needed to implement just such a test, track and trace policy.\n\nThe subject of testing in care homes has also proved to be divisive.\n\nIn England, all care home residents have been eligible to be tested since late April, while in Wales the criteria had until very recently been narrower, with eligible care homes needing to have already had a positive case, or have more than 50 residents.\n\nBack at the end of April, First Minister Mark Drakeford said there would be \"no value\" in providing tests to all care home residents, but that stance appears to have changed following complaints that England was doing more.\n\nAt the weekend, Health Minister Vaughan Gething announced testing would be rolled out to all care home residents and staff in Wales. A move the Welsh Government said was inspired by \"the latest scientific evidence\".\n\nIt now means the last outstanding difference between the nations is England's target to have tested all of its care home residents and staff by early June, while Wales has said it aims to do the same \"shortly.\"\n\nBut what do the experts make of testing all care home residents regardless of symptoms?\n\nProf Gabriel Scally, President of Epidemiology and Public Health section, Royal Society of Medicine, said it was far more important what the nations do with the information they get about infections in care homes.\n\n\"My concern is more that we have a full system in place to test and trace every case,\" he said.\n\n\"Without that, simply saying we're going to test everyone in a care home by June is tokenistic.\n\n\"It may tell you the extent of infection within care homes, but what you then do with that information is more important.\"\n\nSouth Korea has been seen as something of a bench mark in testing.\n\nIts close proximity to China meant it was viewed as having the potential to be one of the worst-affected nations.\n\nHowever, South Korea was quickly able to expand and roll out an aggressive test, track and trace system and has now recorded a fraction of the number of deaths and confirmed cases seen elsewhere.\n\nSo, why didn't we just do that here?\n\n\"I think we're being driven by the resources and availability of testing,\" said Prof Griffiths.\n\n\"What we'd like to do, and what we're able to do are not the same thing at the moment.\"\n\nProf Griffiths said experiencing the Sars outbreak in the early 2000s enabled East Asian countries to be far-better prepared.\n\n\"The whole of the UK was disadvantaged by the fact that we didn't have a testing industry.\n\n\"My experience is mainly in the far east, and you will have seen that, Hong Kong, Korea, Singapore China have done many more tests.\n\n\"The reason for that is that they have had the experience with Sars and they know that the way to get through this is to be able to identify cases, track their contacts, put them in isolation and break the chain of transmission.\n\n\"We didn't have the capacity to do that. We started, as we had a few cases we were able to do contact tracing effectively.\n\n\"But as the numbers grew we were then unable to do the community containment, which relies on testing, and the policy changed.\"\n\nThe lack of existing testing resources in Wales and the rest of the UK has meant there has been a need to order in from overseas.\n\nIt is arguably one of the biggest problems in expanding testing, as ministers have eluded to.\n\nExplaining the decision to abandon the Welsh Government's target to have 5,000 test a day by mid-April, the first minister explained: \"We were relying on equipment coming to Wales from overseas. We were relying on some reagent chemicals coming to Wales from overseas.\n\n\"Those deliveries haven't arrived to the timescale we had hoped.\"\n\nProf Griffiths agreed competing in the global market for testing equipment was difficult.\n\n\"It would probably be a more sensible approach to work as the four nations of the UK together on the ability to get reagents and swabs,\" explained Prof Griffiths.\n\n\"Otherwise you've got little itty bits going in against much larger groups, such as the US. So working together is probably a more effective way of increasing the availability of reagents - and then the vaccine when it's ready.\"\n\nThis is again something with which all nations appear to have struggled. Each has a testing capacity for each day, but very rarely do the actual number of tests done come close to it.\n\nLast week, Wales was doing around 1,200 tests per day despite having a capacity which rose from around 2,000 to around 5,000.\n\nArguably, this means each day there are people who could have been given reassurance about their symptoms who have not been. But the wider scientific picture is more complicated.\n\n\"It depends on how existing tests have been used and whether the capacity to contact trace is in place,\" explained Prof Griffiths.\n\n\"Numbers of cases are lower in Wales and therefore lower testing rates might be expected using current testing criteria.\n\n\"As the criteria changes with lockdown release you will expect higher numbers - but to do this you need to have enough tests and contact tracers.\"\n\nIn other words, what matters far more is your ability to apply an army of contact tracers to those tests being done, in order to track down and isolate anyone infected.\n\nOne other key policy difference between Wales and England has been the emphasis on targets.\n\nWhile UK government policy has featured a well-reported target of hitting 100,000 coronavirus tests per day, ministers in Wales have been more vague with time frames.\n\nThey previously refused to re-set targets after dropping plans for an equivalent 5,000 tests by mid-April.\n\n\"Targets are useful in general for getting health services working and doing what they ought to be doing,\" explained Prof Scally, who also sits on the independent Sage group.\n\n\"But it's not so much the tests, it's the people who are tested.\n\n\"I think a big concern should be the date of 12 March when the decision was made in Whitehall, followed by Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, to stop testing in the community.\n\n\"At that time, the chief medical officer of England said it was to pivot the testing towards hospitals. It was extended to hospital workers and key workers and then care homes.\n\n\"But what hasn't happened, is that there hasn't been a testing system set up in the community.\n\n\"So, I'm not so much concerned about the absolute number of tests performed, but where they're being performed and whether they're delivering the information we need.\"\n\nLast week, the Welsh Government announced an ambition to up testing to 10,000 and then 20,000 tests per day over the coming weeks and months.\n\n\"I would have thought 20,000 should be able to do the job,\" said Prof Scally.\n\n\"Of course, it depends on the number of cases that are out there and multiplying. You won't know what that is to start so it's a kind of a chicken-and-egg situation.\n\n\"I would have thought, if you've got 20,000 tests available a day then that would be a really, really major contribution.\n\n\"That should be enough to make it work in Wales, if it's set up properly and locally, and well organised.\"",

    "Remdesivir: Drug has 'clear cut' power to fight coronavirus \" Heykayjones Blog": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "There is \"clear-cut\" evidence that a drug can help people recover from the coronavirus, say US officials.\n\nRemdesivir cut the duration of symptoms from 15 days down to 11 in clinical trial at hospitals around the world.\n\nThe full details have not been published, but experts said it would be a \"fantastic result\" if confirmed, but not a \"magic bullet\" for the disease.\n\nA drug would have the potential to save lives, ease pressure on hospitals and allow parts of lockdown to be lifted.\n\nRemdesivir was originally developed as an Ebola treatment. It is an antiviral and works by attacking an enzyme that a virus needs in order to replicate inside our cells.\n\nThe trial was run by the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) and 1,063 people took part. Some patients were given the drug while others received a placebo (dummy) treatment.\n\nDr Anthony Fauci who runs the NIAID said: \"The data shows remdesivir has a clear-cut, significant, positive effect in diminishing the time to recovery.\"\n\nHe said the results prove \"a drug can block this virus\" and were \"opening the door to the fact that we now have the capability of treating\" patients.\n\nThe impact on deaths is not as clear cut. The mortality rate was 8% in people given remdesivir and 11.6% in those given a placebo, but this result was not statistically significant, meaning scientists cannot tell if the difference is real.\n\nIt is also not clear who is benefiting. Is it allowing people who would have recovered anyway to do so more quickly? Or is it preventing people from needing treatment in intensive care? Did the drug work better in younger or older people? Or those with or without other diseases? Do patients have to be treated early when the virus is thought to peak in the body?\n\nThese will be important questions when the full details are eventually published, as a drug could have the twin benefit of saving lives and helping to lift lockdown.\n\nProf Mahesh Parmar, the director of the MRC Clinical Trials Unit at UCL, who has overseen the trial in the EU, said: \"Before this drug can be made more widely available, a number of things need to happen: the data and results need to be reviewed by the regulators to assess whether the drug can be licensed and then they need assessment by the relevant health authorities in various countries.\n\n\"While this is happening we will obtain more and longer term data from this trial, and other ones, on whether the drug also prevents deaths from Covid-19.\"\n\nIf a medicine can stop people needing intensive care then the risk of hospitals being overwhelmed is smaller, and there is less need for social distancing.\n\nProf Peter Horby, from the University of Oxford, is running the world's largest trial of Covid-19 drugs. He said: \"We need to see the full results, but if confirmed this would be a fantastic result and great news for the fight against Covid-19.\n\n\"The next steps are to get the full data out and work on equitable access to remdesivir.\"\n\nThe US data on remdesivir has come out at the same time as a trial of the same drug in China, reported in the Lancet medical journal, showed it was ineffective.\n\nHowever, that trial was incomplete because the success of lockdown in Wuhan meant doctors ran out of patients.\n\n\"These data are promising, and given that we have no proven treatments yet for Covid, it may well lead to fast-track approval of remdesivir for treatment of Covid,\" said Prof Babak Javid, a consultant in infectious diseases at Cambridge University Hospitals.\n\n\"However, it also shows that remdesivir is not a magic bullet in this context: the overall benefit in survival was 30%.\"\n\nOther drugs being investigated for Covid-19 include those for malaria and HIV which can attack the virus as well as compounds that can calm the immune system.\n\nIt is though the anti-virals may be more effective in the early stages, and the immune drugs later in the disease.",

        "authors": [],
        "body": "Cancer charities are calling for an urgent plan from the Scottish government to safely restart cancer services disrupted by Covid-19.\n\nThe coronavirus response has seen screening programmes paused, urgent referrals for diagnosis dropping sharply and surgery suspended for many cancer patients.\n\nSpecialists are voiced concerned about the long-term impact on survival.\n\nHospitals have had to change the way they deliver remaining services.\n\nThe Western General Hospital in Edinburgh has managed to keep about 80-90% of non-surgical treatment going through the pandemic.\n\nPatient Jean Greig was worried Covid-19 would adversely affect her treatment for the lung cancer that has spread to her liver.\n\nShe told the BBC: \"The call came in February or March. They said about the coronavirus, and that with the cancer I've got I would be done for, and that I would need to consider maybe a DNR (Do not resuscitate order). So at that, I was shattered.\n\n\"My worry was that they wouldn't do the treatment. That was my greatest concern. I knew this thing was there and it was growing.\"\n\nBut her surgery went ahead, after exploring the risks and treatment options with her oncologist. She is now on her third of four chemotherapy sessions - and things are looking positive.\n\n\"The oncologist has been brilliant. She says the chemo's working, and that the tumour that they saw on my liver is now half the size. So they'll now continue with the therapy in the hope that it will take it away altogether.\"\n\nBut she's still a bit uneasy about coming into the hospital.\n\n\"I still have a wee concern. They're telling me I'm in high risk, and I can't go out, I can't do this, but you can go to the hospital and sit with strangers. It's all a bit weird. They'll obviously do the best that they can to keep it at bay.\"\n\nIn order to do this, the whole hospital has been zoned into Covid and non-Covid areas, including the Cancer Centre. More space has been created in waiting areas and clinics are mostly held remotely by video call.\n\nEveryone who arrives through the front door gets screened for symptoms.\n\n\"We have a clear pathway should anything come up from that,\" says senior oncology charge nurse Jane Curran. \"Yes we have patients that come in with symptoms, but they're managed pretty speedily. I think the system is working very well.\"\n\nDoctors are also learning more about the particular risks for cancer patients who contract coronavirus.\n\nOncologist Dr Larry Hayward said: \"Many of our treatments can suppress the immune system to some degree.\n\n\"So there was an initial assumption across the world I think, that our patients might be particularly vulnerable. But we've been keen to recognise this as an assumption only. We're also engaged in research UK-wide to try to understand in reality what it means.\"\n\nHe added: \"The picture is wider than merely the cancer. There's also the other illnesses that patient might be suffering from, the other past history of that individual, so we're having individual discussions of the risk and benefit of our treatments in the new Covid-19 world.\n\n\"Our estimate to date is that the Covid-19 issue isn't a dramatic extra risk as against the existing known risks of our treatments, and that's a really important message. It's one of the reasons we're able to get on with treatment in many patients.\"\n\nDr Hayward says the biggest impact has been on cancer surgical services.\n\nOf the approximately 32,000 patients diagnosed with cancer every year in Scotland, about 12,000 are usually sent for surgery as their first line treatment. But 85% of cancer specialists who were surveyed by the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh in April said they were carrying out fewer cancer operations.\n\n\"There's been a significant expansion in intensive care provision,\" says Dr Hayward, \"and that's had to use some of the highly trained theatre staff and some of the space in recovery and theatres to allow for that, so there has been a reduction in surgical activity.\"\n\nHe also echoed concerns from the interim chief medical officer Dr Gregor Smith, about a fall in the numbers of people being referred for urgent cancer tests, which could result in later diagnosis and poorer survival rates.\n\n\"A concern that we have is whether new patients are presenting as we'd hope they would with concerning symptoms to their GPs. The influx of new patients that we're really keen to see early in the course of their disease might be falling off if patients are too anxious to see their GPs in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic.\"\n\nMeanwhile national programmes to detect breast, bowel and cervical cancer early have been suspended indefinitely.\n\nJanice Preston, Macmillan's head of services in Scotland, says people need to know when operations and screening will restart.\n\n\"The anxiety that people have over cancer is real,\" she says. \"People on treatment are frightened of getting coronavirus, or of their cancer getting worse if their treatment is altered or delayed. So we need to do as much as possible to address those fears and make sure people know what to expect.\"",

On Sunday, Moscow's total number of cases jumped by 5,948 to a total of 68,606.\n\nA strict lockdown has been imposed in Moscow, where its 12 million residents have been ordered to stay at home with few exceptions.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin has said situation remains \"very serious\", warning Russians to brace for a \"gruelling phase of the pandemic\" in the weeks ahead.\n\nEarlier in the week Russian Prime Minister, Mikhail Mishustin, confirmed he had been diagnosed with Covid-19, the first senior minister in the country to do so.\n\nMr Mishustin, who was appointed as PM in January, was still being treated in hospital on Sunday. His spokesman said he was feeling fine, enabling him to work from hospital.\n\nOn Friday, Russia's housing minister, Vladimir Yakushev, became the second senior minister to be confirmed to have Covid-19.\n\nThe number of confirmed coronavirus cases here is rising steadily each day. The Russian authorities put that down to a big increase in testing - over 40,000 people a day, in Moscow alone.\n\nThey also say up to half of the new cases are people without symptoms - including those detected through screening, like healthcare workers.\n\nStill, the virus is spreading more quickly now in Russia's regions - where hospital facilities are far worse than in the capital and where medics have been complaining they don't have the masks and protective clothing to keep them safe.\n\nAnd even here, in Moscow, some 1,700 people are being admitted to hospital each day, increasing the strain on the system.\n\nPresident Putin has extended a nationwide non-working period until 11 May, saying \"the peak is not behind us\".\n\nBeyond that, the president said his government will consider gradually lifting coronavirus restrictions from 12 May, depending on the region.\n\nLast week, Mr Putin admitted there was a shortage of protective kit for medics on the frontline of the coronavirus crisis.",

        "authors": [],
        "body": "Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary has claimed that if everyone wore face masks on planes and public transport, it would ''eliminate the risk of spreading Covid-19 by about 98.5%''.\n\nMr O'Leary, who wants to restart flights in July, was speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme. He called the government's plan to quarantine travellers for 14 days \"ineffectual\" and \"unmanageable\".\n\nMr O'Leary said the 98.5% figure came from a study by the Mater Hospital in Dublin. He was unable to produce it and the airline directed us instead to a tweet from the hospital.\n\nProf Paul Hunter, who has conducted a review into mask studies, told us he could ''find no valid data to support the claims''.\n\nRyanair directed us to a tweet showing a graphic suggesting surgical masks could cut the risk of transmission to 1.5%.\n\nIt was tweeted on 9 May by the UCD Centre for Precision Surgery at Mater Hospital and was liked more than 500 times.\n\nSimilar versions of this image have been circulating on social media in various countries for about a month.\n\nThe next day, the department posted a reply to the tweet saying: \"The cartoon is, of course, a gross oversimplification.\"\n\nIt said the figures were based on \"approximates\" of infection rates and \"theoretical projections\" about droplet transmissions, \"assuming certain conditions\".\n\nWe have asked Mater Hospital whether it still stands by the figure but it has not given any clarification.\n\nProf Hunter dismissed the 98.5% figure, adding that his ''best guess'' would be that wearing face masks would cut transmission by 10% to 15%.\n\nAs part of his work at UEA Norwich Medical School, he has helped to conduct a systematic review of studies into the effectiveness of mask-wearing in preventing the spread of coronavirus.\n\nHe said there were many factors at play, including the type of mask worn - with some more effective than others at trapping particles. The way the mask is worn is also crucial: ''If you have a loose-fitting mask and you cough, then it will just blast out the side.''\n\n''The current government advice on this - which I think is quite appropriate - is that ideally you should stay at home. If you have to go out into these environments, a face covering will provide a degree of protection but they fall short of this level of protection (98.5%) and to think otherwise would put people at greater danger,'' he adds.\n\nDr Michael Head, senior research fellow in Global Health, University of Southampton, says: \"The number quoted by Michael O'Leary is not reflective of the evidence base. There is very little evidence indicating significant benefits of widespread community use of facemasks.\"\n\nOn 14 May, Ryanair also posted a 20 second clip on its YouTube channel of immunologist Luke O'Neill from Trinity College Dublin, saying studies had shown that \"95% of the viral load [the amount of virus particles] would be trapped by the mask\".\n\n''If we all wear cotton masks on planes that will decrease transmission dramatically,'' Prof O'Neill told the BBC, citing a study looking at oral droplets.\n\nBut he pointed out that an infected person could still transmit the coronavirus when they arrived at their destination.\n\n''I don't see masks as a way to replace quarantine - if someone is infected they could arrive and spread infection.''\n\nThere is not enough evidence either way to determine whether healthy people should use masks in the wider community, according to current guidance from the World Health Organization (WHO).\n\nIt recommends medical masks are worn by people who have the virus and are sick, and by those caring for them.\n\nFace coverings which go over the nose and mouth are now being advised for people in Scotland and England while in certain enclosed spaces, including on public transport and anywhere they can't practise social distancing.\n\nIt's thought that homemade cloth face coverings can help reduce the risk of transmission in some circumstances - they might help stop the spread of coronavirus by people who are contagious but have no symptoms.\n\nBut people are still being told to only use shared transport when the journey is essential and cannot be made in another way.\n\nSome major US airlines, including United, Delta and American Airlines now require their passengers to wear masks or face coverings.",

        "authors": [],
        "body": "The Scottish government has recommended people cover their faces while in some enclosed public spaces, such as shops and public transport.\n\nFirst Minister Nicola Sturgeon said there could be \"some benefit\" in wearing a cloth face covering in places where social distancing was difficult.\n\nBut she said it was \"not a substitute\" for existing lockdown restrictions.\n\nDowning Street said UK ministers were considering the scientific evidence for introducing similar advice.\n\nThe prime minister's official spokesman said a review had been carried out by the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), adding: \"Once a decision has been reached then we'll announce it publicly.\"\n\nThe Scottish government guidance is not mandatory and will not be enforced by the authorities.\n\nMs Sturgeon stressed that the advice related to cloth garments such as a scarf rather than \"medical grade facemasks\" like those used by health and care workers.\n\nThe first minister said evidence about the usefulness of face coverings was \"limited\", but that there may be \"some benefit in wearing a face covering if you enter an enclosed space where you will come into contract with multiple people and safe social distancing is difficult\".\n\nShe said: \"To be clear, the benefit comes mainly in cases where someone might have the virus but is not aware of that because they are not experiencing symptoms and thus not isolating completely.\n\n\"Wearing a face covering in those circumstances could reduce the risk of that person spreading the virus.\"\n\nMs Sturgeon said there was no evidence to suggest that wearing a face covering outdoors was of any benefit.\n\nThe first minister warned that she did not want people to \"think they are invincible\" while covering their face in enclosed spaces such as shops.\n\nShe said: \"It may do some good in limited circumstances, but it cannot and should not be seen as a substitute for the other rules and guidelines.\"\n\nThe Scottish government's national clinical director, Prof Jason Leitch, said earlier this month there was \"no evidence\" to support members of the public wearing protective face masks.\n\nThe government advice says face coverings should not be used by people with asthma or children under the age of two.\n\nIt adds: \"When applying or removing the covering, it is important that you wash your hands first and avoid touching your face.\n\n\"After each use, you must wash the face covering at 60 degrees centigrade, or dispose of it safely.\"\n\nThe guidance also says that it is \"not being made mandatory and will not be enforced at this stage\" due to the \"relatively weak\" evidence of the impact of face coverings on transmission of the virus.\n\nHowever, Ms Sturgeon said this would be kept under review as the government considers how to ease lockdown restrictions.\n\nThe key factor in the Scottish decision is what's called \"asymptomatic transmission\" - people who are infected but not showing symptoms passing on the virus to others.\n\nAlmost a month ago, US government assessed the latest research into this risk and concluded that the public should cover their faces when in confined spaces.\n\nA study in Singapore had found evidence that coronavirus had been spread by people who had not realised they were infected.\n\nIn particular scientists identified the possibility of the virus being passed in a two-day period before symptoms started to show.\n\nDozens of governments are now urging - or ordering - their citizens to cover their faces in an effort to reduce this route of infection.\n\nAs Nicola Sturgeon said, this is not about urging people to rush out to buy professional-grade masks - these are designed to protect medical and care staff and should be reserved for them.\n\nInstead, as in the US, the idea is to devise your own covering, not so much to protect you and as to protect others where distancing isn't possible.\n\nThe UK's government's scientific advisers weighed up the evidence last week and we're now waiting to see whether ministers decide to follow the Scottish example.\n\nWhat is happening in other countries?\n\nOther countries have brought in different rules around the wearing of face masks.\n\nThey are to become compulsory on public transport in Germany, and in supermarkets and pharmacies in Austria.\n\nResidents in Lombardy in Italy must cover their nose and mouth when outside and the French government plans to give out masks to the general public.\n\nAir passengers in Canada must wear a non-medical mask or a face covering, and in the USA, people are advised to wear \"cloth face coverings\" in supermarkets and pharmacies.\n\nMs Sturgeon also announced that all over-70s in Scotland will now be tested for Covid-19 on admission to hospital. They will also be tested every four days throughout their stay.\n\nThe latest figures show that 10,721 people have tested positive for the virus in Scotland, of which 1,754 people are in hospital, and 126 are in intensive care - figures which Ms Sturgeon said \"continue to give us case for cautious optimism\".\n\nMs Sturgeon said a further 70 people who had tested positive for the virus have died, bringing the total under that measure to 1,332.\n\nWider statistics including deaths where Covid-19 was a suspected cause will be published on Wednesday.\n\nMs Sturgeon said: \"These numbers are not and never will be seen as just statistics - behind each and everyone of these numbers is a unique and irreplaceable individual whose loss is a source of grief for their friends and family.\"",

The true number may never be known, but families are asking why so many of their elderly relatives were lost.\n\nAround lunchtime on 8 March, Rosana Castillo met up with some close friends not far from her house in Lucero, a working-class neighbourhood in west Madrid, and, as they did every year, joined a protest to mark International Women's Day. They gave each other a warm hug, held hands and marched to chants of \"Down with the patriarchy\" and \"Feminism will win\".\n\nSpaniards, then, could still venture freely outside and coronavirus, which had already killed several hundred in Italy, felt more like someone else's problem. Castillo, a 60-year-old retired primary school co-ordinator, had seen a few people on the underground wearing surgical masks as a protection, but thought most of them were probably tourists. \"We weren't really talking about it here,\" she said.\n\nBut it was preying on her mind. She had visited Carmela, her 86-year-old mother, hours before at Monte Hermoso, the care home near the square where the women had gathered. Arriving at the main gate, Castillo was told she could not come in. A worker said two residents had contracted Covid-19, the disease caused by the virus, and visits had been suspended.\n\nCastillo had seen Carmela, who had advanced Alzheimer's, three days earlier, when her mother was discharged from hospital after a week's treatment for breathing difficulties. The doctor told her Carmela was going to be fine, that her case was not related to the virus even though she had not been tested.\n\nThe worker said nothing else and went back inside Monte Hermoso. As Castillo exchanged phone numbers with some relatives, she saw another worker rushing away, covering her mouth with a piece of cloth. They had known each other for a long time but, the woman did not stop to talk, Castillo became suspicious. \"At that moment,\" she told me, \"I felt something wasn't right.\"\n\nIt was already widely known, first from China, then Italy, that elderly people with existing health issues were especially vulnerable to the virus. Yet in Spain, where a fifth of the population is above 65, or some 8.9 million people, the government of Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez had done little in response.\n\nAs Castillo followed news of the outbreak, she wondered if enough was being done to protect her mother or, indeed, anyone else. Unable to visit Carmela, her only source of information came from infrequent, and usually very brief, phone calls from Monte Hermoso. No matter how much Castillo asked, few things were said.\n\nConsuelo Dom\u00ednguez, a long-time friend, coincidentally, also had her mother living in Monte Hermoso, a red-brick, private centre with large windows and rooms for up to 130 residents. She, too, struggled to get details. Both daughters knew some staff had gone into isolation with coughs and a fever, the most common symptoms of Covid-19, and were pretty sure there was more going on.\n\nCoronavirus was spreading in Spain at an alarming speed and, on 14 March, the prime minister imposed a state of emergency with a nationwide stay-at-home order. No-one was truly safe.\n\nOn that afternoon, Dom\u00ednguez received an unexpected call from Monte Hermoso. The worker was \"very tense,\" she said, \"you could feel it.\" Surreptitiously, Dom\u00ednguez was told that 70 people had been infected with the virus and at least 10 patients had already died. \"I was frightened,\" she said. Dom\u00ednguez called her friend. \"I couldn't believe it,\" Castillo recalled. \"We weren't being told the truth.\"\n\nCastillo and Dom\u00ednguez alerted journalists and, on 17 March, Monte Hermoso became national news. Only then did the Madrid government reportedly become aware of the devastating outbreak. Nineteen people were already dead.\n\nIt had been a stressful day. In the evening, Castillo received a call from Monte Hermoso. Her mother, who shared her room with another woman in similarly poor health, had a fever. \"It shocked me,\" she said. Castillo knew Carmela was unlikely to survive.\n\nThe relatives created a WhatsApp group, and disturbing messages flowed in. \"Staff were very nervous... Some [residents] were even a little bit delirious,\" said one of a visit two days before they had been halted. Aurora Santos, whose mother was also at Monte Hermoso, recalled seeing residents unwell in the cafeteria around the same time. \"We didn't know anything the management had done,\" she told me, \"the protocols they had followed, nothing\".\n\nShe joined Castillo and Dom\u00ednguez in gathering information. They believed patients with symptoms had not been separated from those without, before the virus spread rapidly through the home. Staff who had been in isolation after falling ill were reportedly not being replaced, while those who continued to work were having to do longer, exhausting shifts. Lacking adequate protection, workers had to make face masks at home. \"We were trying to help, our loved ones were there,\" Dom\u00ednguez said. \"Why weren't they being honest with us?\"\n\nMonte Hermoso, it turned out, was not alone. In fact, nobody seemed to know the true scale of what was going on. For years, Carmen Flores, head of the Patients' Defenders ombudsman group, had warned about precarious conditions in some of Spain's 5,417 care homes. \"The amount of messages we were getting those days was insane,\" Flores told me. \"I was thinking: You can't let these people rot.\"\n\nThree in every four homes in Spain are privately run and many patients, like Carmela, have some of their costs publicly funded. Jos\u00e9 Manuel Ram\u00edrez, president of the federation representing social care managers, said fees received by the residences had not changed in the past decade, a result of years of austerity in Spain.\n\nMany companies had to carry out savings somewhere to make a profit, claimed Flores, who also alleged that some lacked equipment even in normal times, while many operated with minimum staff. Workers' unions also say staffing was insufficient, which Ram\u00edrez rejected. A worker at one care home where more than 90 patients died told me: \"For a long time we had been saying something serious would happen. The conditions were unsustainable. This isn't a surprise at all.\"\n\nCrowded hospitals were having to turn away patients from care homes and send them back, often to die. Many residences did not have oxygen bottles, crucial in treating a disease known to cause severe respiratory problems, or even a doctor. Monte Hermoso, Castillo said, had one doctor, who most days worked only in the mornings.\n\nThe Spanish government had centralised the purchase and distribution of medical material, so the homes asked officials to send tests and protective kits. However, Ram\u00edrez alleged they were not given priority, and pictures emerged of carers wearing gowns made of plastic bags. \"There was nothing that could be done without support,\" he said. \"It was a catastrophe.\"\n\nThe army was deployed to disinfect 1,300 care homes and Monte Hermoso was one of the first. Margarita Robles, the defence minister, said patients, in some places, were found abandoned without care, sometimes dead in their beds, the bodies left for funeral services to retrieve. \"Un horror,\" Flores told me.\n\nAlmost 6,000 people have now died in nursing homes in Madrid, after showing Covid-19 symptoms. \"I think there was a lot of wrongdoing,\" said Castillo. \"These people couldn't shout or say they were unwell. They died in silence and alone.\"\n\nPublic prosecutors are investigating possible crimes including manslaughter for neglect, mistreatment and abandonment. Monte Hermoso has not replied to interview requests by email; when contacted by phone, an employee told me they would not talk to journalists.\n\nAt six in the morning on 22 March, Rosana Castillo got the final call from Monte Hermoso. Carmela had died. Her body was to be cremated, and there would be no chance to say a final goodbye. At home with her husband and son, Castillo paid tribute the only way she could. \"I thought of her with love, and hoped it was as painless as possible.\" Her mother's roommate, Castillo learned later, had died a week before.\n\nAlberto Reyero, councillor for social policies of the Madrid authority, said the homes were not \"sufficiently prepared\" for a crisis of the magnitude brought by the pandemic. At least 48 deaths have been linked to coronavirus at Monte Hermoso, one of 14 facilities where the regional government intervened earlier this month. All 65 residents who remained there had shown symptoms while six were in hospital. Reyero said: \"We all made mistakes.\"\n\nThe task of counting the dead continues in Spain, where the official toll has passed 24,000. It remains unclear how many of the deaths in nursing homes have been included in that total. As many people were cremated or buried without being tested, like Carmela, the disease's true numbers may never be known.\n\nThe Women's Day marches of 8 March are now seen as a symbol of the initial inaction of Spanish authorities. So too was a packed La Liga football match between Real Betis and Real Madrid in Seville and a rally, also in Madrid, staged by the far-right party, Vox.\n\nFinally, though, the worst seems to be over.\n\nAfter pressure from the families, Dom\u00ednguez and Santos began receiving more frequent calls from Monte Hermoso and, on some days, they could see their mothers via video. \"We want to know what happened,\" Santos said, \"to give some meaning to the deaths.\"\n\nIt was 15 days after her mother's death that Castillo received her ashes and that was when reality hit. \"Before, it felt like a dream,\" she told me, \"I thought I could wake up and be with her.\" She plans to drive the family to Meco, her mother's native village outside Madrid, and bury her ashes next to where her father has been laid to rest.",

        "authors": [],
        "body": "Players are \"scared\" about the prospect of returning to action amid the coronavirus pandemic, says Manchester City striker Sergio Aguero.\n\nThe Premier League is hoping to resume the season on 8 June, which would require players to be be back in full training by 18 May.\n\nTop-flight clubs will meet on Friday to discuss options for the restart.\n\n\"The majority of players are scared because they have children and families,\" said 31-year-old Aguero.\n\nSpeaking to Argentine TV station El Chiringuito, the Argentina international Aguero added: \"I'm scared but I'm with my girlfriend here and I'm not going to be in contact with other people. I'm locked in my house and the only person I could infect is my girlfriend.\n\n\"They're saying that there are people that have it and don't have any symptoms but still infect you. That's why I am here at home. Maybe I have the illness and I don't even know.\"\n\nThe Premier League has been suspended since 13 March because of coronavirus but all clubs remain committed to playing this season's 92 remaining fixtures.\n\nAll games are expected to be held behind closed doors and the league is considering making some available on free-to-air TV.\n\nAguero said he and his team-mates, will be \"quite nervous and extra careful\" when they return to work.\n\n\"When one person is ill we will think 'oh what's happening here?'\" he added. \"I hope a vaccine will be found soon so that this all ends.\"\n\nIf training is resumed before social distancing rules are relaxed, BBC Sport understands players will be tested for coronavirus twice a week and will be screened for symptoms every day.\n\nAll tests will be carried out by health professionals at a drive-through NHS testing facility that each club will have access to.\n\nTraining grounds will be optimised for social distancing and high hygiene levels. In addition:\n\nBrighton striker Glenn Murray says some proposed protocols around the Premier League's return to action, such as wearing face masks, are \"farcical\".\n\n\"Face masks is going to be off-putting; it is not going to be natural. People will be ripping them off in games,\" the 36-year-old said. \"It is quite farcical.\n\n\"I understand why people are desperate to get football on. It has to be done in a sensible way and in the right time and in a way that is going to keep everyone safe.\n\n\"There will be ambulances at training and games. Is it fair to take those from the NHS? I don't know.\n\n\"It is not just two squads, there is a lot more involved and it puts more people at risk.\"\n\nArsenal, Brighton and West Ham have opened their training grounds to players for individual work.\n\n\"I understand the public is desperate to get football back,\" said Murray. \"But it is us that are going to be going out there and competing against other teams.\n\n\"We are not talking about guys in one community. We are talking about guys from all over the world who could be possibly carrying the disease. There are so many caveats.\n\n\"Everyone is in different situations. I have children at home. I wouldn't want to jeopardise them. Some footballers have newly born children who might be more susceptible to getting the disease.\n\n\"Some are living with elderly parents. It is a really difficult situation to agree on.\"",

    "Spain tightens mask rules for all older than five": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "Wearing masks is being made compulsory in Spain both indoors and out in public if social distancing is not possible.\n\nOnly children under six and people with health issues are exempt from the law, which comes into force on Thursday.\n\nMany European countries have now made wearing masks a requirement on public transport but the Spanish decree goes further.\n\nSpain has seen one of the worst Covid-19 outbreaks in Europe but is now easing the lockdown gradually.\n\nIt already requires the wearing of masks on public transport and is now strengthening the rules across the population. Spain has reported almost 28,000 deaths and 232,000 infections since March but the rate of infection has declined.\n\nSpain had imposed some of the toughest measures on the continent, including keeping children indoors for six weeks. Prime Minister Pedro S\u00e1nchez addressed parliament on Wednesday ahead of a vote on extending the state of alert for two more weeks.\n\nThe decree states: \"Using masks will be compulsory on the street, in open spaces and any closed place of public use, when it is not possible to maintain a safe distance of at least two metres (6.5ft).\"\n\nWhile children under six are not required to wear masks, all between the ages of three and five are recommended to wear them. According to El Pa\u00eds, that means 45 million people will now have to wear a mask and another 1.3 million will be urged to.\n\nThe law underlines that it is following World Health Organization recommendations to minimise infection in closed and public places where there is a large concentration of people.\n\nIt says wearing masks is justified as it blocks the transmission of infected droplets in areas where safe distances cannot be guaranteed.\n\nYou are exempt if you have a respiratory illness or another health issue or disability that makes wearing a mask impossible.\n\nIn other words, people with asthma, allergies or forms of anxiety will not be liable. No penalties for breaking the law are mentioned and there is no specific type of mask detailed other than that it should cover both nose and mouth.\n\nBy Philippa Roxby, health reporter, BBC News\n\nFace masks or coverings are most useful to stop the person wearing them spreading the virus, particularly if they have any symptoms but also if they don't.\n\nThat's why many countries are now recommending people wear them on public transport and in shops, for example, where they can't stay 2m away from other people.\n\nBut they are by no means fool-proof - if you touch them, if you wear them wrongly and if they are loose around the edges they can become contaminated. And they are not a replacement for washing hands frequently and social distancing.\n\nThey are also not thought to be as relevant when people are outdoors.\n\nThe World Health Organization says only two groups of people should wear masks - those who are unwell with symptoms and those caring for people suspected to have the virus. It also says medical masks - which are usually much tighter and better made - should be kept for healthcare workers, who are most in need.",

I want to pay tribute to the hard work and dedication of staff working across the care sector at this very challenging time.\"\n\nCharity Age NI welcomed the announcement of extra funding, adding: \"It is important, however, that measures are put in place to monitor and review this support to ensure it is adequate in the months ahead.\"\n\nThere are 484 care homes in Northern Ireland, with a total of 16,000 beds. Not all of those beds are occupied.\n\nAcross the UK, about 410,000 people live in care homes, many of which have had cases of Covid-19.",

Among those she addressed in a moving message were grandparents.\n\nNicola Sturgeon said: \"To older people - we are asking you to stay away from your grandkids, from the people you love. That's hard. But it is for your protection - so you can stay around to see them grow up.\"\n\nIn a historic broadcast Prime Minister Boris Johnson told the nation: \"You must stay at home.\"\n\nMr Johnson - who was later diagnosed with Covid-19 and admitted to intensive care - announced people will only be allowed to leave their home for very limited purposes.\n\nFirst Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the incredible measures were necessary to slow the spread of Covid-19, ease pressure on the NHS and save lives.\n\nShe said: \"Let me blunt. The stringent restrictions on our normal day to day lives that I'm about to set out are difficult and they are unprecedented. They amount effectively to what has been described as a lockdown.\"\n\n\"I am not going to sugar coat it in any way. Coronavirus is the biggest challenge of our lifetime.\"\n\nThe first minister announced the Scottish Event Campus (SEC) in Glasgow could be in operation as a temporary hospital within two weeks.\n\nThe \u00a343m NHS Louisa Jordan, named after a hero Scots nurse, opened on 20 April but has yet to admit any patients.\n\nNicola Sturgeon also confirmed several cancer screening programmes - including breast, cervical and bowel - had been suspended, so staff can further concentrate on the battle against Covid-19.\n\nFears had been raised that one of the domino effects of the pandemic would be to put people coming forward with symptoms unrelated to the virus.\n\nThree weeks later it emerged there had been a 72% reduction in urgent suspected cancer referrals by doctors.\n\nDespite the challenges of the lockdown there has been countless uplifting examples of community spirit, from the response to the Ready Scotland volunteer campaign to the weekly Clap For Carers.\n\nA Scottish Sun investigation revealed Scotland's chief medical officer had brazenly flouted her own regulations by visiting her second home on the Fife coast.\n\nDr Catherine Calderwood apologised during the daily press briefing but revealed she had also travelled from Edinburgh to Earlsferry the previous weekend.\n\nAs pressure mounted the chief medical officer was cautioned by Police Scotland and, after further talks with First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, it became clear her position was untenable.\n\nDr Calderwood announced her resignation shortly before 22:00 and was replaced the following morning by her deputy, Dr Gregor Smith.\n\nThat same day nurse Janice Graham became the first NHS worker in Scotland to die from coronavirus, less than 48 hours after it claimed the life of care worker Catherine Sweeney.\n\nMeanwhile, the Queen described the challenge posed by the pandemic as unlike anything the country has faced before.\n\nIn a rare speech, watched by 24 million, the monarch said: \"We should take comfort that while we may have more still to endure, better days will return: we will be with our friends again; we will be with our families again; we will meet again.\"\n\nA more complete picture of Scotland's Covid-19 deaths emerged for the first time.\n\nData from the National Records of Scotland said that 354 deaths had been linked to the virus by 5 April.\n\nThe weekly NRS report includes deaths outside of hospital and those where the coronavirus is a \"suspected\" cause.\n\nOn the day the figures were published BBC Scotland revealed medical professionals had written to the Scottish government to express \"grave concerns\" about the personal protective equipment they had been given.\n\nOn a positive note, 98-year-old Daphne Shah was released from Dundee's Ninewells Hospital after recovering from Covid-19.\n\nHer son Wesley admitted: \"When she left in the ambulance, I honestly never thought I'd see her again.\"\n\nThe first minister announced the lifting of the lockdown is likely to be phased - with some measures remaining in place into next year, \"or beyond\".\n\nNicola Sturgeon said gatherings in pubs and at public events were likely to be banned or restricted for some time to come.\n\nShe was speaking as a new 27-page document, outlining the basis of a lockdown exit strategy, was published.\n\nSince then Ms Sturgeon has admitted Scotland could do things differently from the rest of the UK and recommended people cover their faces while in some enclosed public spaces, such as shops and public transport.\n\nThe month ahead will see a greater focus on testing, growing pressure to support the embattled care sector and the possible lifting of some restrictions in a bid to reboot the economy.\n\nBut governments on both sides of the border will be all too aware that, while the peak may have passed, the UK must be prepared for a second wave of infections.",

Before that access to testing was more limited.\n\nBut Mr Hancock said that now every single resident and worker in English care home was being tested as a matter of routine - and that process would be completed by early June.\n\nThe government is assigning \"clinical leads\" to assess and advise all facilities in England, he added, and the NHS is helping to ensure that residents can see GPs via video link.\n\nAnd local authorities are now being required to carry out daily reviews of the situation in care homes, while care homes have to supply \"timely and accurate\" data so that \"local and national government can support and, where necessary, challenge and act\".\n\nMr Hancock added that the pandemic had acted as a \"catalyst\" for greater integration between health and social care services, claiming \"too often in the past bureaucracy has held them apart.\"",

        "body": "All residents and staff in care homes where someone has coronavirus will be tested, the Welsh Government has said.\n\nUntil now only those with symptoms, or who were being moved into a care home, were being tested for Covid-19.\n\nThe Welsh Government said the \"latest evidence\" prompted the change in policy.\n\nBut the Welsh Conservatives, who called the decision a \"u-turn\", said it should be expanded to all care home residents and workers, in line with England.\n\nUnder the new policy, those living or working in a care home where someone has tested positive for coranavirus will now be tested, with repeat tests to be done a week later.\n\nNeighbouring care homes may also be tested under a system which will use mobile testing units and home testing kits.\n\nThe criteria remains narrower than that in England where all care home staff and residents can be tested.\n\nEarlier this week the Welsh Government was criticised by care workers and opposition parties for not expanding testing to all care home residents and staff.\n\nFirst Minister Mark Darkeford said clinical evidence showed there was \"no value\" in testing everyone, and he feared testing asymptomatic people would \"divert capacity\".\n\nBut Older People's Commissioner Helena Herklots criticised the testing criteria saying rules should be changed in line with England as a \"matter of urgency\".\n\nIn Wales, the daily testing rate remains around 1,000 despite there being capacity to carry out about 2,000 tests.\n\nThe Welsh Government had been criticised for dropping its target of reaching 5,000 tests a day by mid-April.\n\nIn England anyone with symptoms who is over 65, or has to leave the house to work, and others in their households, are eligible for a test.\n\nTests in Wales have only been available for key workers and anyone in hospital experiencing symptoms.\n\nHealth Minister Vaughan Gething, who had previously said testing everyone in care homes was not the best use of resources, said the evidence was under constant review.\n\n\"At the moment, the evidence does not support the blanket testing of everyone who does not have symptoms,\" he said.\n\n\"But, in a care home setting, where there are some people who have symptoms of coronavirus and others who do not, testing everyone, including those who do not, does have a purpose - we will be doing this to help manage outbreaks.\"\n\nWelsh Conservative social care spokeswoman Janet Finch Saunders said the decision amounted to a \"u-turn\" which would be welcomed by residents and staff and their families.\n\n\"Testing can help to reduce the spread of this deadly and horrid virus that is having a devastating impact on the most vulnerable in society,\" she said.\n\n\"We urge the Welsh Government to continue their u-turn and expand testing to all care home residents and staff.\"\n\nPlaid Cymru leader Adam Price asked: \"Why not test staff and residents in every home?\"\n\nHe called on the Welsh Government to publish its evidence, \"so that it can be scrutinised to see how and why it differs from international evidence and best practice that promotes universal testing of all care home staff and residents\".",

    "The 'mystery' of India's low Covid-19 death rate": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "The global media reports are a mixture of relief and bafflement.\n\nThey talk about the \"mystery behind India's lower death rates\" from the Covid-19 infection, and say that India is \"bucking the coronavirus trend\". One talks about the \"Indian exception as death rates in major Indian cities are lower compared to global coronavirus hotspots\".\n\nNearly two months after its first recorded case, Covid-19 infections in the world's second most populous country have passed 27,000, with more than 800 deaths.\n\nOne way to understand the death rate is to track how many days it takes for total deaths to double.\n\nIn India, this is currently at nine days - there were 825 confirmed deaths on 25 April; compared to about half or so of that number on 16 April.\n\nExperts say that's good news. The doubling time for deaths in New York at the same stage of the pandemic was only two or three days, they say.\n\nMany public health professionals and doctors say India's grinding lockdown, which lasted more than a month, could have kept infection and deaths in check.\n\nThe medical journal Lancet says the \"lockdown is already having the desired effect of flattening the epidemic curve\".\n\nOthers believe that India's predominantly young population is helping keep fatalities low - elderly people have an elevated risk of death from the infection.\n\nYet others talk about the possibilities of the presence of a less virulent strain of the virus in India, along with the possibility that its hot weather was diminishing the contagion. Both these claims are not backed by any evidence. In fact, doctors treating critical Covid-19 patients have told me that the contagion is as virulent here as has been reported elsewhere in the world.\n\nSo is India an outlier when it comes to novel coronavirus fatalities?\n\n\"To be totally frank, I don't know and the world doesn't know the answer,\" Indian-American physician and oncologist Siddhartha Mukherjee told journalist Barkha Dutt recently. \"It's a mystery, I'd say and part of the mystery is we are not doing enough testing. If we tested more then we'd know the answer.\"\n\nHe is alluding to both diagnostic tests which determine those who are currently infected and antibody tests to find out whether someone was previously infected and recovered.\n\nThe other question is whether India is \"missing\" Covid-19 deaths.\n\nMost affected countries have inadvertently under-reported deaths. Studying mortality data in 12 countries, The New York Times found that in March at least 40,000 more people died during the coronavirus pandemic than the official death counts. These include deaths from the contagion as well as those from other likely causes.\n\nAnd a Financial Times analysis of overall fatalities during the pandemic in 14 countries found that the death toll from coronavirus may be almost 60% higher than reported in official counts. None of the two studies feature India.\n\nPrabhat Jha of the University of Toronto, who led India's ambitious Million Death Study, believes that to \"do this right, missing deaths have to be considered\".\n\n\"Since most deaths occur at home - and will be for the foreseeable future - in India, other systems are needed,\" Dr Jha told me.\n\nAround 80% of deaths in India still happen at home. This includes deaths from infections like malaria and pneumonia. Maternal deaths, and deaths from sudden coronary attacks and accidents are more often reported from hospitals. \"A lot of people get some medical attention over time, return and die at home in India,\" says Dr Jha.\n\nClearly, counting hospital deaths alone is not going to be sufficient enough to get an accurate number of Covid-19 fatalities.\n\nTrying to get a count from funerals at crematoria and burial grounds would be equally tricky. Many of India's dead are cremated in the open in large swathes of the countryside. Funeral services cater only to a small sliver of the population.\n\nAt the same, there are no reports yet of a massive surge in hospital deaths, which would surely have not gone unnoticed, K Srinath Reddy, president of the Public Health Foundation of India, told me. (For example, a sharp rise in deaths of children in single hospitals in northern India in recent years has been faithfully reported.)\n\nSimilarly, Prof Reddy believes a sharp spike in home deaths over a long period is also not likely to go unnoticed.\n\nIn the absence of a robust public health surveillance system, experts say mobile phones could be used to find out whether there was an unusual surge in influenza-related deaths which could be linked to Covid-19.\n\nMore than 850 million Indians use mobile phones and they could be persuaded to report any unusual death in their villages on a toll-free number. Authorities could then follow up the deaths by visiting the families and conducting \"verbal autopsies\".\n\nCounting deaths has always been an inexact science in India.\n\nSome 10 million people die in India every year. The Million Death Study found that some deaths were overestimated (India had only 100,000 premature HIV deaths in 2005, about a quarter of the total estimated by WHO) and some were underestimated (five times as many malaria deaths as the WHO had estimated.) Also, according to the government's own admission, only 22% of deaths in India are medically certified.\n\nThen there's the question of how to define a Covid-19 death.\n\nSome Indian doctors have reported that many people were dying of Covid-19 symptoms without getting tested or \"treated\". Then there's the question of wrong diagnosis in a country where doctors often misdiagnose the cause of death.\n\nJean-Louis Vincent, a professor of Intensive Care Medicine at Belgium's Erasme University Hospital, told me there was under-reporting of Covid-19 deaths \"in many countries, including India\".\n\n\"When you are told the person had some fever and some respiratory problems before death, you may suspect Covid-19. But it may be something else,\" he said.\n\n\"Death is often preceded by an infection, sometimes minor. If you do not test, you may attribute many deaths to Covid-19 or deny its role altogether. That is why the mortality rates from 1918 Spanish flu varied so much.\"\n\nDr Vincent is not sure whether the death counts tell the whole story about the infection. \"Recording the number of deaths due to Covid-19 is not very meaningful to evaluate the severity of the disease. The number of hospital admissions is somewhat better, but it does not include all deaths outside the hospital,\" he says.\n\nIt is also true, as experts say, that most governments are naturally concerned about reporting deaths to avoid scaring people.\n\n\"But nobody is trying to hide deaths intentionally. You can't hide mass deaths,\" says Dr Jha.\n\n\"Tracking deaths is far more reliable than cases, which are heavily affected by testing biases. But the key is to make sure all deaths or a good random sample or snapshot of deaths is captured.\"\n\nIndia might be missing some deaths and not diagnosing every patient correctly for Covid-19. But the fatalities are unarguably low. Yet, it's too early to say that the country has bucked the trend. \"Let's be frank,\" one expert told me. \"We don't know yet.\"",

    "The Covid 'catastrophe' in southern Russia": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "Dr Ibragim Yevtemirov still coughs every so often as he talks. A paediatric trauma surgeon in Dagestan, in the Caucasus region of southern Russia, his ward had been full of Covid-19 cases for a couple of weeks when he got infected himself.\n\nHe says seven colleagues in his town have now died, including nurses, orderlies and laboratory staff, according to a count kept by local medics themselves.\n\n\"All three doctors on my team got sick. We were replaced by dentists until we recovered,\" Dr Yevtemirov told the BBC by phone from Khasavyurt, where he's now back at work in the central hospital.\n\n\"At the peak, there were 10, 11 patients dying a day here,\" he says.\n\nThe doctor's account of dire shortages and deadly chaos is just one, stark snapshot of a Covid-19 crisis in Dagestan so serious that the republic's chief mufti this week described it to President Vladimir Putin as a \"catastrophe\".\n\nAs the holy month of Ramadan ends this weekend, Akhmad Afandi has been urging people in the mainly Muslim republic not to gather to celebrate Eid with friends and extended family - as it may cause a further dangerous spike in cases.\n\nBut it was a startling interview with the local health minister that first exposed Dagestan's struggle with this epidemic.\n\nThe minister told a blogger that 40 medics had died in the republic: more than the total, official number of Covid-19 fatalities.\n\n\"At the start, the kit we were given was very primitive,\" Dr Yevtemirov explains, from his personal experience.\n\n\"It's not that we weren't worried, but when this epidemic hit there was no alternative. It's like we had to rush straight into battle,\" he says.\n\nThe health minister's interview also revealed that hundreds of people had died of \"community-acquired pneumonia\" in Dagestan - with all the same symptoms as Covid-19 - casting further doubt on Russia's low official mortality rate from coronavirus.\n\n\"Our hospital is full of Covid cases, but only a tiny handful of patients have a confirmed diagnosis,\" Dr Yevtemirov clarifies, saying that most of the swabs the hospital sends off for analysis are recorded as pneumonia.\n\nLike other countries, Russia only adds cases with a positive test result to its daily death toll.\n\n\"Perhaps there's a problem here with the tests, or something. Some think there's been an order from above not to diagnose Covid, but I can only guess,\" the doctor says.\n\nData on how deeply the infection has penetrated Dagestan is also hard to be sure of.\n\nUntil recently, the republic was conducting fewer than 1,000 tests a day, lacking both the equipment and laboratory capacity for more.\n\n\"The hospitals only dealt with the seriously sick, no-one was testing anyone else,\" explains Ziyautdin Uvaisov of advocacy group Patient Monitor.\n\nLike many, Mr Uvaisov believes the spread of the virus was helped by mixed messaging from Moscow, coupled with deep-rooted mistrust of officials.\n\n\"People on TV kept saying it's no worse than normal flu,\" he points out, adding that official orders to stay at home were then widely ignored.\n\nDagestan was always going to be susceptible to coronavirus. Many local men are long-distance truck drivers, criss-crossing Russia to travel to Iran and beyond.\n\nThere are also close links with Moscow and when the Russian capital declared a lockdown at the end of March many Dagestanis flowed back to their villages, unchecked.\n\nThe village of Gurbuki was better served than others to cope.\n\nA brand new hospital was opened in December to great fanfare. But when in April suspected Covid-19 cases began filling up beds, a staggering 50% of medical personnel fell ill.\n\nLocals didn't wait for government help to take action.\n\nVolunteers, mainly young men, began helping out on the wards; others stepped in to set up checkpoints at the village entrance to try to control the infection's spread.\n\nAnd when the hospital began running dangerously low on oxygen, it was volunteers who travelled the 120km (75-mile) round trip to the Dagestani capital, Makhachkala, to refill all the gas canisters they'd begged and borrowed off villagers.\n\n\"At the peak they were travelling three times a day, to bring oxygen for the wards,\" village head Magomedkhabib Mamatgereev told the BBC.\n\n\"The canisters are really heavy and it's a lot of work, but they did it all for free. They're our heroes!\"\n\nDespite their efforts, at least 10 people have died in the local hospital and some 30 in the village itself.\n\n\"Of course we expected more from the Dagestani government, but I don't want to criticise anyone,\" the village head reflects. \"At the start we had nothing: no PPE, no medicine. We hoped the virus wouldn't affect our village,\" he admits.\n\nThe sudden focus on Dagestan has brought belated promises of urgent, extra resources from Moscow - though Vladimir Putin appeared to blame local people for the \"complications\", suggesting too many had tried to treat themselves at home.\n\nAn inspection team confirmed the republic's poor testing capacity for Covid-19, a lack of PPE, medicine - and even medics.\n\nBut there are signs that the immediate crisis is beginning to ebb.\n\n\"Fewer people are being brought in and fewer are dying,\" Dr Yevtemirov confirmed, adding that staff at his hospital in Khasavyurt do now have protective clothing.\n\nBut he's concerned that Eid celebrations could shake the new, tentative stabilisation.\n\nPeople have been crowding local markets, he says, despite imams sending WhatsApp warnings not to lay on food to share with neighbours.\n\n\"I think they'll gather together less, but it won't stop totally,\" the doctor worries, ahead of another shift on the Covid ward. \"People are a little bit undisciplined.\"",

    "The Eurovision that never was": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "Back in February, James Newman stepped onto a small stage at a London club to perform My Last Breath live to a crowd for the first time.\n\nAfter writing hits for Ed Sheeran, Calvin Harris and Little Mix he was introducing himself to the world as an artist in his own right.\n\nThat morning Radio 1 Breakfast had revealed him as the UK's entry at the 2020 Eurovision Song Contest in the Netherlands.\n\nJames decided taking part in the world's largest live music event was \"too good an opportunity to turn down\".\n\nOn 18 March the Eurovision Song Contest was cancelled for the first time in its 64-year history.\n\nOrganisers called the decision \"difficult\" and said everyone involved in the contest was \"heartbroken\".\n\nAt that point the UK was fast approaching lockdown and James said he was \"expecting\" the announcement but was still \"absolutely gutted\".\n\n\"I was meant to be singing on the stage in front of a TV audience of 200 million and 20,000 people in an arena - but what's more important is people's health.\"\n\nJames was one of 41 acts who were due to compete in the Dutch city of Rotterdam.\n\nLesley Roy, representing Ireland, says she went from \"excitement, high energy and a buzz\" about her song to \"being upset but not really shocked\".\n\nIsrael's Eden Alene admitted she \"cried a lot\" and Poland's Alicja says the cancellation was \"crushing news\".\n\nBlas Canto's anxiety worsened when \"the most incredible festival\" was cancelled.\n\n\"I've fought it since I was 20 but now this situation is hard because my heart is broken,\" the 28-year-old Spanish contestant tells Newsbeat.\n\nThe former boyband member, who's duetted with Kelly Clarkson, developed a rash across his body as a result of the anxiety and had to pull out of online concerts.\n\n\"My throat was closed and my mind,\" he explains. \"I can't breathe normally or sing like I used to do and it's hard for me because I want to give my best to the fans.\"\n\nVictoria Georgieva, 22, was representing Bulgaria, who were returning to the contest after a year's absence.\n\nTears Getting Sober, a sparse but melodic Billie Eilish-esque ballad, was seen as one of the favourites.\n\n\"It meant a lot because I've always wanted to represent Bulgaria on the big stage. When I found out I was selected I got anxiety and happiness at the same time because it's such a big thing.\"\n\nVictoria and James were both due to perform with other contestants at pre-Eurovision concerts across Europe, which were all cancelled.\n\nThe coronavirus pandemic meant James' diary went from \"100 to zero\". But it also had a personal effect on him - when he began showing symptoms of the virus.\n\n\"I lost my sense of smell and taste,\" he reveals. \"I started getting chills and couldn't get out of bed. I had a tight chest.\"\n\nHe had moments when he felt better, then \"couldn't breathe again\" an hour later.\n\nAs an asthmatic, breathing was his main concern and he describes a feeling of \"impending doom\" as he didn't know what was going to happen.\n\nAfter a week of symptoms, he reported feeling better but that lulled him into a false sense of security. Later, he began to feel even worse.\n\nNow recovered, James says his illness \"solidifies\" why everyone has had to stay at home and why events with large crowds have been cancelled.\n\nAfter Duncan Laurence won 2019's contest with Arcade, the Netherlands was excited to host Eurovision for the first time in 40 years.\n\nRotterdam's slogan for the contest was Open Up but its Ahoy Arena had to close down to be converted into a hospital to deal with Covid-19.\n\n\"I got to play my song there when it was empty,\" explains Dutch entry Jeangu Macrooy. \"You could see people building the hospital in the back, which was weird.\"\n\nThere's no confirmation on a 2021 host city but Rotterdam's city council says it wants to welcome fans next year.\n\nJeangu was hoping the event would be \"postponed to the autumn or December\" - with the cancellation being his \"worst case scenario\".\n\nThat's exactly how Latvia's Samanta Tina felt too after competing on national TV eight separate times hoping to be chosen as a Eurovision act.\n\n\"It's always been my ambition as a singer to get on that stage,\" Samanta tells Newsbeat.\n\nAfter \"finally making it\" she was \"broken\" when she was told she wouldn't get her dream.\n\nOutside of sport there's no bigger TV audience in the world than Eurovision, and the show is a massive hit with younger viewers.\n\nTens of thousands of international tourists were expected in Rotterdam during the week of the song contest.\n\nThe seriousness of the outbreak hit home for Danish entrant Tanne Balcells when she, along with singing partner Benjamin Rosenbohm, performed at their national selection show on 7 March.\n\nBen & Tan had expected to sing in front of 10,000 people at an arena in Copenhagen, giving them a taste of what the Rotterdam shows would have been like.\n\nBut following government advice they had to sing in an empty hall.\n\n\"We were disappointed at first,\" Tanne admits.\n\n\"You're preparing this whole thing to go on stage and feel the energy from the full arena and then the day before you get told there's not going to be anyone there. It was very nerve-racking.\"\n\nAt this stage Ben & Tan don't know if they'll compete next year, but several other countries have confirmed their acts will get a second chance.\n\n2020 competitors confirmed for 2021:\n\nCurrently, there's no word on whether the UK's James Newman will be chosen for the 2021 contest, although he \"absolutely\" wants to represent his country again.\n\nAustralian entrant Montaigne is one of those who've been reselected but contest rules state it has to be with a new song.\n\nThe singer, whose real name is Jessica Cerro, says she's disappointed she won't get to perform Don't Break Me because \"life has revolved around it for six months\".\n\nBut she says there was \"no doubt\" about wanting to come back in 2021. \"The fandom is amazing so I want to be able to see it through to the end.\"\n\nCrucially, she won't have to compete in Australia Decides - where the public vote for who they want to send.\n\nThe same can't be said for Norway's Ulrikke Brandstorp, who has turned down a chance to represent her country in 2021.\n\nShe won the Norwegian selection show Melodi Grand Prix (MGP) and was asked to compete in it again next year.\n\nBut it's a TV programme with a public vote - so there's no guarantee she'd even win.\n\nEurovision was her \"biggest dream\" and it got \"broken\".\n\n\"This year was a hard and bumpy ride and I need a break.\"\n\nFans will say the performance and staging is just as important as the music if you want to win the contest.\n\nIceland's Daoi Freyr had that in mind when he came up with his song, Think About Things, which was another pre-contest favourite.\n\n\"The whole performance was in my head before I wrote the song.\"\n\nThe video features simple dance moves and as a result the track became a TikTok trend - with thousands of people copying the routine.\n\nIceland has never won the competition but he could tell people \"were getting excited\" with the momentum online.\n\n\"Lots of people are more disappointed than I am,\" he jokes.\n\nOrganisers have helped fans deal with the cancellation by streaming online concerts featuring 2020 acts as well as previous contestants.\n\nThe BBC has also announced coverage across TV, radio and online.\n\nFor now, James has to wait to find out if he'll get picked for next year's contest.\n\n\"I felt welcomed into the Eurovision world,\" he says. \"It's such a diverse celebration of music and I love being part of something so big.",

    "The Uber driver evicted from home and left to die": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "The last time Mary Jayaseelan spoke to her husband Rajesh, he was about to be hooked up to a ventilator in a Covid ward.\n\nRajesh was being treated in Northwick Park Hospital in London, the city where he worked as an Uber driver for most of the year. Mary was 5,000 miles away in their family home in Bangalore, India, with their two young sons. Until that point he had repeatedly told her he would be fine, that he was feeling ill but she was not to worry, he'd get better - at 44 years old, he was young and otherwise healthy.\n\nBut on that call, he broke down and admitted: \"Mary, I'm feeling a bit scared.\"\n\nRajesh Jayaseelan died the following day.\n\nRajesh and Mary got married on 24 February 2014, and rented a home in Hulimavu, south Bangalore, that they shared with his 66-year-old mum. For most of the year, Rajesh rented a room in Harrow, north London and drove an Uber vehicle in the city. He'd work from late in the evening to the early hours of the morning - the busy hours - so he could save enough money to spend a few months with his family in India.\n\nHe enjoyed working as a driver, although he didn't realise that his precarious gig economy job would leave him vulnerable in the global health crisis that would later emerge.\n\n\"He'd been living in London on-and-off for 22 years, and would come back to India for a few months at a time,\" Mary says. \"He loved London. He always used to talk to me about how beautiful London was, and so clean. I've never been to London, so he would describe it to me.\"\n\nThey were very happy. Rajesh loved his wife, and playing with their two sons, aged six and four. When he wasn't in India he would video-call them every day.\n\n\"He was also a really good singer,\" Mary says, full of pride. \"He sang a lot of Hindi songs.\"\n\nHe was also a \"humble, gentle person\" his close friend Sunil Kumar adds. Sunil and Rajesh first met in 2011 - they were both from Bangalore, so mutual friends there put them in touch when Sunil moved to the UK. They would help each other navigate the UK's various bureaucratic systems, loaned each other small amounts of money when needed, and Sunil and his wife would have Rajesh over for meals at their home in Hertfordshire - sending him back with several days' worth of leftovers of delicious South Indian food.\n\nAlthough Rajesh loved London, he didn't plan to stay forever - he wanted to be reunited with his family in India. Renting their home in Hulimavu was relatively expensive, so during his last stay in Bangalore at the end of 2019, he and his wife took out a loan and bought land to build their own home. The loan was no problem, they thought - Rajesh would go back to London and put enough money aside to pay it off. The next time he travelled to Bangalore, he told his wife, it would be for good.\n\nHe came back to London on 15 January. Less than two weeks later, the first cases of coronavirus were reported in the UK.\n\nAlthough the virus had reached Britain, at this point Rajesh wasn't too worried. Shops and restaurants were still open, people were still going into work and then going out. For everyone, including Uber drivers, it was business as usual, and not much changed for another month.\n\nThen March came around, and the virus was passing from person to person within the UK. The number of cases - and, by now, deaths - was increasing every day. People were told to self-isolate for seven days if they had any symptoms - even mild ones, such as a fever or a persistent cough.\n\nOn 23 March, Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced a nationwide lockdown lasting an initial three weeks, meaning that most businesses would close, and people would only be allowed outside for one form of exercise a day and for essential trips to the shops, unless they were considered \"essential\" workers.\n\nLike many Uber drivers, Rajesh continued to work at first, but he quickly developed flu-like symptoms and had to stop. His last job was on 25 March - a drop-off at Heathrow Airport.\n\nHis symptoms became much worse, and he was admitted to the hospital with dehydration. While there, he was tested for the coronavirus.\n\nIt came back positive.\n\nStaff told Rajesh to go home, self-isolate, and to come back if his symptoms got worse. He did as he was told, and went home to his room. But things were about to get even worse.\n\n\"The landlord sent Rajesh out of the house for something, and when he came back the landlord had changed the locks, so he couldn't get in,\" Mary says. \"He tried knocking on the door and asking the landlord to speak to him, but he wouldn't open the door.\"\n\nHis landlord didn't know about his positive diagnosis - but he told him that, as an Uber driver, he might bring the coronavirus back into the house, and that it wasn't a risk he was willing to take.\n\nWith nowhere else to turn, Rajesh was forced to sleep in his car for several nights.\n\n\"He had no food in there, nothing to eat at all,\" Mary says.\n\nAt this point he called his friend Sunil for advice.\n\n\"That was the last call he made to me,\" Sunil says. \"He didn't go into details about what was happening to him, but because I work in the NHS, he was asking me questions like 'How safe are we', 'Is it better to go to India'... things like that. He was asking me if I knew any routes, if there was any possible way he could go - he wanted to go to India and be with his family. But by that time there was a complete lockdown in India too.\"\n\nSunil told him the best thing to do would be to stay at home, not to work, and to look into the financial support for self-employed workers the government had just announced, or the 14 days' assistance offered by Uber.\n\nRajesh agreed, and explained he needed to find a new place to live because his landlord said he was high risk. But, Sunil says, he didn't say that he'd already been kicked out: \"He may have been embarrassed.\"\n\nRajesh then went back to trying to call his landlord to plead with him to let him stay. There was no answer.\n\nAfter days of searching, he eventually found another room in a shared house in Harrow. The new landlord made him pay \u00a34,000 upfront - money he didn't have, and Mary says he had to borrow.\n\nIf your landlord kicks you out of your home without giving you notice, or locks you out of your home, it is likely to be an illegal eviction - a criminal offence in all UK nations.\n\nThis is still the case during the coronavirus pandemic. Under the Coronavirus Act, notice periods for evictions have been extended to three months.\n\n\"This means that for most private and social tenants, even if they receive an eviction notice they're likely to have the legal right to stay in their home,\" Andy Parnell, helpline adviser for housing charity Shelter, tells the BBC.\n\nBut, he says, \"sadly there are some groups not protected by the recent changes to the evictions law, including lodgers with live-in landlords\".\n\n\"Lodgers have fewer rights than private renters with live-out landlords and landlords don't need to go to court to evict a lodger. But they are required to provide reasonable notice before asking them to leave the property.\"\n\nPeople in Rajesh's situation should call the local council's homelessness team as soon as possible and all councils have an emergency out-of-hours number. If you don't have anywhere to sleep, you should go to the council's office in person, bringing ID and any proof of immigration status with you.\n\nEarlier this month, Shelter also told renters in this situation to \"stay put\".\n\nOnce Rajesh was back indoors, he didn't want to risk being evicted again. He hid himself away and avoided contact with his new landlord and all the other tenants, not even daring to try and cook a meal for himself. His health became worse with every passing day. The only social interaction he had were daily phone calls with his wife, where he would alternate between reassuring her that he would be fine, and crying.\n\nIt was during one of these calls that Mary noticed he was struggling to breathe.\n\n\"He was wheezing a lot in that room, and every day it was getting worse,\" she says. \"One night I told him to go to the hospital. He didn't want to call an ambulance because he didn't want others there to know he was ill, in case he was evicted again.\"\n\nRajesh drove himself to the hospital, despite being severely out of breath. When he got there he was diagnosed with pneumonia.\n\n\"The next morning he called me from the hospital for a video call - but when the children saw him they started crying because of how ill he was,\" Mary says. \"He turned off his video, and told me he didn't want them to remember him looking so unwell.\" They would speak only a few more times.\n\nOn 11 April, the doctors caring for Rajesh called Mary and explained that he was in a critical state, and they didn't think his condition would improve. They arranged a video call for her and the children to see him one final time; he was unconscious. He died two hours later.\n\nWhile \"coronavirus doesn't discriminate\" has been repeated often during this pandemic, it is evident that the virus is worse for some than others. One group hit particularly hard are gig economy workers.\n\nThe gig economy is where people take on short-term or freelance work instead of permanent jobs. These include private-hire cab drivers like Rajesh as well as food delivery workers and couriers. Last year about 4.7 million people in the UK worked in gig economy jobs while, according to a 2018 study, 60% of the global population is in insecure work.\n\nResearch by the World Economic Forum and other bodies shows these workers are disproportionately affected by the pandemic - a combination of being classified as \"essential\" workers, requiring them to continue interacting with strangers; a lack of guaranteed paid sick leave that makes it harder to self-isolate; low and insecure pay, making it more likely for them to be living in dangerous and insecure housing situations; and no entitlement to risk assessments or protective equipment.\n\nAyako Ebata, from the Institute of Development Studies, says because people in insecure work \"heavily rely on their daily wages\", they are under a lot of pressure not to lose their jobs or take time off, even when there are significant health risks.\n\n\"It's not because they're ignorant or uninformed, it's because the whole system is forcing them to make decisions that eventually prove detrimental to their livelihoods and health,\" she says.\n\nDr Alex Wood, a sociologist at Oxford University focusing on the gig economy and insecure work, agrees - and says a lack of workplace protection makes the problem much worse.\n\n\"People have been told by these platforms that they don't need to worry about [rights and protections] because when the economy's fine, there isn't really any risk,\" he says. \"In reality, when you have these crises, it's the workers who pay - despite many of them now being classified as 'essential'.\"\n\nNow, drivers in the UK are calling for greater protection from the government. United Private Hire Drivers (UPHD), an independent trade body for private-hire drivers, has this week called for an urgent judicial review on the matter.\n\n\"What the government is saying now is that it's not safe for you to go to a barbershop, but it's somehow safe for you to ride around in an Uber,\" James Farrar from the UPHD says.\n\nRace is a risk factor, too. According to multiple recent studies, BAME people in the UK like Rajesh are disproportionately more likely to be in insecure work than their white counterparts.\n\nResearch from the Trade Union Congress (TUC) last year found that ethnic minority workers are a third more likely to be in insecure work. A report released last month by Carnegie UK Trust, UCL and Operation Black Vote also found that BAME millennials in particular were 47% more likely to be on \"zero-hours\" contracts - another notoriously unstable form of work.\n\nAt the same time, recent studies show that BAME people in the UK are disproportionately more likely to become critically ill and to die from coronavirus. Ethnic minority patients make up 34% of those in intensive care, despite making up only 13% of the population.\n\nEarly research suggests this is down to a combination of risk factors - an increased incidence of high-risk underlying health conditions, such as diabetes and hypertension, as well as social factors and systemic inequality.\n\n\"Coronavirus is making a lot of the inequalities in our society that we had previously turned a blind eye to, very clear,\" Dr Wood says.\n\nAfter learning that her son had died, Rajesh's mother became ill. She suffered hypertension and a spike in her blood sugar level, and has been confined to her bed. \"She's been inconsolable since,\" Mary says.\n\nFaced with a loan for the house, upcoming medical bills and children's school fees, Mary is trying to find work as a cleaner in their area but the lockdown is making it much more difficult to get on top of their finances.\n\nSunil is helping them with money where he can, and has set up an online fundraiser for them. He's also looking into whether he can pursue legal action against Rajesh's first landlord. Mary's relatives in Bangalore have also set up a fundraiser for her in India.\n\nBut more than anything, Mary is struggling to come to terms with how quickly everything has changed for her family.\n\n\"Now that Rajesh is gone, our life has become very difficult,\" she says. \"I don't know what we'll do without him.\"",

    "The chef who lost her sense of smell": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "In January, chef Joshna Maharaj revealed a secret - she hadn't been able to smell properly for about five years. Now, she's working to regain some of what she lost.\n\nHer loss of smell was gradual, though looking back she realised there had been red flags along the way.\n\nFirstly, she was burning things. Peach squares, made with sliced \"beautiful\" summertime fruit, came out not browned but blackened.\n\n\"Sometimes you can trim and get away with it,\" she says. Not this time. They ended up in the bin.\n\nOne day she walked into a BBQ restaurant with friends and was the only one who couldn't smell the meat smoker working its magic.\n\n\"There was a moment where I retrospectively did all this math. 'Wait a second, my nose is not working like it's supposed to,'\" she says.\n\n\"And to be honest, at that moment, the idea of it filled me with enough panic - particularly with the professional implications of this - that I just shut it all down.\"\n\nShe told herself: \"You are going to keep this secret, you are not going to tell anybody about this.\"\n\nThe Toronto-born chef, food activist and author has worked with major public institutions, from universities to hospitals, to revamp the way they source, cook, and serve food.\n\nNow she had anosmia, the complete loss of the sense of smell.\n\nShe became diligent about using cooking timers for everything, careful in case her nose betrayed her.\n\nHer cooking shifted towards \"mega flavour\".\n\n\"Lots of garlic and onions and ginger and a giant curry that's going to smack you in the face, or intense, intense, major rhubarb, or we're going to go deep on strawberry.\"\n\nThe flavours had to be bold, especially as her taste was also muted by her smell loss.\n\nAnosmia can have any number of causes, from common infections to brain injuries. Recently, researchers have found a loss of smell or taste is a symptom of the coronavirus.\n\nMs Maharaj's condition was caused by extreme sinusitis that led to polyps -noncancerous growths linked to chronic inflammation - in her nasal passage.\n\nFor years, she struggled with what felt like constant congestion.\n\n\"I tried all the things - Chinese medicine, diet change, acupuncture, constantly hoofing down decongestants. We had suspicions about mould lurking under the carpet of my apartment.\"\n\nIn February 2019, she had surgery to remove the polyps and fix a deviated septum. In August, she regained a momentary sense of smell.\n\nThe first whiff she got was of a mango while on a trip to Bangalore. Her nose then gave her a glimpse of the incense and flowers in the lobby of her hotel. But in two weeks, her smell had disappeared again.\n\nOver the 2019 winter holidays, she found herself in Croatia, and the trip brought home to her what she had been missing. Family would comment on the delicious smells in streets and restaurants. For her it was a blank.\n\nThere are smells she misses - campfires, garlic and ginger in the frying pan, the smell of newborns.\n\n\"I stuck my face all under his chin and nothing,\" she says of meeting a friend's new baby a few months back. \"There was a sadness there, for sure.\"\n\nA friend also told her about the link between smell and emotion, leading her to research that suggests impairments in smell have been linked to increased rates of depression, anxiety, and a sense of isolation.\n\nThose experiences made her realise she needed to address her anosmia head on.\n\nIn January, she went public with a post on Instagram, disclosing her condition and announcing she had begun \"smell training to repair the path between my nose and my brain\".\n\nShe had found Abscent, a UK-based organisation that raises public awareness of smell loss and of smell training, which can help people regain some or all of their lost sense.\n\nSmell disorders are believed to affect about 5% of the general population - though that's a very rough estimate, notes organisation founder Chrissi Kelly.\n\nWhen people seek out a doctor or find themselves consulting with organisations like hers, it's because \"they're absolutely miserable\".\n\nShe pictures the \"archetypical good smeller\" as a \"bon vivant - you know, people who love to eat and drink and who love to be with people, and they're gregarious\".\n\n\"So imagine when that person loses their sense of smell.\"\n\nWhen she lost her own ability to smell eight years ago, she hadn't realised how connected she was to it, to the simple pleasure of breathing in fresh laundry off the line or the comfort of returning to the familiar smell of your own home.\n\nResearch suggests smell training may not be a cure for smell loss but it can improve a person's chances of recovery by stimulating the olfactory nerves, which convey the sensation of smell to the central nervous system.\n\nIt's like physiotherapy for the nose, says Ms Kelly.\n\nThe concept is simple.\n\nTake four essential oils - usually a flowery smell, and fruity, aromatic and resinous ones - and spend about 20 seconds with each scent twice a day, focusing not just on trying to capture the smell but its related experiences.\n\nMs Maharaj chose four commonly recommended essential oils for her training - eucalyptus, rose, lemon, and clove.\n\n\"They're mega - the four corners of smelling,\" she says.\n\nWhen she sits with the jars, the first in the rotation is eucalyptus, and she brings to mind \"the steam room at the spa... with the greeny-ness, almost a minty-ness and an astringency, a little bit of sweetness\".\n\nThen it's lemon, and she's imagining \"lemon curd and just squeezing the juice out of a lemon\".\n\nFor rose, \"there is a version of rose that actually finishes with sweetness that I love\" and doesn't have the \"powderiness, grandmother-y\" scent.\n\nThe last is clove, which is all about memories of \"making pomanders at Christmas time\", and \"winter, holiday baking and that woody, sweet, spicy kind of smell\".\n\nFor weeks, she sensed nothing when she opened the jars. Then in March she began to get hints of scent. Not quite the smells of eucalyptus or clove but something.\n\nIt was like struggling to find a word at the end of your tongue - she couldn't quite grasp it. Soon she was getting some smell back. Within weeks, it was gone again.\n\nAbscentUK cautions it takes a minimum of four months of sustained training to recover the sense - and that it can come back distorted or limited.\n\nImperfect as it is, Ms Maharai says she's excited to begin \"tasting all over again... reworking how I understand flavour\" after years of cooking from memory.\n\n\"The fact that I have the freedom to just play around like that and honestly and truthfully experience this is very, very exciting.\"",

        "body": "Malawi was one of the last countries in the world to announce its first case of Covid-19. But ever since, it has been embroiled in a constitutional row about a lockdown the government wants to impose to tackle the pandemic.\n\nThe High Court took the unprecedented step of blocking the government's plans to impose a lockdown until more had been done to help those worst affected.\n\nNow, President Peter Mutharika has announced an emergency cash transfer programme for the poorest people in what is one of the world's poorest countries.\n\nThe government will target 172,000 households, who will receive a monthly payment equivalent to almost $50 (\u00a340) through mobile money transfer from Friday.\n\nOn 15 April, the government announced a 21-day lockdown, which was due to start three days later but campaigners complained that the government did this without providing help for those in need.\n\nThe Human Rights Defenders Coalition (HRDC) went to court to challenge the government on the issue and the courts blocked the lockdown.\n\n\"While we respect the health regulations regarding the lockdown, we want a lockdown that follows all... laws and we do not want rights of vulnerable groups to suffer,\" said independent rights activist Victor Mhango according to the AFP news agency.\n\nAs well as the HRDC, traders in Blantyre and Mzuzu protested after plans to restrict movement were announced.\n\nThe traders lit bonfires and police dispersed them.\n\nThe vendors said they would not be unable to provide for their families during the lockdown.\n\nReligious groups also sought an injunction of their own, saying the lockdown was a violation of religious freedom.\n\nOn Friday 17 April, a day before the lockdown was due to start, a court injunction ordered the lockdown be delayed for seven days, pending a judicial review.\n\nFollowing a judicial review, a High Court judge extended the ban for a further five days.\n\nOn Tuesday the judge decided to refer the case to the Constitutional Court because the issues raised by the petitioners required an interpretation of the constitution.\n\nThe judge ordered that until the Constitutional Court makes its ruling, the lockdown cannot be enforced.\n\nWith the exception of law enforcement officers and providers of essential goods and services, people would have needed to seek permission to leave the area around their homes.\n\nProviders of essential goods and services would have been issued special permits.\n\nCentral markets would have been closed and local markets would only have been allowed to open between 05:00 and 18:00 local time.\n\nNot necessarily.\n\nThe Constitutional Court still has to hear the case and no date has been set.\n\nFor the moment, people are still going about their businesses almost as usual - markets are open and cities and towns remain crowded.\n\nBut journalist Peter Jegwa in the capital, Lilongwe, says there is a noticeable change in people's behaviour - with water buckets and soap or sanitisers placed outside market entrances and shops.\n\nIt is not clear.\n\nA $37m funding package was approved by the World Bank last week to help Malawi fight the coronavirus.\n\nBut that may only cover a part of the bill. If 172,000 households get just one payment of $50 that would amount to a bill of $86m for the first month.\n\nThe president has not said how long these cash handouts could continue for.\n\nBy Peter Jegwa, Lilongwe\n\nThe coronavirus outbreak - and the ensuing court row - comes against a tense political backdrop.\n\nEarlier this year, Malawi's courts took the equally unprecedented step of ordering the annulment of last year's elections, following complaints of rigging from the opposition.\n\nThe re-run was due to be held on 2 July.\n\nSo when the court once more went against the government, allies of President Mutharika accused it of having a political motivation.\n\nThe organisations which brought the case were linked to protests last year which demanded the sacking of the head of the election body and the annulment of the result. There is deep mistrust on both sides.\n\nThe opposition has suggested that government is exaggerating the extent of the pandemic and may be even lying about positive coronavirus tests.\n\nThe first cases were announced on 2 April - much later than most countries.\n\nSince then, there have been 36 cases of coronavirus confirmed. Of those, three people are recorded to have died and five people have recovered.\n\nThe best thing is regular and thorough hand washing, preferably with soap and water.\n\nCoronavirus spreads when an infected person coughs or sneezes small droplets - packed with the virus - into the air. These can be breathed in, or cause an infection if you touch a surface they have landed on, then your eyes, nose or mouth.\n\nSo, coughing and sneezing into tissues, not touching your face with unwashed hands, and avoiding close contact with infected people are important.\n\nPeople will be most infectious when they have symptoms, but some may spread the virus even before they are sick.\n\nFace masks do not provide effective protection, according to medical experts. However, the WHO is re-examining whether the public might benefit from using them.",

        "body": "\"In the depths of winter, I finally learned that within me there lay an invincible summer\" - Albert Camus.\n\nHere's a kick for touch.\n\nIn terms of the 'big three' contact sports I think 2020 is a write off. I hope I'm proved wrong but I remain to be convinced.\n\nBeyond the guarded rhetoric of governments and the cautious, arguably naive optimism of sports governing bodies, there is a conversation to be had.\n\nAre those of us desperate for the return of contact sports just a little delusional in thinking that it's coming back anytime soon?\n\nUltan Power and I used to hurl together for the Bredagh Club on Belfast's Ormeau Road.\n\nLike me, Ultan loves the game he is also Professor of Molecular Virology at Wellcome-Wolfson Institute for Experimental Medicine at Queen's University, Belfast.\n\n\"We're in a pandemic and on this journey its crucial to remember we've only just taken the first steps,\" says Power.\n\n\"At some point we're all going to bump into this unwelcome viral visitor.\n\n\"In the history of mankind, developing an effective vaccine in less than 18 months would be unprecedented. Developing drugs to treat Covid-19 is also difficult and will take time to ensure safety and efficacy.\n\n\"I expect sports bodies are being guided by their own experts but for me it's difficult to see any meaningful contact sport here in 2020.\n\n\"For players and coaching staff who have had confirmed Covid-19, increasing evidence indicates that they will likely become immune to the virus, although the jury is still out on the duration of this immunity.\n\n\"For those who haven't, they would need to undergo regular testing for the virus to lower the risk of transmission during training or matches.\n\n\"For spectators, returning to crowded stadia in the current stage of the pandemic would be highly risky in terms of virus transmission and would add substantially to the disease's burden in society as a whole.\"\n\n\"How likely, in your expert opinion, is a second wave of the virus?\", I ask.\n\nLiam Heaney used to play gaelic football for Down and loves his sport.\n\nHe is also Professor of Respiratory Medicine in Queen's University and is currently based in the Belfast City and Nightingale Hospital.\n\n\"We must remember that social distancing is not a panacea, the lockdown was all about slowing the virus down and ensuring health services didn't get overwhelmed and it has been pretty effective here,\" he states.\n\n\"Stormont's five-phased approach feels about right and in a purely sporting context the Bundesliga and South Korea experiments, where football has returned behind closed doors, will be useful yard sticks for the start of similar sports here.\n\n\"In a wider context, the experience of European countries and England's relaxation of their lockdown, particularly in London, will help inform others watching on.\n\n\"If they hit a bump on the road fairly quickly with a rise in infection rate, then we should all prepare for a very slow and gradual emergence from lockdown with persistent social distancing measures for many month.\"\n\nWhat about those sports men and women who say 'no vaccine, no return to play'?\n\n\"To be blunt, to anyone stipulating that a vaccine is mandatory before returning to training or playing, I would say put your boots in the bin,\" Heaney continues.\n\n\"There is no guarantee an effective and safe vaccine will be developed and even if it does happen, it will take time.\n\n\"We must not hurry a vaccine and we must get it right, it's quite likely Covid-19 will be a recurrent event.\n\n\"I think going forward in the new normal, whatever that is, we must factor in some degree of managed risk and sport, like many other things in life, can never be completely risk free.\"\n\nI've been a sports broadcast journalist for 25 years.\n\nJust a few months ago, for the first time in my privileged career, I stepped back from covering a major event.\n\nMy wife Ciara and I have three boys. A decade ago our middle son required life saving surgery as a baby due to a congenital heart defect.\n\nUncertain if he fell into a vulnerable category, I was hesitant about covering a four-day event with over a quarter of a million people in attendance. The BBC was understanding and upon raising my concerns it was agreed, without hesitation, that I wouldn't travel.\n\nAs it transpired Covid 19 came to our door anyway. Ciara is a senior physiotherapist for the NHS in Belfast.\n\nShe and her colleagues worked in one of Northern Ireland's first Covid-19 hotspots. One by one, they came down with the virus - some were floored and others recovered quickly. All have returned to work a month on.\n\nThe week in which Ciara isolated (with our youngest son who was also exhibiting symptoms) was one of the most stressful of my life. When she re-emerged from quarantine, I cried.\n\nIn many instances, it is human nature to think of the worst case scenario and work your way back, at the extreme end the virus is life threatening and that's a sobering thought.\n\nHaving Covid-19 in my home rendered me completely paranoid like some kind of 21st-century Howard Hughes. As with so many other families, we pulled the shutters down, prayed and rode it out.\n\nI, and my two other children, had no symptoms and were not tested for the virus or for the antibodies.\n\nWe self-isolated for two weeks and re-emerged feeling very fortunate but also a little unclean and in my case that is because so few other people have had it.\n\nI asked Professor Heaney how likely it was that I'd had coronavirus and been asymptomatic.\n\n\"Without a test you can't be definitive but in my experience this virus is quite contagious so when living in the same household with family members with proven infection, you're also very likely to have had it,\" he replied.\n\nI have a little dog called Fiach, who has been my lockdown lifeline.\n\nI missed our daily walk, where over such a short period of time random strangers had become familiar, if socially distant faces.\n\nInvariably talk of sport began to dominate our routinely brief chats.\n\n\"Do you think we'll ever have sport back?\", I get asked.\n\n\"All this blether of being back at major events anytime soon that's just pie in the sky isn't it? The economy needs sport, it's vital for our physical and emotional well being, surely we must get back soon, don't you think so? What are you hearing?\"\n\nAnd so the questions continue, and having taken the elephant in sports waiting room out for a walk, I don't have the answers, indeed few of us do.\n\nI do know that sport without spectators is like bread without butter - dry and unpalatable. Take away the fans, and you strip sport of its soul.\n\nIn researching this story, it has become apparent to me that we must, for the foreseeable future, factor 'risk' into the life equation. Not least when considering a return to contact sport.\n\nAbout the only other certainty I feel comfortable broaching in this emerging 'new normal' is we are only just approaching a bend on the road, around which w will be able to glimpse the foothills of the climb which lies ahead.",

    "The financial hole coronavirus ripped in African sport": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "African football and athletics have been gravely impacted by the coronavirus pandemic - as is perhaps guessable, with the sports being the two biggest on the continent. But with sportsmen and women experiencing series of pay cuts, lost income, redundancy, mental health hit and lack of fitness, we now take a look at how the pandemic has financially affected other sports across Africa.\n\nBasketball's popularity in Africa is growing, especially with NBA engagement on the continent.\n\nThis month would have seen the inaugural Basketball Africa League finals held in Kigali, Rwanda. But they has been postponed indefinitely.\n\nNigerian club Rivers Hoopers is one of the 12 teams in the 2020 Basketball Africa League.\n\nThey, like most basketball clubs in Africa, are state-owned and run - and this means some professional basketball players take up side jobs to supplement their monthly pay.\n\nIn Cameroon, for instance, basketball players also double as PE teachers.\n\nState-run basketball clubs in Nigeria earn a fixed salary, as they are deemed \"civil servants.\" This pay ranges from an estimated $185 to $210 monthly.\n\nHowever, for private run clubs in Nigeria like Raptors, there is a pay-by-play clause during competitions. Out of competition, they fend for themselves while still training.\n\n\"In a month it depends on your contract with your team, it can be or $79 or $92. The money we get from basketball is not even enough to do anything,\" explained Ginikachukwu Ofuegbu, a 17-year-old rookie with Raptor Basketball club of Nigeria.\n\nCharles Ibeziako, Head Coach and owner of Raptors Basketball Club of Nigeria, said that the teams are heavily dependent on sponsorship - and \"when the league finishes, no more payment.\"\n\n\"You're managing 12 players' average 50,000 ($137.00) monthly; good players 70k ($191) 80k ($218) monthly. It's not like football.\n\n\"The more money sponsors give, the more money we're going to give the players. But right now, there's nothing we can do.\"\n\nBasketball's financial woes have spread globally, affecting African players across the world.\n\nEvelyn Akhator is a forward for Flammes Carolo in the French Women's Basketball League, winner of the FIBA Women's AfroBasket with Nigeria.\n\nPlaying in France means signing a new contract every year, and pay is estimated to be an average of $20,000 monthly. The price to pay due to the pandemic is the fall in revenue from matchday ticket sales and merchandise.\n\n\"I'm still getting paid but from next month (June) our money will be cut. The government is paying 86% so we're losing 14% percent from the club.\n\n\"The other 14%, it's the team that balances out. For sure they are losing,\" says Akhator who was drafted by the Dallas Wings of the Women's National Basketball Association (WNBA) as the 3rd overall pick in the 2017 WNBA Draft.\n\nAccording to Henning, the salary reductions will contribute only 25% of the industry's savings - that is 12.5% for players and 12.5% for administrative and coaching staff.\n\n\"The industry's primary objective was to safeguard the professional game against a complete collapse post the Covid-19 pandemic - ie to collectively absorb as much of the revenue losses as possible in a responsible manner that would leave the industry in a position to resume \"business as usual\" once our players return to play,\" he added.\n\nWater sports have also taken a big hit as centres dedicated for events such as swimming, diving and rowing have been closed. Professionals have had to develop unlikely home routines such as showering for longer just to experience water, and lifting weights.\n\n\"I already lost 10,000 euro - a huge percentage of my budget for this year,\" said Privel Hinkati, a rower from Benin who had already qualified for the Tokyo Olympic Games.\n\n\"The thing is, corona has changed everything. Everything is postponed now - cancelled, we don't know yet - so I lost a lot of money on flight tickets and accommodation for this year,\" he added.\n\nHinkati's competitions are in Europe or the USA during spring.\n\n\"Some you can have refund maybe 50%, or maybe you can have a voucher - but still you don't know what the company may decide, so it is a lot of money.\"\n\nThe money lost was part of his of yearly budget of 85,000 euro ($92,400) meant for training, travel and equipment - mainly the boats.\n\nHinkati is not a professional rower, and works part-time as an IT engineer.\n\n\"It is a very expensive season because of preparations normally - but it is a lot of money, so my challenge for next year will be to find the same amount of money.\"\n\nSouth Africa's Lejan Lewthwaite is a Ladies European Tour professional golfer. In February she won the SuperSport Ladies Challenge.\n\n\"I miss the golf course - I feel my best at the golf course, it is where I find my motivation to keep going,\" she told BBC Sport Africa.\n\n\"I am having huge withdrawal symptoms.\"\n\nLewthwaite was ready for a very busy golf season. The prize fund for Sunshine Ladies Tour events range from R200,000 ($11,000) to R700,000 ($38,000). She had a schedule that included eight to 10 events in South Africa and a further 26 events had been scheduled in Europe - a bigger number compared to last year.\n\n\"Prior to the pandemic, I was planning on being away from home for most of the rest of year,\" she explained.\n\n\"It is hard to say how the rest of the year going to pan out. We have about 10 events that have been moved or postponed. Six of those have been moved to next year already. That is a pity but a big big positive is that we haven't lost those events even though they going to happen next year.\"\n\nSunshine Tour in South Africa offered financial support to professional men and women golfers like Lewthwaite starting April.\n\n\"I know that our Sunshine ladies Tour and Womens Professional Golf association here have helped us professional golfers for the next two months with a little bit of stipend to help us with our expenses, so we appreciate that very much,\" she said.\n\n\"Our biggest worry though during this time is the people in our community own earn money on a day to day basis or weekly basis that are unable to do that for now and don't have food.\"\n\nThe 2019 SA Women's Masters winner is also worried about sponsorship cuts.\n\n\"I am sponsored to travel to Europe to play in these events and maybe I am not going to be playing in as many events this year. I am making provisions for that and just trying to plan now for later.\"\n\nUnlike South African rugby, Cricket has not had reductions to date. An annual income for a cricket player is roughly ranges between R200,000.00 ($11,000) to R1 million ($53,500).\n\nPrimarily, this is because the cricket season in South Africa happens over the winter - and it had finished by the time the coronavirus arrived in the country.\n\nHowever, the franchise income does not include centralised contracts from the national team or other leagues around the world, nor Endorsements.\n\nKaya Zondo, a South Africa international who plays for the Dolphins, said covid has still had a \"major impact\" on the season and cost players their form.\n\n\"The uncertainty makes one consider post-career planning - and that in itself is a positive as we should be planning for that anyway,\" Zondo added.\n\n\"As players, we taking our guidance from the franchises and government but we remain hopefully that the game will return. I would not say that I'm scared but what I can say is that this has been a major wake up call to all sportsmen.\"\n\nEven the lifestyle sport of polo has not been spared.\n\nThe sport, which is one of the few where a mixed team of men and women take part, has taken a hit even as it struggles to attract a professional status in Africa.\n\nNeku Atawodi-Edun, the first black female professional polo player, said that looking at her finances \"the only thing I could do was laugh - to stop me from crying.\"\n\n\"We've got a large percentage of players for whom it's very hand-to-mouth: hand to your mouth; to your horse's mouth; to your grooms and your pilot, everybody that is part of your organisation.\n\n\"If you want to earn money, you have to keep playing.\n\n''With polo, it's quite tough because normally if you're having financial difficulties, you would just sell a horse - but who's buying horses right now?\"\n\nThe 32-year-old, who has been a professional for 12 years, added that polo has special difficulties because the costs continue to mount whether there is play or not.\n\n''The sport is quite unique in its financial structure,\" she said.\n\n\"As opposed to perhaps football where if I'm not playing football my cost stays at zero - I might not be earning but at least I'm not spending - with polo, as long as you own a horse, you're always spending. It's a living thing.\"\n\nThe dynamic further differs with female polo players who, until a few years ago, had never had a specific tournament dedicated to women's polo teams.\n\n''We earn less than the men but then the cost is pretty much the same as the men.",

    "The last 'normal' photo on your phone": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "The coronavirus pandemic has changed how we live. What was ordinary just a couple of months ago seems almost unrecognisable.\n\nWe asked you for the last \"normal\" photo you had on your phone, and hundreds of you replied. Here are 13 pictures from before we had to come to terms with lockdowns and social distancing.\n\nWe spent two years planning our wedding in Austria.\n\nI drove out through France and Germany in a campervan, with the world closing down around me, not knowing if we could go ahead with it.\n\nOn the Friday night as our guests arrived, Austria announced they would be shutting down from Sunday. On Saturday 14 March we married, and on the Sunday we were escorted from the resort back to the airport.\n\nWe had two or three guests who didn't make it to the wedding, but it was an absolutely amazing day. Looking at the pictures now is totally mind-boggling.\n\nTwo of my mates were taking the campervan back. They got as far as Germany, and then Germany locked the borders. They left it there and flew home.\n\nSo the campervan with the wedding cake inside is still in a Munich car park.\n\nThis was the last photo I took of my boyfriend before we went into lockdown separately. We both live with our parents so we aren't together and I haven't seen him in weeks.\n\nIt was the Saturday before the lockdown was announced. We knew what was about to happen so we had a few drinks and played air hockey together at his house in Hampshire before we parted ways. We have a tradition of playing air hockey all the time - it's what we do on our Saturday nights.\n\nI genuinely didn't anticipate having to be away from him for so long. I've never spent more than a few days without him so this is very hard, but we know it's for ours and everyone else's safety.\n\nWe send a picture of ourselves to each other every day as a little reminder, so we don't forget what each other looks like.\n\nI can't wait to see him again.\n\nIt was Friday 13 March at Cheltenham Festival. On the Thursday night I got a text from a friend saying he had a handful of spare hospitality tickets for the races after clients dropped out because of Covid-19. With no work the next day I jumped at the chance.\n\nIt was a lovely day. I took this snap because it looked nice with the sun and things. I wasn't really thinking about coronavirus at the time, but looking back it's an awful lot of people.\n\nI wasn't especially concerned about coronavirus then. There were quite a lot of hand sanitiser dispensers, and we were doing the no handshake thing with everyone we met, but back then it felt like a bit of a novelty.\n\nI left slightly in profit and very drunk on a nearly empty train with more staff than customers (apparently also coronavirus related). I do wonder how many cases can be traced back to Cheltenham.\n\nI walk my kids to and from school every day and it's something I enjoy, a time to chat about their days and mine.\n\nI took this photo on 20 March, the last day of school before it closed because of coronavirus. I was with my daughter, my son and my daughter's friend. I'd just left the playground where I said goodbye to my school mum friends, not knowing when we'd see each other again.\n\nOn the way home, I was asking the kids how they felt about schools closing. They were really happy - it was like breaking up for the summer holidays. I was sad.\n\nSince this photo, the novelty has worn off a bit for the kids. Mummy school isn't as good as normal school - I'm not Ofsted rated.\n\nI cannot wait until I walk them to school again.\n\nIt was a friend's 50th birthday celebration in Ascot on Saturday 14 March.\n\nIt was a fantastic evening celebrating with special friends. We had an Amy Winehouse impersonator and we danced until the early hours.\n\nWhat is so weird is we were all discussing coronavirus throughout the night, but partying still without a care in the world.\n\nAt that time, nobody really knew anyone who'd had it and we hadn't heard of anything in the area.\n\nAbout five to seven days later, 17 of us from the party became bed-ridden and severely poorly with all the classic Covid-19 symptoms.\n\nAll 17 of us fell ill within days of each other and have taken six weeks to get back to good health. Not one of us knew that we had been in contact with anyone with symptoms prior to the party.\n\nNone of us has had a test to prove we had it.\n\nI wanted to visit my dad on that day in particular because I knew it was the last day I was going to be allowed to before his care home locked down to outside visitors.\n\nIt was Sunday 22 March. I wanted to be sure to visit him because he's 93, he's got dementia and he can't actually walk anymore - I knew that if he got ill with Covid-19, the chances are he'd probably succumb.\n\nWe had a nice talk and I made sure to take some photos of him so that if worst comes to worst I'd have a nice memory of visiting him.\n\nWe talked about coronavirus and my little grandchild who my dad absolutely loves. I normally tell him if I've seen any interesting birds, because he's a bird watcher and I am too.\n\nHe's still fine, so far.\n\nWe were celebrating my wife's birthday at home on 8 March, back when we were allowed to be surrounded by family.\n\nI guess it was at a time when we were taking things for granted. We were doing what we'd normally do on someone's birthday.\n\nI don't remember talking about coronavirus. We were talking about what we'd done that weekend and a family wedding planned for later this year.\n\nSome of us watched the Rugby Six Nations game when Scotland beat France - the last game before the tournament got postponed.\n\nOne of the last birthday cards my wife received was from her aunt Barbara who, with no underlying health conditions, suddenly passed away from Covid-19 in April.\n\nThe next birthday celebrations we have as a family will now be appreciated even more.\n\nWe flew home from Disney World in Florida on 8 March - my son's birthday. Here he is heading to the cockpit to meet the pilot.\n\nIt was an amazing family holiday. We were following the news quite closely whilst we were away, but it was all so uncertain. It felt like we were truly in a Disney bubble.\n\nOn the flight back my husband was ill (with hindsight probably Covid-19) and as an NHS manager, I was about to head home to a whole new world of household isolation, working from home, preschool education and plate spinning.\n\nThis photo feels like it was taken in another lifetime.\n\nWe had just rented a perfect property in Voe, Shetland, where we were going to move. This was the last photo taken of our first visit to the house and the start of moving in.\n\nWe left in the happy anticipation of this being our new home before long.\n\nOur next visit (less than two weeks later) was to remove our things and hand back the keys. A dream, which was so close you could feel it, stopped by Covid-19.\n\nThis is a photograph taken at Anfield before the kick off of the Champions League tie between Liverpool and Atletico Madrid on 11 March.\n\nMy friend and I travelled down from Edinburgh to go to the game. At that point in March, the virus was already a real issue but nowhere near as advanced, and at that point we couldn't have envisioned the devastation it would go on to cause. We discussed it on the train down with no real seriousness.\n\nAfter the game we went to a local pub where Liverpool fans and Atletico fans mixed and discussed the game with respect and with humour, allowing for the language barrier. Again, no-one considered the possibility of an issue with the virus.\n\nBeing well fortified with beer I gave my scarf to an Atletico supporter from Madrid. He was very grateful. I can't remember his name. I hope he still has it and with all that has happened in Madrid, I hope he is well.\n\nMy nan Mavis and I went on our usual trip to the supermarket for a coffee and a catch-up on 10 March. Little did either of us know it would be the last time she would leave her house for months and that she was soon to become an expert at FaceTime.\n\nWe were talking a lot about my plans for the rest of the year. I don't remember speaking much about coronavirus. I was meant to be going on holiday to a yoga retreat so I was looking for bits to wear. That's what the day was about.\n\nShe lives on her own. Knowing she is alone during all of this has been the hardest thing for me but she is famous for her never-ending optimism.\n\nShe recently got stuck on her chairlift and had to have three firemen come and sort her out. I think she was quite grateful for a bit of a chat with them and an interlude to her isolation.\n\nI can't wait to race her wheelchair into the supermarket again - she always loves that.\n\nThis photo was taken on 14 March at a restaurant in Norfolk, where I went out for dinner for a friend's 21st birthday. I'd also secured a post-grad job a couple of days beforehand so I was keen to celebrate.\n\nMy university, UEA, had announced that on-campus teaching was being cancelled so I spent the weekend preparing to travel back to my family home and was conscious that this dinner was likely to be my last social event for a long time, which it was.\n\nIt's the last time I wore makeup and the last time I got dressed up. It's also the last time I saw that friend before we both graduate or finish our degrees, because we don't know when we'll have an official graduation.\n\nI'm glad to have enjoyed that occasion just before spending weeks inside.\n\nIt was 8 March, I'd only moved to California a couple of months earlier. I was heading to the gym and the LA Marathon was being run near me in Santa Monica. I took the photo to send to my mum to show her that I was adjusting to life well here.\n\nI didn't know it would be the last time I'd see crowds out in public spaces. The virus seemed like one of those things that happens to \"other people\".\n\nThen I lost my job in independent film production when foreign investment from China fell through. I took to dog walking, but got furloughed when the shut-down dried up demand.\n\nI'm now headed home to Hawaii - I'll have to quarantine in place for two weeks when I get there.\n\nAdditional research by Paul Harrison\n\nIf you could go back to the start of the year and give yourself some pre-lockdown advice, knowing what was about to happen, what advice would that be?",

        "body": "Since the first coronavirus death in Scotland was recorded on 13 March, the number of victims has steadily increased. Behind the statistics, there are real people - grandparents, parents, brothers, sisters, husbands and wives - and the families and friends they leave behind. These are some of the people who have lost their lives to Covid-19.\n\nDanny Cairns was a healthy 68-year-old before he fell ill with coronavirus, according to his brother, Hugh.\n\nWhen he developed a cough and sore throat at the end of March, he isolated at home in Greenock.\n\nBut within days he was so ill he had to be taken to hospital by ambulance.\n\nIn a video call from his hospital bed, his last words to his brother were: \"I'm on my way out mate\".\n\nHe died on 26 March, three days after arriving in hospital.\n\n'I'm on my way out, mate'\n\nSchool janitor Ian Wilson was at home in Coatbridge for two weeks with a high temperature and delirium before being admitted to hospital.\n\nDespite his worsening condition, doctors initially told his wife, Sandra, she would not be able to visit the 72-year-old who had a heart condition and diabetes.\n\nStaff eventually granted access provided she wore protective equipment - a decision which meant she could be at her husband's side when he died on 29 March.\n\nAlthough nurses were unable to comfort her with a hug due to social distancing protocols, Mrs Wilson is grateful they allowed her to be with her partner at the end.\n\n\"I was able to talk to him and just say goodbye. I've got strength from that,\" she said.\n\nThe impact my husband's death had on NHS staff\n\nRyan Storrie was in Scotland to celebrate his 40th birthday with a trip to a Rangers match when he fell ill.\n\nThe father-of-two was from Ardrossan but he lived in Dubai.\n\nWhen he developed symptoms, the asthmatic isolated in his hotel room and waited for the virus to run its course.\n\nHis condition deteriorated but he wouldn't let his wife, Hilary, phone 999 as he was convinced he would recover and didn't want to bother the NHS.\n\nLord Gordon of Strathblane was a former political editor of STV and he founded Radio Clyde.\n\nHe died at Glasgow Royal Infirmary on 31 March after contracting coronavirus, Radio Clyde reported. He was 83.\n\nHis family paid tribute to his \"generosity, his kindness and his enthusiasm for life\".\n\nFormer First Minister Jack McConnell said Lord Gordon had \"an outstanding career in business and public service\".\n\nLabour peer dies 'after contracting coronavirus'\n\nCatherine Sweeney was a \"wonderful mother, sister and beloved aunty\", her family said after her death on 4 April.\n\nBorn and raised in Dumbarton, she worked as a home carer for more than 20 years.\n\nHer family said she would be sorely missed after a \"lifetime of service\" to the community.\n\nAnd they praised the medics at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley who \"heroically\" looked after her in her final days.\n\nCarer was 'dedicated to the most vulnerable'\n\nMofizul Islam was beginning a new life in Scotland after relocating from Bangladesh when he fell ill with coronavirus.\n\nHis family believe the 49-year-old caught the virus on his daily three-hour journeys between their Edinburgh home and his job at a pizza outlet in Midlothian.\n\nHe died on 5 April and was buried in the Muslim section of a city cemetery but his wife and children were in isolation and unable to attend.\n\nHis death has left the family \"completely helpless\", according to a family friend as they have no documents, no bank account and they are struggling for money.\n\n\"We are very worried about our future because we don't have our father,\" said Mofizul's 19-year-old son, Azahural. \"He was everything for us. And now we are just hopeless.\"\n\nFamily 'helpless' after father's coronavirus death\n\nNewly-wed Andy Wyness developed a high temperature and a cough following a trip to Wales.\n\nWhen his symptoms worsened the 53-year-old drove himself from his Wishaw home to an appointment at an assessment centre.\n\nThat was the last time his wife, Sandra, saw him.\n\nThe grandfather, who was a keen bowler, was taken straight to hospital by ambulance. He died on 6 April.\n\n\"Even walking out the house that night, although I knew he wasn't well, I never imagined he would never walk back in,\" Sandra said.\n\nMy husband went to the doctor and never came back\n\nJanice Graham was the first NHS worker to die with coronavirus in Scotland.\n\nThe health care support worker and district nurse died at Inverclyde Royal Hospital on 6 April.\n\nOne colleague said she had a \"bright and engaging personality and razor sharp wit\".\n\nAnther said the 58-year-old was the \"most kind, caring and compassionate HCA I have had the privilege to work with\".\n\nHer son, Craig, told STV News he would miss everything about her.\n\nNurse remembered for her 'kindness and compassion'\n\nMaths teacher Gerry McHugh was a \"true gentleman\", able to inspire every single student who walked through his door.\n\nHis death would have a \"devastating effect\" on the Notre Dame High School community in Greenock, head teacher Katie Couttie said.\n\nUnable to attend his funeral due to the lockdown, past and current pupils found a unique way to pay tribute to the 58-year-old.\n\nThey wore red and posted images on social media in memory of the lifelong Manchester United fan.\n\nHe died on 11 April.\n\nPupils find safe way to honour much-loved teacher\n\nFormer Merchant Navy engineer Bill Campbell died of suspected Covid-19 at Erskine Park care home in Bishopton.\n\nThe 86-year-old had dementia and carers initially thought he had a chest infection but he developed a cough and a high temperature.\n\nHis condition deteriorated and he died on Easter Sunday, with his daughter, Linda Verlaque - in full protective clothing - by his side.\n\nShe praised the work of carers at the home but she said his death was \"horrific\" as undertakers came to take away his body in full hazmat gear and goggles.\n\n\"Instead of having people surrounding me and giving me a hug to say everything was all right, everyone was just standing there and we were watching my dad being taken away, which was traumatic,\" she said.\n\nDad's virus death in care home was 'traumatic'\n\nDerek Wilkie worked for 27 years as a firefighter before retiring in December 2017.\n\nHe had senior roles in Badenoch and Strathspey, and Shetland before becoming station commander for Inverness and Nairn District.\n\nColleagues said he was a \"diligent and capable firefighter...with a larger than life personality\".\n\nHis wife and two sons - who all work for the NHS - thanked those who cared for Mr Wilkie and urged people to stay at home.\n\nHe died at Raigmore Hospital in Inverness on 12 April.\n\nEx-firefighter dies after contracting Covid-19\n\nAnne Duncan contracted coronavirus in Lethan Park care home in Edinburgh.\n\nHer daughter Linda, a lawyer for the BBC, had hoped she would survive the virus as she was from \"strong stock\".\n\nShe last saw her mother in March when she travelled from London to warn her they may not be able to visit her during the pandemic.\n\nThe pensioner had been \"extremely distressed\" afterwards, Ms Duncan said.\n\nShe was taken to Edinburgh's Western General Hospital on 12 April and died three days later.\n\nCare home death 'hard to process' for family\n\nMary McCann, 70, was a \"strong, wonderful woman\" who was dedicated to her family, according to her son, David.\n\nShe spent the last three months of her life in an East Kilbride care home, having being diagnosed with cancer last year.\n\nThe grandmother was doing well in the Whitehills home, where she was putting on weight and smiling again, David said.\n\nBut in early April she developed a urinary tract infection.

        "body": "David Harris's world has shrunk to the size of his front room.\n\nSeven weeks ago he developed Covid-19 symptoms that he describes as being like a bad flu.\n\nThat was when the freelance architect, 42, first began to isolate himself at the home in Bristol he shares with his wife and baby daughter.\n\nAfter a week or so he started to feel better, but two weeks later his symptoms returned, much to his surprise.\n\n\"It's been a bit of a mini-saga of a recurring wave of symptoms which I wasn't expecting at all,\" he said.\n\n\"The second wave was much worse - the same flu symptoms, but also with shortness of breath, and that's why I was confident it was coronavirus.\n\n\"Then I had two weeks where I thought I was getting better, I was just very tired.\n\n\"And then on week seven, I relapsed again and had my third wave, luckily much milder but still significant.\"\n\nWorking on the basis it was better to be safe than sorry, David continued to self-isolate, changing into clean clothes on the rare occasions he left the front room to visit the bathroom, and eating and sleeping alone.\n\nHis wife would bring their 10-month-old daughter Millie to the window of the front room so David could see her through the glass.\n\nThe illness left David exhausted and uncertain what was going to happen next.\n\n\"Probably one of the most stressful things is trying to work out at what point you ask for help.\n\n\"You don't want to pester the NHS, because there are obviously people in much worse situations than me.\n\n\"But certainly, at my weakest moment I didn't want to fall into the trap of not asking for help and then something bad happening because you didn't ask for help.\n\n\"When I first relapsed, when I first got worse, it's quite a scary experience because you don't know if that means you're going down, down, down.\n\n\"So it is quite scary to get worse when you thought you were getting better.\"\n\nFelicity, 49, from London, is six weeks into her recovery after first falling ill with Covid-type symptoms.\n\nBut like David, her experience has been far from smooth.\n\n\"I think the hardest part was having gone through the first 10 days of being very sick and thinking I was getting better, things then getting much, much worse again.\n\n\"So it was actually in the fifth week of being ill that my partner had to call A&E because I was experiencing such horrific abdominal pains that I was just calling out in just extreme agony.\n\n\"It's so difficult to know, is that the work of the virus? Is it the immune system's response? Is it ongoing inflammation?\n\n\"I had no problems in my stomach before falling sick, but week five was just horrendous.\"\n\nNeither Felicity nor David has been tested for Covid-19, but both were told by doctors they probably had the virus.\n\nThey have also been assured they are no longer infectious.\n\nBut Felicity struggled to shake off her symptoms and the weeks of illness have taken their toll.\n\n\"I spend a huge amount of time in bed trying to recover.\n\n\"This entire experience, of being sick and trying to recover, has been mentally overwhelming.\"\n\nPart of the problem is that so much about the coronavirus is unknown, including why some people experience relatively mild symptoms lasting a few days, while other perfectly healthy people are left struggling for weeks.\n\nDr Philip Gothard, a consultant physician at London's Hospital for Tropical Diseases, says the vast majority of patients make a full and fairly rapid recovery.\n\n\"Some will have a persisting cough and we're beginning to see patients who've got profound fatigue and exhaustion that goes on perhaps three, four, five or six weeks.\n\n\"It's very distressing if you're an otherwise young healthy person, it's something you're not used to.\n\n\"And so it comes as a shock that recovery is slow and stuttering.\n\n\"But in many patients with other diseases who are recovering from an acute illness you do tend to see this kind of waxing and waning effect as you are slowly getting better, and you have good days and bad days.\"\n\nTim Spector, professor of genetic epidemiology at King's College London, says data emerging from the Covid Symptom Study app shows that, on average, it takes people 12 days to start slowly recovering.\n\n\"We are also seeing a significant number of people reporting symptoms that can go on much longer than this, in some cases for 30 days or more.\n\n\"As we collect more data and continue to use machine-learning and artificial intelligence, we will soon be able to identify which combination of symptoms and risk factors make a person more or less likely to suffer from these longer terms symptoms.\"\n\nDavid and Felicity both hope they are now finally recovering and can start to return to normal life.\n\nBut Covid-19, an illness that is still only a few months old, continues to spring surprises on us, and none of them welcome.",

I no longer get mixed up with a dermatologist and asked to look at people's skin rashes.\n\nAn epidemiologist is a medical detective, and like all detectives, the three key clues we are looking for are always: person, place and time.\n\nSo when I got an email out of the blue from a Bradford resident saying that she and her friends may have been infected with Covid-19 in January - nearly two months before the first confirmed case of transmission in the UK - I looked for these clues and decided to investigate further.\n\nJane Hall is a member of two choirs - the Voices of Yorkshire choir and the All Together Now Community Choir - and she says that Covid-like symptoms affected members of both, starting in early January.\n\nAmong the first singers to get ill was the partner of a man who returned from a business trip to Wuhan on 17 or 18 December and developed a hacking cough.\n\n\"My friend from the choir became ill mid-January. Then my best friend, Christine, became ill, and then I became ill in the first weekend of February,\" Jane said.\n\nShe went on to describe her symptoms.\n\n\"I had a throat that felt like I had swallowed broken glass, a high temperature, headaches... I was totally fatigued - I slept for two whole days which was totally unlike me. I had a high temperature and a dry unproductive cough.\"\n\nWith the passing of time, a new symptom emerged.\n\n\"It was like breathing through treacle - I was really struggling to breathe and it felt like there was a lot of gunk I was trying to breathe through.\"\n\nProf John Wright, a medical doctor and epidemiologist, is head of the Bradford Institute for Health Research, and a veteran of cholera, HIV and Ebola epidemics in sub-Saharan Africa. He is writing this diary for BBC News and recording from the hospital wards for BBC Radio 4's The NHS Front Line\n\nAnd later Jane noticed yet another symptom - an impaired sense of smell. Already on the mend, she visited her friend, Simon, a member of the All Together Now Community choir, who was also ailing. She made him a hot drink.\n\n\"And the milk curdled when I put milk in the tea. And I said, 'Oh, isn't the milk off?' And he said, 'Oh well, I had some this morning and it did the same but I couldn't taste any different.' So I smelled the milk, and I couldn't smell anything. And I couldn't understand how come I couldn't smell it - the milk was off.\"\n\nJane was describing some of the classical symptoms people can experience with Covid-19. On most occasions when people contact me to say they had an illness like this last year, I reassure them that it was probably a different viral infection. But Jane's story, with the link to Wuhan in mid-December, is very interesting.\n\nChris Kemp, who runs the All Together Now Community Choirs, was also among the first to get ill, with a cough and a feeling of exhaustion. He says he first felt poorly on 27 December, and didn't feel properly better until early February.\n\nA singer in the choir, Suzanne Smith, points out that its \"Christmas\" party takes place in January, and that people could have infected one another with the mystery illness there. She herself came down with it later in the month. But at that point, awareness of Covid-19 was low.\n\n\"We didn't really know about Covid,\" she says. \"I work in a doctor's surgery but this was before it was widely talked about. I think it could have been what we had. It is intriguing.\"\n\nSimon Rochester, who drank the tea Jane made with sour milk on 8 February, says choir members had noticed how many of them were coming down with a similar illness, but didn't make a connection with the coronavirus.\n\n\"If it was something we'd heard of it was in the news, like 'China had this problem and blah, blah, blah,'\" he says. \"So we didn't really recognise that there was any possibility that we would have anything.\"\n\nBy all accounts, the members of the choir are very friendly. They socialise as well as sing, and there is plenty of hugging. Simon Rochester describes it as \"an ideal breeding ground\" for infection. And it's likely they passed their virus to some outside the choir as well.\n\nJuanita Kearns runs the Bulls Head pub in Baildon, just north of central Bradford, the destination for Altogether Now choir members after their weekly practice session in a church hall nearby. Towards the end of January she collapsed, barely able to breathe, and went to bed, sweating profusely. Her doctor called an ambulance.\n\n\"My doctor asked if I'd been to China, the ambulance people asked if I'd been to China and the hospital asked me the same. I said no, and explained again about being a pub landlady. They said I appeared to have a lung condition and sent me home,\" she says.\n\n\"I think they need to test us all, so many of us have been so ill. It's like nothing I've ever known. The entire choir are always in here, we are all friendly together. I'm only 53, no underlying health conditions and never ill. This was really strange and I'm convinced we all had it.\"\n\nThese experiences are fascinating. We have to be cautious about assuming that this is Covid-19 - there will have been lots of other seasonal viral illnesses circulating - but what interests me in this case is the pattern of transmission, the timeframe and what's been described about the initial link to what we think was happening in Wuhan.\n\nIn all epidemics, when you start tracking back, you find that there were cases much earlier than expected. The nature of epidemics is they do start very, very slowly - one or two people, gradually increasing - and before it hits people's radar it's been lurking just below it for some time.\n\nSo I'm sure there will be cases where people have travelled to Wuhan, who have been exposed to the virus before it was officially announced by the Chinese government, and who have come back and had symptoms (or have been infected but asymptomatic).\n\nThe test for Covid-19 we have at present only tells us whether someone is infected at the time the test is carried out. We haven't yet, in the NHS, got a reliable test that reveals whether someone had it in the past, but we hope to have one in the next few weeks.\n\nWhen we do, it will be very interesting to see whether Juanita and Jane and her choral friends had a normal winter virus - or were among the first in the UK to experience the Covid-19 pandemic.",

        "body": "Thousands of cancer patients will be operated on at new centres designed to be kept clear of coronavirus.\n\nThe regional \"virus-free\" centres have been set up in 21 areas of England to carry out urgent surgery during the pandemic.\n\nTrusts have been told all essential cancer treatments must continue despite the NHS focus on coronavirus.\n\nBut it is estimated cancer referrals have dropped by about 70%.\n\nA survey by NHS England of 1,000 people found a third were worried about seeking help from their GP.\n\nTop reasons included fear of catching coronavirus, giving it to family members, and being a burden on the health service.\n\nQueen Victoria Hospital in East Grinstead, West Sussex, is the first such designated cancer hub to be established in the South East outside London.\n\nIt is treating patients across Sussex, Surrey and Kent who have been diagnosed with head and neck, breast and skin cancers.\n\nInitial conversations and diagnoses are made remotely between surgeon and patient via a video consultation to limit face-to-face contact.\n\nAnyone visiting the hospital goes through a screening process which includes temperature checks before being allowed on site.\n\nRod Plethero, 71, lives 40 miles away from Queen Victoria Hospital. He was referred there last week for an operation after being diagnosed with cancer of the jaw.\n\nPart of Rod's jaw was removed and replaced with bone from his fibula.\n\nHe said: \"I took the chance to come here straightaway because it's a Covid-free area. Cancer is not a disease that waits for you and having the surgery meant everything.\"\n\nPrior to admission, patients are given a swab test for Covid-19 and are asked to remain in isolation for seven days. If they need complex surgery they may also be given a CT scan.\n\nIf a patient is diagnosed with coronavirus they will be given a date for surgery after their recovery.\n\nQVH associate medical director Dr Ian Francis said: \"An unintended consequence of the pandemic is that cancer patients aren't being treated in their favour because of the lack of capacity within the NHS.\n\n\"Cancer hubs like this are imperative. Before we had the pandemic, cancer was a significant issue.\n\n\"If you put the pandemic on top of that, it's even more critical than ever to ensure their outcomes are as good as you could expect any other time.\"\n\nProf Peter Johnson, NHS England's clinical director for cancer, said waiting to get help could have \"serious consequences\" for patients - and ultimately put a greater burden on the NHS.\n\nHe said: \"Online consultations mean people do not necessarily need to go to GP surgeries for check-ups while Covid-free cancer hubs have been set up to provide surgery.\"\n\nThere are calls for diagnostic services to be up and running more widely too to investigate whether patients do in fact have cancer and need treatment.\n\nProf Richard Neal, a GP in Leeds, said: \"Many diagnostic pathways are not open because they're unsafe as they are aerosol generating so GPs can't get our patients to have those procedures done for good reasons.\n\n\"It will take quite a little while to get public confidence back into knowing they can come to GPs and to take those symptoms further if they are concerned about them.\"",

The report says the contact tracing operation will be led by 94 teams spread across the country, with each team responsible for an area with a population of roughly 30,000.\n\nEach of the 94 teams will have between 15 to 17 members amounting to a total workforce of 1,400 to 1,600 full time employees on duty across the country seven days per week.\n\nPublic Health Wales will also provide a \"National Contact Centre\", which will provide extra support with the contact tracing effort via telephone..\n\nPlaid Cymru health spokesman Rhun ap Iorwerth said: \"This outline document contains as many questions as answers.\n\n\"Worryingly, there is no clear commitment let alone a coherent strategy to drive transmission rates down to as close to zero as possible in line with the 'disease elimination' strategy followed successfully by the likes of South Korea and New Zealand.\n\n\"Moving to 'Test, trace and isolate' will require a sea change in testing capacity. 10,000 a day would be a good start but we may need 3 times that.\"\n\nThe report indicates many workers will come from councils and local health boards.\n\n\"A workforce of this size cannot be met from the health protection resources within Public Health Wales or Local Government,\" the document says.\n\n\"However, the nature of the patient identifiable information collected and distributed will mean that the resource will have to come from redeployment of existing public sector workers.\"\n\nIt suggests that non-specialist workers would be needed to free up resources in Environmental Health and Public Health Wales, allowing them to focus on more \"complex tasks and outbreaks\".\n\nThe document, dated last Wednesday, said that the UK government's scientific advisory group SAGE believes the reproduction rate in Wales is 0.9.\n\nIt estimated that 60-70% of the population is complying with social distancing, estimating that by the end of May this year there will be around 1000 to 1,500 cases in Wales.\n\nUnder the contact system the plan estimates that each day between 7,500 and 30,000 new contacts will be identified.\n\nAbout 105,000 and 400,000 cases at any one time could need to be tracked.",

You do not need to keep self-isolating after seven days, unless you have a high temperature or are unwell, says the advice.\n\nLoss of smell and taste may still be signs of other respiratory infections, such as the common cold. Experts say fever and cough remain important symptoms of coronavirus to look out for.\n\nUsing an app, researchers at King's College London have gathered symptom information from over 1.5m people in the UK who believe they might have had coronavirus.\n\nThey say there are even more symptoms - such as tiredness and stomach pain or diarrhoea - that could be included as possible coronavirus symptoms.\n\nSome other countries and the World Health Organization are already citing them.\n\nLead researcher Prof Tim Spector said: \"We list about 14 symptoms which we know are related to having a positive swab test.\n\n\"These are not being picked up by the NHS. This country is missing them all and not only underestimating cases but also putting people at risk and continuing the epidemic.\n\n\"There's no point telling people to be alert if they don't know the symptoms.\"\n\nProf Nirmal Kumar from ENT UK, the body that represents ear, nose and throat doctors, said the change was \"better late than never\".\n\n\"We had been asking for this almost eight weeks ago. The delay has not helped at all. Many, many people have contacted us with concerns about loss of smell and taste and whether these are symptoms they should act upon.\"\n\nEngland's deputy chief medical officer, Prof Jonathan Van-Tam said it was important to update advice at the right time \"when we think it's going to make a difference moving forwards to how we pick up cases\".\n\nDowning Street said the UK's chief medical officers were continually reviewing symptoms of the virus based on advice from experts.\n\n\"They are now confident that encouraging self-isolation with a loss of sense of smell or taste will pick up slightly more cases and help to further control the spread of the virus,\" the prime minister's official spokesman said.\n\nThe World Health Organization says along with the most common symptoms of fever, cough and tiredness, people may have:\n\nOn Monday, the Department for Health and Social Care announced 160 new deaths of people who had tested positive for Covid-19.\n\nThe overall UK death toll remains the highest in Europe, and was at 34,796 as of 17:00 BST on Sunday.",

        "authors": [],
        "body": "The UK provided more than 122,000 coronavirus tests on the last day of April, passing the government's target, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said.\n\nMr Hancock said the 100,000 target was \"audacious\", but testing was needed to get Britain \"back on her feet\".\n\nThe figure includes 40,000 tests sent out, including directly to people's homes, which may not yet have been taken.\n\nMr Hancock set the goal on 2 April, when the UK was on 10,000 tests a day.\n\nSome 27,510 people have now died in UK hospitals, care homes and the wider community after testing positive for coronavirus.\n\nOf the 122,347 tests provided in the 24 hours up to Friday morning, the number of people tested was fewer - at just over 70,000 - as has been the case since the testing programme began. This is because some people need to be tested more than once to get a reliable result.\n\nThe total testing figure includes 27,497 kits which were delivered to people's homes and also 12,872 tests that were sent out to centres such as hospitals and NHS sites.\n\nHowever, these may not have been actually used or sent back to a lab.\n\nLabour's shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth suggested the government had been misleading. \"This isn't a time for quibbling but actually 39,000 of these tests have simply been posted out so it's not quite that the government have hit their commitment,\" he told the BBC News channel.\n\n\"I don't think posting out the tests is the same as carrying out tests but nonetheless it is welcome that testing has increased.\"\n\nPrior to 28 April, there was no reference to how tests were counted, but on 28 April guidance on the government website said home tests and satellite tests were being included.\n\nAt the daily Downing Street briefing, Prof John Newton - a scientist advising the government on testing - said there had been \"no change to the way tests are counted\".\n\n\"As we've developed new ways of delivering tests, we've taken advice from officials as to how they should be counted,\" Prof Newton said.\n\n\"So, the tests that are done within the control of the programme - which is the great majority - are counted when the tests are undertaken in our laboratories.\n\n\"But, for any test which goes outside the control of the programme, they're counted when they leave the programme - so that's the tests that are mailed out to people at home and the test that's gone out on the satellite.\"\n\nThe headline figures certainly look impressive - 122,000 tests in a day. Just a week ago around 25,000 were being recorded and a month ago it stood at 10,000.\n\nIt is testament to the hard work that has been done behind the scenes by a partnership of government, scientists and the private sector - with a helping hand from the military.\n\nBut has the government been a little creative with its counting? It has included home-testing kits sent out to individuals as well as the satellite kits - these are batches of tests sent out to care homes and other settings where there are lots of people who need testing.\n\nSome, no doubt, will never be returned.\n\nA week ago these made little difference to the figures - only a few thousand a day were being sent out. But now they account for around a third of the tests.\n\nIn his opening remarks, the health secretary suggested the government's 100,000 target had had a \"galvanising effect\".\n\nHe said the testing capacity built since then would \"help every single person in this country\", and would \"help us to unlock the lockdown\".\n\nMr Hancock said the government's \"next mission\" was its test, track and trace operation and work was already under way to roll it out.\n\n\"By mid-May, we will have an initial 18,000 contact tracers in place,\" he said.\n\n\"The combination of contact tracers and new technology, through our new Covid-19 NHS app, will help tell us where the virus is spreading and help everyone to control new infections.\"\n\nMr Hancock added that the next phase would allow the government \"to reassert, as much as is safely possible, the liberty of us all\".\n\nThe Department of Health established a testing network, including three \"mega labs\" to test samples, almost 50 drive-through centres, a home-testing service and mobile testing units, as part of the drive to achieve the government's target.\n\nMeanwhile, Mr Hancock also expanded the list of people eligible for testing throughout the month.\n\nAt first, across the UK, the focus was on testing the sickest patients in hospitals, followed by health, care and emergency services staff.\n\nAs of last week, other essential workers and their families in England became eligible for testing, if they showed symptoms.\n\nTesting was further expanded in England earlier this week to millions more people, with symptoms including over-65s, those who have to leave home to work, and people living with someone in these groups.\n\nIn Scotland, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon announced earlier that testing will be expanded to over-65s with symptoms and also all those in care homes where there has been an outbreak.\n\nAnd on Friday, the Welsh government extended coronavirus testing to people in care homes even if they are not showing symptoms of the disease.",

        "body": "The government's ability to test people for coronavirus has been \"inadequate\" throughout the pandemic, a committee of MPs has said.\n\nThe Science and Technology Committee said capacity had not been increased \"early or boldly enough\".\n\nIt said a lack of capacity had driven initial decisions in mid-March to scale back contact tracing and largely restrict tests to hospital patients.\n\nNo 10 said testing had since been expanded on \"an unprecedented scale\".\n\nCommittee chairman Greg Clark said ministers would need to \"apply the lessons\" from the \"slowness\" of increases to testing to other areas.\n\nIn a letter to Prime Minister Boris Johnson, the Conservative MP added that capacity \"drove strategy, rather than strategy driving capacity\".\n\nThe UK significantly increased its testing capacity throughout April, although it has previously faced criticism it was initially too slow to do so.\n\nA target for 100,000 daily tests was initially met on 1 May, but then missed for eight consecutive days after that before being met again on 10 May.\n\nOn Monday, after 100,678 tests were provided in the previous 24 hours, ministers announced another expansion in eligibility, with everyone aged five and over now able to get tested if they show symptoms.\n\nIncreasing testing capacity has also been seen as crucial in allowing a mass programme to track infected people using an NHS app, which ministers want to launch UK-wide \"in the coming weeks\".\n\nIn his letter, Mr Clark laid out several recommendations to ministers.\n\nHe accused Public Health England (PHE) of initially opting to \"concentrate\" tests in a limited number of its own laboratories and only expanding capacity \"gradually\".\n\nHe said that had led to the decision to initially abandon contact-tracing as a strategy on 12 March, and meant care home residents could not be tested when the virus was spreading at its fastest rate.\n\nHe added that evidence taken by his committee from experts in South Korea, Hong Kong and Germany had shown the need for mass testing was \"identifiable from the beginning\".\n\nIn response, PHE said it was \"not responsible\" for the UK's testing strategy, which \"has been led by the Department of Health and Social Care\".\n\nIts chief executive Duncan Selbie added that \"any testing facility with the right technology and containment\" could conduct the test it approved after security restrictions were lowered on 3 March.\n\n\"PHE did not constrain or seek to control any laboratory either public, university or commercial from conducting testing,\" he added.\n\nThe committee also said the transparency of scientific advice to ministers needed to be improved, and called for summaries of advice to be published \"now and regularly\".\n\nIt added that while some scientific papers discussed by the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) had been published, 92 out of the current total of 120 had yet to be made public.\n\nA statement from Downing Street said that testing rates had increased \"on an unprecedented scale\" from 2,000 per day at the start of March to more than 100,000 in May.\n\n\"Now everyone aged five and over who has symptoms and needs a test can get one - and we will continue to build this capacity,\" it added.\n\n\"This is an unprecedented global pandemic and we have taken the right steps at the right time to combat it, guided at all times by the best scientific advice.\"",

        "body": "The US's Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has authorised the emergency use of the Ebola drug remdesivir for treating the coronavirus.\n\nThe authorisation means the anti-viral drug can now be used on people who are hospitalised with severe Covid-19.\n\nA recent clinical trial showed the drug helped shorten the recovery time for people who were seriously ill.\n\nBut emergency FDA authorisation is not the same as formal approval, which requires a higher level of review.\n\nExperts have also warned the drug - which was originally developed to treat Ebola, and is produced by Gilead pharmaceutical company - shouldn't be seen as a \"magic bullet\" for coronavirus.\n\nDuring a meeting with US President Donald Trump in the Oval Office, Gilead Chief Executive Daniel O'Day said the FDA authorisation was an important first step. The company would donate 1.5 million vials of the drug, he said.\n\nFDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn also said at the meeting: \"It's the first authorised therapy for Covid-19, so we're really proud to be part of it.\"\n\nPresident Trump has been a vocal supporter of remdesivir as a potential treatment for the coronavirus.\n\nIn its clinical trial, the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) found that remdesivir cut the duration of symptoms from 15 days down to 11. The trials involved 1,063 people at hospitals around the world. Some were given the drug and others were given a placebo (dummy) treatment.\n\nDr Anthony Fauci who runs NIAID, said that remdesivir had \"a clear-cut, significant, positive effect in diminishing the time to recovery\".\n\nHowever, although remdesivir may aid recovery - and possibly stop people having to be treated in intensive care - the trials did not give any clear indication whether it can prevent deaths from coronavirus.\n\nNews of the potential treatment comes as a nursing home in New York reports 98 coronavirus-related deaths.\n\nThe Isabella Geriatric Center in Manhattan said 46 of its residents died after testing positive, while the other 52 were suspected to have had the virus.\n\nAnd Dr Fauci has been barred from testifying next week to a congressional committee examining the Trump administration's response to the pandemic.\n\n\"While the Trump administration continues its whole-of-government response to Covid-19, including safely opening up America again and expediting vaccine development, it is counter-productive to have the very individuals involved in those efforts appearing at congressional hearings,\" White House spokesman Judd Deere said in a statement.",

        "body": "Coronavirus testing is available for millions more people in England from today after the government loosened rules on who can apply.\n\nTesting was expanded last week to all key workers in England and their households.\n\nNow, all care home residents and staff, people over 65 and those who must leave home to work are entitled to a test.\n\nNo 10 aims to hit its target of 100,000 tests per day by Thursday, with just over 43,000 taking place as of Monday.\n\nIt comes as the government prepares to publish for the first time up to date figures for all coronavirus deaths, both in hospitals and care homes. Previously, the daily reported figure has been restricted almost entirely to hospital deaths.\n\nOffice for National Statistics data showed a third of all coronavirus deaths in England and Wales are now happening in care homes.\n\nSpeaking at the latest coronavirus briefing, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said: \"From construction workers to emergency plumbers, from research scientists to those in manufacturing, the expansion of access to testing will protect the most vulnerable and help keep people safe.\"\n\nAnyone eligible can book a test on the government's test-booking website. Last week, it closed temporarily following \"exceptional demand\" when key workers were first able to register.\n\nMeanwhile, Downing Street has refused to confirm whether Boris Johnson will appear at Prime Minister's Questions later.\n\nIt is set to be his first appearance opposite the new leader of the Labour Party, Sir Keir Starmer.\n\nMr Johnson and Sir Keir are also due to speak by telephone later, as part of the government's commitment to keep opposition parties informed about its response to the pandemic.\n\nThis represents a massive expansion of who is eligible for testing - and means we are now one step away from allowing everyone to access a test if they have symptoms.\n\nThat will be crucial when lockdown restrictions are eased as part of the \"test, track and trace\" strategy to keep coronavirus at bay.\n\nIt is being made possible by the roll-out of home-testing kits and mobile units staffed by the armed forces.\n\nThe problems experienced getting more people tested have - to some extent - been because the network of drive-through testing centres have not always been in convenient locations.\n\nThere is plenty of lab capacity to process the tests now the three mega labs are up-and-running in Milton Keynes, Glasgow and Cheshire.\n\nThe expansion has also allowed the government to do something that could prove crucial in tackling the epidemic in care homes - the testing of residents and staff without symptoms.\n\nA big concern is that the virus has been able to get a foothold in care homes via people transmitting it before they develop symptoms or if they are asymptomatic.\n\nBut promising something is one thing - delivering it is another.\n\nWhile the capacity looks like it will be there to test 100,000 a day by the end of the month, the numbers actually getting tested are currently less than half that.\n\nEligibility criteria for testing varies around the UK.\n\nIn Scotland, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said all patients over 70 who are admitted to hospital for any reason will now be tested for Covid-19.\n\nIn Northern Ireland, testing has begun in some GP practices and will also be expanded in hospitals and care homes. Wales has adopted a needs-based approach to testing for NHS and \"critical\" non-NHS workers.\n\nMeanwhile, Office for National Statistics data showed there were 2,000 coronavirus care home deaths in England and Wales in the week ending 17 April, double the previous week.\n\nIt brings the total number of deaths in care homes linked to the virus since the start of the pandemic to 3,096.\n\nCoronavirus deaths in hospitals across the UK, have reached 21,678 - a rise of 586 from Monday.\n\nThe health secretary said that from Wednesday the government will publish daily figures on deaths in care homes and the community.\n\nHe said the change aimed to \"bring as much transparency as possible\" to the figures and \"add to our understanding of how this virus is spreading day by day\".",

People who need a test can apply through the NHS website, or dial 119 if they do not have access to the internet.\n\nThe range of recognised symptoms was also expanded on Monday - as well as a continuous cough or fever, a loss of taste or smell are also included.\n\nThe Welsh Government wants to increase the number of tests for people in hospital, key workers and in care homes to 10,000 a day by the end of the month.\n\nIt has said that it could increase to 20,000 a day by drawing on the UK-wide testing programme.\n\nWelsh Health Minister Vaughan Gething said: \"This announcement is a major step forward in increasing coronavirus testing in Wales even further.\n\n\"Critical workers will continue to be prioritised for testing but now members of the public with symptoms can apply for a test. The number of people we can test will increase as we continue to build our capacity.\"\n\nHe told BBC Wales the Welsh NHS will receive the results of the tests, which will go to a \"UK testing lab\".\n\nOpposition parties gave the news cautious approval.\n\nWelsh Conservative health spokeswoman Angela Burns said it came with the \"usual caveat of 'How will Wales cope?', because the testing regime in Wales has been very poor, with missed and then abandoned targets since this pandemic began\".\n\n\"We need to see real and sustained improvements and increases here by the Welsh Government before this new policy can give us hope,\" she said.\n\nPlaid Cymru health minister Rhun ap Iorwerth said: \"We're all in agreement that we can't even begin to significantly ease restrictions in Wales without having testing, tracing and isolating plans in place that we can trust.\n\n\"But after consistently failing to reach testing targets before scrapping them, the Welsh Government has put even more pressure on itself to get this right.\"\n\nWelsh Secretary Simon Hart said both the UK and Welsh governments \"have worked closely together to put the safety of Wales' population at the centre of our efforts to combat the coronavirus\".\n\n\"The decision of the Welsh Government to join the rest of the UK on the testing portal brings that alignment even closer,\" he added.",

        "body": "Wales' first Covid-19 patient hopes his recovery from the disease will inspire others to \"stay positive\" through the pandemic.\n\nMark Hosking, 53, from Mumbles, Swansea, became ill following a family skiing holiday in Italy in February.\n\nHe is recovering at home after spending more than two weeks in hospital, including four days in an induced coma.\n\n\"If you can take your time and build up your strength, you can become the person you were before,\" he said.\n\nMr Hosking added: \"You hear so much of the other side but you can come through it, so remain positive. You have to, there's no real alternative.\n\n\"If you're that severe that you have to go onto intensive care then the care they give you is fantastic.\"\n\nMr Hosking, a sales director, had only just returned from skiing in Lombardy - the epicentre of the outbreak in Italy - during the February school half-term when he began to feel unwell.\n\nHe self-isolated but his symptoms became more severe and after testing positive for the virus, he was taken to the Royal Free Hospital in London.\n\nHowever his condition continued to worsen and the decision was taken to put him into an induced coma.\n\n\"They [the doctors] came in and said 'we're going to be putting you out now and put you on a ventilator,\" he recalled.\n\n\"That was the biggest thing I was fearing because you have no sense of what's going on and there's every chance you might not come back.\n\n\"It happened so quickly, it's just like a light going out. I have no recollection of anything, I was just gone.\"\n\nMr Hosking praised the NHS staff for regularly updating his wife Gemma.\n\nHe said when she asked doctors just how ill her husband was, they replied, \"He's the sickest patient we have.\"\n\nSix weeks after leaving hospital, his breathing is slowly improving but he still struggles with fatigue.\n\n\"I was told take your time, don't expect to get back to full fitness quickly,\" Mr Hosking said.\n\n\"When I came out of the coma with the ventilator I felt extremely fragile, very weak, and even leaving the hospital was a strange thing.\n\n\"To leave the security of the hospital was a big thing. There's a lot of mental issues you've got to think about, to bring yourself back into the world. But the world had changed a lot from when I went in to when I came out.\"\n\nThe UK was in a \"contain\" phase of the outbreak when Mr Hosking was diagnosed so health authorities carried out checks to trace anyone he had been in contact with after returning from Italy.\n\nThat, he said, ensured there was no further contamination, though his daughter Ellen suffered mild symptoms at home.\n\nFirst Minister Mark Drakeford said the Welsh Government could adopt an experimental app being trialled in the Isle of Wight to track and trace coronavirus.\n\nMr Hosking said people should \"buy-in\" to self-isolation and contact tracing completely.\n\n\"I can't see any reason why the population shouldn't get involved with contact tracing and the apps,\" he said.\n\n\"That would be a very good thing to get us back to some degree of normality as soon as we can.\"",

        "body": "Yemen has recorded its first two deaths linked to the new coronavirus disease, raising fears of a devastating outbreak in the war-ravaged country.\n\nThe pair were reported to be brothers who died at a hospital in the southern port city of Aden.\n\nOfficials had confirmed five infections there on Wednesday. Previously, only one case had been detected nationwide.\n\nThe UN has warned there is a \"very real probability\" Covid-19 is circulating undetected within communities.\n\nFive years of civil war have devastated Yemen, reportedly killed more than 100,000 people, and triggered what is considered the world's worst humanitarian crisis.\n\nAn estimated 10 million Yemenis are on the brink of famine, 20 million have no access to healthcare, and the 50% of medical facilities still functioning are desperately ill-prepared to deal with a pandemic.\n\nYemen confirmed its first Covid-19 case almost four weeks ago - a port official in al-Shihr, in the government-controlled eastern province of Hadramawt.\n\nOn Wednesday, a committee reported that a cluster of five infections had been discovered in Aden, some 540km (335 miles) west of al-Shihr.\n\nA medical source in Aden told the UAE-based newspaper The National that the five cases were detected in the city's northern al-Mansourah district.\n\n\"The two cases who died are brothers,\" the source was quoted as saying.\n\n\"Both were transferred to a private hospital in al-Mansourah city, where they died on Monday and Tuesday,\" the source added.\n\nIn an interview with Yemeni state TV, Health Minister Nasser Baoum confirmed the two deaths and noted the similarities between the symptoms of Covid-19 and those of other contagious diseases that have seen major outbreaks in Yemen in recent years, such as Dengue Fever.\n\nAn official in the Southern Transitional Council (STC), a southern separatist movement that declared self-rule in Aden last weekend amid a power struggle with the government, warned that it was very likely the number of coronavirus cases would increase in the coming days.\n\nThe STC imposed a three-day curfew in Aden after the infections were discovered.\n\nTwo sources told Reuters news agency that at least one case had also been confirmed in the capital, Sanaa, which is controlled by the rebel Houthi movement.\n\nThe Houthi-run health ministry has said all suspected cases have tested negative.\n\nThe conflict in Yemen escalated in March 2015, when the Houthis seized control of much of the west of the country and forced President Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi to flee abroad.\n\nAlarmed by the rise of a group they believed to be backed militarily by Iran, Saudi Arabia and eight other Arab states began a campaign aimed at restoring Mr Hadi's government.\n\nAt the start of the war, Saudi officials forecast that it would last only a few weeks. But five years of military stalemate have followed.\n\nEarlier this month, the Saudi-led coalition unilaterally declared a ceasefire to support UN efforts to broker a peace settlement and stop the spread of Covid-19.\n\nHowever, the Houthis dismissed the move and in recent days coalition air strikes and clashes on the ground have reportedly increased.\n\n\"With an increase in fighting and Covid-19 hitting the world's largest humanitarian crisis, Yemen is on the brink of catastrophe. A ceasefire means an end to fighting, yet, we are seeing the opposite on the ground,\" warned Tamuna Sabadze, Yemen country director of the International Rescue Committee on Wednesday.\n\n\"International actors like the US, UK and France, who have influence over the warring parties, must push those responsible for the escalation in fighting to commit to a nationwide ceasefire and return to political negotiations to end the war.\"",

That's obviously quite a strange thought.\"\n\nPlayers and staff who have tested positive will now self-isolate for seven days.\n\nThe six positive results came as squads started non-contact training on Tuesday, as the Premier League steps up plans for a restart.\n\nA total of 748 players and staff from 19 clubs were tested. Norwich City did their tests on Tuesday and are yet to announce their results.\n\nBefore the news about Watford's positive tests emerged, captain Troy Deeney said he would not return to training because he feared for his family's health.\n\nA number of other team-mates have joined Deeney's stance in not training and they will follow individual programmes at home.\n\nThey want reassurances to questions they have around the return to training protocols and the specifics around the spread of the virus.\n\n\"We're due back in this week. I've said I'm not going in,\" Deeney, 31, told Eddie Hearn and Tony Bellew on the Talk the Talk YouTube show.\n\n\"It only takes one person to get infected within the group and I don't want to be bringing that home.\n\n\"My son is only five months old. He had breathing difficulties, so I don't want to come home to put him in more danger.\"\n\nIn an interview with the Sunday Times, manager Nigel Pearson expressed his own concerns about the situation and said he would not insist on players reporting for training.\n\nThe Premier League has been suspended since 13 March because of the Covid-19 pandemic, with 92 fixtures remaining.\n\nThe league had previously identified 12 June for matches to possibly start again, but there is now an expectation this will need to be pushed back.",

        "body": "Wales coach Wayne Pivac says his side will relish the prospect of a crowded international calendar later in the year.\n\nWales' summer tour to Japan and New Zealand looks set to be postponed because of coronavirus.\n\nPivac's side could travel to face the All Blacks in October before hosting an autumn series in November.\n\n\"If you had to play six or seven Test matches over eight to 10 weeks, they'd relish the opportunity,\" said Pivac.\n\nWales still have to finish their 2019 Six Nations campaign after the match against Scotland on 14 March was postponed because of the pandemic.\n\nA Test in Japan on 27 June and two international matches against New Zealand on 4 and 11 July are likely to be called off.\n\nWales also are due to host a November programme against Fiji, Argentina, New Zealand and South Africa, with a Six Nations-style tournament mooted as a replacement if the overseas sides cannot travel.\n\n\"You could end up with the New Zealand matches, Scotland and a full autumn programme in a period of weeks,\" said Pivac.\n\n\"That would be something new but talking to the players, they just want to get back as everybody does to some sort of normality.\"\n\nPivac insisted that would not be a rushed process after admitting some players had suffered coronavirus symptoms.\n\nThe Wales coach had previously said it had affected three of his squad but would not name the individuals.\n\n\"Some have picked up illness - it is about four or five players all told but nobody has been required to go to hospital,\" said Pivac.\n\n\"They have had symptoms like cough and temperature and have dealt with that at home and have come out the other side.\n\n\"What that is telling us is that you can be the fittest bloke in the world but this thing is not going to discriminate. Young, fit athletes can pick it up like older people can.\n\n\"But we have been fortunate nobody has been seriously ill with the virus.\"\n\nPivac insists player welfare will take precedence.\n\n\"It won't be a question of going back and simply turning up for training and playing,\" said Pivac, who believes the players will need about five weeks together before they are ready for a match.\n\n\"One would imagine there will be testing involved because you are asking people to stay two metres apart and to play a game of rugby, and those two sentences don't go together.\"\n\nWales could be asked to play behind closed doors initially, with WRU chief executive Martyn Phillips saying last week that matches might be taken away from the Principality Stadium, which is currently a field hospital with 2,000 beds.\n\n\"It is mind-blowing to think a number of weeks ago we were training at the Principality Stadium and our base in the Vale of Glamorgan and now they are both hospitals,\" said Pivac.\n\n\"It is a reality check and puts sports into perspective and rams home the enormity of what we are dealing with. These are unique times and it is amazing to see what has happened.\n\n\"Playing behind closed doors is interesting.\n\n\"Home advantage will be affected especially when you factor in 75,000 people gives you a few points and it becomes a bit of a fortress. Take the crowd out and it become more a neutral venue, a different environment.\n\n\"If the hospital is still there [at Principality Stadium] and we are back playing behind closed doors, we could be at another venue.\n\n\"You still have the game on television and it is a spectacle for people to view. We have contracts we need to see through so it is a starting point for rugby.\n\n\"Without crowds, ticket prices and hospitality it hurts financially but it could be staged first of all behind closed doors before going back to full crowds.\"\n\nPivac believes Wales can help lift the mood when rugby returns.\n\n\"It will be massive when we return because sport plays a huge part in our lives,\" said Pivac.\n\n\"Welsh rugby plays a massive part in the community. When you think about when we do get back to normality and play a Test match in front of 75,000 people, what that does to Cardiff is amazing.\n\n\"We can help put a smile on people's faces. It will be a special day when we do get back, I can assure you of that.\"",

    "We owe it to children to open schools - Williamson": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "Education Secretary Gavin Williamson has said \"we owe it to the children\" to get pupils back in school, as he reassured parents it would be safe.\n\nMr Williamson said he knew some parents were \"very anxious\" about reopening schools, but said it would be a \"cautious, phased return\".\n\nIt follows a row over the government's plan to begin a phased reopening of schools in England from 1 June.\n\nTeachers' unions have said the date is too soon to be safe.\n\nSpeaking at the government's daily briefing on Saturday, Mr Williamson said: \"There are some who would like to delay the wider opening of schools but there is a consequence to this.\n\n\"The longer that schools are closed the more children miss out. Teachers know this. Teachers know that there are children out there that have not spoken or played with another child of their own age for two months.\n\n\"They know there are children from difficult or very unhappy homes for whom school is the happiest moment in their week and it's also the safest place for them to be.\"\n\nEngland is the only UK nation to set a date for schools to start to reopen. Schools in Wales will not reopen on 1 June, while those in Scotland and Northern Ireland may not restart before the summer holidays.\n\nMeanwhile, the number of people who died with coronavirus in the UK has increased by 468, the government said on Saturday. It takes the total number of UK deaths, in all settings following a positive coronavirus test, to 34,466.\n\nSchools in England closed for most pupils on 20 March, staying open only for the children of key workers and vulnerable children.\n\nThe phased reopening will begin with children in nursery and pre-school, Reception and Years 1 and 6 at returning to primary school first an 1 June. At secondary school and college, Years 10 and 12 would return first.\n\nBut teaching unions have said plans to reopen primary schools do not have adequate safety measures and need to be halted. Some councils have said their schools will not open.\n\nMr Williamson said he was \"always keen to listen and talk to\" union leaders - who met with the government's scientific advisers on Friday - saying: \"My door is always open.\"\n\nHe said the government's approach was based on the \"best scientific advice with children at the very heart of everything we do\" - and the impact of it would be carefully monitored.\n\n\"We have been quite clear all along that we'd only start inviting more children when our five key tests have been met,\" he said. \"That position has not changed nor will it.\"\n\nThe education secretary also said students in years 10 and 12 who were studying for their GCSEs and A-levels \"stand to lose more by staying away from school\".\n\nBut there were no plans to bring forward the start of the next school year to August, he said - although he was looking at \"different initiatives\" which could be rolled out during the summer.\n\nReassuring people what safety measures were being taken, Mr Williamson said school staff could already be tested for the virus and, from 1 June, children and their families would also be able to get tests if they developed symptoms.\n\nPupils will also be kept in groups of no more than 15 and there will be regular cleaning, Mr Williamson added.\n\n\"Together these measures will create an inherently safer system where the risk of transmission is substantially reduced for children, their teachers and also their families,\" he said.\n\nThere were 136,486 tests in the UK on Friday - the highest daily figure so far in the UK.\n\nSome councils - such as Liverpool and Hartlepool - have said their schools will not reopen at the start of next month.\n\nAsked what school governors should do if the council's stance differs from the government's, Mr Williamson said: \"What we would ask them to do is look at the guidance very, very carefully.\n\n\"The best way of protecting children, the best way of giving them the best opportunities in life is actually to have them coming back into school - and this is a very small, tentative step in what I believe is the right direction if we pass those five tests.\"\n\nThe government has already issued guidance for schools, saying they should:\n\nOn Saturday, the children's commissioner for England, Anne Longfield, said the government and unions should \"stop squabbling and agree a plan\" to reopen schools safely \"as quickly as possible\".\n\nShe said many disadvantaged children were losing out because of schools being closed for so long.",

        "authors": [],
        "body": "The European Union's executive Commission is to propose a gradual lifting of borders in an attempt to kick-start a tourist industry hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic.\n\n\"Our message is we will have a tourist season this summer,\" said economic affairs commissioner Paolo Gentiloni, \"even if it's with security measures and limitations.\"\n\nBorders closed across the EU, including the border-free Schengen zone.\n\nBut states are starting to reopen them.\n\nAustria and Germany have become the latest EU countries to agree to remove travel restrictions.\n\nFrom Friday there will be random checks at border crossings and then on 15 June free movement should resume. \"We want to make people's everyday lives easier and take another step towards more normality,\" said Chancellor Sebastian Kurz.\n\nThe scale of the crisis was illustrated by travel giant Tui announcing the loss of up to 8,000 jobs worldwide with plans to cut costs by 30%. The German government has given the company a \u20ac1.8bn (\u00a31.6bn; $1.9bn) bridging loan to stay afloat.\n\nThe European Commission will give details of the proposals on Wednesday, but a draft document called for a \"concerted\" and \"non-discriminatory\" move across the 27-nation bloc.\n\nThe non-binding plans involve gradually removing travel bans and then border checks as the Covid-19 outbreak comes under control across the member states. Countries with a similar health situation would work together to lift their borders and maintain targeted restrictions.\n\nMr Gentiloni, in an interview with six European newspapers, said Europe's tourist industry was facing a 40% loss of activity and the sector had to be relaunched with a focus on three areas:\n\nMr Gentiloni said Italy's tourist season had already been badly hit as the first half of main period from March to May had already been lost.\n\nThe EU is keen to get countries in the EU and the Schengen zone working together, as many are moving at a different pace in lifting their lockdowns.\n\nSome countries have already imposed quarantine measures on travellers. From Friday, arrivals in Spain will have to go into quarantine for 14 days.\n\nThe UK, which has left the EU but still operates under its rules this year, plans to impose a 14-day quarantine on arrivals by air. However, it has agreed bilateral travel arrangements with France and Ireland that mean there would be no quarantine involved. Beaches in France's north-western Brittany region began reopening to visitors on Wednesday but under tight restrictions.\n\nEngland's health secretary, Matt Hancock, said on Tuesday that \"big, lavish international holidays\" this year were unlikely this year, although some hospitality could resume from July.\n\nA \"Baltic bubble\" is set to come into operation on Friday, enabling travel by rail, sea and air across Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, but with a quarantine initially in place for travellers from other states.\n\nAll travellers will have to be free of Covid-19 symptoms and Latvia has urged people to decide whether travel is absolutely necessary.",

    "Welsh minister not told about England tests move": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "Wales' health minister was not told about a change in policy in England to offer all staff and residents in care homes coronavirus tests, he has said.\n\nCurrently, in Wales, only residents and staff with symptoms are tested.\n\nBut ministers here have faced questions after the scheme was expanded in England.\n\nMr Gething said he did not understand \"the rationale\" for the extra care home tests, and how the policy would keep the public safer.\n\nIn England, the UK government has aimed for 100,000 tests a day by the end of April. On Tuesday it committed to expanding tests in care-homes, as well as to over-65s and those who need to leave home to work.\n\nThe Welsh Government, which is testing symptomatic critical workers, care home residents and staff and hospital patients, has not followed suit.\n\n\"There hasn't been a discussion before those policy changes have effectively been determined and made,\" he said, following a question for Newport West Labour AM Jayne Bryant.\n\n\"So, no, we don't really have notice of the way the policy is changing in England.\"\n\n\"This is difficult, isn't it,\" he said.\n\n\"We make policy choices for ourselves here in Wales.\n\n\"When I decided to end standard activity in the national health service I spoke to each of the health ministers in the UK at cabinet level.\n\n\"That hasn't always been the case in every choice. That's partly because it's a fast moving picture.\"\n\nThe issue of care home deaths became a focus after thousands were added to the UK total that had been newly recorded.\n\nThere were 184 deaths in Welsh care homes involving coronavirus up to 17 April. A total of 40% of deaths in Cardiff during that time had been in care homes.\n\nMr Drakeford said it would \"divert capacity\" in Wales.\n\n\"I think it's really important to be clear that just testing every care home resident doesn't automatically make them safer,\" the health minister told AMs.\n\n\"Because the test tells you whether you have coronavirus at the point in time the test was undertaken, not whether you can get it the next day.\"\n\nHe said he would be happy to change his position if the evidence changed.\n\n\"There hasn't been a discussion before those policy changes have effectively been determined and made,\" he said.\n\n\"So, no, we don't really have notice of the way the policy is changing in England.\"\n\nWales had aimed for tests 5,000 a day but abandoned the target. It now has capacity for 2,100 a day.\n\nWales' chief medical officer said there is now more \"divergence\" in the UK on testing at an \"operational delivery level\".\n\nFrank Atherton said Wales is \"still trying to reach across to England to understand the exact rationale for the changes that they've made in various categories, given that they've made a number of changes all at the same time\".\n\nThe science is the \"same across the four nations\", he said.\n\nIndependent scientific advisory group SAGE, which advises the UK government, \"has not looked at the question of whether the testing of asymptomatic individuals gives us benefit in terms of viral transmission\", he said.\n\nThe chief medical officer said he did not have a \"clear understanding\" from England \"of how often they will be testing residents who are asymptomatic in care homes\".\n\n\"Capacity obviously has an impact,\" he said. \"There are 25,000 residents living in care homes currently in Wales.\n\n\"If we were to institute a policy around testing all asymptomatic people living in those environments, we would have to be very clear - are we going to test them once, or how often are we going to retest them.\"\n\nDr Atherton said \"saving any life is important but we have to remember the opportunity costs of that\".\n\n\"If the cost of providing marginal benefit in terms of testing one group of society means, for example, testing will not be available to support patients or to support health care workers, health care staff working in A&E departments or ITUs, then that's a very different argument.\"",

    "What Covid-19 decisions are made in Wales?": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "How are the decisions carved up when it comes to coronavirus?\n\nWith many policy responsibilities devolved to Wales - across areas including health, social care and education - there are decisions which are in the in-trays of ministers in Cardiff Bay.\n\nBut other important responsibilities - like who is paying a big chunk of people's salaries while businesses are forced to close - lies in Westminster.\n\nSo who does what?\n\nThe NHS and public health is devolved in Wales, so the decisions on how health boards are responding to the enormous challenges in our hospitals and communities ultimately rest with the health minister here.\n\nThe decision on when and how to ease lockdown measures - which has affected the lives of everyone - will be taken in Wales too.\n\nWelsh ministers are in regular meetings with their counterparts in the other UK nations, at Cobra meetings for example, as well as receiving scientific advice from the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage).\n\nBut Wales has its own chief medical officer too, a key adviser, who will also be taking advice from colleagues in other countries.\n\nWales has already decided to go its own way in not setting a target for testing or offering tests to all people over the age of 65. Although, the Welsh Government says after listening to \"latest evidence\" all residents and staff in care homes will now be tested - where someone has coronavirus. But it insists that testing key workers who have symptoms is the best use of resources at this stage.\n\nThe Welsh Government is required to review lockdown measures, by law, every 21 days - so the next review is due by the end of the week.\n\nFirst Minister Mark Drakeford has said any changes are \"likely to be gradual and will be driven by evidence\".\n\nBut he has consistently favoured a \"four-nation approach,\" saying taking different geographic responses would be \"fraught with difficulties\".\n\n\"One simple message\" applying across the United Kingdom was easier to communicate and for people to understand. , he said.\n\nFor example, it would raise the potential problem of too many people travelling to parts of the country if restrictions were lifted in particular areas - with, say, beaches or tourist attractions being opened - and risking the transmission of the virus.\n\nBut Mr Drakeford said he would only do things differently in this aspect, if medical advice was to do so and it was right for Wales.\n\nHe has set out seven key questions as to whether easing a restriction would have a negative effect on containing the virus.\n\nThese include whether it risks further infection, if it can be monitored and enforced, and if it was possible to reverse quickly if it created unintended consequences.\n\nWith many places of work closed and workers \"furloughed\", the virus has had a big impact - and different help falls under the umbrellas of either the Welsh Government or UK government.\n\nSo if you're being paid 80% of your usual salary - up to \u00a32,500 a month - this comes from the UK government. It also looks after sick pay.\n\nIt also helps companies of different sizes with business interruption loans - and also income support for the self-employed. Westminster - through HM Customs and Revenue - is also managing tax deferrals.\n\nBut the Welsh Government is responsible for economic development - and so it is offering grants for small and medium-sized business through its economic resilience fund.\n\nIts finance arm, the Development Bank for Wales, has already provided \u00a3100m in business loans and is also offering capital repayment holidays.\n\nMeanwhile, councils - mostly funded by Welsh Government - are offering a year's relief on business rates for shops, leisure and hospitality businesses, and also offering small grants. Local councils are calculated to have distributed \u00a3508m to 41,000 businesses by the end of April.\n\nSchools across the UK closed on 20 March to all but pupils who are vulnerable or those of critical workers. Education is devolved, however, so the decision was made by the Welsh Government - as will be the decision to re-open them.\n\nBut how education is provided in those schools which are already open are the responsibility of local councils, subject to guidance.\n\nEducation Minister Kirsty Williams has suggested a phased return is likely, when the time is right, while it appears it would take three weeks before the first children go back from when a decision is taken.\n\nThis is another devolved area and the responsibility lies with local councils in Wales.\n\nIn a normal year, caring for the elderly takes up about a third of council social services budgets.\n\nCouncils have been under particular pressure because of the importance of social care to the work they do and staff having to work in the most challenging of circumstances.\n\nThe Welsh Government recently received \u00a395m extra - as part of a wider UK government announcement for councils. Council leaders say they have been facing \"soaring demand\" at a time their general coffers have been depleted by a \u00a333m a month loss of income.\n\nWelsh Government meanwhile has announced all social care workers will get a cash bonus of \u00a3500 each to recognise the work they are doing.\n\nThe testing policy has emerged as the obvious difference. Others are smaller - like the size of the fixed penalty notice for breaking lockdown restrictions. This is \u00a360 but in England it can rise to \u00a3960 for repeat offenders, but only to a \u00a3120 maximum in Wales.\n\nIn general though, this is a pandemic which knows no borders - and cooperation between all governments and best practice are the watch words.",

        "body": "As a precaution, pregnant women have been told to be particularly strict about avoiding social contact, so they reduce their risk of catching coronavirus. But what do we know about its impact on pregnancy?\n\nAlthough there is still much that doctors don't know about how pregnancy can be affected by the virus, pregnant women do not appear to become more unwell than other healthy adults who contract it.\n\n\"If there were huge risks, we would have seen them by now,\" says Christoph Lees, professor of obstetrics at Imperial College London.\n\nLike the general population, if they are infected, the vast majority of pregnant women will have mild or moderate symptoms and recover. These include cough, fever, shortness of breath, headache and loss of sense of smell.\n\nCoronavirus can be a problem in pregnancy if women become seriously ill with Covid-19 - but that is very rare.\n\nPregnant women with serious heart problems are in a very high-risk group and are recommended to stay at home at all times and avoid any face-to-face contact. They should contact doctors about their care.\n\nSome viruses are worse in pregnant women, but there is no evidence this is the case for this coronavirus.\n\nResearchers are now studying the experiences of pregnant women to find out more through the Pan-Covid Pregnancy and Neonatal Registry and the UK Obstetric Surveillance System.\n\nSome reports are emerging of babies being born early to women who were very ill with the coronavirus - but it's hard to know the reason for delivery.\n\n\"Where a reason is given, it may be due to signs of distress in the baby or to allow better treatment for low oxygen levels in the woman,\" says Dr Ed Mullins, from Queen Charlotte's and Chelsea Hospital, London.\n\nDuring pregnancy, a growing baby places some pressure on the lungs, heart and circulation of its mum. Being seriously ill with Covid-19 could make this situation worse and cause breathing difficulties.\n\nAny woman in this position would be watched extremely closely in hospital.\n\n\"Acute illnesses which cause fever can be associated with premature labour and birth,\" says Prof Marian Knight, professor of maternal and child population health from the University of Oxford.\n\nHowever, she said most premature births have been because of early Caesareans in women with Covid-related breathing problems, rather than because of premature labour starting.\n\nThere is no evidence of an increased risk of miscarriage if women become infected.\n\nThis is possible. There have been reports of a small number of cases, but the newborns were discharged from hospital and are well.\n\nA study from China found three out of 33 babies born to mums with Covid-19 were infected.\n\nIt is difficult to work out if the babies were infected in the uterus, during labour or soon after birth, when a newborn is likely to have had close contact with the mum.\n\nThere is no evidence of the virus causing problems with a baby's development, says the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG).\n\nIf you have cold or flu-like symptoms, you should stay at home for seven days.\n\nIf you've got any routine appointments in that time, you should let your midwife, antenatal clinic or maternity unit know about your symptoms.\n\nMost women will have mild symptoms which should go away in a few days.\n\nBut if you start feeling worse, you should contact your GP, the NHS via 111 (or NHS 24 in Scotland), your maternity unit or 999 in an emergency.\n\nThe RCOG has lots more advice on its website for pregnant women and their families.\n\nIf you are pregnant and can work from home, you should.\n\nIf you are more than 28 weeks' pregnant, or have an underlying health condition, this is particularly important, as you should be avoiding unnecessary social contact.\n\nWomen less than 28 weeks' pregnant can continue to work outside the home provided they take the necessary precautions, and stay 2m (6ft) away from other people.\n\nAdvice for healthcare workers who are pregnant is to avoid caring for patients with suspected or confirmed coronavirus infection.",

    "What do we not know about coronavirus in Scotland?": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "The daily government briefings have delivered an avalanche of statistics about the coronavirus outbreak in Scotland.\n\nBut there are a number of questions about the pandemic which remain unanswered.\n\nIt is a very difficult question to answer given the vast majority of people with Covid-19 seem to have mild or no symptoms.\n\nBut back at the start of the pandemic such estimates were more forthcoming.\n\nIn March, the former chief medical officer Dr Catherine Calderwood said each death represented up to 1,000 potential cases and each intensive care patient could represent another 500 cases.\n\nThe Scottish government says these figures are no longer valid, adding that it is now \"difficult to estimate with certainty how many people have had the virus and recovered beyond the daily numbers we publish\".\n\nSo how do they know what is going on? The original Scottish government plan to assess the spread of the new virus was to piggyback on the well-established GP \"sentinel\" surveillance system for the winter flu, which is run through 200 GP practices and covers a population of 1.2 million.\n\nThis approach was then dropped in favour of Health Protection Scotland (HPS) using a sample of the people presenting with moderate symptoms at Covid-19 community hubs and assessment centres.\n\nWhen asked what was happening with this monitoring, the Scottish government said HPS was in \"the process of ramping up surveillance testing\", with a spokesman adding that \"additional surveillance testing is being undertaken at a community level to monitor and manage the spread and prevalence of coronavirus\".\n\nThe most tangible pointer for infections comes in the form of data from NHS24, which has received nearly 60,000 calls during the lockdown from people worried they had coronavirus, with just over 40,000 of these consultations resulting in a caller being referred to a doctor for further assessment.\n\nIn terms of \"live\" cases of infections - that is those who currently have the virus and have not yet recovered - the Scottish government estimate stands at about 26,000, a number which it says is \"much too high to consider the virus under control\".\n\nOne of the most alarming trends of the pandemic has been the spike in so-called \"excess\" deaths, as laid out in the graph below.\n\nThe data shows that there have been 3,752 more deaths in the past four weeks than would be expected, based on a five-year average.\n\nTo put these \"extra\" deaths is some context, this is about the same number of people killed on Scotland's roads in the past 15 years.\n\nWhile the majority of these were linked to coronavirus - marked in red on the chart - concerns have been raised about \"excess\" deaths due to other causes.\n\nThis has included situations where people have put off going to hospital, such as heart disease or stroke patients, but also indirect coronavirus deaths such as suicide or drugs overdose.\n\nA full understanding of the excess deaths will take some time to become clear.\n\nIt is likely to be the case that, given the age and health profile of those dying, the virus has brought forward some deaths which would have been spread over the course of a year.\n\nWe know that people living in more deprived areas of England and Wales are more likely to die with coronavirus than those in more affluent places.\n\nMortality rates are normally higher in poorer areas but Office for National Statistics analysis shows there were 55 deaths for every 100,000 people in the most deprived parts of England, compared with 25 in the wealthiest areas.\n\nThe same data used to work this out is also captured north of the border - but a similar analysis has not been carried out yet. The National Records of Scotland (NRS) said it is keeping this under review.\n\nOne indicator that Scotland will be in line with the trends elsewhere in the UK is that the country's most deprived council area, Inverclyde, has the highest death rate.\n\nIn addition, figures shown to councillors in Fife suggested that, of the 73 people who had died there with coronavirus by 16 April, 23% were from parts of Fife with the highest levels of deprivation and 15% were from the least deprived areas.\n\nThe stark message from England and Wales is that black men and women are nearly twice as likely to die with coronavirus as white people.\n\nThe Office for National Statistics analysis shows the inequality persists after taking into account age, where people live and some measures of deprivation and prior health.\n\nAnd previous BBC News analysis found that 84 of the 135 healthcare workers whose deaths have been publicly announced were from ethnic minority backgrounds.\n\nHowever, equivalent data for the impact on coronavirus on people with an ethnic minority background is not currently available in Scotland.\n\nThis is largely because collection of ethnicity data is undertaken on a voluntary basis and \"unlike the rest of the death registration process, are not statutory\".\n\nA NRS spokeswoman said the public body does not believe that the ethnicity data that has been submitted so far is \"at an acceptable level of quality to produce robust statistics for these purposes\".\n\nThis may be because the numbers affected are too low.",

    "What is the UK's test, track and trace strategy?": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "The UK's \"test, track and trace\" strategy is being rolled out with the trial launch of a new app designed to alert people to possible exposure to coronavirus.\n\nThe NHS app will be made available on the Isle of Wight on Tuesday, Health Secretary Matt Hancock has announced, and all residents will be asked to download it.\n\nMr Hancock says the programme will allow the government to take a \"more targeted\" approach to the lockdown, while containing the virus.\n\nHere's a guide to the three parts of the strategy.\n\nThe first element - testing - has been scaled up over the last month, following Mr Hancock's pledge to reach 100,000 tests per day by the end of April.\n\nWhile that target was met last week - albeit by including testing kits being sent out by post - daily tests dropped back to 85,000 on Sunday.\n\nThe following people and groups are currently eligible for NHS coronavirus tests\n\nFor people not in hospital, tests can be booked online either by self-referral or by an employer.\n\nTests are done with a swab applied to the back of the throat.\n\nDrive-through regional testing sites have been set up, and mobile testing units will operate from these regional sites in the near future.\n\nSatellite testing centres will also be established at existing NHS sites where there is an urgent need.\n\nHome testing kits are also available, although they are in limited supply at the moment.\n\nA network of couriers will take the test swabs to laboratories for analysis. Three \"mega-labs\" have been set up in Glasgow, Milton Keynes and Cheshire, to boost capacity.\n\nThe results are sent back within 48 hours, or 72 hours for home tests.\n\nTo understand how coronavirus spreads through the population, 20,000 households will be recruited and routinely tested over 12 months.\n\nThe survey, which will eventually be expanded to include 300,000 participants, will also use \"high accuracy\" antibody tests to understand how much immunity is acquired by those recovering from the disease.\n\nPeople taking part will be swab-tested and asked a short set of questions during a home visit by a health worker. The swab tests will show whether or not participants currently have the virus.\n\nTests will be repeated every week for the first five weeks, and then every month for 12 months.\n\nThe study will be run by the Department for Health and the Office for National Statistics, with advice from University of Oxford scientists and support from data science company IQVIA UK and the National Biosample Centre in Milton Keynes.\n\nThe NHS' digital research division NHSX is developing a smartphone app which will alert people that they have been exposed to someone with coronavirus.\n\nThe app will use Bluetooth signals to log when smartphone owners are close to each other.\n\nIf an app user develops coronavirus symptoms, an alert can then be sent to other app users with whom they have been in close proximity.\n\n\"In the initial instance you would record (your own) symptoms, and people who have come into contact with you over the past few days would receive a notification\", epidemiologist Professor Christophe Fraser told the BBC on Sunday,\n\nProfessor Fraser, a pathogen dynamics specialist who is assisting with the app's development, said the system would eventually be linked to testing, so people will be notified if they come into contact with a confirmed Covid-19 case.\n\nThe app could be particularly useful in stopping transmission by warning people who have been exposed to coronavirus cases, but not yet displaying symptoms, of the need to self-isolate, he added. The app could also be configured to send alerts to contacts of contacts.\n\nThe critical factor in determining the app's success will be getting enough people to install it - however, use of other \"interventions\" such as manual contact tracing means it could succeed with a lower level of uptake, Professor Fraser said.\n\n\"If you, your friends, relatives and colleagues install the app, you have a group of people who are protected. For this intervention alone to control an epidemic, you would need about 60% of the population to download and adhere to it. On the other hand, we're not proposing that this system should work alone ... if this intervention is sitting alongside other methods, you would need a lower uptake. \"\n\nThe app is to be trialled on the Isle of Wight this week.\n\nWhile NHS-X says all shared data is anonymised, others have raised privacy concerns over the way the app \"centralises\" data collection.\n\nThe Information Commissioner's Office has said that \"as a general rule, a decentralised approach\" would better follow its principle that organisations should minimise the amount of personal data they collect.\n\nAs part of this multi-intervention strategy, the government has said it will recruit 18,000 people for manual contact tracing by the middle of May.\n\nThese contract tracers will interview people who test positive, to find out where they have been and who they have been in contact with.\n\nA detailed picture will be built up of who that person has spent time in close proximity to, such as family members, colleagues or people they have travelled with.\n\nA \"close contact\" is considered to be someone with whom they have spent a certain period of time, within a two-metre distance. Such a contact may be defined as \"high risk\" and asked to self-isolate.\n\nPeople potentially exposed to the coronavirus are given advice on what to do if they become unwell or develop symptoms. Some are contacted daily until they can be given the all clear, usually after 14 days.\n\nIf a monitored person develops symptoms, they can be tested and given specialist treatment where needed.",

    "What will emerge when post-WW2 order ends?": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "It was the war that, more than anything else, shaped our world.\n\nVictory in Europe - or VE day - was clearly not the final chapter of the conflict. Japan remained to be fully defeated. But it was, nonetheless, a major milestone and marked an essential step towards ushering in a new kind of global order.\n\nThe US emerged from the conflict as a military superpower, having stolen a march on Moscow in terms of the development of nuclear weapons - henceforth the prime currency of global strategic power.\n\nBut the Russians soon caught up. Their decision to retain control over much of Eastern Europe dashed some of the more ambitious hopes for a less confrontational new order.\n\nThis prompted the creation of Nato and a seemingly permanent military and diplomatic linkage between the US and Western Europe. As journalist and historian Anne Applebaum noted in a Rusi webinar this week, it \"created the idea of 'the West'; a values-based alliance system not just about borders but about ideas too\".\n\nBut it wasn't just Nato. As Professor Michael Clarke underlines, there was a whole network of institutions.\n\n\"Very little was left of the pre-war structure of international institutions,\" he says, \"and there was a conscious understanding - even more than in 1919 - that it was necessary to build a 'global order' from the wreckage.\"\n\nThe UN \"was the keystone achievement; then the Bretton Woods economic system; the IBRD (World Bank), and the IMF\". The UK was influential in much of this but US power, he says, was decisive.\n\n\"Almost every international institution depended on US interest in, and support for, their establishment. From that clutch of Western-dominated organisations,\" he argues, \"a very distinctive 'rules-based international order' evolved during the growth decades of the 50s and 60s. That rules-based order is now under real pressure because its political underpinnings are significantly changing.\"\n\nThe reason why is part and parcel of our everyday news agenda.\n\nIt is a rising China; the shift of economic power to Asia and the Far East; it's the rising populist trends even in many Western democracies.\n\nLook at the clear tensions within Nato for example, prompted by President Donald Trump's questioning of its value to Washington, and the rise of a more authoritarian style of government in Alliance countries like Turkey and Hungary.\n\nAnne Applebaum notes that in the US an isolationist strand in foreign policy has come to dominate the Republican Party. There are cracks, she argues, in the Western value system and generational change means that few if any politicians have real roots in the immediate post-war era.\n\nIgnorance of contemporary history is another problem.\n\nChina did not just arrive on the scene in recent times. It was after all one of the original permanent members of the UN Security Council.\n\n\"The US always felt a special concern for China before and then during the war,\" Michael Clarke told me. It is not much remembered now, but he says \"the US always viewed pre-communist China as a major power for the new world and one that would naturally counter-balance the old imperial empires of Britain and France.\n\n\"That,\" he says, \"was why the US was so traumatised when it 'lost' China to the Communists in 1949. It did not get over that until 1972, and may now be falling back into another syndrome of 'disillusionment' over China's role in the world.\"\n\nProfessor Lawrence Freedman of King's College agrees, but stresses that during the Cold War it was \"a different China issue.\" Unlike today, 20th century China was not seen as an economic and technological threat.\n\nIndeed, as Michael Clarke told me, Washington's relative decline is more a symptom than a cause of the end of the post-war order. However, he believes that \"Washington is now acting to accelerate it quite precipitously\".\n\n\"The new, emerging 'world order',\" he says, \"is based on the simple fact that more than half the world's population now live within a circle that can be drawn around India, China and South East Asia.\"\n\n\"That drives the economic geography of the world, and that, in turn, eventually translates itself into national political power and thence into international political structures.\"\n\nSo what, if anything, is going to change in the wake of the Covid-19 crisis?\n\nMichael Clarke argues that the post-pandemic world will not cease to be the 'Asian Century', but its effects will likely create some real disjunctures for the coming decade.\n\nIn his view, \"China will be a long-term loser from this crisis, both in political reactions to its handling of the issue and in national reassessments of resilience and supply chains that rely so heavily on China\".\n\nIt is probably premature to make any fundamental assessment of what the post-Covid-19 international system will look like.\n\nSafe to say the sense of public service and solidarity that emerged from WW2 carried over into the post-war settlement. It would be nice if something similar took hold now, but all the signs are that sadly, this is unlikely to be the case.",

    "What's going wrong in Sweden's care homes?": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "More than half of elderly Covid-19 victims in Sweden have died in care homes. Some healthcare workers believe an institutional reluctance to admit patients to hospital is costing lives.\n\nLili Perspolisi's father, Reza Sedghi, was not seen by a doctor on the day he died from coronavirus, at his care home in northern Stockholm.\n\nA nurse told her he'd had a morphine shot in the hours before he passed away, but he was not given oxygen, nor did staff call an ambulance. \"No-one was there and he died alone,\" says Ms Perspolisi. \"It's so unfair.\"\n\nMost of the 3,698 people who have died from coronavirus in Sweden so far were over 70, despite the fact that the country said shielding risk groups was its top priority.\n\nSweden, with 10m inhabitants, has kept more of society open than is the case in most of Europe.\n\n\"We did not manage to protect the most vulnerable people, the most elderly, despite our best intentions,\" Prime Minister Stefan L\u00f6fven admitted last week.\n\nSweden did ban visits to care homes on 31 March. But as in many European countries, relatives, staff and union officials have shared concerns that protective clothing arrived too late, and that some staff may have gone to work at the start of the crisis despite showing symptoms of Covid-19.\n\nNow, increasing numbers of workers are also coming forward to criticise regional healthcare authorities for protocols which they say discourage care home workers from sending residents into hospital, and prevent care home and nursing staff from administering oxygen without a doctor's approval, either as part of acute or palliative (end-of-life) services.\n\n\"They told us that we shouldn't send anyone to the hospital, even if they may be 65 and have many years to live. We were told not to send them in,\" says Latifa L\u00f6fvenberg, a nurse who worked in several care homes around G\u00e4vle, north of Stockholm, at the beginning of the pandemic.\n\n\"Some can have a lot of years left to live with loved ones, but they don't have the chance... because they never make it to the hospital,\" she says. \"They suffocate to death. And it's a lot of panic and it's very hard to just stand by and watch.\"\n\nMs L\u00f6fvenberg is now working on a Covid-19 ward in a major hospital in the Swedish capital, where she says the demographic of patients she's treating is further evidence that the elderly are being kept away. \"We don't have many older people. It's a lot of younger people born in the 90s, 80s, 70s.\"\n\nA paramedic working in Stockholm, who wanted to remain anonymous, told the BBC she had not had a single call-out to an elderly care home connected to Covid-19, despite putting in overtime during the crisis.\n\nMikael Fj\u00e4llid, a Swedish private consultant in anaesthetics and intensive care, says he believes \"a lot of lives\" could have been saved if more patients had been able to access hospital treatment, or if care home workers were given increased responsibilities to administer oxygen themselves, instead of waiting for specialist Covid-19 response teams or paramedics.\n\n\"If you need care and you can benefit [from] care, for example, or oxygen for a short time, you should have it. Like any other age group in the population,\" he says.\n\n\"If you have more than 20% that survive without nothing, you could assume that also perhaps the same amount or the same proportion would have survived with supplemental oxygen.\"\n\nDecisions about healthcare staffing and resources are taken at a regional level in Sweden, although national guidelines suggest that elderly patients, whether in state or privately run care homes, should not automatically be taken to hospital for treatment.\n\nDr Thomas Linden, Chief Medical Officer at the National Board of Health and Welfare, says workers should \"professionally weigh the potential benefits\" against risk factors such as catching the virus in hospital and the \"costs\" of transporting patients, including the likelihood of disorientation and discomfort.\n\nHealthcare workers are asked not to discriminate on age alone, he says, although biological age may be relevant in combination with other factors.\n\nWhen it comes to providing palliative care, it is not mandatory to give patients oxygen, and Dr Linden admits \"the opinions on the value of oxygen is divided between specialities and regions\".\n\nG\u00e4vleborg, the region where Latifa L\u00f6fvenberg worked at the start of the pandemic, says individual patients' needs are always put first and that nurses can call doctors to make assessments about the need for hospital care.\n\nIt is against the idea of care-home workers administering oxygen during palliative care, because it requires specialist training.\n\nChristoffer Bernsk\u00f6ld, a spokesperson for geriatric care for Region Stockholm, insists there are enough resources to ensure patients in the capital get acute or palliative care, with a focus on \"specialist homecare units\" providing help in the first instance.\n\nHe points to a new, unused, military field hospital in southern Stockholm as proof that the elderly are not being held back from treatment because of a lack of beds.\n\nBut he says it can be an \"ethical dilemma\" whether to administer oxygen or transfer patients to hospital.\n\nCritics like Mikael Fj\u00e4llid see that field hospital as a sign that officials in the capital have been cautious about hospitalising the elderly because they fear overstretching resources, which would be needed to cope with a future spike in cases.\n\nSweden is not alone in asking healthcare workers to consider the fragility of patients when deciding whether or not to send them to hospital.\n\nBut representatives of care homes in other parts of Europe have told the BBC they do not share Swedish critics' concerns about a lack of access to treatment.\n\nIn the UK, the National Care Association says it believes care has been available for Covid-19 patients \"no matter how old or sick\" they are.\n\nThe Association of German Aid for the Elderly and Disabled says every patient with coronavirus symptoms is seen by a doctor and there hasn't been a single patient who has not received the care they needed. In some cases, entire care homes have been moved into hospitals. Many homes also keep emergency oxygen on site.\n\nThe Danish Nurses Association says that all patients in need of oxygen are currently sent to hospital. This could be reviewed if there is a shortage of ventilators, although age would not affect future guidelines.\n\nAt a recent news conference, Sweden's Prime Minister Stefan L\u00f6fven told the BBC that regional authorities had been trusted to make sure healthcare provision \"works the best way\" and given extra resources from the state to cover costs connected to Covid-19.\n\nLast week the government also announced a further 2.2bn kronor (\u00a3185m) for additional training within care homes, with a view to creating 10,000 permanent positions for assistant nurses and care workers.\n\nMr L\u00f6fven said it wasn't currently the right time to reflect on potential failures, but a national commission would look at how things had been handled at a local, regional and national level as soon as the \"acute\" phase of the crisis was over.\n\nThat is a bittersweet message for relatives of Covid-19 victims like Lili Perspolisi, who buried her father last week.\n\n\"Whatever they did didn't work, because... many, many people in his home are dead,\" she says.",

With stay-at-home orders in place, businesses closed, travel restricted and events scrapped, many of us are caught in limbo: the milestones we've been working toward - like university graduations or starting a new job - are suddenly postponed or cancelled altogether.\n\nThankfully, in most cases, these events haven't fully vanished from our lives - instead, they've shifted from our immediate sight to the distant horizon. So, in a state of lockdown, maintaining a healthy mental and physical foundation to get to the finish line - whenever that'll be - requires a special kind of grit and determination.\n\nBut how, exactly, are you supposed to stay game-ready when you're stuck in isolation, separated from many of the people and resources you're accustomed to? After all, you don't know when you're going to be called to rise to the challenge. And, in the interim, how do you cope with your lack of closure, and use the crisis as an opportunity to boost resilience and perform at your peak when the time comes?\n\nSo much for closure\n\nWhether you're looking ahead to a difficult school exam, a competition or a public speaking appointment, fretting about your performance is a natural symptom of 'anticipatory emotions'.\n\nThese are feelings triggered by the anticipation of a future event that cause you to either take immediate pleasure in inevitable success, or, conversely, feel dread about impending failure, according to Chris Dawson, senior lecturer in business economics at the University of Bath.

    "When did care homes go into lockdown?": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "Many thousands of care home residents have died since the start of the coronavirus outbreak.\n\nAfter criticism from the Labour leader last week, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: \"We brought the lockdown in care homes ahead of the general lockdown.\"\n\nThe wider lockdown was announced on 23 March so when were measures to protect people in care homes introduced?\n\nThere are three main routes for the transmission of the virus into care homes - visitors coming to see residents, members of staff and residents being admitted (for instance from hospital).\n\nMost care homes in England are privately run, but are regulated by national bodies and would typically act on advice from central as well as local government.\n\nGeneral guidance produced on 25 February included advice for carers on what to do if they came into contact with someone with Covid-19 - but there was nothing advising against visits to care homes.\n\nIn one section it said: \"It remains very unlikely that people receiving care in a care home or the community will become infected.\"\n\nAnother section said: \"Currently there is no evidence of transmission of Covid-19 in the United Kingdom. There is no need to do anything differently in any care setting at present.\"\n\nHowever, the government's own Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE) had advised on 10 February that \"it is a realistic probability that there is already sustained transmission in the UK, or that it will become established in the coming weeks.\"\n\nOn 3 March, the government released its coronavirus action plan - the document did not mention restricting visits to care homes.\n\nAt a briefing the same day, the Chief Medical Officer for England Prof Chris Whitty said on care homes: \"One of the things we're keen to avoid is doing things too early, because if you do them early you get no benefit from the epidemic, but what you do get is a social cost.\"\n\nBy 5 March, England had had 273 cases of people with the virus.\n\nThat day Prof Whitty told a committee of MPs that as there were cases that could not be traced back to people who had come from abroad, it was \"highly likely therefore that there is some level of community transmission in this virus in the UK now\".\n\nItaly suspended visits to care homes at this point, five weeks after recording its first case. The next day Ireland restricted visits - only allowing relatives to see residents just before they died - just a week after the first confirmed case in the country.\n\nOn 10 March, Prof Martin Green, head of Care England which represents independent care providers, directed criticism in an Independent article at the government for its response.\n\nAt this point in England nearly 800 people had caught the virus, but the article noted that the generic guidance published by Public Health England appeared out of date, as it said there was no evidence of transmission within the UK. Prof Green said: \"There is no evidence of a plan. I'm not even certain they have these plans and aren't just making them up as they go along.\"\n\nNevertheless, some homes were deciding to close their doors to visitors, with care groups Barchester and HC-One stopping non-essential visits on 10 March and 12 March.\n\nScottish Care - a representative body for social care in Scotland - advised care homes to close to visits on 11 March.\n\nOn 13 March, the government's guidance from 25 February was updated to say that \"care home providers are advised to review their visiting policy, by asking no-one to visit who has suspected Covid-19 or is generally unwell, and by emphasising good hand hygiene for visitors\".\n\nOn the same day Bupa and Four Seasons care homes stopped non-essential visits.\n\nIt wasn't until 16 March that it was announced that social distancing should be carried out by everyone, in particular those aged over 70 and vulnerable people.\n\nThat day, the prime minister was asked about care homes and said: \"We don't want to see people unnecessarily visiting care homes.\" By this point there had been 3,200 cases in England (although the figure given by the authorities at that point was less than half of that; positive cases are now dated to the day the sample was given).\n\nIn the period between 25 February and 16 March, 14 deaths of care home residents were reported along with 30 outbreaks in England's 15,000 care homes.\n\nOn 21 March, guidance was introduced to encourage medically vulnerable people to remain indoors as much as possible until the end of June - a process known as shielding.\n\nOn 24 March, when the lockdown began, people were not supposed to leave their homes at all except for \"essential\" reasons, which didn't include visits to care homes.\n\nFinally, on 2 April another document from the Department of Health and Social Care said that \"family and friends should be advised not to visit care homes, except next of kin in exceptional situations such as end of life\".\n\nSpeaking on 15 May, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said that on the basis of the 13 March guidance \"many of the care home providers, for instance Care UK, at that point stopped visitors\".\n\nOn 19 March, NHS guidance said that \"unless required to be in hospital, patients must not remain in an NHS bed\".\n\nThis policy was implemented to free up beds in advance of an expected surge in coronavirus patients.\n\nOn 2 April, the rules on discharging to care homes were clarified, saying \"negative [coronavirus] tests are not required prior to transfers/admissions into the care home\".\n\nEven elderly hospital patients who had tested positive could be admitted to care homes, according to the document, if measures - such as use of personal protective equipment (PPE) and isolation - were used.\n\nFrom 15 April, the government said that all patients discharged from hospitals would be tested for coronavirus. By this time, more than 5,700 residents in England and Wales had died either in their care home or in hospital.\n\nThere are no statistics to show how many cases of coronavirus were transmitted from hospitals to care homes.\n\nChris Hopson, the head of hospital representative body NHS Providers, said it was \"categorically not true\" that hospitals were systematically discharging patients to care homes with coronavirus, saying there had been a 40% drop in the number of discharges compared with January.\n\nHe added that because \"sufficient testing\" didn't come in until mid-April: \"It is possible that a very small number of asymptomatic Covid-19 patients [people who had coronavirus but weren't showing symptoms], who trusts were unable to test prior to that date, were discharged to social care.\"\n\nThe Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove was asked by Andrew Marr on 17 May about the government's guidance on moving patients from hospitals to care homes. He said: \"The decision about whether a patient is in a hospital or in another setting, a care home or home, is a clinical decision.\"\n\nMr Gove acknowledged that government advice had altered over time, \"as a result of our scientific knowledge of the virus changing\".\n\nA Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: \"We have followed a science-led action plan designed at all times to save lives. This week we announced a new \u00a3600m infection control fund for care homes... on top of the \u00a33.2 billion we made available in March and April.\"",

    "Why \"shark attacks\" won't go down as Covid deaths": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "Online videos and social media posts with fake and misleading information about the coronavirus pandemic are often watched by hundreds of thousands of people around the world.\n\nWe've been fact-checking some of those most widely shared this week.\n\nFirst up, a video featuring the right-wing conspiracy theorist Alex Jones calling America's coronavirus data \"fake\". It's being used, he suggests, to keep the country in lockdown and to scupper President Trump's bid for re-election.\n\nHe argues that the Covid-19 death figures are wrong, but in doing so he misinterprets how the information is recorded.\n\nMr Jones says anyone who tests positive for Covid-19 at the time of their death - be it due to \"cancer\", \"sky-diving accidents\" or \"shark attacks\" - is being recorded as a death due to coronavirus.\n\nCovid-19 is only listed on the death certificate in the United States if the disease played a role in that person dying, so deaths by misadventure such as shark attacks and sky-diving falls would certainly not be included.\n\nExperts say that, if anything, Covid-19 deaths have been under-reported, because of a lack of testing in the community, and deaths at home which aren't counted.\n\nCalculating death rates is certainly not an exact science and is open to interpretation. We've written extensively about how these figures are worked out in the UK:\n\nMr Jones also claims that anyone who has ever had any coronavirus infection, or the common cold, will produce a positive test.\n\nThe tests currently being widely used across the US and elsewhere are to find out whether you are infected with the novel coronavirus responsible for the pandemic.\n\n\"The diagnostic tests for Covid-19 are specific for the SARS-CoV-2 virus (which causes it),\" says Dr Jeremy Rossman, Honorary Senior Lecturer in Virology at the University of Kent. \"They do not detect other coronaviruses nor do they detect the common cold virus (rhinovirus) or the flu virus.\"\n\nThese tests do not identify previous infections from which you have recovered - although scientists are working hard to roll out a reliable test for this too.\n\nThe video has been shared many thousands of times but was not posted on Alex Jones' main account or his Infowars Facebook page, because both of them have been banned by Facebook.\n\nA viral video claiming an elderly woman with coronavirus was put in a body bag while still alive has been exposed as misleading.\n\nThe video originated in Brazil and went viral on WhatsApp and Facebook. Various versions have been shared hundreds of thousands of times, including in large English-language conspiracy groups.\n\nThe video shows an elderly patient on top of plastic sheeting struggling to breathe. The caption claims the woman's family was told she was dead.\n\nThe truth is less dramatic. The director of the Abelardo Santos Hospital in northern Brazil told BBC News Brasil that the protective sheeting she is lying on is indeed a body bag, but it was used to transfer her to another bed.\n\n\"It's a common practice in hospitals,\" he said, \"especially during a pandemic or an epidemic, which force us to adapt\".\n\nThe police are looking into who leaked the video and who is responsible for the spread of fake news related to it.\n\nSince the footage was recorded, the woman has sadly died.\n\nSome of the posts in Portuguese on Facebook feature a warning message that they are misleading. However, we've spotted some in English which have not been flagged by Facebook.\n\nA fake quote attributed to a prominent French scientist went viral this week.\n\nThe Facebook post claims Professor Didier Raoult (a specialist in infectious diseases) said Covid-19 was created by the United States and China to kill millions of Africans.\n\nWe spoke to the hospital in Marseille where Prof Raoult works and they confirmed it's not genuine.\n\nProf Raoult has become well-known for promoting an anti-Malarial drug to treat coronavirus.\n\nThe original post, which can be traced back to an account in the Democratic Republic of Congo, has been shared more than 150,000 times in a number of African countries, including Madagascar and Cameroon.\n\nAnd there's an intriguing twist to this story. Another fake story we reported on linked to the same Instagram account.\n\nThat one contained a fake message attributed to Jeff Bezos - claiming Bill Gates had a plan to destabilise Africa.\n\nAnger at how African countries are being treated during the pandemic has repeatedly surfaced online. Two French doctors have been accused of racism after suggesting vaccine trials in Africa.\n\nLastly, we've taken a look at a video which contains false information about powers being introduced in the United States to forcibly remove infected individuals from their home and into quarantine.\n\nIn the video, Dr Rashid Buttar, know for holding anti-vaccination views, says a new bill being introduced in the US Congress will give authorities these powers.\n\nHowever, this is false - the bill does no such thing. It is a request for funds to help contain the spread of the virus and boost testing, particularly in areas with poorer health services.\n\nAs part of this process, some of the funds would be used for contact tracing, which means tracking people down who might have come into contact with someone with coronavirus.\n\nDr Buttar suggests that under the bill authorities would be allowed into your house if you show coronavirus symptoms. This clip has had more than three million views on Facebook.\n\nThe bill does mention that where necessary people could be tested in their homes, but makes it clear that existing federal privacy or confidentiality laws would not be superseded.\n\nDespite various claims by Dr Buttar about relatives being taken away, there is nothing in the proposal about people being removed from their homes.",

    "Why hasn't the UK listed smell loss as a Covid-19 symptom?": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "Government advisers have been considering since March whether to include loss of smell among the criteria for deciding whether someone has Covid-19. Evidence that it is one of the symptoms is already strong and some scientists argue this is now an urgent step, as the lockdown is eased.\n\nAt first Dan, 23, dismissed his stuffy nose as hay fever, but when he couldn't taste his beans on toast, he began to worry he had come down with Covid-19.\n\n\"I thought something must be up so just to check I poured myself a strong glass of orange squash,\" says Dan, who works as a respiratory physiotherapist at a West Midlands hospital.\n\n\"I just couldn't taste that at all.\" He tried inhaling a nasal decongestant made with eucalyptus oil and menthol, but couldn't smell that either.\n\nDan worried that if he did have Covid-19, going into work might have serious consequences. But when he called the NHS helpline, 111, he was told there was no problem as he didn't have a cough or a high temperature.\n\n\"They were obviously reading off a script and they said, 'You're good to go back to work,' which I felt a bit funny about,\" Dan says. \"To have suddenly lost my sense of smell and taste when I work with some patients who have coronavirus felt like too much of a coincidence.\"\n\nIgnoring this advice, he began self-isolating, as did the rest of his family, including his mum, a podiatrist whose clients include vulnerable elderly people, and his sister, an intensive care nurse at a children's hospital.\n\nMeanwhile Dan's manager arranged a coronavirus test for him - and a few days later it came back positive.\n\n\"Based on government advice alone, I would have been back at work, going from patient to patient and potentially giving them coronavirus,\" says Dan.\n\nThat was in April, just after the Easter bank holiday, but the advice from 111 and on the NHS website remains the same today. The website mentions only two symptoms, a high temperature and a new continuous cough.\n\nThis is frustrating for Ear Nose and Throat consultant Prof Claire Hopkins, president of the British Rhinological Society, who has been arguing for eight weeks that people suddenly losing their sense of smell should be told to self-isolate.\n\nShe accepts that when she first gave this advice to Public Health England on 19 March - later published as a joint press release with Prof Nirmal Kumar, president of the ENT surgeons' professional body, ENT UK - the evidence for loss of smell being a symptom of Covid-19 was anecdotal, but she now argues that it is \"robust\".\n\nAt first there were signs that Hopkins might be succeeding in getting her point across.\n\nOn 30 March, the government's chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, said at the government's daily briefing that loss of taste and smell \"does seem to be a feature of this, from what people are reporting, and it is obviously something that people should take into account as they think about their symptoms\".\n\nAt the briefing on 3 April, deputy chief medical officer Prof Jonathan Van-Tam said that experts did not at that stage think loss of smell and taste needed to be part of the \"case definition\" - the set of criteria used to determine whether someone has the disease - but that the government's advisory group on new and emerging respiratory virus threats (Nervtag) had been asked to look into the question.\n\nIn the nearly six weeks since then, though, while the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization have both joined France in adding the loss of smell and taste to their official lists of Covid symptoms, the UK has held back.\n\nThroughout this period, Claire Hopkins has been among those updating Nervtag on data that she and medical colleagues from a range of countries have been collecting.\n\nFirst results from the King's College coronavirus tracker app, published on 1 April, found that 59% of users testing positive for Covid-19 reported loss of smell or taste. The latest research from the same team, produced in collaboration with partners in Massachusetts and Nottingham and published in Nature Medicine, found that 65% of the more than 7,000 users of the app who had tested positive for Covid-19 reported loss of smell and taste, compared with just over a fifth of those who tested negative. This, the authors say, suggests that loss of smell - anosmia - is a stronger predictor of Covid-19 than fever.\n\nHopkins herself has been working with teams of doctors in Italy, France, Belgium, and Spain measuring the ability to smell of thousands of patients with known Covid-19 infection, and has concluded that sudden loss of smell, when not accompanied by other symptoms such as a blocked nose or a head injury, is in fact the best predictor of infection.\n\n\"We've been able to show that in groups of patients that have lost their sense of smell without any other symptoms, there's a greater than 95% chance it is due to Covid-19 at the moment,\" she says.\n\nBy contrast, fever is not a good marker, Hopkins argues, because many things can cause a fever, and this symptom is only present in about 40% of patients with Covid-19. By focusing only on fever and a continuous cough, she argues, citing published papers, the NHS will only catch 50% to 60% of cases.\n\nHopkins has also been involved with the Global Consortium for Chemosensory Research, which has published results from a survey of more than 4,000 patients diagnosed with Covid-19, who reported on average an 80% drop in ability to smell and a 69% drop in ability to taste.\n\nAll these results suggest to Hopkins that key workers who have continued working during the lockdown despite losing the sense of smell have probably been contributing to the spread of the virus.\n\n\"There are a significant number of essential workers, who got in contact and told me that, because they don't meet the criteria, their employers have told them that they still have to go to work,\" she says. \"For example somebody who's involved in food delivery, potentially delivering food to vulnerable groups, is still having to go out despite having very recently lost his sense of smell, and almost certainly having Covid-19.\"\n\nAs the lockdown eases, this group of people will grow, Hopkins says, unless the 111 helpline changes its criteria.\n\n\"I can still put in my symptoms into NHS 111 and claim to have muscle ache, fatigue, loss of smell, diarrhoea [all recognised as symptoms of Covid-19 by the WHO] and be told that I don't have coronavirus,\" says Hopkins. \"I think that is now actually, clinically, negligence.\"\n\nProf Peter Horby, director of the epidemic diseases research group at the University of Oxford, who chairs Nervtag, told the BBC it was important to find the cluster of symptoms that most reliably identifies Covid-19 cases at an early stage of the illness, but also distinguishes it from other respiratory infections, so as to avoid large numbers of false-positive cases in the winter.\n\n\"Anosmia is certainly in the mix for a revision of the case definition, and is included in the app being piloted on the Isle of Wight,\" he added.\n\nNervtag member Dr Ben Killingley, a consultant at University College London Hospital, commented that loss of smell was a \"definitely a symptom\" of Covid-19 but the question was \"whether the positive predictive value of the symptom is high enough to warrant its inclusion in a case definition\".\n\nHe added: \"Whether the symptom is included in the symptom/contact tracing app will give you a clue, though this remains in development.\"\n\nAnother member of the advisory group, Prof Andrew Hayward, director of the UCL Institute of Epidemiology and Health Care, commented: \"All I can really say is that Nervtag have recently provided scientific advice on this and it is being considered by the Department of Health and Social Care and other bodies, so I would expect an announcement about case definitions soon.\"\n\nA DHSC press officer told the BBC: \"Symptoms of Covid-19, including loss of smell and taste, have remained under constant review by an expert scientific group. At all times during this global pandemic we have been guided by the evidence, taking the right steps at the right time to deliver a strategy designed to protect the NHS and save lives.\"\n\nAs for Dan, he regularly tested his taste buds by eating salt and vinegar crisps, and noticed a gradual improvement.\n\n\"After five days I could tell they were salt and vinegar but it wasn't normal at all,\" he says.\n\nHis sense of smell is taking longer to return.\n\n\"When I'm cooking and putting garlic in a pan and everyone says, 'Ooh, that garlic smells nice,' it takes me a little bit longer to get that smell,\" he says.\n\nHe's very glad his boss acted decisively to get him tested.\n\n\"It was credit to them, to be fair, because they spotted the signs early,\" he says. \"And I know that other places might not have arranged testing, and I would still have been treating patients.\"\n\nDouble Olympic gold medallist James Cracknell says he is unable to smell or taste very much due to a brain injury. What is life like without these senses?",

    "Why is there so little coronavirus testing in Japan?": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "Why is Japan not in lockdown? It's a question I've been asked numerous times by friends all over the world. That's not surprising given what's going on in Europe and America. But it is perhaps the wrong question. Taiwan, Hong Kong, South Korea and most of mainland China, have also never had full lockdowns.\n\nFor those trying to understand what's going on in Japan, the much more puzzling question is why there is so little testing for Covid-19.\n\nWhen you look at Germany or South Korea, Japan's testing figures look like they're missing a zero.\n\nTake Tokyo, population 9.3 million, and centre of Japan's epidemic. Since February, just 10,981 people have been tested for Covid-19. Of those, just over 4,000 were positive.\n\nThose figures are striking both because the number tested is so small and because the percentage testing positive is so high.\n\nWhat it shows is Japan is only testing people who are already quite sick. In fact, the guidelines for doctors say they should only recommend a test if the patient has pneumonia.\n\nThis is leading to some rather extraordinary stories from those trying to get tested.\n\nJordain Haley is an American working in Japan as a translator. Via Skype she told me what happened when she helped a friend, who doesn't speak fluent Japanese, to get a test.\n\nOn 10 April, her friend had developed a fever and cough, but waited four days, as per the guidelines.\n\n\"By then she was having trouble breathing and was dizzy from lack of oxygen,\" Jordain tells me. \"I called the Covid hotline. They refused to help. They said if she's sick she should call an ambulance.\"\n\nThe following day (Wednesday 15 April) her friend found a clinic where they gave her a chest X-ray. The doctor said she probably had Covid-19, but not bad enough to be hospitalised. He sent her home and told her to isolate.\n\nLate on Thursday night Jordain's friend called. She was in distress.\n\n\"I could hear the EMT (ambulance crew) in the background. She was coughing and wheezing so much I couldn't make out what she was saying. It took them two hours to find a hospital that would accept her. The whole time her breathing was getting worse and worse.\"\n\nThe hospital did another chest X-ray and told her friend to get a PCR test at her local health centre. But the doctor wouldn't write a recommendation. Instead she was sent home in a taxi.\n\n\"They said she should roll down the windows in the cab, and that it would be ok,\" Jordain says, rolling her eyes.\n\nOn Friday 17 April Jordain called the local health centre. For two hours she was passed from one desk to another. She answered scores of questions. Finally, she got her friend an appointment. But it came with a warning.\n\n\"She must use the side entrance.\" Jordain was told. \"She must not tell anyone where this testing is taking place. It could cause a commotion.\"\n\nApart from the distress caused to someone who thinks their life is in danger, why does this matter? After all, Japan has very few deaths from Covid-19, still below 400.\n\nOn social media I am often told: \"Japan is identifying those who really need help and its medical care is excellent, and that's why so few are dying.\"\n\nThis is not untrue according to Professor Kenji Shibuya of Kings College London.\n\n\"From the physician's point of view, it makes sense,\" he says. \"Forget about mild cases, focus on cases with major symptoms and save lives. Focus testing on those who have symptoms.\"\n\nBut, says Professor Shibuya, from a public health point of view, Japan's refusal to test more widely is incredibly risky.\n\nHe points to a study done by Keio University in Tokyo.\n\nLast week, the University hospital published a study of PCR tests done on patients admitted for non-Covid related illnesses and procedures. It found that around 6% of them tested positive for Covid-19.\n\nIt is a small sample and not \"generalisable\". But Professor Shibuya still describes it as \"very shocking\".\n\n\"We are definitely missing a lot of asymptomatic and mildly symptomatic cases,\" he says. \"There is clearly widespread community transmission. I am very worried by this situation.\"\n\nHow many? He is not sure. But based on the Keio results he thinks it could be from 20 to 50 times the official figure. That would mean between 280 and 700 thousand people might be infected in Japan.\n\nWithout more testing it is impossible to know. But anecdotal evidence supports the idea that infections are far wider than reported.\n\nAmong the small number of deaths are famous comedian Ken Shimura and actress Kumiko Okae. High profile infected people include seven sumo wrestlers, a TV presenter, two former professional baseball players, and a famous screen writer.\n\n\"Currently 70%-80% of new infections recorded in Tokyo do not come from any previously known cluster,\" says Dr Yoshitake Yokokura, the head of the Japan Medical Association. \"We need more prompt PCR testing and we need the results more quickly.\"\n\nAccording to official figures, the number of new infections in Tokyo has now been falling for over a week. Good news? Not necessarily.\n\n\"I would like to believe the numbers are really decreasing,\" says Dr Yokokura, \"but the number of tests is insufficient to tell that.\"\n\nThis has direct implications for Japan's ability to lift its state of emergency, which is currently supposed to end on 6 May.\n\n\"It is not possible to lift the state of emergency at this stage,\" says Dr Yokokura. \"We need a sustained decrease in new cases, and we need the reproduction rate to be well below one to do that.\"\n\nThis week Japan begins its 'Golden Week' holiday. According to the governor of Okinawa, 60,000 people have booked flights to the island during the holiday.\n\nGovernor Denny Tamaki is pleading with them to stay away.\n\n\"I am sorry to tell you but Okinawa is under a state of emergency,\" he wrote on social media. \"Please cancel your trip to Okinawa now.\"\n\nThe weather for the next week is looking hot and sunny. People will be tempted to head to the beaches and mountains and, without knowing it, some percentage will inevitably be taking the virus with them.\n\nProfessor Shibuya says it is imperative that Japan now abandon its current strategy and increase testing.\n\n\"Without much wider testing,\" he says, \"it will be very hard to end this pandemic.\"",

    "Why so many people are dying in Belgium": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "Belgium is the world's worst affected country when it comes to the coronavirus mortality rate.\n\nThat rate, unlike the total number of fatalities, is a measure of the number of deaths in relation to the size of population.\n\nPresident Donald Trump pointed to a graph recently, displaying Belgium at the top and the US in seventh place, as a result of the number of deaths relative to population size.\n\nHe was suggesting the US was handling the pandemic more effectively.\n\nBelgium has a population of 11.5 million. That means 66 people in every 100,000 have died from Covid-19. In the US, with a population of around 330 million, it's 19 in every 100,000, according to Johns Hopkins University data.\n\nBut those figures are \"faulty comparisons\" that have been \"abused\", argues Prof Steven Van Gucht, a Belgian virologist and government spokesman.\n\n\"That's the difference between public health science and political motivation,\" he explains. \"That's purely inspired by showing how good you are doing, and it's wrong. We are actually reporting in a more correct way.\"\n\nBelgian officials say they are counting in a way that no other country in the world is currently doing: counting deaths in hospitals and care homes, but including deaths in care homes that are suspected, not confirmed, as Covid-19 cases.\n\nAccording to Belgium's latest official figures, out of 7,703 deaths, 53% have been in care homes.\n\nSome 16% of deaths in care homes were tested positive for coronavirus. The rest are suspected.\n\nThat means more than 3,500 deaths have been counted as caused by Covid-19, but not confirmed.\n\n\"It's based on the assessment of the medical doctor, usually taking into account whether the coronavirus is present in the same care home,\" says Prof Van Gucht.\n\n\"For example: if you have one or two confirmed cases, then the week after you have 10 deaths in the same home based on similar symptoms.\"\n\nPrime Minister Sophie Wilm\u00e8s recently suggested Belgium may be over-reporting the actual number of cases.\n\nHowever, Prof Van Gucht says the real number of deaths may still be higher than they are reporting, as he believes they may still be missing a few cases.\n\nAnother factor is that many more people here put loved ones in care homes than elsewhere in Europe.\n\nOnly the Netherlands and Luxembourg have a higher rate of care home occupancy, relative to their populations.\n\nOfficials also acknowledge mistakes were made at the beginning: poor preparation left care home staff lacking personal protective equipment (PPE). That allowed the virus to spread quickly, with devastating effect.\n\nNow all nursing home staff are issued with masks and protective clothing, and nurses from hospitals and the military have been brought in to help.\n\nEpidemiologists say they've found a \"remarkable\" observation in care homes, that around 10% of residents have been asymptomatic carriers of the virus and have built up an immunity. A small comfort, but of important scientific value.\n\nSince 18 March all non-essential business has been closed and, apart from emergency workers, people have been asked to stay at home.\n\nShopping is limited to one person per family. You can leave the house for medical reasons, to walk the dog, or for an hour's exercise with immediate family, or one other person, while maintaining social distancing of at least 1.5m (5ft).\n\nBelgian police have been enforcing the lockdown, using drones in parks and fines for anyone breaking social distancing rules.\n\nCheckpoints have been set up at the borders with Luxembourg, France and the Netherlands, allowing through only cross-border workers, or those with an urgent reason to enter Belgium.\n\nSome cyclists have been fined after taking a ride into the Netherlands, then being stopped by Belgian police on the way back.\n\nAll non-food shops have been closed too, which led to a bizarre incident in the neighbouring towns of Baarle Hertog and Baarle Nassau, where the border line runs through a bargain store called Zeemans.\n\nThe Dutch half of the shop is open, but the Belgian half has been taped off, with customers unable to get to the men's clothing section.\n\nUnlike Belgium's policy, the Netherlands has what Prime Minister Mark Rutte described as an \"intelligent lockdown\", with florists, ironmongers, bakeries, clothes and toy stores remaining open.\n\nThere have been fewer deaths in the Netherlands, despite having a larger population. But unlike Belgium, the Netherlands does not count suspected Covid-19 deaths in care homes.\n\nI asked the head of Belgium's Covid-19 taskforce, Minister Philippe De Backer, if he thought the Belgian confinement method was more effective than the more relaxed Dutch and Swedish approaches.\n\nHe told me Swedes were renowned for following government advice, while it was \"a bit more difficult in a country like Belgium\". However, he was generally \"impressed by how Belgians has dealt with the crisis\".\n\nBelgium will lift its lockdown gradually, in four phases. From Monday, fabric stores are being opened so people can buy material to make their own face masks. Masks will be mandatory on public transport.\n\nSport will be allowed, too, though no more than two people can play together.\n\nAll other shops will open from Monday 11 May. Schools will restart on 18 May, with a maximum of 10 students per class.\n\nCafes, restaurants and some tourist attractions will open after 8 June, if there has been no second spike in cases. Trips abroad may also be allowed in early June.\n\nTesting for Covid-19 is being done on 10-20,000 people a day, with priority for emergency workers.\n\nThe taskforce has also finished screening all 210,000 residents and staff in care homes, discovering that 10% of people are infected. There are more than 500 care homes, and roughly half have had an outbreak.\n\nAntibody tests to detect if people have had the virus will start in mid-May.\n\nNot in the short term. Taskforce head Philippe De Backer tells me it's not \"feasible\" at the moment, so they will concentrate on the laborious system of tracing manually.\n\n\"When people test positive, it activates a call centre, and our staff ask who they've been in contact with, and they will be contacted and may have to self-isolate.\"\n\nMr De Backer says use of an app requires at least 60% of the nation to take part voluntarily and he believes that is not realistic at the moment.\n\n\"I've seen reports in Austria where it's around 9-10%. So that means you need to do 90% of the tracking in another way,\" he says.\n\nAs Belgium gradually lifts its restrictions, 2,000 so-called \"corona detectives\" are being hired, to trace people who have been in contact with confirmed or suspected Covid-19 patients.\n\nBelgian scientists have started to look at lessons that can be learned, including an analysis of why three cities have had the biggest concentration of cases: Charleroi in the south, and Hasselt and Sint-Truiden in the east.\n\nEarly indications suggest that local carnivals with big gatherings of people in March may have contributed, along with areas where second-generation Italian populations are high. In the case of Charleroi, experts are studying whether the spread was linked to issues of poverty and deprivation.\n\nBelgian hospitals have been largely able to cope with the epidemic so far, with a 42% occupancy rate now, but some hospitals in Brussels have been overwhelmed, and have had to move patients elsewhere.\n\nAs the confinement here slowly ends, September is a worry for officials, as Prof Van Gucht makes clear.\n\n\"When all the schools are open again after the summer, that's when the virus risks spreading quickly again. That's when I'm more afraid, with winter coming too.\"",

    "Will Scotland have its own coronavirus app?": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "The UK government is trialling an app to help warn people if they come into contact with someone with coronavirus. The Scottish government is also developing digital tools to run a \"test, trace, isolate\" system - what are these, and how will they work together?\n\nLet's be clear that, to start with, the bulk of the \"test, trace, isolate\" (TTI) system being developed in Scotland is going to rely on \"old-fashioned\" contact tracing.\n\nWhen someone flags up that they are feeling the symptoms of coronavirus, they should go into isolation and a test will be arranged for them.\n\nWhile the patient is waiting for the results to come back, a specialist contact tracer will be in touch with them, generally over the phone. The contact tracer will try to pin down where the patient has been over the past 48 hours, and who they've been in close proximity to - so within two metres for more than 15 minutes.\n\nIf the test comes back negative, as the government's clinical director Prof Jason Leitch puts it, \"all bets are off\".\n\nBut if a positive result does come back, the contact tracer will ring around the people the patient had been in close contact with and ask them to go into self-isolation for 14 days.\n\nContact tracing is not a new thing - NHS boards and Public Health Scotland have plenty of experience in doing this with infections in the past.\n\nBut the current plan is to do it on an utterly unprecedented scale, right across the country.\n\nTo make this sustainable, the Scottish government wants to automate the process as much as possible, to take some pressure off the specialist contact tracing staff - an extra 2,000 of whom are being taken on.\n\nThe most basic approach to this is a \"secure web-based tool for the NHS in Scotland\" - basically an online form which people can access via a computer or smartphone.\n\nThis could take the place of some of the phone calls. People can fill in where they've been and who they've spoken to - names and phone numbers - and the information is sent to the contact tracers digitally, cutting out one step of the process for them.\n\nThe app the UK government is developing - and trialling on the Isle of Wight - takes a slightly different approach.\n\nThe app can provide information to users, and help them diagnose themselves if they are feeling symptoms.\n\nHowever the core purpose is to use Bluetooth technology, which keeps an eye out for other users of the app near to the user. If one of those people then comes down with the virus, the app can notify anyone who came into close contact with them.\n\nThis is particularly useful for tracing strangers who you may have come into contact with - for example on public transport - which traditional contact tracing cannot cover.\n\nThe downside of this approach is that it needs huge buy-in from the public to be effective. Nicola Sturgeon has suggested that up to 60% of people might need to download it - a huge number, particularly given not everyone has a smartphone.\n\nAnd the group which is least likely to have a smartphone is also the group most at risk from the virus - the elderly.\n\nThe answer to that isn't entirely clear yet. Hopefully they will, but there is a lot of work to be done first.\n\nProf Leitch says the Scottish government is looking at the UK app as potentially an extra \"layer\" on top of its own systems - the old-fashioned ring-round approach, and the digital form-filling.\n\nScottish officials want to be more involved in the development of the UK app, to make sure the data gathered will slot smoothly into the system north of the border.\n\nThey also want assurances about how it will be ensured the public have confidence in the technology and the use of their data - something that will be critical if enough people are going to buy in.\n\nThe plan for the UK app is that it will not require users to enter too many personal details - but people will need to be convinced it is secure and that they cannot be easily identified either by the government or by hackers.",

    "World split between two types of virus-tracing app": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "Countries around the world are developing Covid-19 smartphone apps to limit the spread of coronavirus and relax lockdown restrictions.\n\nIt's hoped the information they gather can be used to alert people whether they pose a risk of spreading the contagion, and need to isolate. But, over recent weeks, a split has emerged between two different types of app - the so-called centralised and decentralised versions.\n\nBoth types use Bluetooth signals to log when smartphone owners are close to each other - so if someone develops Covid-19 symptoms, an alert can be sent to other users they may have infected.\n\nUnder the centralised model, the anonymised data gathered is uploaded to a remote server where matches are made with other contacts, should a person start to develop Covid-19 symptoms .\n\nThis is the method the UK is pursuing.\n\nBy contrast, the decentralised model gives users more control over their information by keeping it on the phone. It is there that matches are made with people who may have contracted the virus. This is the model promoted by Google, Apple and an international consortium.\n\nBoth sides have their fans.\n\nBackers of the centralised model say it can give the authorities more insight into the spread of the virus and how well the app is performing. Supporters of the decentralised approach say it offers users a higher degree of privacy, protecting them from hackers or the state itself revealing their social contacts.\n\nIn truth, both are unproven at this stage. South Korea, seen as one of the most successful countries at tackling Covid-19, has done it without a contact-tracing app. It has however used other surveillance methods which would be seen as invasive by many.\n\nAt the start, the centralised approach was seen pioneering. Singapore's TraceTogether was widely viewed as the one to emulate. But that changed after it emerged the app was only being used by about 20% of the local population, and there had been a resurgence of Covid-19 cases.\n\nPart of the problem is that TraceTogether does not work properly when in the background on iPhones because of the way Apple restricts use of Bluetooth. The firm has promised to waive these curbs, but only if apps fall into line with its decentralised system. Singapore has since signalled it will do so as a result.\n\n\"We are working with Apple and Google to make the app more effective, especially for iOS users,\" a spokesman told the BBC.\n\nAustralia, another early adopter of the centralised approach, launched its CovidSafe app based on TraceTogether, and faced similar issues as a consequence. It too has said it plans to adopt the Apple-Google framework, citing a \"big shift in performance of Bluetooth connectivity\". And on Wednesday, Colombia confirmed it too was considering a switch after having to turn off the contact-tracing feature in its CoronApp.\n\n\"[We need to] minimise the risk of generating unnecessary alerts,\" said presidential advisor Victor Munoz.\n\nOthers, though, are still forging ahead with the centralised approach. France's digital minister has said it intends to launch its StopCovid app by 2 June, and is attempting to press Apple into a U-turn of its own.\n\n\"Apple could have helped us make the application work even better on the iPhone,\" said digital minister C\u00e9dric O on Tuesday. \"They have wished not to do so. I regret this.\"\n\nBut he faces internal resistance from one of the government's own human rights bodies, which has described the design as being \"dangerous\" and warned it may try to block its adoption.\n\nNorway has already adopted a centralised design for its Smittestopp app, which went live last month in three municipalities. In addition to Bluetooth readings, it also collects GPS location data.\n\nThe developer claims that the combination of the two leads to \"very accurate contact tracing results without the need for [the Google-Apple interface\".\n\nBut this has raised privacy concerns, which may have contributed to a fairly high drop-out rate. The Norwegian Institute of Public Health said that as of 28 April, 1.5 million people had downloaded the app, but only 899,142 were actively using it - representing just 20.5% of over-16s in the test zones.\n\nIndia's contact-tracing app, Aaroya Setu, takes a similar approach to Norway's. To tackle adoption, the government has ruled all government and private sector workers must use it.\n\nUntil Apple and Google release their interface, known as an API, it's impossible to be sure their system will be any more successful. But the list of nations flocking to it keeps growing. Germany surprised many when it confirmed it had been convinced decentralisation was the way to go - it had previously seemed set to go hand-in-hand with France.\n\nPoland's forthcoming app may also be about to abandon its centralised plan before launch.\n\n\"We assume that adapting ProteGo Safe to Google and Apple APIs will be necessary,\" developers' notes read. \"We assume that adapting... to Google and Apple APIs will be necessary.\"\n\nItaly's Immuni announced it too was backing the US tech giants' initiative on 29 April, praising its stronger guarantee of anonymity. Other countries set to do likewise include:\n\nLuxembourg's MPs are about to vote on a decentralised approach. And the BBC has also been told Greece is about to adopt a similar position.\n\nWhy does all this matter? There may be problems trying to make the two different types of system talk to each other.\n\n\"The core reason is that centralised systems ask you to upload the people you have seen, and decentralised systems don't need that data, so they don't play well together,\" explained Prof Michael Veale of the joint Apple-Google DPT3 group\n\n\"So if you see an app as an important part of reducing lockdown, then you remove the ability to trace the virus as it crosses borders, and viruses don't respect borders.\"",

    "Wristbands, colour-coding - inventive ways out of lockdown": {
        "authors": [],
        "body": "Across the world, countries are embarking on enormous experiments in ending coronavirus lockdown measures - and others are looking on nervously, asking themselves what's the best way back to normality.\n\nThere's no international consensus over how best to do it - but we've looked at the key trends that are emerging, and some of the innovative thinking leading the way.\n\nThe big trend around the world is to ease lockdown gradually. Many will be closely watching what happens in hard-hit Italy. Rome has set out a phased approach about how everything from shops to museums may be able to open with the most significant opening up yet due on 4 May.\n\nAll Italians - particularly those in the areas with highest infection rates - know they won't see anything approaching normal life before September.\n\nDr Michael Tildesley, an expert in infectious diseases at Warwick University, says the world just doesn't know what will happen to the rate of coronavirus transmission as lockdowns ease.\n\n\"It's really difficult to untangle the relative effectiveness of all the lockdown measures to work out what effect each of them has,\" he told BBC Radio 4's The Briefing Room. \"It may be that the only way we can do that - and get a real understanding - is when we start to relax them. We may have to lift a certain measure and monitor what that does to the epidemic.\"\n\nThe second more important step appears to be the roll-out of smartphone apps to track infections. More and more nations - or at least those that can afford it - are designing apps for their population.\n\nSome - such as Australia's operational app, and proposed solutions in Italy, France and the UK - will see phones gather anonymised records of other phones the user has been close to. If someone develops symptoms, each phone in that log of potential contacts will receive an alert. In Israel, the government went straight to one of its secret services and asked it to track phones to, in turn, track likely transmissions.\n\nSouth Korea used phones from the outset, to contact anyone who was near to someone who tested positive. The government there relied on this aggressive strategy of testing and alerting to avoid a complete lockdown.\n\nThermal cameras could soon have a crucial role, particularly in transport hubs. During the 2003 Sars outbreak, anyone who travelled through Hong Kong airport had to stand in a queue while an official pointed a heat gun at their head to discover if they had the tell-tale temperature of a fever.\n\nA smarter thermal camera is now being tested at Bournemouth Airport in the UK to see how quickly it could spot potential coronavirus carriers.\n\nListen to The Briefing Room - available now on BBC Sounds.\n\nExperts explain how lockdowns could be lifted around the world - and why we don't know what will happen next.\n\nSome nations looked at wristbands to enforce lockdown - but the Belgian port of Antwerp is testing whether this technology can help let people go about their business.\n\nWorkers there wear wristbands that aim to reduce accidents. They vibrate as a vehicle approaches and raise the alarm if someone falls into water. Romware, the company behind this safety system, has modified the sportswatch-like wristband so that it buzzes if workers who may be too busy to notice each other inadvertently become too close.\n\nNew Zealand is emerging from one of the toughest and most successful lockdowns in the world with a national \"social bubble\" plan.\n\nEach household is a bubble. Citizens can now expand their bubble by inviting up to two specific additional people into it who, ideally, live close by. In other words, two bubbles bump together and become one. Social contact increases in a controlled way: grandparents see family, singletons can meet up instead of being home alone.\n\nIf any of them want a coffee, Kiwis have come up with innovative non-contact ways of buying their flat whites:\n\nAs lockdown eases, one of the worst possible outcomes could be long queues in pharmacies for face masks - increasingly the likelihood of accidental spreading while people wait to buy them. Germany, Taiwan and Poland are among countries that have seen face mask vending machines pop up in cities to help ease the pressure.\n\nIn Lithuania, cafes and bars have reopened - but only if they can serve customers sitting outside and ensure social distancing. That's a huge problem in the capital, Vilnius, where narrow historic streets make distancing impossible.\n\nSo the mayor is handing 18 of the city's historic public spaces to those hardest-hit businesses. Large parts of the city are going al fresco. There's a public appeal to customers to help venues find furniture to make the sociable-but-social-distancing plan work.\n\n\"Buy, borrow, invite your loyal customers to help,\" says the mayor's office. \"The municipality asks only one thing - maintain a high-quality visual appearance, don't build cheap with poor-looking plastic furniture.\"\n\nLots of teachers say social distancing can't be done in schools. But Norway is giving it a try. Children are now arriving for school at staggered times to prevent overcrowding at the gates. Parents can't come inside and mill around for a chat with friends.\n\nTeachers then take the students and place them in small groups which, crucially, they must remain in - both for lessons and playtime - without variation.\n\nIran is experimenting with a flexible approach that allows more freedom in areas that are the least affected. Towns and cities across the country are being graded white, yellow or red - and each of those designations indicates the level of infections and deaths - and what level of easing each community should expect.\n\nThe more places that are coded white based on the local health data, the more freedom there will be.\n\nWhile Italy isn't using a colour-code system, residents in the most severely affected communities in northern Italy are expecting their lockdown to continue longer than others in the nation.\n\nThese techniques link to the all-important \"R\" number - the mathematical model of how fast of slow the virus is spreading.\n\nChina, on the other hand, has decided to colour-code people rather than places - the first nation effectively to license people to go about freely.\n\nA month ago it rolled out a health status smartphone app. In the coronavirus epicentre of Wuhan, residents must show their status to use public transport. If they're green, they're healthy and good to go. If they're red, they should be in isolation as a known sufferer of Covid-19.\n\nAside from privacy issues that would be a major factor in Europe, critics say there is no guarantee the health status will be accurate when it's checked by an official. Those kinds of concerns have played into a World Health Organisation recommendation to all governments not to issue \"immunity passports\".\n\nChile has nevertheless said it will introduce a \"certificate\" system. Ministers said the document would confirm whether or not someone had been infected and recovered after a period of isolation.\n\nAll these novel schemes, and many more, may help a return to some form of normality. But Ngaire Woods, professor of global economic governance at Oxford University, says easing lockdown requires us all to rethink our lives.\n\n\"We have got to get testing tracing and isolating up and running fantastically well,\" she told Radio 4's Briefing Room. \"We have to start thinking about preventative measures in public spaces and schools. We have got to manage the import of cases - so think about travel restrictions. That's a clear checklist in order to safely start lifting the lockdown.\"\n\nProf Woods says thinking will have to go far beyond just re-opening closed-down businesses. We may need to split workforces by age group - an example could be that older teachers must take their classes by video link.\n\n\"Those are the questions we have to ask - they are not insurmountable problems. The alternative is to stay in a total lockdown.\"",

People are dying because they can't get treatment that would normally save their lives,\" he said.\n\n\"There are patients who go from hospital to hospital and yet cannot get admitted.\"\n\nThe rise in people dying after showing symptoms such as respiratory issues, fever and weakness raises concerns that Covid-19 infections might be considerably higher than reported in Aden, the group said.\n\nThere are fears that a coronavirus outbreak could be disastrous in Yemen, a country already suffering from years of war.\n\nThere are only 500 ventilators in the country, and just four labs that can test for the virus, says Save the Children.\n\nSo far, the World Health Organization puts the number of confirmed infections at just 72, with 13 deaths, but the latest reports suggest the actual number could be far higher.",
